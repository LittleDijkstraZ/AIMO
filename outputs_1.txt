Question (hint: positive numerical answer):
"What is the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ when $x$ and $y$ range over all real numbers such that $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$?"
Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:


<<<<<<< HEAD
First, we notice that the expression $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ can be rewritten as $\frac{1}{2}((5x-4y)^2+(4y-5x)^2)$.

Next, we observe the condition $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$.

This can be rewritten as $|(x-2y)| + |(2x-y)| = 40$.

We can rewrite this as $|(5x-4y)| + |(4y-5x)| = 40$.

Now we notice that both terms inside the absolute value signs are the same but with opposite signs. So, we can rewrite this as $|(5x-4y) - (4y-5x)| = 40$, which simplifies to $|10x - 8y| = 40$.

We can rewrite this as $10|x - \frac{4}{5}y| = 40$, which simplifies to $|x - \frac{4}{5}y| = 4$.

This means that the distance between the points $(x, y)$ and $(\frac{4}{5}y, y)$ is always 4.

Now, we know that the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ occurs when $x = \frac{4}{5}y$, because the expression is minimized when the points $(x, y)$ and $(\frac{4}{5}y, y)$ coincide.

Substituting $x = \frac{4}{5}y$ into the expression $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$, we get $5(\frac{4}{5}y)^2+5y^2-8(\frac{4}{5}y)(y) = \frac{32}{5}y^2 + 5y^2 - \frac{32}{5}y^2 = 5y^2$.

So, the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ is achieved when $y = \pm \frac{5}{4}$, and the minimum value is $5(\pm \frac{5}{4})^2 = \frac{125}{16}$.

Therefore, the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ is $\frac{125}{16}$.
The answer is: $\boxed{\frac{125}{16}}$
=======
First, we rewrite the given equation $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$ as $|2x-y| + |2y-x| = 40$.
By the triangle inequality, $|a| + |b| \ge |a+b|$, so $|2x-y| + |2y-x| \ge |(2x-y) + (2y-x)| = |x+y|$.
Therefore, we have $|x+y| = 40$.
Now let $A = x+y$ and $B = x-2y$. Then we can rewrite the expression $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ as $5(x^2+y^2) - 8xy = 5[(x+y)^2 - 2xy] - 8xy = 5[A^2 - 2xy] - 8xy = 5A^2 - 18xy$.
We also have $B = x-2y \implies x = B+2y \implies y = \frac{x-B}{2} \implies xy = x\left(\frac{x-B}{2}\right) = \frac{x^2 - Bx}{2}$.
Substituting this into the expression $5A^2 - 18xy$, we get $5A^2 - 18\left(\frac{x^2 - Bx}{2}\right) = 5A^2 - 9(x^2 - Bx) = 5A^2 - 9x^2 + 9Bx$.
Now, from the equation $|x+y| = 40$, we know that $A = 40$, so the expression becomes $5(40)^2 - 9x^2 + 9Bx = 8000 - 9x^2 + 9Bx$.
To minimize this expression, we need to minimize $9Bx - 9x^2$.
By completing the square, we get $9Bx - 9x^2 = -9(x^2 - Bx) = -9\left(x^2 - Bx + \frac{B^2}{4} - \frac{B^2}{4}\right) = -9\left(\left(x - \frac{B}{2}\right)^2 - \frac{B^2}{4}\right) = -9\left(x - \frac{B}{2}\right)^2 + \frac{9B^2}{4}$.
The expression $-9\left(x - \frac{B}{2}\right)^2 + \frac{9B^2}{4}$ is minimized when $x = \frac{B}{2}$, at which point it equals $\frac{9B^2}{4}$.
Substituting $B = x-2y$ into $x = \frac{B}{2}$, we get $x = \frac{x-2y}{2} \implies 2x = x-2y \implies x = -2y$.
Substituting this into $x+y = 40$, we get $-y+y = 40$, which is a contradiction.
However, we made a mistake in our calculations. We assumed that $x = \frac{B}{2}$ would minimize the expression, but it turns out that the minimum is actually achieved when $x = \frac{B}{3}$.
So we have $9Bx - 9x^2 = -9\left(x^2 - Bx + \frac{B^2}{9} - \frac{B^2}{9}\right) = -9\left(\left(x - \frac{B}{3}\right)^2 - \frac{B^2}{9}\right) = -9\left(x - \frac{B}{3}\right)^2 + \frac{B^2}{3}$.
This expression is minimized when $x = \frac{B}{3}$, at which point it equals $\frac{B^2}{3}$.
Therefore, the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ is achieved when $x = \frac{B}{3}$, and substituting this into the equation $x+y = 40$, we get $y = 40 - x = 40 - \frac{B}{3}$.
Substituting these values into $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$, we get $5\left(\frac{B}{3}\right)^2 + 5\left(40 - \frac{B}{3}\right)^2 - 8\left(\frac{B}{3}\right)\left(40 - \frac{B}{3}\right)$.
Evaluating this expression, we find that it equals $\frac{2B^2}{3} + 5\left(1600 - \frac{80B}{3} + \frac{B^2}{9}\right) - \frac{320B}{3} + \frac{8B^2}{9}$.
Simplifying this, we get $\frac{2B^2}{3} + 8000 - \frac{400B}{3} + \frac{5B^2}{9} - \frac{320B}{3} + \frac{8B^2}{9}$.
Combining like terms, we get $\frac{13B^2}{9} - \frac{800B}{3} + 8000$.
Now, since $B = x-2y$, we can substitute this back into the expression. We have $B = x-2y \implies x = B+2y \implies y = \frac{x-B}{2}$.
Substituting $y = \frac{x-B}{2}$ into $x+y = 40$, we get $x + \frac{x-B}{2} = 40 \implies 2x + x - B = 80 \implies 3x - B = 80$.
Therefore, $B = 3x - 80$.
Substituting this into the expression $\frac{13B^2}{9} - \frac{800B}{3} + 8000$, we get $\frac{13(3x-80)^2}{9} - \frac{800(3x-80)}{3} + 8000$.
Expanding and simplifying, we find that this expression equals $-\frac{39x^2}{3} + 10400x - 104000$.
This is a quadratic function in $x$, and its minimum value is achieved at $x = \frac{-b}{2a} = \frac{-10400}{-78} = \frac{5200}{39}$.
Substituting this value of $x$ back into the equation $x+y = 40$, we get $y = 40 - x = 40 - \frac{5200}{39\cdot 3} = \frac{240}{39}$.

Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.
<<<<<<< HEAD

Step-by-step Solution:



First, let's simplify the equation $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$.
Using the property $|a| = |-a|$, we can rewrite the equation as $|x-2y| + |2x-y| = 40$.
Then, by the property of absolute value, we have two cases:

Case 1: If $x - 2y \geq 0$ and $2x - y \geq 0$, then $x - 2y + 2x - y = 40$, which simplifies to $3x - 3y = 40$, or $x - y = \frac{40}{3}$.

Case 2: If $x - 2y < 0$ and $2x - y < 0$, then $-(x - 2y) - (2x - y) = 40$, which simplifies to $-3x + 3y = 40$, or $x - y = -\frac{40}{3}$.

However, these two cases cannot hold simultaneously, because if $x - y = \frac{40}{3}$, then $2x - 2y = 2(x - y) = 2(\frac{40}{3}) = \frac{80}{3}$, which would make $2x - y \geq 0$ in Case 1, contradicting our assumption in Case 1. The same argument applies to Case 2.

Therefore, we conclude that the only possibility is that $x - y = -\frac{40}{3}$.
Substituting $y = x + \frac{40}{3}$ into the expression $5x^2 + 5y^2 - 8xy$, we have
\begin{align*}
5x^2 + 5(x + \frac{40}{3})^2 - 8x(x + \frac{40}{3}) &= 5x^2 + 5(x^2 + 2 \cdot x \cdot \frac{40}{3} + (\frac{40}{3})^2) - 8x^2 - 32x\frac{40}{3} \\
&= 5x^2 + 5x^2 + \frac{400}{3}x + \frac{800}{9} - 8x^2 - \frac{1280}{3}x \\
&= -3x^2 - \frac{880}{3}x + \frac{800}{9}.
\end{align*}
Now, we complete the square for $-3x^2 - \frac{880}{3}x$ as follows:
\begin{align*}
-3x^2 - \frac{880}{3}x &= -3(x^2 + \frac{880}{9}x) \\
&= -3\left(x^2 + \frac{880}{9}x + \left(\frac{440}{9}\right)^2 - \left(\frac{440}{9}\right)^2\right) \\
&= -3\left(\left(x + \frac{440}{9}\right)^2 - \left(\frac{440}{9}\right)^2\right) \\
&= -3\left(x + \frac{440}{9}\right)^2 + 3\left(\frac{440}{9}\right)^2.
\end{align*}
Thus, the expression $5x^2 + 5y^2 - 8xy$ simplifies to $-3\left(x + \frac{440}{9}\right)^2 + 3\left(\frac{440}{9}\right)^2 + \frac{800}{9}$.

The minimum value of $-3\left(x + \frac{440}{9}\right)^2$ is $0$, attained when $x = -\frac{440}{9}$. Therefore, the minimum value of $5x^2 + 5y^2 - 8xy$ is $3\left(\frac{440}{9}\right)^2 + \frac{800}{9} = \frac{58400}{9} + \frac{800}{9} = \frac{59200}{9}$.
The answer is: $\boxed{\frac{59200}{9}}$

Step-by-step Solution:



First, let's denote $A = x - 2y$ and $B = y - 2x$. Then, we have $|A| + |B| = 40$.

Now, let's consider the expression $5x^2 + 5y^2 - 8xy$. We can rewrite this as $\frac{1}{2}(5(x^2 + y^2) - 8xy) = \frac{1}{2}((x - 2y)^2 + (y - 2x)^2)$. 

So, $5x^2 + 5y^2 - 8xy = \frac{1}{2}(A^2 + B^2)$.

Question (hint: positive numerical answer):
"What is the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ when $x$ and $y$ range over all real numbers such that $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$?"
Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:



First, let's analyze the given equation $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$.
This equation splits into two cases:

Case 1: $x-2y \geq 0$ and $y-2x \geq 0$.
Then the equation becomes $x-2y + y-2x = 40$, which simplifies to $-x-y = 40$.
This contradicts the initial conditions ($x-2y \geq 0$ and $y-2x \geq 0$).

Case 2: $x-2y < 0$ and $y-2x < 0$.
Then the equation becomes $-(x-2y) - (y-2x) = 40$, which simplifies to $3x - 3y = 40$.
Dividing both sides by 3 gives $x - y = \frac{40}{3}$.

Now, let's substitute $x = y + \frac{40}{3}$ into the expression $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$.
Substituting $x = y + \frac{40}{3}$ gives $5(y + \frac{40}{3})^2 + 5y^2 - 8y(y + \frac{40}{3})$.
Expanding this gives $5\left(y^2 + \frac{80y}{3} + \frac{1600}{9}\right) + 5y^2 - 8y^2 - \frac{320y}{3}$.
Combining like terms gives $5y^2 + \frac{400y}{3} + \frac{8000}{9} + 5y^2 - 8y^2 - \frac{320y}{3}$.
Simplifying gives $-3y^2 + \frac{80y}{3} + \frac{8000}{9}$.

Now we need to find the minimum value of this expression.
To do this, we can complete the square:
$-3(y^2 - \frac{80y}{9}) + \frac{8000}{9}$.
Completing the square in $y^2 - \frac{80y}{9}$ gives $-3\left(y - \frac{40}{9}\right)^2 + \frac{1600}{9}$.
So our expression is now $-3\left(y - \frac{40}{9}\right)^2 + \frac{8000}{9}$.

The expression $-3\left(y - \frac{40}{9}\right)^2 + \frac{8000}{9}$ is minimized when $\left(y - \frac{40}{9}\right)^2$ is maximized, which happens when $y = \frac{40}{9}$.

Substituting $y = \frac{40}{9}$ into the equation $x - y = \frac{40}{3}$ gives $x = y + \frac{40}{3} = \frac{40}{9} + \frac{40}{3} = \frac{80}{9}$.

So the minimum value of the expression $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ occurs at $x = \frac{80}{9}$ and $y = \frac{40}{9}$.

Substituting these values into the expression gives $5\left(\frac{80}{9}\right)^2 + 5\left(\frac{40}{9}\right)^2 - 8\left(\frac{80}{9}\right)\left(\frac{40}{9}\right) = \frac{3200}{9}$.

Therefore, the minimum value of the expression $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ when $x$ and $y$ satisfy the given conditions is $\frac{3200}{9}$.
The answer is: $3200/9$

Now, using the triangle inequality, we know that $|A| + |B| \geq |A + B|$. Substituting the given $|A| + |B| = 40$, we get $40 \geq |A + B|$. 

Since $A + B = (x - 2y) + (y - 2x) = -x - y$, we have $|A + B| = |-x - y| = |-(x + y)| = |x + y|$. 

So, $40 \geq |x + y|$. 

Now, let's consider the expression $\frac{1}{2}(A^2 + B^2) = \frac{1}{2}((x - 2y)^2 + (y - 2x)^2)$. 

Expanding this out, we get $\frac{1}{2}(x^2 - 4xy + 4y^2 + y^2 - 4yx + 4x^2) = \frac{1}{2}(5x^2 + 5y^2 - 8xy) = \frac{1}{2} \cdot 2(x^2 + y^2 - 2xy) = x^2 + y^2 - 2xy$. 

Now, using the inequality $|x + y| \leq |x| + |y|$, we have $|x + y|^2 \leq (|x| + |y|)^2$, or $(x + y)^2 \leq (|x| + |y|)^2 = x^2 + 2|x||y| + y^2$. 

So, we have $1600 \geq (x + y)^2 \geq x^2 + 2|x||y| + y^2$. 

Rearranging this inequality, we get $x^2 + y^2 - 2|x||y| \leq 1600$. 

Since $-2|x||y| \leq -2xy$, we have $x^2 + y^2 - 2xy \leq 1600$, or $x^2 + y^2 - 2xy \leq 1600$.

Therefore, the minimum value of $5x^2 + 5y^2 - 8xy$ is $0$, when $x = 2y$ and $y = 2x$. 

However, when we substitute these conditions into the equation $|x - 2y| + |y - 2x| = 40$, we get $0 + 0 = 40$, which is not possible.

And substituting $y = -2x$ into $5x^2 + 5y^2 - 8xy$, we also get $5x^2 + 5(-2x)^2 - 8x(-2x) = 5x^2 + 20x^2 + 16x^2 = 41x^2$.

Since $41y^2 = 41x^2$, we have $y^2 = x^2$. Since $y = -2x$, we have $y^2 = 4x^2$. So, $x^2 = y^2$. 

And since $x = -2y$, we have $x^2 = 4y^2$. So, $y^2 = 4y^2$. This implies that $y^2 = 0$, or $y = 0$.

Since $y = -2x$, we have $0 = -2x$, or $x = 0$.

Firstly, we recognize that $5x^2+5y^2-8xy = (x-2y)^2 + (y-2x)^2$. We are given the condition $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$.

Now, let's try to express the expression $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ in a way that involves $|x-2y| + |y-2x|$. By the triangle inequality, we know that $|a| + |b| \geq |a+b|$ for all real numbers $a$ and $b$. Therefore, we can write $|x-2y| + |y-2x| \geq |(x-2y) + (y-2x)| = |-x + y| = |y-x|$. Since $|y-x| = |x-y|$, we have $|x-2y| + |y-2x| \geq |y-x|$. Given the condition $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$, we can equate $|y-x|$ to 40.

Now, we need to find the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ under the condition $|y-x| = 40$. Since $|y-x| = 40$, we know that $y-x = \pm 40$. Without loss of generality, let's assume $y-x = 40$. Then, we can solve for $x$ in terms of $y$: $x = y - 40$. Substituting this into the expression $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$, we get
$$5(y - 40)^2 + 5y^2 - 8(y - 40)y = 5(y^2 - 80y + 1600) + 5y^2 - 8y^2 + 320y = 10y^2 - 400y + 8000.$$
To find the minimum value of this expression, we can take the derivative and set it equal to zero: $20y - 400 = 0$, which gives $y = 20$. Substituting this back into the expression for $x$, we get $x = 20 - 40 = -20$.

Now, we substitute these values of $x$ and $y$ back into the expression $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ to find the minimum value:
$$5(-20)^2 + 5(20)^2 - 8(-20)(20) = 2000 + 2000 + 3200 = 7200.$$

Therefore, the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ when $x$ and $y$ range over all real numbers such that $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$ is 7200. The answer is: $7200$

However, this contradicts the condition $|x - 2y| + |y - 2x| = 40$. So, there must be another way to achieve the minimum value.

Let's consider the case when $x = 2y$ and $y = 2x$. Substituting these conditions into the equation $|x - 2y| + |y - 2x| = 40$, we get $|x - 4x| + |2y - 4y| = 40$, or $|-3x| + |-2y| = 40$, or $3|x| + 2|y| = 40$. 

Now, since $|x| = \frac{40}{3}$ and $|y| = \frac{20}{3}$, we can substitute these values into $5x^2 + 5y^2 - 8xy$ to get $5(\frac{40}{3})^2 + 5(\frac{20}{3})^2 - 8(\frac{40}{3})(\frac{20}{3}) = \frac{8000}{9}$.

So, the minimum value of $5x^2 + 5y^2 - 8xy$ is $\frac{8000}{9}$, when $x = 2y$ and $y = 2x$. 

However, this also contradicts the condition $|x - 2y| + |y - 2x| = 40$. So, there must be another way to achieve the minimum value.

Let's consider the case when $x = -2y$ and $y = -2x$. Substituting these conditions into the equation $|x - 2y| + |y - 2x| = 40$, we get $|-x + 4y| + |-y + 4x| = 40$, or $|-x + 4(-2

Question (hint: positive numerical answer):
"What is the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ when $x$ and $y$ range over all real numbers such that $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$?"
Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:


The expression $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ can be rewritten as $5(x^2 - \frac{8}{5}xy + y^2) = 5[(x - \frac{4}{5}y)^2 + \frac{1}{5}y^2]$.
Similarly, the expression $|x-2y| + |y-2x|$ can be rewritten as $|x-2y| + |2y-x| = |x-2y| + |-1(x-2y)| = |x-2y| + |x-2y| = 2|x-2y|$.
We are given that $2|x-2y| = 40$, so $|x-2y| = 20$.
Now we want to minimize $5[(x - \frac{4}{5}y)^2 + \frac{1}{5}y^2]$.
Since $|x-2y| = 20$, we can rewrite this as $|x-2y| = \sqrt{(x-2y)^2} = \sqrt{(x^2 - 4xy + 4y^2)} = 20$.
Then, we square both sides to get $(x^2 - 4xy + 4y^2) = 400$.
Rearranging terms, we get $x^2 - 4xy + 4y^2 - 400 = 0$.
This equation can be rewritten as $(x - 2y)^2 - 400 = 0$.
So $(x - 2y)^2 = 400$.
Taking the square root of both sides, we get $x - 2y = \pm 20$.
Without loss of generality, let's assume $x - 2y = 20$.
Then, solving for $y$, we get $y = \frac{x - 20}{2}$.
Substituting this into the expression $5[(x - \frac{4}{5}y)^2 + \frac{1}{5}y^2]$, we get
\[5\left[\left(x - \frac{4}{5}\left(\frac{x - 20}{2}\right)\right)^2 + \frac{1}{5}\left(\frac{x - 20}{2}\right)^2\right] = 5\left[\left(x - \frac{2}{5}(x - 20)\right)^2 + \frac{1}{20}(x - 20)^2\right].\]
Expanding and simplifying, we get
\[5\left[\left(\frac{3}{5}x + \frac{4}{5} \cdot 20\right)^2 + \frac{1}{20}(x - 20)^2\right] = 5\left[\left(\frac{3}{5}x + 16\right)^2 + \frac{1}{20}(x - 20)^2\right].\]
This is a quadratic function with minimum value when $x = -\frac{b}{2a} = -\frac{-96}{2 \cdot \frac{3}{5}} = 80$.
Substituting $x = 80$ into the equation $y = \frac{x - 20}{2}$, we get $y = \frac{80 - 20}{2} = 30$.
Substituting $x = 80$ and $y = 30$ into the expression $5[(x - \frac{4}{5}y)^2 + \frac{1}{5}y^2]$, we get
\[5\left[\left(80 - \frac{4}{5} \cdot 30\right)^2 + \frac{1}{5} \cdot 30^2\right] = 5\left[\left(80 - 24\right)^2 + \frac{1}{5} \cdot 900\right] = 5 \cdot (56^2 + 180) = 5 \cdot (3136 + 180) = 5 \cdot 3316 = 16580.\]
So the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ is 16580. The answer is: 16580

Step-by-step Solution:


<<<<<<< HEAD
First, let's rewrite the condition as $|2y - x| + |2x - y| = 40$. We know that for any $a$ and $b$, $|a - b| = |b - a|$, so we can rewrite the condition as $|2y - x| + |x - 2y| = 40$.
This simplifies to $2|2y - x| = 40$, so $|2y - x| = 20$.
This means $2y - x = 20$ or $2y - x = -20$.

Case 1: $2y - x = 20$. Solving for $x$, we get $x = 2y - 20$.

Substituting $x = 2y - 20$ into the expression $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$, we get
\begin{align*}
5(2y - 20)^2 + 5y^2 - 8(2y - 20)y &= 5(4y^2 - 80y + 400) + 5y^2 - 16y^2 + 160y \\
&= 20y^2 - 400y + 2000 + 5y^2 - 16y^2 + 160y \\
&= -11y^2 - 240y + 2000.
\end{align*}

Let $f(y) = -11y^2 - 240y + 2000$. We want to find the minimum of $f(y)$.
Taking the derivative of $f(y)$ with respect to $y$, we get $f'(y) = -22y - 240$.
Setting $f'(y)$ equal to zero, we get $-22y - 240 = 0$, which gives $y = -\frac{240}{22} = -\frac{120}{11}$.

Substituting $y = -\frac{120}{11}$ back into the equation $x = 2y - 20$, we get
\[x = 2 \left(-\frac{120}{11}\right) - 20 = -\frac{240}{11} - \frac{220}{11} = -\frac{460}{11}.\]

So one possible pair of $(x, y)$ is $\left(-\frac{460}{11}, -\frac{120}{11}\right)$.

Substituting $x = -\frac{460}{11}$ and $y = -\frac{120}{11}$ into the expression $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$, we get
\begin{align*}
5 \left(-\frac{460}{11}\right)^2 + 5 \left(-\frac{120}{11}\right)^2 - 8 \left(-\frac{460}{11}\right) \left(-\frac{120}{11}\right) &= 5 \cdot \frac{211600}{121} + 5 \cdot \frac{14400}{121} + \frac{368000}{121} \\
&= \frac{1058000}{121} + \frac{72000}{121} + \frac{368000}{121} \\
&= \frac{1498000}{121} \\
&= 12371.\overline{267605633802816901408450704225352112676056338028169...}.
\end{align*}

Case 2: $2y - x = -20$. Solving for $x$, we get $x = 2y + 20$.

Substituting $x = 2y + 20$ into the expression $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$, we get
\begin{align*}
5(2y + 20)^2 + 5y^2 - 8(2y + 20)y &= 5(4y^2 + 80y + 400) + 5y^2 - 16y^2 - 160y \\
&= 20y^2 + 400y + 2000 + 5y^2 - 16y^2 - 160y \\
&= -11y^2 + 240y + 2000.
\end{align*}

Let $g(y) = -11y^2 + 240y + 2000$. We want to find the minimum of $g(y)$.
Taking the derivative of $g(y)$ with respect to $y$, we get $g'(y) = -22y + 240$.
Setting $g'(y)$ equal to zero, we get $-22y + 240 = 0$, which gives $y = \frac{240}{22} = \frac{120}{11}$.

Substituting $y = \frac{120}{11}$ back into the equation $x = 2y + 20$, we get
\[x = 2 \left(\frac{120}{11}\right) + 20 = \frac{240}{11} + \frac{220}{11} = \frac{460}{11}.\]

So another possible pair of $(x, y)$ is $\left(\frac{460}{11}, \frac{120}{11}\right)$.

Substituting $x = \frac{460}{11}$ and $y = \frac{120}{11}$ into the expression $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$, we get
\begin{align*}
5 \left(\frac{460}{11}\right)^2 + 5 \left(\frac{120}{11}\right)^2 - 8 \left(\frac{460}{11}\right) \left(\frac{120}{11}\right) &= 5 \cdot \frac{211600}{121} + 5 \cdot \frac{14400}{121} - \frac{436800}{121} \\
&= \frac{1058000}{121} + \frac{72000}{121} - \frac{436800}{121} \\
&= \frac{689200}{121}

Question (hint: positive numerical answer):
"What is the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ when $x$ and $y$ range over all real numbers such that $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$?"
Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:



First, let's simplify the given equation $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$.

By the property of absolute value, we can write $|a-b| = |-(b-a)|$, so the equation can be rewritten as $|x-2y| + |-(x-2y)| = 40$.

This simplifies to $|x-2y| + |-1| \cdot |x-2y| = 40$, which further simplifies to $2|x-2y| = 40$.

So $|x-2y| = 20$. This means either $x-2y = 20$ or $x-2y = -20$.

Now let's express $y$ in terms of $x$ from these two equations:

For $x-2y = 20$, we have $y = \frac{x}{2} - 10$.

For $x-2y = -20$, we have $y = \frac{x}{2} + 10$.

Now we substitute these expressions for $y$ into the expression we want to minimize: $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$.
>>>>>>> 6f0b69cb07fbcd5ccae9b1688198c8331f697675

For $y = \frac{x}{2} - 10$, we have
\[5x^2+5y^2-8xy = 5x^2+5\left(\frac{x}{2} - 10\right)^2 - 8x\left(\frac{x}{2} - 10\right).\]

Simplifying this gives
\[5x^2+5\left(\frac{x^2}{4} - 10x + 100\right) - 4x^2 + 80x = \frac{x^2}{4} + 80x + 500.\]

Question (hint: positive numerical answer):
"What is the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ when $x$ and $y$ range over all real numbers such that $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$?"
Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:


We can rewrite the given equation as $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$.
By the triangle inequality, we have $|x-2y| + |y-2x| \geq |(x-2y) + (y-2x)| = |x-2y+y-2x| = |-x-y| = |-(x+y)| = |x+y|$.
So, $|x+y| = 40$.
Now, let's express the given expression $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ in terms of $x+y$ and $x-2y$.
We have
\[5x^2 + 5y^2 - 8xy = \frac{1}{2} [(5x^2 + 5y^2 - 8xy) + (5x^2 + 5y^2 + 8xy)]\]
\[= \frac{1}{2} [(5x^2 + 5y^2) + (5x^2 + 5y^2)] = \frac{1}{2} [10x^2 + 10y^2] = 5(x^2 + y^2).\]
Now, we express $x^2 + y^2$ in terms of $x+y$ and $x-2y$.
From $x+y = 40$, we get $y = 40 - x$. Substituting this into $x-2y$, we get
\[x - 2y = x - 2(40 - x) = x - 80 + 2x = 3x - 80.\]
So, $x-2y = 3x - 80$. Then, $2y = -2x + 80$, and $y = -x + 40$.
Now, we can express $x^2 + y^2$ in terms of $x$ only:
\[x^2 + y^2 = x^2 + (-x + 40)^2 = x^2 + (x^2 - 80x + 1600) = 2x^2 - 80x + 1600.\]
Now, we substitute this into $5(x^2 + y^2)$ to get
\[5(x^2 + y^2) = 5(2x^2 - 80x + 1600) = 10x^2 - 400x + 8000.\]
To find the minimum value of this expression, we can use calculus.
Taking the derivative of $10x^2 - 400x + 8000$ with respect to $x$, we get
\[\frac{d}{dx} (10x^2 - 400x + 8000) = 20x - 400.\]
Setting this equal to zero to find the critical points, we have
\[20x - 400 = 0 \implies 20x = 400 \implies x = 20.\]
Then, $y = 40 - x = 40 - 20 = 20$.
Substituting these values back into $5(x^2 + y^2)$, we get
\[5(x^2 + y^2) = 5(20^2 + 20^2) = 5(800) = 4000.\]
Thus, the minimum value of the given expression is $4000$.
The answer is: $4000$

Question (hint: positive numerical answer):
"What is the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ when $x$ and $y$ range over all real numbers such that $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$?"
Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:


To begin with, let's denote $A = x - 2y$ and $B = y - 2x$. We have the equation $|A| + |B| = 40$. By the triangle inequality, we know that $|A| + |B| \geq |A + B|$, so $|A + B| \leq 40$. 

On the other hand, $A + B = x - 2y + y - 2x = -x - y$, so $|A + B| = |-x - y| = |-(x + y)| = |x + y|$. Therefore, we have $|x + y| \leq 40$.

Now let's look at the expression $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$. We can rewrite this as $\frac{1}{2}(5(x^2 + y^2) - 8xy) = \frac{1}{2}[(5x^2 - 8xy + 5y^2) + 3(x^2 + y^2)] = \frac{1}{2}[(5x - 4y)^2 + 3(x^2 + y^2)]$.

By the Cauchy-Schwarz inequality, we know that $(a^2 + b^2)(c^2 + d^2) \geq (ac + bd)^2$ for any real numbers $a, b, c, d$. Taking $a = 5x - 4y$, $b = \sqrt{3}(x + y)$, $c = \sqrt{3}(x - y)$, and $d = 5x - 4y$, we have $((5x - 4y)^2 + 3(x^2 + y^2))((5^2 + (-4)^2)((\sqrt{3})^2 + 1^2)) \geq ((5x - 4y)\sqrt{3}(x - y) + \sqrt{3}(x + y)(5x - 4y))^2 = 0$. Thus we have $(5x - 4y)^2 + 3(x^2 + y^2) \geq 0$.

Therefore, the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ is 0. However, we still need to ensure that the conditions $|x - 2y| + |y - 2x| = 40$ and $|x + y| \leq 40$ are both satisfied. 

Let's substitute $x = 2y$ into $|x - 2y| + |y - 2x| = 40$, we get $0 + |y - 4y| = 40 \Rightarrow |-3y| = 40 \Rightarrow 3|y| = 40 \Rightarrow |y| = \frac{40}{3}$, which is true because $\left|\frac{40}{3}\right| = \frac{40}{3}$ and $3\left(\frac{40}{3}\right) = 40$.

Similarly, substitute $x = 2y$ into $|x + y| \leq 40$, we get $3|y| \leq 40 \Rightarrow |y| \leq \frac{40}{3}$, which is also true.

Therefore, the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ when $x$ and $y$ range over all real numbers such that $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$ is indeed 0. The answer is: $0$

For $y = \frac{x}{2} + 10$, we have
\[5x^2+5y^2-8xy = 5x^2+5\left(\frac{x}{2} + 10\right)^2 - 8x\left(\frac{x}{2} + 10\right).\]

Simplifying this gives
\[5x^2+5\left(\frac{x^2}{4} + 10x + 100\right) - 4x^2 - 80x = \frac{x^2}{4} - 80x + 500.\]

Now we can compare the two expressions. We can see that the expression for $y = \frac{x}{2} - 10$ is always greater than or equal to the expression for $y = \frac{x}{2} + 10$.

So to find the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$, we just need to minimize the expression for $y = \frac{x}{2} - 10$.

Setting the derivative of this expression with respect to $x$ equal to zero gives
\[\frac{x}{2} = 40,\]
which implies $x = 80$.

Substituting $x = 80$ into the equation $y = \frac{x}{2} - 10$ gives $y = 30$.

Substituting $x = 80$ and $y = 30$ into the expression $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ gives
\[5(80)^2 + 5(30)^2 - 8(80)(30) = 32000 + 4500 - 24000 = 13500.\]

So the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ is 13500.
The answer is: 13500

Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:



Given the equation $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$, we can split it into two cases based on the signs of $x-2y$ and $y-2x$.
>>>>>>> 6f0b69cb07fbcd5ccae9b1688198c8331f697675

Case 1: $x-2y \ge 0$ and $y-2x \ge 0$. This means $x \ge 2y$ and $y \ge 2x$. Substituting these inequalities into the equation gives $x - 2y + y - 2x = 40$, which simplifies to $-x - y = 40$. This is a contradiction because both $x$ and $y$ cannot be negative at the same time.

Case 2: $x-2y < 0$ and $y-2x < 0$. This means $x < 2y$ and $y < 2x$. Substituting these inequalities into the equation gives $-(x - 2y) - (y - 2x) = 40$, which simplifies to $x - 2y + 2x - y = 40$, and further simplifies to $3x - 3y = 40$. Dividing both sides by 3 gives $x - y = \frac{40}{3}$.

Question (hint: positive numerical answer):
"What is the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ when $x$ and $y$ range over all real numbers such that $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$?"
Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:



To solve this problem, we first need to find a relation between $x$ and $y$ from the equation $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$. 

Let's rewrite $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$ as $|2y-x| + |2x-y| = 40$.

We know that $|a-b| + |b-a| = 2|a-b|$. So, we can simplify the equation to $2|2y-x| = 40$, which gives $|2y-x| = 20$.

Now, we know that $|2y-x|$ represents the distance between the points $x$ and $2y$ on the number line. So, the distance between $x$ and $2y$ is $20$. This gives two possibilities: either $x=2y+20$ or $x=2y-20$.

Now, we substitute these possibilities into the original expression $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ and simplify.

Case 1: If $x=2y+20$, substituting this into $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ gives:
\[5(2y+20)^2+5y^2-8y(2y+20) = 20y^2+200y+2000+5y^2-16y^2-160y = -y^2+40y+2000.\]

Case 2: If $x=2y-20$, substituting this into $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ gives:
\[5(2y-20)^2+5y^2-8y(2y-20) = 20y^2-200y+2000+5y^2-16y^2+160y = -y^2-40y+2000.\]

Since both cases give the same form of expression $-y^2+40y+2000$, we can find the minimum value of this expression by taking the derivative with respect to $y$ and setting it to zero:
\[-2y+40=0 \Rightarrow y=20.\]
Substituting $y=20$ into the expression, we get:
\[-y^2+40y+2000 = -(20)^2+40*20+2000 = -400+800+2000 = 2400.\]
So, the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ under the given condition is $2400$.
The answer is: $\boxed{2400}$.

Question (hint: positive numerical answer):
"What is the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ when $x$ and $y$ range over all real numbers such that $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$?"
Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:



First, we notice that the expression $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ can be rewritten as $(5x^2 - 8xy + 5y^2)$ which is in the form of $(a - 2ab + b^2)$ where $a=5x$ and $b=5y$. Therefore, we can rewrite it as $(5x - 5y)^2$.

Similarly, the given condition $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$ can be rewritten as $|x - 2y| + |2y - x| = 40$, which simplifies to $2|x - 2y| = 40$ and further simplifies to $|x - 2y| = 20$.

Now, let's introduce a new variable $z = x - 2y$. Then, we have $|z| = 20$. This means that $z = 20$ or $z = -20$.

If $z = 20$, then $x - 2y = 20$ and $y - 2x = -20$. Solving these equations simultaneously, we get $x = 20$ and $y = 0$.

If $z = -20$, then $x - 2y = -20$ and $y - 2x = 20$. Solving these equations simultaneously, we get $x = 0$ and $y = -10$.

Now, we substitute $x = 20$ and $y = 0$ into the expression $(5x - 5y)^2$ to get $(5*20 - 5*0)^2 = (100)^2 = 10000$.

Similarly, substituting $x = 0$ and $y = -10$ into the expression $(5x - 5y)^2$, we get $(5*0 - 5*(-10))^2 = (50)^2 = 2500$.

Therefore, the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ is $2500$.
The answer is: $2500$

Question (hint: positive numerical answer):
"What is the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ when $x$ and $y$ range over all real numbers such that $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$?"
Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:


First, notice that $5x^2+5y^2-8xy = \frac{1}{2}((5x-4y)^2 + (4x-5y)^2)$. 

Given $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$, we can use the property of absolute value $|a| + |b| \geq |a+b|$ to simplify the equation. We have $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = |x-2y| + |-(x-2y)| = 2|x-2y| = 40$, which implies $|x-2y| = 20$.

Now, we know that $|x-2y| = 20$, so $(x-2y)^2 = 400$. Expanding this out gives $x^2 - 4xy + 4y^2 = 400$.

Now, we want to minimize $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$, which is equal to $\frac{1}{2}((5x-4y)^2 + (4x-5y)^2)$. Using the equation $x^2 - 4xy + 4y^2 = 400$, we can substitute $x^2 - 4xy + 4y^2$ with $400$, giving us the expression to minimize as $\frac{1}{2}((5x-4y)^2 + (4x-5y)^2) = \frac{1}{2}(5x-4y)^2 + \frac{1}{2}(4x-5y)^2$.

Since the square of a real number is always non-negative, $(5x-4y)^2$ and $(4x-5y)^2$ are both non-negative. Hence, the sum of them is non-negative, i.e., $\frac{1}{2}(5x-4y)^2 + \frac{1}{2}(4x-5y)^2 \geq 0$.

Therefore, the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ is 0. The minimum value of the given function is achieved when $5x-4y = 0$ and $4x-5y = 0$, which gives $x = \frac{20}{3}$ and $y = \frac{20}{3}$.

Substituting $x = \frac{20}{3}$ and $y = \frac{20}{3}$ back into the equation $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$, we can verify that these values satisfy the given condition. 

So, the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ is 0, when $x = \frac{20}{3}$ and $y = \frac{20}{3}$. The answer is: $0$

Question (hint: positive numerical answer):
"What is the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ when $x$ and $y$ range over all real numbers such that $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$?"
Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:


We first note that $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$ is equivalent to $|x-2y| = |2x-y|$.
By the property of absolute value, we know that $|a| = |b|$ is equivalent to $a = b$ or $a = -b$.
So we have two cases to consider:
Case 1: $x - 2y = 2x - y$, which gives $x = y$.
Substituting into the absolute value equation, we have $|x-2x| + |x-2x| = |-x| + |-x| = 2|x| = 40$. So $|x| = 20$, which means $x = 20$ or $x = -20$.
Case 2: $x - 2y = -(2x - y)$, which gives $x - 2y = -2x + y$, or $3x = 3y$, so $x = y$.
Again, substituting into the absolute value equation, we have $|x-2x| + |x-2x| = |-x| + |-x| = 2|x| = 40$, so $|x| = 20$, and $x = 20$ or $x = -20$.
Now we substitute $x = y$ into $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$, which becomes $5x^2 + 5x^2 - 8x^2 = 2x^2$.
Since $x = 20$ or $x = -20$, we substitute these values into $2x^2$:
If $x = 20$, then $2x^2 = 2(20^2) = 800$.
If $x = -20$, then $2x^2 = 2(-20^2) = 800$.
So in both cases, $2x^2 = 800$.
Therefore, the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ is $800$.
The answer is: $800$

Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:



First, we can rewrite the equation $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$ as $|2y-x| + |2x-y| = 40$.

By the triangle inequality, $|a| + |b| \ge |a+b|$, we have $|2y-x| + |2x-y| \ge |(2y-x) + (2x-y)| = |y| = y$ when $y \ge 0$, and $|2y-x| + |2x-y| \ge |- (2y-x) - (2x-y)| = |-3(x-y)| = 3|x-y| = 3(x-y)$ when $y < 0$.

So, we have $y \ge 0$ or $3(x-y) = 40$. If $y \ge 0$, then $y = 40$, and we can substitute this into the equation $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$ to get $|x-80| + |80-2x| = 40$. This simplifies to $|x-80| + |80-2x| = 40$.

If $x \le 40$, then $|x-80| = 80-x$ and $|80-2x| = 80-2x$, so the equation becomes $80-x + 80-2x = 40$, which simplifies to $3x = 120$, and $x = 40$. But this contradicts our assumption that $x \le 40$.

If $x \ge 40$, then $|x-80| = x-80$ and $|80-2x| = 2x-80$, so the equation becomes $x-80 + 2x-80 = 40$, which simplifies to $3x = 200$, and $x = \frac{200}{3}$. But this also contradicts our assumption that $x \ge 40$.

So, we must have $3(x-y) = 40$, which gives $y = \frac{x}{3} - \frac{40}{3}$. Substituting this into the equation $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$ gives $|x - 2(\frac{x}{3} - \frac{40}{3})| + |(\frac{x}{3} - \frac{40}{3}) - 2x| = 40$. This simplifies to $|x - \frac{2x}{3} + \frac{80}{3}| + |\frac{x}{3} - \frac{40}{3} - 2x| = 40$.

Simplifying further, we have $|\frac{x}{3} + \frac{80}{3}| + |-\frac{5x}{3} - \frac{40}{3}| = 40$. This gives $\frac{x}{3} + \frac{80}{3} = 40$ or $-\frac{5x}{3} - \frac{40}{3} = 40$.

From the first equation, we get $\frac{x}{3} = - \frac{40}{3}$, so $x = -40$. Substituting this into $y = \frac{x}{3} - \frac{40}{3}$ gives $y = - \frac{80}{3}$. But this makes $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$ false, so we discard this solution.

From the second equation, we get $-\frac{5x}{3} = 80$, so $x = -\frac{240}{5} = -48$. Substituting this into $y = \frac{x}{3} - \frac{40}{3}$ gives $y = - \frac{88}{5}$.

Now, we substitute $x = -48$ and $y = - \frac{88}{5}$ into the expression $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ to get $5(-48)^2 + 5(- \frac{88}{5})^2 - 8(-48)(- \frac{88}{5}) = 1152$.

Therefore, the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ when $x$ and $y$ range over all real numbers such that $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$ is 1152.
The answer is: $1152$
=======
Now we need to minimize $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ under the condition $x - y = \frac{40}{3}$. We can rewrite the expression as $5(x^2 + y^2) - 8xy$.

Using the identity $(x - y)^2 = x^2 + y^2 - 2xy$, we can express $xy$ in terms of $x - y$ and $x + y$. From $x - y = \frac{40}{3}$, we get $x + y = \frac{3}{2}(x - y) + y = \frac{3}{2} \cdot \frac{40}{3} + y = 20 + y$.

Substituting $x + y = 20 + y$ into the equation $(x - y)^2 = x^2 + y^2 - 2xy$ gives $\left(\frac{40}{3}\right)^2 = (20 + y)^2 - 2xy$, which simplifies to $\frac{1600}{9} = 400 + 40y + y^2 - 2xy$.

Rearranging terms gives $2xy - 40y = y^2 - \frac{1600}{9} + 400$.

Since we want to minimize $5(x^2 + y^2) - 8xy$, we want to minimize $-8xy$. From the equation above, we have $-8xy = -8(2xy - 40y) = -16xy + 320y = -16(y^2 - \frac{1600}{9} + 400) + 320y = -16y^2 + \frac{25600}{9} - 6400 + 320y$.

The minimum value of this expression is attained when the derivative with respect to $y$ is zero. Taking the derivative gives $-32y + \frac{25600}{9} - 6400 + 320 = 0$. Solving for $y$ gives $y = \frac{17600}{2880} = \frac{11}{18}$.

Substituting $y = \frac{11}{18}$ into the equation $x - y = \frac{40}{3}$ gives $x = \frac{40}{3} + \frac{11}{18} = \frac{240 + 11}{18} = \frac{251}{18}$.

Finally, substituting $x = \frac{251}{18}$ and $y = \frac{11}{18}$ into the expression $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ gives
\[5\left(\frac{251}{18}\right)^2 + 5\left(\frac{11}{18}\right)^2 - 8\cdot\frac{251}{18}\cdot\frac{11}{18} = -\frac{8845}{162} < 0.\]
This is impossible because the expression $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ is always nonnegative. We must have made a mistake in our calculations. Let's go back and check our work.

Upon re-examining our calculations, we realized that we made a mistake in the equation $-(x - 2y) - (y - 2x) = 40$. We should have $-(x - 2y) + (y - 2x) = 40$. This gives $x - 2y - y + 2x = 40$, and further simplifies to $3x - y = 40$. Dividing both sides by 3 gives $x - \frac{y}{3} = \frac{40}{3}$.

Now we need to minimize $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ under the condition $x - \frac{y}{3} = \frac{40}{3}$. We can rewrite the expression as $5(x^2 + y^2) - 8xy$.

Using the identity $(x - \frac{y}{3})^2 = x^2 + \frac{y^2}{9} - \frac{2xy}{3}$, we can express $xy$ in terms of $x - \frac{y}{3}$ and $x + y$. From $x - \frac{y}{3} = \frac{40}{3}$, we get $x + y = 3\left(x - \frac{y}{3}\right) + y = 3 \cdot \frac{40}{3} + y = 40 + y$.

Substituting $x + y = 40 + y$ into the equation $(x - \frac{y}{3})^2 = x^2 + \frac{y^2}{9} - \frac{2xy}{3}$ gives $\left(\frac{40}{3}\right)^2 = (40 + y)^2 - \frac{2}{3}xy$, which simplifies to $\frac{1600}{9} = 1600 + 80y + y^2 - \frac{2}{3}xy$.

Rearranging terms gives $\frac{2}{3}xy - 80y = y^2 - \frac{1600}{9} + 1600$.

Since we want to minimize $5(x^2 + y^2) - 8xy$, we want to minimize $-8xy$. From the equation above, we have $-8xy = -8\left(\frac{2}{3}xy - 80y\right) = -\frac{16}{3}xy +

Question (hint: positive numerical answer):
"What is the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ when $x$ and $y$ range over all real numbers such that $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$?"
Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:


First, we notice that the given equation $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$ is equivalent to $|x-2y| + |2y-x| = 40$, which simplifies to $|x-2y| - |x-2y| = 40$. This is obviously not possible, so there must be a mistake in our reasoning.
Let's try to solve the given equation $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$ again. We can rewrite it as $|x-2y| + |-1*(x-2y)| = 40$. Since $|a| + |b| = |a+b|$ if $a$ and $b$ have the same sign, and $|a| + |-b| = |a-b|$ if $a$ and $b$ have opposite signs, we can simplify the equation to $|x-2y + x-2y| = 40$ if $x-2y$ and $y-2x$ have the same sign, or $|x-2y - (x-2y)| = 40$ if $x-2y$ and $y-2x$ have opposite signs. In the first case, we get $|2(x-2y)| = 40$, or $2|x-2y| = 40$, so $|x-2y| = 20$. In the second case, we get $|-2(x-2y)| = 40$, or $2|x-2y| = 40$, so $|x-2y| = 20$ again.
Now let's solve the inequality $|x-2y| = 20$. This gives us two cases:
1) $x-2y = 20$: In this case, we can solve for $y$ to get $y = \frac{x}{2} - 10$.
2) $x-2y = -20$: In this case, we can solve for $y$ to get $y = \frac{x}{2} + 10$.
Substituting these expressions for $y$ into the given expression $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$, we can simplify it to:
1) $5x^2+5\left(\frac{x}{2} - 10\right)^2 - 8x\left(\frac{x}{2} - 10\right) = 5x^2+5\left(\frac{x^2}{4} - 10x + 100\right) - 4x^2 + 80x = \frac{x^2}{4} - 10x + 500$.
2) $5x^2+5\left(\frac{x}{2} + 10\right)^2 - 8x\left(\frac{x}{2} + 10\right) = 5x^2+5\left(\frac{x^2}{4} + 10x + 100\right) - 4x^2 - 80x = \frac{x^2}{4} + 10x + 500$.
In both cases, we can see that the expression is minimized when $x=0$. Substituting $x=0$ into either expression for $y$, we get $y = \pm 10$. Thus, the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ is achieved when $x=0$ and $y=\pm 10$, and is equal to $5(0)^2+5(10)^2-8(0)(10) = 500$.
Therefore, the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ is 500.
The answer is: 500

Question (hint: positive numerical answer):
"What is the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ when $x$ and $y$ range over all real numbers such that $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$?"
Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:


First, we need to solve the equation $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$.
By the triangle inequality, we have $|x-2y| + |y-2x| \geq |(x-2y) - (y-2x)| = |x-2y-y+2x| = |3x-3y| = 3|x-y|$.
Thus, $3|x-y| = 40$, so $|x-y| = \frac{40}{3}$.
Now, let's substitute $z = x-y$. Then, $y = x - z$, and we have $|z| = \frac{40}{3}$.
We can rewrite the expression $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ as $5(x^2+y^2)-8xy = 5[(x-y)^2+2xy] - 8xy = 5[z^2+2(x-z)y] - 8xy = 5z^2+10xy - 8xy = 5z^2+2xy$.
Since $z = x - y$, we have $y = x - z$, so $xy = x(x - z) = x^2 - xz$.
Thus, $5z^2+2xy = 5z^2+2(x^2 - xz) = 5z^2+2x^2 - 2xz$.
Now, we want to minimize this expression. Since $z = \frac{40}{3}$, we have $5z^2 = 5\left(\frac{40}{3}\right)^2 = \frac{8000}{9}$.
To minimize the expression, we want to minimize $2x^2 - 2xz = 2x(x - z)$. This occurs when $x = z = \frac{40}{3}$.
Thus, the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ is $5z^2+2xz = \frac{8000}{9} + 2\left(\frac{40}{3}\right)^2 = \frac{8000}{9} + \frac{3200}{9} = \frac{11200}{9}$.
The minimum value is therefore $\frac{11200}{9}$.
The answer is: $\frac{11200}{9}$

Question (hint: positive numerical answer):
"What is the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ when $x$ and $y$ range over all real numbers such that $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$?"
Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:


First, let's rewrite the expression $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ as $5(x^2+y^2)-8xy$.
We know that $(x^2+y^2)-2xy=(x-y)^2$. So we can rewrite the expression as $5[(x-y)^2+2xy]-8xy = 5(x-y)^2 + 5(2xy) - 8xy = 5(x-y)^2 - 3xy$.
Now, let's look at the constraint $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$. By the triangle inequality, we know that $|a+b| \leq |a| + |b|$, so $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = |x-2y| + |2x-y| \geq |(x-2y) + (2x-y)| = |3x-3y| = 3|x-y|$. Therefore, $3|x-y| = 40$ and $|x-y| = \frac{40}{3}$.
Now, let's substitute $z = x-y$, so we have $|z| = \frac{40}{3}$.
Our expression now becomes $5z^2 - 3(y+z)y = 5z^2 - 3yz - 3y^2$.
To minimize this expression, we take the derivative with respect to $y$ and set it to zero: $-3z - 6y = 0$, so $y = -\frac{z}{2}$.
Now substitute $y = -\frac{z}{2}$ into our expression to get $5z^2 + \frac{9}{4}z^2 = \frac{29}{4}z^2$.
Since $|z| = \frac{40}{3}$, the minimum value of the expression is $\frac{29}{4} \left(\frac{40}{3}\right)^2 = \frac{29 \cdot 1600}{36} = \frac{46400}{36} = \frac{11600}{9}$.
So the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ is $\frac{11600}{9}$. The answer is: $\frac{11600}{9}$

Question (hint: positive numerical answer):
"What is the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ when $x$ and $y$ range over all real numbers such that $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$?"
Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:


First, we notice that the given equation $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$ is equivalent to $|2y-x| + |2x-y| = 40$.
This can be rewritten as $|2y-x| + |x-2y| = 40$.
By the property of absolute value, we know that $|a| + |b| = |a+b|$ if and only if $ab \ge 0$.
In this case, we have $(2y-x)(x-2y) \ge 0$.
Expanding the expression, we get $-(x-2y)^2 \ge 0$.
This implies that $(x-2y)^2 \le 0$, and since the square of a real number is always non-negative, we must have $(x-2y)^2 = 0$.
This implies that $x-2y = 0$, or $x=2y$.

Now, substitute $x=2y$ into the expression $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$, we get
\[5(2y)^2+5y^2-8(2y)(y) = 20y^2+5y^2-16y^2 = 9y^2.\]
Since $y$ can be any real number, the minimum value of $9y^2$ is $0$, which occurs when $y=0$.
And since $x=2y$, when $y=0$, we have $x=0$.
So the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ under the condition $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$ is $9(0)^2 = 0$. The answer is: 0

Question (hint: positive numerical answer):
"What is the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ when $x$ and $y$ range over all real numbers such that $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$?"
Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:


To solve this problem, we first need to find the relationship between $x$ and $y$ from the equation $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$.
Without loss of generality, we can assume that $x \geq y$. Then, the equation becomes:
\[(x-2y) + (2x-y) = 40.\]
Simplifying the left side gives:
\[3x-3y = 40,\]
\[x-y = \frac{40}{3}.\]
This means $x = y + \frac{40}{3}$. Now, we can substitute this back into the expression we want to minimize, $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$:
\[5\left(y + \frac{40}{3}\right)^2 + 5y^2 - 8y\left(y + \frac{40}{3}\right).\]
Expanding and simplifying gives:
\[5y^2 + 400y + \frac{8000}{9} + 5y^2 - 8y^2 - \frac{320y}{3} = \frac{1}{9}(54y^2 + 1200y + 8000).\]
Now, we can use the fact that the minimum value of $ax^2+bx+c$ occurs at $x = -\frac{b}{2a}$ to find the minimum value of this expression. The minimum value of $\frac{1}{9}(54y^2 + 1200y + 8000)$ occurs at $y = -\frac{1200}{2 \cdot 54} = -\frac{100}{9}$.
Substituting this back into the expression gives the minimum value:
\[\frac{1}{9}(54\left(-\frac{100}{9}\right)^2 + 1200\left(-\frac{100}{9}\right) + 8000) = \frac{1}{9}(5400 - 12000 + 8000) = \frac{1}{9}(1800) = 200.\]
Therefore, the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ when $x$ and $y$ range over all real numbers such that $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$ is 200. The answer is: 200

Question (hint: positive numerical answer):
"What is the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ when $x$ and $y$ range over all real numbers such that $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$?"
Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:


We are given the equation $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$.
By the Triangle Inequality, we have $|x-2y| + |y-2x| \geq |x-2y + (y-2x)| = |x-2y-y+2x| = |x-3x+2y-y| = |-2x+y| = 2|y-x|$.
So, $2|y-x| = 40$, and thus $|y-x| = 20$.
This means $y-x = 20$ or $y-x = -20$.
We can solve these two cases separately.
Case 1: $y-x = 20$. Adding $x$ to both sides gives $y = x+20$.
Substituting this into the given expression, we have
\begin{align*}
5x^2 + 5y^2 - 8xy &= 5x^2 + 5(x+20)^2 - 8x(x+20) \\
&= 5x^2 + 5(x^2 + 40x + 400) - 8x^2 - 160x \\
&= 5x^2 + 5x^2 + 200x + 2000 - 8x^2 - 160x \\
&= 2x^2 + 40x + 2000.
\end{align*}
Let $f(x) = 2x^2 + 40x + 2000$. To find the minimum value of this quadratic function, we can find its vertex.
The $x$-coordinate of the vertex is $x = -\frac{b}{2a} = -\frac{40}{2(2)} = -10$.
Substituting this back into $f(x)$, we have $f(-10) = 2(-10)^2 + 40(-10) + 2000 = 200 - 400 + 2000 = 1800$.
Case 2: $y-x = -20$. Adding $x$ to both sides gives $y = x-20$.
Substituting this into the given expression, we have
\begin{align*}
5x^2 + 5y^2 - 8xy &= 5x^2 + 5(x-20)^2 - 8x(x-20) \\
&= 5x^2 + 5(x^2 - 40x + 400) - 8x^2 + 160x \\
&= 5x^2 + 5x^2 - 200x + 2000 - 8x^2 + 160x \\
&= -3x^2 - 40x + 2000.
\end{align*}
Let $g(x) = -3x^2 - 40x + 2000$. To find the minimum value of this quadratic function, we can find its vertex.
The $x$-coordinate of the vertex is $x = -\frac{b}{2a} = -\frac{-40}{2(-3)} = \frac{20}{3}$.
However, this value of $x$ does not satisfy the condition $|y-x| = 20$. So, we discard this case.

From case 1, we have found that the minimum value of the given expression is 1800.

So, the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ when $x$ and $y$ range over all real numbers such that $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$ is 1800.
The answer is: $1800$

Question (hint: positive numerical answer):
"What is the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ when $x$ and $y$ range over all real numbers such that $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$?"
Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:


Let $u = x - 2y$ and $v = y - 2x$. We are given that $|u| + |v| = 40$.
By the triangle inequality, $|u| + |v| \geq |u + v|$. Thus, we have $|u + v| \leq 40$.
Since $u + v = (x - 2y) + (y - 2x) = -x - y$, we have $|-x - y| \leq 40$.
Now, let's consider the expression $5x^2 + 5y^2 - 8xy$. We can rewrite it as
\[5(x^2 + y^2) - 8xy = 5[(x - y)^2 + xy] - 8xy
= 5(x - y)^2 + xy.\]
By the AM-GM inequality, we have
\[(x - y)^2 \geq 0,\]
so $5(x - y)^2 \geq 0$. Thus,
\[5(x - y)^2 + xy \geq xy.\]
To minimize this expression, we need to maximize $xy$. But from $|u + v| \leq 40$, we have $|-x - y| \leq 40$, or $-40 \leq -x - y \leq 40$. Multiplying by $-1$ gives $40 \geq x + y \geq -40$.
Now, let's use the triangle inequality again. From $|u| + |v| = 40$, we have $|x - 2y| + |y - 2x| = 40$. This simplifies to $|x - 2y| + |2x - y| = 40$. Again using the triangle inequality, we have
\[|(x - 2y) + (2x - y)| \leq 40,\]
which simplifies to $|3x - 3y| \leq 40$, or $|x - y| \leq \frac{40}{3}$.
By the AM-GM inequality, we have
\[xy \leq \left(\frac{x + y}{2}\right)^2 \leq \left(\frac{40}{6}\right)^2 = \frac{400}{9}.\]
Therefore, the minimum value of $5x^2 + 5y^2 - 8xy$ is $xy$, and its minimum value is $\frac{400}{9}$.
The answer is: $\boxed{\frac{400}{9}}$

Question (hint: positive numerical answer):
"What is the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ when $x$ and $y$ range over all real numbers such that $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$?"
Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:



We are given the equation $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$ and we want to find the minimum value of the expression $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$.

First, let's simplify the equation $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$. We can rewrite $|x-2y|$ as $|2y-x|$ and $|y-2x|$ as $|2x-y|$, so the equation becomes $|2y-x| + |2x-y| = 40$.

Now, let's use the property $|a| + |b| = |a+b| + |a-b|$ to simplify further. We have $|2y-x+2x-y| + |(2y-x)-(2x-y)| = 40$, which simplifies to $|y+x| + |y-x| = 40$.

Since $|a+b| = |a-(-b)|$, we can rewrite this as $|x+y| + |-x+y| = 40$. Applying the property again, we have $|2y| + |-2x| = 40$, which simplifies to $|2y| + |2x| = 40$ or $2|y| + 2|x| = 40$.

Dividing both sides by 2 gives $|y| + |x| = 20$. This equation represents a set of points $(x, y)$ in the coordinate plane such that the sum of their absolute values is a constant, which is a diamond-shaped region in the coordinate plane.

Now, we want to find the minimum value of the expression $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ within this diamond-shaped region. 

Let's consider the expression $5x^2+5y^2-8xy = \frac{1}{2}[(5x^2 - 8xy + 5y^2) + (5x^2 + 8xy + 5y^2)] - 10xy = \frac{1}{2}[(5x^2 - 8xy + 5y^2) + (x+y)^2] - 10xy$.

We know that $(x+y)^2 \ge 0$, so the minimum value of the expression is achieved when $10xy$ is maximized.

From the equation $|y| + |x| = 20$, we can see that the maximum value of $xy$ occurs when $x$ and $y$ are equal in magnitude but opposite in sign, i.e., $x = -y$. Substituting $y = -x$ into the equation $|y| + |x| = 20$, we get $2|x| = 20$, so $|x| = 10$ and $x = \pm 10$.

When $x = 10$ and $y = -10$, we have $xy = -100$, and the minimum value of the expression $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ is $\frac{1}{2}[(5*10^2 - 8*(-100) + 5*(-10)^2) + (10+(-10))^2] - 10*(-100) = \frac{1}{2}(500+800+500+0)-(-1000) = \frac{1}{2}(1800)+1000 = 900 + 1000 = 1900$.

Therefore, the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ when $x$ and $y$ range over all real numbers such that $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$ is 1900. The answer is: $1900$

Question (hint: positive numerical answer):
"What is the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ when $x$ and $y$ range over all real numbers such that $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$?"
Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:


To solve this problem, we can use the identity $a^2 - 2ab + b^2 = (a - b)^2$. 
Let's first rewrite the expression $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ as follows:
$$5x^2+5y^2-8xy = \frac{5}{2}(2x)^2 + \frac{5}{2}(2y)^2 - 8xy = \frac{5}{2} [(2x)^2 - 4xy + (2y)^2] + \frac{5}{2} [(2y)^2 - 4xy + (2x)^2] = \frac{5}{2} [(2x-2y)^2 + (2y-2x)^2].$$
We know that $|a-b| = |b-a|$, so $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = |x-2y| + |2y-x| = |2x-2y| + |2y-x| = |2(x-y) + (y-x)| = |x-y|$. Thus, $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$ is equivalent to $|x-y| = 40$. 
Now, we know that $(x-y)^2 \geq 0$, so $(x-y)^2 = 40^2 = 1600$. Thus, the minimum value of $\frac{5}{2} [(2x-2y)^2 + (2y-2x)^2]$ is $\frac{5}{2} \cdot 0 = 0$. This occurs when $(2x-2y)^2 = 0$ and $(2y-2x)^2 = 0$, which is equivalent to $x=y$. However, this is not consistent with the condition $|x-y| = 40$. So, we need to find the minimum value of $5x^2 + 5y^2 - 8xy$ when $x$ and $y$ are related by the equation $x-y = 20$ or $y-x = 20$. 

1) If $x-y = 20$, then $y = x - 20$. Substituting this into the expression $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$, we get
$$5x^2+5(x-20)^2-8x(x-20) = 5x^2+5(x^2-40x+400)-8x^2+160x = -3x^2+200x+2000.$$
To minimize this expression, we can find its derivative and set it equal to 0:
$$-6x + 200 = 0 \Rightarrow x = \frac{200}{6} = \frac{100}{3}.$$
Substituting this value of $x$ into the equation $y = x - 20$, we get $y = \frac{100}{3} - 20 = \frac{40}{3}$.

Now, substitute $x = \frac{100}{3}$ and $y = \frac{40}{3}$ into the expression $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$, we get
$$5\left(\frac{100}{3}\right)^2+5\left(\frac{40}{3}\right)^2-8\left(\frac{100}{3}\right)\left(\frac{40}{3}\right) = -\frac{8000}{3}.$$
2) If $y-x = 20$, then $y = x + 20$. Substituting this into the expression $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$, we get
$$5x^2+5(x+20)^2-8x(x+20) = 5x^2+5(x^2+40x+400)-8x^2-160x = -3x^2-200x+2000.$$
To minimize this expression, we can find its derivative and set it equal to 0:
$$-6x - 200 = 0 \Rightarrow x = -\frac{200}{6} = -\frac{100}{3}.$$
Substituting this value of $x$ into the equation $y = x + 20$, we get $y = -\frac{100}{3} + 20 = \frac{20}{3}$.

Now, substitute $x = -\frac{100}{3}$ and $y = \frac{20}{3}$ into the expression $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$, we get
$$5\left(-\frac{100}{3}\right)^2+5\left(\frac{20}{3}\right)^2-8\left(-\frac{100}{3}\right)\left(\frac{20}{3}\right) = -\frac{8000}{3}.$$
In both cases, we find that the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ is $-\frac{8000}{3}$. Since this value is negative, the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ must be 0, when the expression inside the absolute value is zero. Thus, the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ under the constraint $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$ is 0.
The answer is: $0$

Question (hint: positive numerical answer):
"What is the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ when $x$ and $y$ range over all real numbers such that $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$?"
Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:


We are given the equation $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$.
We can rewrite this as $|2y-x| + |2x-y| = 40$.
Using the property of absolute value $|a-b| = |b-a|$, we can simplify this to $|2y-x| + |x-2y| = 40$.
This equation is always true for all real numbers $x$ and $y$, so the condition $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$ is always true.
Now we need to find the minimum value of the expression $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$.
We can rewrite this as $5(x^2+y^2)-8xy$.
Using the formula $(a-b)^2 = a^2 - 2ab + b^2$, we can rewrite $5(x^2+y^2)-8xy$ as $5[(x-y)^2 + 2xy] - 8xy$.
Simplifying further, we get $5(x-y)^2 + 2xy - 8xy = 5(x-y)^2 - 6xy$.
Now we want to minimize $5(x-y)^2 - 6xy$.
We know that $(x-y)^2$ and $xy$ are always non-negative.
Therefore, the minimum value of $5(x-y)^2 - 6xy$ occurs when $x=y$.
When $x=y$, the expression $5(x-y)^2 - 6xy$ simplifies to $5(0)^2 - 6x^2 = -6x^2$.
So the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ is $-6x^2$.
To find the actual minimum value, we need to find the value of $x$ (or $y$) that minimizes $-6x^2$.
This occurs when $x=0$ (or $y=0$).
Substituting $x=0$ into the expression $-6x^2$, we get $-6(0)^2 = 0$.
Therefore, the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ is 0. The answer is: 0

Question (hint: positive numerical answer):
"What is the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ when $x$ and $y$ range over all real numbers such that $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$?"
Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:


First, we notice that $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$ can be rewritten as $|x-2y| + |2y-x| = 40$.
By the triangle inequality, $|a| + |b| \geq |a+b|$, so $|x-2y| + |2y-x| \geq |(x-2y) + (2y-x)| = 0$.
The only way for the sum of two absolute values to equal 0 is if both absolute values are 0.
So we have $x-2y = 0$ and $2y-x = 0$, which means $x = 2y$.
Substituting $x = 2y$ into the expression $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$, we get $5(2y)^2+5y^2-8(2y)(y) = 20y^2+5y^2-16y^2 = 9y^2$.
Since $y^2$ is always nonnegative, the minimum value of $9y^2$ is 0, which occurs when $y = 0$.
Substituting $y = 0$ into $x = 2y$, we get $x = 0$.
Thus, the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ is $9 \cdot 0^2 = 0$.
The answer is: 0.

Question (hint: positive numerical answer):
"What is the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ when $x$ and $y$ range over all real numbers such that $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$?"
Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:


First, let's simplify the given expression $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$.
We can rewrite it as $(5x^2-8xy+5y^2)$, which can be factored as $(5x^2-10xy+5y^2+2xy)$.
The first three terms form a perfect square: $(5x^2-10xy+5y^2) = (5(x-y)^2)$.
So the expression becomes $(5(x-y)^2+2xy)$.
Now let's consider the constraint equation $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$.
We can rewrite it as $|x-2y| + |2y-x| = 40$, which simplifies to $2|x-2y| = 40$, or $|x-2y| = 20$.
This means that $x-2y = 20$ or $x-2y = -20$.
Without loss of generality, let's consider the case $x-2y = 20$.
Then we have $x = 2y + 20$.
Substitute this into the expression $(5(x-y)^2+2xy)$, we get
\[(5((2y+20)-y)^2+2(2y+20)y) = (5(y+20)^2+4y^2+40y) = 5(y^2+40y+400)+4y^2+40y = 5y^2+200y+2000+4y^2+40y = 9y^2+240y+2000.\]
Now we want to minimize this expression.
To find the minimum, we can find the derivative and set it equal to zero.
The derivative of $9y^2+240y+2000$ with respect to $y$ is $18y+240$.
Setting this equal to zero, we have $18y+240=0$, or $y=-\frac{240}{18}=-\frac{40}{3}$.
Substitute this back into $x = 2y + 20$, we get $x = 2(-\frac{40}{3}) + 20 = -\frac{80}{3} + 20 = \frac{20}{3}$.
Finally, substitute $x = \frac{20}{3}$ and $y = -\frac{40}{3}$ into the expression $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$, we get
\[5(\frac{20}{3})^2 + 5(-\frac{40}{3})^2 - 8(\frac{20}{3})(-\frac{40}{3}) = \frac{2000}{9} + \frac{8000}{9} + \frac{6400}{9} = \frac{17400}{9} = \frac{5800}{3}.\]
Therefore, the minimum value of the expression $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ is $\frac{5800}{3}$.
The answer is: $\frac{5800}{3}$

Question (hint: positive numerical answer):
"What is the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ when $x$ and $y$ range over all real numbers such that $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$?"
Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:


The given expression is $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$. We can rewrite this as $(5x^2-8xy+5y^2)$. We recognize that $(5x^2-8xy+5y^2)$ is a perfect square trinomial, specifically $( \sqrt{5}x - \sqrt{5}y)^2$. Therefore, $(5x^2-8xy+5y^2) = (\sqrt{5}x - \sqrt{5}y)^2 \geq 0$.

Now let's consider the condition $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$. We can rewrite this as $|x-2y| + |2y-x| = 40$. Using the property $|a| = |-a|$, we can simplify this to $|x-2y| + |-1*(x-2y)| = 40$, which further simplifies to $|x-2y| + |2y-x| = 40$, and finally $|x-2y| + |2y-x| = 40$.

Using the property $|a| + |-a| = 2|a|$, we can rewrite the equation as $2|x-2y| = 40$, and then $|x-2y| = 20$. The absolute value equation has two solutions: $x - 2y = 20$ or $x - 2y = -20$.

We can analyze each case separately:

1) If $x - 2y = 20$, then $y = \frac{x - 20}{2}$. Substituting this into the expression $( \sqrt{5}x - \sqrt{5}y)^2$, we get $(\sqrt{5}x - \sqrt{5}\frac{x - 20}{2})^2 = (\sqrt{5}x - \frac{\sqrt{5}x}{2} + \sqrt{5}*10)^2 = (\frac{\sqrt{5}x}{2} + \sqrt{5}*10)^2$.

2) If $x - 2y = -20$, then $y = \frac{x + 20}{2}$. Substituting this into the expression $(\sqrt{5}x - \sqrt{5}y)^2$, we get $(\sqrt{5}x - \sqrt{5}\frac{x + 20}{2})^2 = (\sqrt{5}x - \frac{\sqrt{5}x}{2} - \sqrt{5}*10)^2 = (\frac{\sqrt{5}x}{2} - \sqrt{5}*10)^2$.

In both cases, the expression becomes a perfect square, and since a perfect square is always non-negative, the minimum value of $( \sqrt{5}x - \sqrt{5}y)^2$ is 0. But since the minimum value of $( \sqrt{5}x - \sqrt{5}y)^2$ is 0, the minimum value of the original expression $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ is also 0.

Therefore, the minimum value of the given expression when $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$ is 0. The answer is: $0$
