Assistant:

 The equation \[\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}\] has $4$ distinct solutions. 

Let's first consider the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=k$, where $k$ is a positive constant. This equation has $4$ distinct solutions if and only if $0<k<1$. This is because the function $f(x) = \vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert$ is a piecewise linear function with slope of $1$ for $x<1$, slope of $-1$ for $1<x<3$, and slope of $1$ for $x>3$. So, the equation $f(x) = k$ has $4$ distinct solutions when $0<k<1$.

Therefore, we need to find the value of $m$ such that $\frac{m}{100}$ is in the interval $(0,1)$. This gives us $0<\frac{m}{100}<1$, which simplifies to $0<m<100$.

However, $m$ is a positive integer, so the only positive integers $m$ that satisfy this inequality are $m=1,2,...,99$. So, there are $99$ possible values of $m$ for which the given equation has $4$ distinct solutions.
The answer is: $99$.

 The given equation is $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$, and we want to find the number of positive integers $m$ such that the equation has $4$ distinct solutions.

First, let's understand the behavior of the expression on the left-hand side (LHS) of the equation. The expression $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert$ is a "hump" function that goes from $0$ to $2$ as $x$ goes from $1$ to $3$, and then goes from $2$ to $0$ as $x$ goes from $3$ to $5$. Thus, the LHS is equal to $\frac{m}{100}$ for four distinct values of $x$.

To have four distinct solutions, the height of the "hump" must be equal to $\frac{m}{100}$. This means that $\frac{m}{100} = 1$, so $m = 100$. Thus, there is only one positive integer $m$ for which the equation has four distinct solutions, and that is $m = 100$. The answer is: $1$

Assistant:

 First, let's understand the problem. We are given an equation with absolute values and we are asked to find the number of positive integers $m$ for which the equation has 4 distinct solutions.

The equation is $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$.

The absolute value function makes the equation a bit complicated, but we can simplify it by considering the different cases for the inner absolute value $\vert x-1 \vert -2$. This function will be zero or positive when $\vert x-1 \vert \geq 2$, and negative when $\vert x-1 \vert < 2$. So we can divide the problem into three cases:

1. $\vert x-1 \vert \geq 2$: In this case, the equation becomes $\vert x-1 \vert -2 = \frac{m}{100}$, which simplifies to $\vert x-1 \vert = \frac{m}{100} + 2$. This gives us two sub-cases:

   a) $x-1 \geq 2$, so $x \geq 3$. The equation becomes $x-1 = \frac{m}{100} + 2$, or $x = \frac{m}{100} + 3$.
   
   b) $x-1 < 2$, so $x < 3$. The equation becomes $1-x = \frac{m}{100} + 2$, or $x = 1 - \frac{m}{100} - 2$, or $x = -1 - \frac{m}{100}$.
   
2. $\vert x-1 \vert < 2$ but $\vert x-1 \vert > 0$: This gives us $0 < x-1 < 2$, or $1 < x < 3$. In this case, the equation becomes $\vert x-1 \vert -2 = -\frac{m}{100}$, or $\vert x-1 \vert = 2 - \frac{m}{100}$. This gives us two sub-cases:

   a) $x-1 \geq 0$, so $x \geq 1$. The equation becomes $x-1 = 2 - \frac{m}{100}$, or $x = 3 - \frac{m}{100}$.
   
   b) $x-1 < 0$, so $x < 1$. The equation becomes $1-x = 2 - \frac{m}{100}$, or $x = \frac{m}{100} - 1$.
   
3. $\vert x-1 \vert < 0$: In this case, the equation is not possible because the left hand side is always non-negative while the right hand side is negative for $m > 0$.

Now we need to find the values of $m$ for which the four distinct solutions exist. This will happen when the graphs of the four lines (from the four cases) intersect each other in four distinct points.

After plotting the four lines and analyzing their intersection points, we find that the four lines intersect each other in four distinct points when $1 < m < 400$. So the number of positive integers $m$ for which the equation has 4 distinct solutions is the number of integers from 1 to 400, not inclusive. This is 400 - 1 = 399. But since we only want positive integers $m$, the number of positive integers $m$ is 399.
The answer is: $399$.

Assistant:

 To solve this problem, we first need to understand the structure of the equation \[\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}.\] This equation has four distinct solutions if and only if $\frac{m}{100}$ is less than $2$ and greater than $0$. This is because the expression on the left side of the equation, $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert$, varies between $0$ and $2$ when $x$ varies over the real numbers. So $\frac{m}{100}$ must be in this interval to allow for four distinct solutions. In other words, $0 < \frac{m}{100} < 2$, which simplifies to $0 < m < 200$.

Since $m$ is a positive integer, the possible values of $m$ are the integers from $1$ to $199$. Therefore, there are $199$ possible values of $m$ that make the equation have four distinct solutions. However, we are asked to find the number of positive integers $m$ such that the equation has four distinct solutions. This is equivalent to the number of positive integers from $1$ to $199$.

The number of positive integers from $1$ to $199$ is $199$. Therefore, the number of positive integers $m$ for which the equation has four distinct solutions is $199$.
The answer is: $199$.

 The equation has four distinct solutions, which means the right side of the equation, $\frac{m}{100}$, must be equal to $2$ or $3$ for the absolute value equation to have four distinct solutions.
If $\frac{m}{100}=2$, then $m=200$.
If $\frac{m}{100}=3$, then $m=300$.
Therefore, there are only two possible values for $m$. The answer is: $2$

Assistant:


The problem is asking for the number of positive integers $m$ for which the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has four distinct solutions. 

Firstly, we know that the absolute value function $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert$ will be equal to a non-negative number. Thus, the right hand side of the equation $\frac{m}{100}$ must also be non-negative, which implies $m \ge 0$.

Secondly, the absolute value function $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert$ can take on a value from $0$ to $3$ only. This is because the inner absolute value $\vert x-1 \vert$ can take on a value from $0$ to $+\infty$, and $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert$ can shrink this range to $0$ to $2$, and then expand it to $0$ to $3$ by taking the absolute value again.

So, we need to find out for which $m$ the equation $\frac{m}{100}$ falls into the range $(0, 3)$. This means $0 < \frac{m}{100} < 3$, which simplifies to $0 < m < 300$. 

Since $m$ must be a positive integer, the possible values of $m$ are the integers from $1$ to $299$.

However, we want the number of these integers that make the equation have four distinct solutions. 

By examining the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$, we can see that the right hand side determines the number of solutions. Specifically, the right hand side $\frac{m}{100}$ determines the "gap" between the two "branches" of the absolute value function $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert$. When this gap is $1$, the equation has four distinct solutions.

By trial and error, we can find that this happens when $m=100$. 

So, the only such positive integer $m$ is $100$. Therefore, the number of such $m$ is $1$. The answer is: $1$. The answer is: $1$. The answer is: $1$
The answer is: $1$

Assistant:

 The equation has 4 distinct solutions, so the right side of the equation, $\frac{m}{100}$, must be equal to either $2$, $1$, or $0$.
If $\frac{m}{100} = 2$, then $m = 200$.
If $\frac{m}{100} = 1$, then $m = 100$.
If $\frac{m}{100} = 0$, then $m = 0$.
However, $m$ must be a positive integer, so $m$ cannot be $0$.
Therefore, the only possible values for $m$ are $100$ and $200$.
However, $m$ must also satisfy the condition that the equation has 4 distinct solutions.
To determine if these values of $m$ satisfy this condition, we need to solve the equation for each value of $m$.
For $m = 100$, the equation becomes: \[\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{100}{100} = 1.\]
This simplifies to $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=1$.
Let's solve this equation in two steps.
First, we solve $\vert x-1 \vert -2 = 1$.
Adding $2$ to both sides gives $\vert x-1 \vert = 3$.
This splits into two cases:
1) $x-1 = 3$ gives $x = 4$.
2) $x-1 = -3$ gives $x = -2$.
Next, we solve $\vert x-1 \vert -2 = -1$.
Adding $2$ to both sides gives $\vert x-1 \vert = 1$.
This splits into two more cases:
3) $x-1 = 1$ gives $x = 2$.
4) $x-1 = -1$ gives $x = 0$.
Therefore, for $m = 100$, the equation has 4 distinct solutions: $x = 0, 2, -2, 4$.

For $m = 200$, the equation becomes: \[\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{200}{100} = 2.\]
This simplifies to $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=2$.
Let's solve this equation in two steps.
First, we solve $\vert x-1 \vert -2 = 2$.
Adding $2$ to both sides gives $\vert x-1 \vert = 4$.
This splits into two cases:
1) $x-1 = 4$ gives $x = 5$.
2) $x-1 = -4$ gives $x = -3$.
Next, we solve $\vert x-1 \vert -2 = -2$.
Adding $2$ to both sides gives $\vert x-1 \vert = 0$.
This implies $x-1 = 0$, so $x = 1$.
Therefore, for $m = 200$, the equation has 3 distinct solutions: $x = 1, -3, 5$.

Since the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ can only have 4 distinct solutions when $m = 100$, the number of positive integers $m$ for which the equation has 4 distinct solutions is 1. The answer is: $1$

Assistant:

 The equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has $4$ distinct solutions. 
We know that $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert$ is a positive quantity and is always greater than or equal to $0$. 
So $\frac{m}{100}$ must also be greater than or equal to $0$, which implies $m \geq 0$. 

The left side of the equation, $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert$, is a piecewise function. 
We can break it down into cases based on the value of $x$.

1. If $x < 1$, then $\vert x-1 \vert = -(x-1) = 1-x$. So the equation becomes $\vert 1-x-2 \vert = \vert -x-1 \vert = \vert x+1 \vert = \frac{m}{100}$. This gives us two sub-cases:

   a) If $x+1 \geq 0$, then $x \geq -1$. So the equation becomes $\vert x+1 \vert = x+1 = \frac{m}{100}$.
   b) If $x+1 < 0$, then $x < -1$. So the equation becomes $\vert x+1 \vert = -(x+1) = -x-1 = \frac{m}{100}$.

2. If $1 \leq x \leq 3$, then $\vert x-1 \vert = x-1$. So the equation becomes $\vert x-1-2 \vert = \vert x-3 \vert = \frac{m}{100}$. This gives us two sub-cases:

   a) If $x-3 \geq 0$, then $x \geq 3$. So the equation becomes $\vert x-3 \vert = x-3 = \frac{m}{100}$.
   b) If $x-3 < 0$, then $x < 3$. So the equation becomes $\vert x-3 \vert = -(x-3) = -x+3 = \frac{m}{100}$.

3. If $x > 3$, then $\vert x-1 \vert = x-1$. So the equation becomes $\vert x-1-2 \vert = \vert x-3 \vert = \frac{m}{100}$, which is the same as in the second case.

So, for each value of $x$, we have a corresponding equation. We need to find the values of $m$ that make these equations have $4$ distinct solutions.

For each sub-case, the equation simplifies to a linear equation in $x$, and the number of distinct solutions of this linear equation depends on the value of $\frac{m}{100}$. 

We can check each sub-case and find the values of $m$ that give $4$ distinct solutions.

After checking all sub-cases, we find that $m=100$ is the only value that gives $4$ distinct solutions. 

So the number of positive integers $m$ that satisfy the given condition is $1$. The answer is: $1$
