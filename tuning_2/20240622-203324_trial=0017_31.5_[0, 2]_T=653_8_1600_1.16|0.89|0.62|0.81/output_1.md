 To solve this problem, we will first try to simplify the expression $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ and then analyze the condition $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$.

Let's start by writing the expression $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ in the form $(a - b)^2 + c$, where $a$ and $b$ are expressions of $x$ and $y$, and $c$ is a constant. We can rewrite the expression as follows:

$5x^2+5y^2-8xy = (x^2 - 4xy + 4y^2) + (y^2 - 4xy + 4x^2) - 8xy + 40 = (x - 2y)^2 + (y - 2x)^2 - 8xy + 40$.

Now let's analyze the condition $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$. Since $|a| + |b| = |a+b| + |a-b|$, we have $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = |(x-2y) + (y-2x)| + |(x-2y) - (y-2x)| = |x-2y + y - 2x| + |x-2y - y + 2x| = |-x - y| + |x - y| = 40$.

So, the given condition implies that $|-x - y| + |x - y| = 40$. This is a well-known inequality, and it can be shown that the minimum value of $|-x - y| + |x - y|$ is achieved when $x = y$.

Substituting $x = y$ into the expression $(x - 2y)^2 + (y - 2x)^2 - 8xy + 40$, we get $(x - 2x)^2 + (x - 2x)^2 - 8x^2 + 40 = 0 + 0 - 8x^2 + 40 = -8x^2 + 40$.

To minimize this expression, we should maximize $x^2$. Since $x$ and $y$ are real numbers, the maximum value of $x^2$ is achieved when $x = y = 0$, and $x^2 = 0$. Substituting $x = 0$ into the expression $-8x^2 + 40$, we get $-8*0^2 + 40 = 40$.

Therefore, the minimum value of the expression $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ under the condition $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$ is $40$.
The answer is: $40$

 To solve this problem, we can use the Cauchy-Schwarz inequality. First, let's rewrite the expression $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ as $(x-2y)^2 + (y-2x)^2 - 4xy$. Now, we can use the given condition $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$ to find the minimum value of the expression.

The Cauchy-Schwarz inequality states that for any real numbers $a_1, a_2, ..., a_n$ and $b_1, b_2, ..., b_n$, we have
\[(a_1b_1 + a_2b_2 + ... + a_nb_n)^2 \leq (a_1^2 + a_2^2 + ... + a_n^2)(b_1^2 + b_2^2 + ... + b_n^2).\]
Applying this inequality to our problem, we let $a_1 = x - 2y$, $a_2 = y - 2x$, $b_1 = 1$, and $b_2 = 1$. Then we have
\[((x - 2y) + (y - 2x))^2 \leq ((x - 2y)^2 + (y - 2x)^2)(1^2 + 1^2).\]
Simplifying, we get
\[(0)^2 \leq ((x - 2y)^2 + (y - 2x)^2)(2).\]
Thus, $(x - 2y)^2 + (y - 2x)^2 \geq 0$.

Now, let's go back to our expression $(x-2y)^2 + (y-2x)^2 - 4xy$. We know that $(x-2y)^2 + (y-2x)^2 \geq 0$, and therefore, $(x-2y)^2 + (y-2x)^2 - 4xy \leq 0$.

Therefore, the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ is 0, which is achieved when $(x - 2y)^2 = 0$ and $(y - 2x)^2 = 0$. This happens when $x = 2y$ and $y = 2x$. Solving these equations simultaneously, we find that $x = 4$ and $y = 2$.

Thus, the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ is 0 when $x = 4$ and $y = 2$. However, this solution does not satisfy the condition $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$. So we need to find another solution that satisfies the condition.

Let's try another approach. From the equation $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$, we can try to find the minimum value of the expression $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ by setting the partial derivatives of the expression with respect to $x$ and $y$ to zero. 

Let $f(x, y) = 5x^2+5y^2-8xy$. Then the partial derivatives are:
\[\frac{\partial f}{\partial x} = 10x - 8y,\]
\[\frac{\partial f}{\partial y} = 10y - 8x.\]
Setting these to zero, we get the system of equations:
\[10x - 8y = 0,\]
\[10y - 8x = 0.\]
Simplifying, we get $x = \frac{4}{5}y$ and $y = \frac{4}{5}x$. Substituting one into the other, we find that $x = 4$ and $y = 2$.

Now we can substitute these values into the expression $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$:
\[5(4)^2+5(2)^2-8(4)(2) = 80 - 64 = 16.\]
So the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ when $x$ and $y$ range over all real numbers such that $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$ is 16.

Therefore, the answer is $\boxed{16}$.
The minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ is 16.
The answer is: $16$

To accomplish this, first list the problem's constraints, conditions and related knowledge, and thens solve the problem step by step. Be clear so even an idiot can follow your instructions. After solving the problem, output the final numerical answer within \boxed{}.

 The problem's constraints, conditions, and related knowledge are:

1. The constraint equation is $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$.
2. The function to be minimized is $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$.

We will first manipulate the constraint equation to get a relationship between $x$ and $y$.

Since $|a| = |-a|$, we can rewrite the constraint equation as $|x-2y| + |2x-y| = 40$.

Expanding the absolute value expressions, we have two cases to consider:

Case 1: $x-2y \ge 0$ and $2x-y \ge 0$. In this case, the constraint equation becomes $(x-2y) + (2x-y) = 40$, which simplifies to $3x - 3y = 40$, or $x - y = \frac{40}{3}$.

Case 2: $x-2y < 0$ and $2x-y < 0$. In this case, the constraint equation becomes $-(x-2y) - (2x-y) = 40$, which simplifies to $-3x + 3y = 40$, or $x - y = -\frac{40}{3}$.

From these two cases, we see that $x - y = \pm \frac{40}{3}$.

Now, we substitute $y = x \pm \frac{40}{3}$ into the function to be minimized:

$$5x^2 + 5(x \pm \frac{40}{3})^2 - 8x(x \pm \frac{40}{3})$$

Expanding and simplifying, we get:

$$5x^2 + 5(x^2 \pm \frac{80x}{3} + \frac{1600}{9}) - 8x^2 \mp \frac{320x}{3}$$

$$= 5x^2 + 5x^2 \pm \frac{400x}{3} + \frac{800}{3} - 8x^2 \mp \frac{320x}{3}$$

$$= (10x^2 - 8x^2) \pm (\frac{400x}{3} - \frac{320x}{3}) + \frac{800}{3}$$

$$= 2x^2 \pm \frac{80x}{3} + \frac{800}{3}$$

Now, we complete the square for the quadratic expression:

$$= 2(x^2 \pm \frac{40x}{3} + (\frac{20}{3})^2) - 2(\frac{20}{3})^2 + \frac{800}{3}$$

$$= 2(x \pm \frac{20}{3})^2 - \frac{800}{9} + \frac{800}{3}$$

$$= 2(x \pm \frac{20}{3})^2 + \frac{800}{9}$$

Since the square of a real number is always non-negative, the minimum value of the function occurs when $(x \pm \frac{20}{3})^2 = 0$, which means $x = \mp \frac{20}{3}$.

Substituting $x = \mp \frac{20}{3}$ back into $x - y = \pm \frac{40}{3}$, we get $y = \mp \frac{20}{3}$.

Thus, the minimum value of the function occurs at $x = -\frac{20}{3}$ and $y = -\frac{20}{3}$.

Substituting these values into the function, we get:

$$2(-\frac{20}{3})^2 + \frac{800}{9} = \frac{800}{9}.$$

Therefore, the minimum value of the function $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ subject to the constraint $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$ is $\frac{800}{9}$. The answer is: $800/9$

"What is the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ when $x$ and $y$ range over all real numbers such that $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$?"

 To solve this problem, we first note that the condition $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$ is always true.
This can be seen by expanding the absolute values and simplifying.
So, we can ignore this condition and focus on minimizing the expression $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$.

The expression can be rewritten as $5(x^2 + y^2) - 8xy = 5[(x - y)^2 + 2xy] - 8xy$.
Now, we can rewrite $2xy$ as $(x - y)^2 - (x^2 + y^2)$ to get $5[(x - y)^2 + (x - y)^2 - (x^2 + y^2)] - 8xy = 10(x - y)^2 - 5(x^2 + y^2) - 8xy$.

Now, let's denote $a = x - y$ and $b = x + y$. Then we can rewrite the expression as $10a^2 - 5(a^2 + b^2) - 4ab = 5a^2 - 5b^2 - 4ab$.

We can now apply the AM-GM inequality to minimize the expression. The AM-GM inequality states that the arithmetic mean of a set of non-negative numbers is always greater than or equal to their geometric mean. In other words, if $x$ and $y$ are non-negative, then $(x + y)/2 \geq \sqrt{xy}$. Squaring both sides gives $(x + y)^2/4 \geq xy$, or $xy \leq (x + y)^2/4$.

Applying this to our expression, we have $5a^2 - 5b^2 - 4ab \geq 5a^2 - 5b^2 - 4(b^2/4) = 5a^2 - 5b^2 - b^2 = 5a^2 - 6b^2$.

Since $a^2$ and $b^2$ are both non-negative, the minimum value of the expression is achieved when $a = 0$ and $b = 0$, in which case the expression equals 0.
However, $a = 0$ and $b = 0$ implies $x = y$, which doesn't satisfy the condition $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$.
So, we need to find another way to minimize the expression.

Notice that the expression is quadratic in $a$ and $b$. We can complete the square to find its minimum value.
First, rewrite the expression as $5a^2 - 6b^2 - 4ab = 5(a^2 - \frac{4}{5}ab + (\frac{2}{5}b)^2) - 6b^2 - 5(\frac{2}{5}b)^2 = 5(a - \frac{2}{5}b)^2 - 6b^2 - \frac{4}{5}b^2 = 5(a - \frac{2}{5}b)^2 - \frac{24}{5}b^2$.

Since $(a - \frac{2}{5}b)^2$ and $b^2$ are both non-negative, the minimum value of the expression is achieved when $a - \frac{2}{5}b = 0$ and $b = 0$.
This gives $a = 0$, which implies $x = y$. Again, this doesn't satisfy the condition.

However, we can try a different approach. Notice that the condition $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$ is equivalent to $|x-2y| = |y-2x| = 20$.
This implies that $x - 2y = \pm (y - 2x)$, or $(x - 2y)(y - 2x) = 0$.
Expanding, we get $xy - 2x^2 - 2y^2 + 4xy = 0$, or $5xy - 2(x^2 + y^2) = 0$.
Multiplying by 2, we get $10xy - 4(x^2 + y^2) = 0$, or $10xy = 4(x^2 + y^2)$.
Dividing by $x^2 + y^2$, we get $10\frac{xy}{x^2 + y^2} = 4$, or $\frac{xy}{x^2 + y^2} = \frac{2}{5}$.
This means that the expression $\frac{xy}{x^2 + y^2}$ is always equal to $\frac{2}{5}$.

Now, let's substitute this into our expression $5(x - y)^2 - 5(x^2 + y^2) - 4ab$.
We have $5(x - y)^2 - 5(x^2 + y^2) - 4ab = 5(x - y)^2 - 5(x^2 + y^2) - 4\cdot \frac{2}{5}(x^2 + y^2) = 5(x - y)^2 - \frac{9}{5}(x^2 + y^2)$.

Again, since $(x - y)^2$ and $(x^2 + y^2)$ are both non-negative, the minimum value of the expression is achieved when $x - y = 0$, or $x = y$.
In this case, the expression simplifies to $- \frac{9}{5}(2x^2) = - \frac{18}{5}x^2$.

Since $x = y$, we can substitute $x$ for $y$ in the condition $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$, which gives $|x-2x| + |x-2x| = 40$, or $| - x| + | - x| = 40$, or $2|x| = 40$, or $|x| = 20$.
Since $x$ is real, this implies $x = \pm 20$. Taking $x = 20$, we get $y = 20$, and substituting into the expression $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$, we get $5(20)^2 + 5(20)^2 - 8(20)(20) = 2000 + 2000 - 3200 = 800$.
Taking $x = -20$, we get $y = -20$, and substituting into the expression, we get $5(-20)^2 + 5(-20)^2 - 8(-20)(-20) = 2000 + 2000 - 3200 = 800$.

Therefore, the minimum value of the expression $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ when

 The problem seems to be too complex to solve with a simple Python code, especially with the constraint $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$. However, it seems that the function $f(x, y) = 5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ reaches its minimum value when $x = y$. In this case, the function simplifies to $f(x, x) = 10x^2 - 16x^2 = -6x^2$.

To find the minimum value of $f(x, y)$ with the constraint $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$, we can first simplify the constraint. We have $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = |x-2y| + |2y-x| = 40$. Since the absolute values of two expressions are equal, the expressions themselves must be equal or opposite. So we have two cases to consider:
1. $x - 2y = 2y - x$, which simplifies to $4y = 2x$, or $x = 2y$.
2. $x - 2y = -(2y - x)$, which simplifies to $x - 2y = -2y + x$, which does not give us any new information.

So we have $x = 2y$. Now we can substitute this into the constraint equation: $|x - 2x| + |y - 2y| = | -x | + | -y | = x + y = 40$. Since $x = 2y$, we have $3y = 40$, so $y = \frac{40}{3}$. Then $x = 2y = \frac{80}{3}$.

Now we can substitute $x = \frac{80}{3}$ and $y = \frac{40}{3}$ into the function $f(x, y)$:

The minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ is $-6x^2$, but we need to find the minimum value of $f(x, y) = 5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ with the constraint $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$. After simplifying the constraint and finding that $x = 2y$, we substitute $x = \frac{80}{3}$ and $y = \frac{40}{3}$ into the function to get the minimum value of $f(x, y)$, which is $1600$. However, since $x = \frac{80}{3}$ and $y = \frac{40}{3}$ do not satisfy the original constraint $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$, we must have made a mistake in our calculations.

Let's try another approach. The function $f(x, y) = 5x^2+5y^2-8xy = 5(x^2 + y^2) - 8xy$ is a quadratic function, and its graph is a paraboloid opening downward. Therefore, the minimum value of $f(x, y)$ will occur at the vertex of the paraboloid. The vertex of a parabola $ax^2 + bx + c$ is given by the point $(-\frac{b}{2a}, f(-\frac{b}{2a}))$. For the function $f(x, y)$, the coordinates of the vertex are given by $(-\frac{8y}{2*5}, f(-\frac{8y}{2*5}))$.

Now, we need to find the value of $y$ that makes the constraint $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$ true, and then substitute this value into the vertex formula to find the minimum value of $f(x, y)$.

After some experimentation, we find that $y = \frac{20}{3}$ satisfies the constraint $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$. Then we substitute $y = \frac{20}{3}$ into the vertex formula to find the minimum value of $f(x, y)$:

```python

The minimum value of $f(x, y) = 5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ with the constraint $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$ is approximately $648.89$. However, this value does not seem to be correct. Let's try another approach.

We can use the method of Lagrange multipliers to find the minimum value of $f(x, y)$ with the constraint $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$. The method of Lagrange multipliers states that to find the minimum or maximum of a function $f(x, y)$ subject to the constraint $g(x, y) = 0$, we need to solve the system of equations $\nabla f(x, y) = \lambda \nabla g(x, y)$ and $g(x, y) = 0$, where $\lambda$ is the Lagrange multiplier.

For our problem, the function to be minimized is $f(x, y) = 5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ and the constraint is $g(x, y) = |x-2y| + |y-2x| - 40$. The gradient of $f(x, y)$ is $\nabla f(x, y) = (10x - 8y, 10y - 8x)$ and the gradient of $g(x, y)$ is difficult to compute directly. However, we can use the fact that $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$ implies $x = 2y$ or $y = 2x$. Let's consider these two cases separately.

Below is a math problem you are to solve (natural number answer):
"What is the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ when $x$ and $y$ range over all real numbers such that $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$?"
To accomplish this, first list the problem's constraints, conditions and related knowledge, and thens solve the problem step by step. Be clear so even an idiot can follow your instructions. After solving the problem, output the final numerical answer within \boxed{}.

Assistant:

 The problem's constraints are $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$. First, let's simplify the left side of the equation:
\[|x-2y| + |y-2x| = |x-2y| + |-(x-2y)| = |x-2y| + |2y-x|.\]
By the definition of absolute value, $|a| = |-a|$ for all real numbers $a$, so the equation is equivalent to
\[|x-2y| + |2y-x| = 40.\]
Now, let's express $x-2y$ and $2y-x$ as single absolute values:
\[|x-2y| + |2y-x| = |x-2y| + |-1\cdot(x-2y)| = |x-2y| + |-1|\cdot|x-2y| = |x-2y| + |x-2y| = 2|x-2y|.\]
So, the equation simplifies to $2|x-2y| = 40$. Dividing both sides by 2 gives $|x-2y| = 20$.

The constraints of the problem are now clear: $x$ and $y$ must satisfy $|x-2y| = 20$.

Now we want to minimize $f(x,y) = 5x^2+5y^2-8xy$. Let's complete the square to rewrite $f(x,y)$ in a form that will be easier to minimize:
\[f(x,y) = 5(x^2-8xy+16y^2) + 5(y^2-16y^2) = 5[(x-4y)^2-16y^2] + 5[-15y^2] = 5(x-4y)^2 - 80y^2 - 75y^2 = 5(x-4y)^2 - 155y^2.\]
To minimize $f(x,y)$, we want to minimize $5(x-4y)^2 - 155y^2$. Since $(x-4y)^2$ and $y^2$ are both nonnegative, the minimum value of $f(x,y)$ will occur when $(x-4y)^2 = 0$ and $y^2 = 0$. This happens when $x = 4y$ and $y = 0$. Solving these equations gives $x = 0$.

However, we must check if this solution satisfies the constraint $|x-2y| = 20$. Substituting $x = 0$ and $y = 0$ into the equation gives $|0-2\cdot0| = 0 \neq 20$, so $x = 0$ and $y = 0$ is not a valid solution.

Instead, let's substitute $x = 4y$ into the constraint equation:
\[|4y-2y| = 20 \implies |2y| = 20 \implies 2|y| = 20 \implies |y| = 10.\]
So $y = 10$ or $y = -10$. Substituting $y = 10$ into $x = 4y$ gives $x = 40$, and substituting $y = -10$ into $x = 4y$ gives $x = -40$. So the possible pairs $(x, y)$ that satisfy the constraint are $(40, 10)$ and $(-40, -10)$.

Now we substitute these pairs into the function $f(x,y) = 5x^2+5y^2-8xy$:
\[f(40,10) = 5(40^2) + 5(10^2) - 8(40)(10) = 8000 + 500 - 3200 = 5300,\]
\[f(-40,-10) = 5(-40^2) + 5(-10^2) - 8(-40)(-10) = -8000 + 500 + 3200 = -4300.\]
Comparing the values of $f(x,y)$ at these two points, we see that $f(-40,-10) = -4300$ is smaller than $f(40,10) = 5300$. Therefore, the minimum value of $f(x,y)$ is $-4300$. The answer is: $\boxed{-4300}$

Below is a math problem you are to solve (natural number answer):
"What is the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ when $x$ and $y$ range over all real numbers such that $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$?"
To accomplish this, first list the problem's constraints, conditions and related knowledge, and thens solve the problem step by step. Be clear so even an idiot can follow your instructions. After solving the problem, output the final numerical answer within \boxed{}.

Assistant:

 The problem's constraints are given by $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$.

Using the property $|a| + |b| = |a+b| + |a-b|/2$, we can rewrite the constraint as $|x-2y - (y-2x)| = |3x-3y| = 40 \Rightarrow x-2y = \pm 20$.

Now we solve for $y$ in terms of $x$: $y = \frac{x \pm 20}{3}$.

Substitute this into the expression we want to minimize: $5x^2+5y^2-8xy = 5x^2 + 5(\frac{x \pm 20}{3})^2 - 8x(\frac{x \pm 20}{3}) = 5x^2 + \frac{5(x^2 \pm 40x + 400)}{9} - \frac{8x(x \pm 20)}{3}$.

Simplify this expression: $5x^2 + \frac{5x^2 \pm 200x + 2000}{9} - \frac{8x^2 \pm 160x}{3} = \frac{45x^2 + 5x^2 \pm 200x + 2000 - 27x^2 \mp 480x}{9} = \frac{-17x^2 \mp 680x + 2000}{9}$.

Let $f(x) = -17x^2 \mp 680x + 2000$. We want to find the minimum value of $f(x)$ over the set of all $x$ such that $y = \frac{x \pm 20}{3}$.

Taking the derivative of $f(x)$ with respect to $x$ and setting it equal to zero gives: $f'(x) = -34x \mp 680 = 0 \Rightarrow x = \pm \frac{340}{17} = \pm 20$.

Since $y = \frac{x \pm 20}{3}$, we have two possible values for $x$ and $y$: $x = 20, y = \frac{40}{3}$ and $x = -20, y = -\frac{40}{3}$.

Substituting these values into $f(x)$ gives: $f(20) = -17(20)^2 - 680(20) + 2000 = -6800 - 13600 + 2000 = -20400$, and $f(-20) = -17(-20)^2 + 680(-20) + 2000 = -6800 - 13600 + 2000 = -20400$.

Therefore, the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ is $-20400$.
The answer is: $-20400$

Assistant:

 The problem states that $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$.
This equation simplifies to $|x-2y| + |2y-x| = 40$.
By the triangle inequality, $|a| + |b| \geq |a+b|$, we know that $|x-2y| + |2y-x| \geq |(x-2y) + (2y-x)| = |0| = 0$.
But $|x-2y| + |2y-x|$ is equal to $40$, so we must have equality, which means $x-2y$ and $2y-x$ must have the same sign.
If $x-2y > 0$ and $2y-x > 0$, then $x > 2y$ and $2y > x$, which is a contradiction.
If $x-2y < 0$ and $2y-x < 0$, then $x < 2y$ and $2y < x$, which is also a contradiction.
Therefore, we must have either $x-2y > 0$ and $2y-x < 0$, or $x-2y < 0$ and $2y-x > 0$.
The first case gives us $x > 2y$ and $x < 2y$, which is a contradiction.
The second case gives us $x < 2y$ and $x > 2y$, which is also a contradiction.
So we must have $x-2y = 0$ and $2y-x = 0$, which implies $x = 2y$.
Substitute $x = 2y$ into the equation $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$, we get $|2y-2y| + |y-4y| = 40$, which simplifies to $|0| + |-3y| = 40$.
So we have $|-3y| = 40$, which implies $3|y| = 40$, and $|y| = \frac{40}{3}$.
Therefore, $y = \pm \frac{40}{3}$.
If $y = \frac{40}{3}$, then $x = 2y = \frac{80}{3}$.
If $y = -\frac{40}{3}$, then $x = 2y = -\frac{80}{3}$.
We can now substitute these values of $x$ and $y$ into the expression $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$:
For $x = \frac{80}{3}$ and $y = \frac{40}{3}$, we have $5\left(\frac{80}{3}\right)^2 + 5\left(\frac{40}{3}\right)^2 - 8\left(\frac{80}{3}\right)\left(\frac{40}{3}\right)$.
For $x = -\frac{80}{3}$ and $y = -\frac{40}{3}$, we have $5\left(-\frac{80}{3}\right)^2 + 5\left(-\frac{40}{3}\right)^2 - 8\left(-\frac{80}{3}\right)\left(-\frac{40}{3}\right)$.
Both expressions simplify to the same value:
\[5\left(\frac{6400}{9}\right) + 5\left(\frac{1600}{9}\right) - 8\left(\frac{-3200}{9}\right) = \frac{32000}{9}.\]
Therefore, the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ when $x$ and $y$ satisfy the constraint is $\frac{32000}{9}$.
The answer is: $\boxed{\frac{32000}{9}}$
