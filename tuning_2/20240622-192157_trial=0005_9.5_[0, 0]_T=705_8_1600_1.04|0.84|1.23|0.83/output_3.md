"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"

Assistant:

 The problem's constraints, conditions, and related knowledge are as follows:

1. The equation is equal to zero, which means that the product of two terms is zero if and only if at least one of the terms is zero.
2. Therefore, we have two cases to consider: $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ and $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$.
3. For the first case, $\vert x + y \vert - 10 = 0$, which implies $\vert x + y \vert = 10$, and so $x + y = \pm 10$.
4. Similarly, for the second case, $\vert x - y \vert - 10 = 0$, which implies $\vert x - y \vert = 10$, and so $x - y = \pm 10$.
5. For the third case, $\vert x \vert - 8 = 0$, which implies $\vert x \vert = 8$, and so $x = \pm 8$.
6. For the fourth case, $\vert y \vert - 8 = 0$, which implies $\vert y \vert = 8$, and so $y = \pm 8$.
7. By combining these cases, we find that the points satisfying the equation are the vertices of a square with side length 10, centered at the origin, and with vertices at $(\pm 8, \pm 8)$.
8. The area of this square is $10^2 = 100$.

So, the area of the convex polygon is 100. The answer is: $100$

Below is a math problem you are to solve (natural number answer!):
"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"
Analyze the problem and think step by step to come to a solution with programs. After solving the problem, output the final numerical answer within \boxed{}.

Assistant:

 The given equation is of the form $f(x, y) = 0$, where $f(x, y) = ((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2)$. For the product of two quantities to be zero, either one of the quantities must be zero. Therefore, either $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$. 

The first equation implies that $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. This forms a square with side length $20$.
The second equation implies that $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$. This forms a square with side length $16$.

The area of the polygon is the sum of the areas of these two squares. The area of a square with side length $a$ is $a^2$, so the area of the polygon is $20^2 + 16^2 = 400 + 256 = 656$. The answer is: $656$ square units.

Below is a math problem you are to solve (natural number answer):
"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"
To accomplish this, first list the problem's constraints, conditions and related knowledge, and thens solve the problem step by step. Be clear so even an idiot can follow your instructions. After solving the problem, output the final numerical answer within \boxed{}.

Assistant:

 The problem's constraints, conditions and related knowledge are:

1. The equation is given as $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$.
2. For the product of two numbers to be zero, either one of them must be zero.
3. Therefore, we have two cases to consider: $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$.
4. For a square of a real number to be zero, the number itself must be zero. Hence, we have two sub-cases for each case:
   a. $\vert x + y \vert - 10 = 0$ and $\vert x - y \vert - 10 = 0$, or
   b. $\vert x \vert - 8 = 0$ and $\vert y \vert - 8 = 0$.
5. Solving the sub-cases gives us the coordinates of the vertices of the polygon.

Now, let's solve the problem step by step:

Case 1: $\vert x + y \vert - 10 = 0$ and $\vert x - y \vert - 10 = 0$.
This gives us $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. The solutions to these equations are:
- $x + y = 10$ and $x - y = 10$, which gives $x = 10$ and $y = 0$.
- $x + y = 10$ and $x - y = -10$, which gives $x = 0$ and $y = 10$.
- $x + y = -10$ and $x - y = 10$, which gives $x = -10$ and $y = 0$.
- $x + y = -10$ and $x - y = -10$, which gives $x = 0$ and $y = -10$.

Case 2: $\vert x \vert - 8 = 0$ and $\vert y \vert - 8 = 0$.
This gives us $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$. The solutions to these equations are:
- $x = 8$ and $y = 8$.
- $x = 8$ and $y = -8$.
- $x = -8$ and $y = 8$.
- $x = -8$ and $y = -8$.

The coordinates of the vertices of the polygon are:
- $(10, 0)$, $(0, 10)$, $(-10, 0)$, $(0, -10)$, $(8, 8)$, $(8, -8)$, $(-8, 8)$, and $(-8, -8)$.

The polygon is a square with side length 20. The area of the square is $20^2 = 400$.
The answer is: $400$

Below is a math problem you are to solve (natural number answer):
"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"

Assistant:

 The problem's constraints, conditions and related knowledge are as follows:

1. The expression $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$

2. The points $(x, y)$ that satisfy this equation are the ones that make either the first or the second factor equal to zero.

3. If the first factor is zero, then both $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ and $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$, which means $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. These two equations represent two lines in the plane.

4. If the second factor is zero, then both $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ and $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$, which means $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$. These two equations represent two squares in the plane.

5. The intersection of these lines and squares will form a convex polygon.

To find the area of this polygon, we first need to find the coordinates of the vertices of the polygon. The vertices are the points where the lines intersect the squares.

The lines $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$ intersect the squares $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$ at the following points:

- For $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x \vert = 8$:
  - When $x = 8$, $y = 2$ or $y = -18$.
  - When $x = -8$, $y = 18$ or $y = -2$.

- For $\vert x - y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x \vert = 8$:
  - When $x = 8$, $y = -2$ or $y = 18$.
  - When $x = -8$, $y = 2$ or $y = -18$.

- For $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$:
  - When $y = 8$, $x = 2$ or $x = -18$.
  - When $y = -8$, $x = 18$ or $x = -2$.

- For $\vert x - y \vert = 10$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$:
  - When $y = 8$, $x = -2$ or $x = 18$.
  - When $y = -8$, $x = 2$ or $x = -18$.

So, the vertices of the polygon are $(8, 2)$, $(8, -18)$, $(-8, 18)$, $(-8, -2)$, $(2, 8)$, $(-18, 8)$, $(18, -8)$, and $(-2, -8)$.

Now, we can find the area of the polygon. The polygon is a square with side length 16 (the maximum distance between any two vertices). The area of a square is side length squared, so the area of the polygon is $16^2 = 256$.
The answer is: $256$.

Assistant:

 The problem's constraints, conditions, and related knowledge are:

1. The equation is satisfied if either $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$, which implies $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ or $\vert x - y \vert = 10$.
2. The equation is also satisfied if either $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$, which implies $\vert x \vert = 8$ or $\vert y \vert = 8$.
3. The absolute value equations $\vert x + y \vert = 10$, $\vert x - y \vert = 10$, $\vert x \vert = 8$, and $\vert y \vert = 8$ represent four lines in the coordinate plane.
4. The intersection points of these lines form a rectangle.

Now, let's solve the problem step by step:

1. The lines $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$ form the diagonals of a rectangle. The lines $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$ form the sides of the rectangle.
2. The diagonals of a rectangle bisect each other, so the midpoint of the diagonals is the center of the rectangle.
3. The midpoint of the line segment connecting $(10, 0)$ and $(0, 10)$ is $\left(\frac{10+0}{2}, \frac{0+10}{2}\right) = (5, 5)$.
4. Similarly, the midpoint of the line segment connecting $(-10, 0)$ and $(0, -10)$ is $\left(\frac{-10+0}{2}, \frac{0-10}{2}\right) = (-5, -5)$.
5. The midpoints of the line segments connecting $(8, 0)$ and $(-8, 0)$, $(0, 8)$ and $(0, -8)$ are $(0, 0)$ and $(0, 0)$, respectively.
6. Therefore, the center of the rectangle is at the origin $(0, 0)$, and the lengths of the sides of the rectangle are 16 (from $-8$ to $8$ in both the $x$ and $y$ directions).
7. The area of the rectangle is the product of its side lengths, which is $16 \times 16 = 256$.

The answer is: $256$

Below is a math problem you are to solve (natural number answer):
"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"

Assistant:

 The given equation is $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$.

Since the product of two numbers is zero if and only if at least one of the numbers is zero, this equation is satisfied if either of the following conditions is met:
1. $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$.
2. $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$.

For the first condition to be true, both $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2$ and $( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2$ must be zero. This implies that $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. This is satisfied by the points on the lines $x + y = 10$ and $x - y = 10$ as well as their reflections across the coordinate axes.

For the second condition to be true, both $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2$ and $( \vert y \vert - 8)^2$ must be zero. This implies that $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$. This is satisfied by the points on the lines $x = 8$ and $y = 8$ as well as their reflections across the coordinate axes.

The intersection of these lines forms a square with side length 10, as the lines $x + y = 10$ and $x - y = 10$ are perpendicular and intersect at the point $(5, 5)$, and the lines $x = 8$ and $y = 8$ are also perpendicular and intersect at the point $(8, 8)$.

The area of this square is the square of the side length, which is $10^2 = 100$. So the area of the convex polygon formed by the points satisfying the given equation is 100 square units. The answer is: $100$

Assistant:

 The problem's constraints, conditions, and related knowledge are as follows:

1. The expression $A \cdot B = 0$ is true if and only if $A = 0$ or $B = 0$.
2. $\vert x \vert$ is the absolute value of $x$.
3. $\vert x + y \vert$, $\vert x - y \vert$, $\vert x \vert$, and $\vert y \vert$ are all nonnegative.
4. The square of a nonnegative number is also nonnegative.

Given the equation $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$, we can apply constraint 1 to get two separate cases:

Case 1: $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$.
From constraint 4, this is only possible if both $(\vert x + y \vert - 10) = 0$ and $(\vert x - y \vert - 10) = 0$. This implies that $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. The only way this can happen is if $x = y = 5$ or $x = -y = -5$.

Case 2: $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$.
From constraint 4, this is only possible if both $(\vert x \vert - 8) = 0$ and $(\vert y \vert - 8) = 0$. This implies that $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$. The only way this can happen is if $x = 8$ or $x = -8$, and $y = 8$ or $y = -8$.

Combining these two cases, the points that satisfy the equation are $(5, 5)$, $(-5, -5)$, $(8, 8)$, $(-8, -8)$, $(8, -8)$, and $(-8, 8)$. These points form a square with side length $10$.

The area of this square is the side length squared, so the area is $10^2 = 100$. The answer is: $100$

To accomplish this, first list the problem's constraints, conditions and related knowledge, and thens solve the problem step by step. Be clear so even an idiot can follow your instructions. After solving the problem, output the final numerical answer within \boxed{}.

Assistant:

 The given equation is $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$.

For the product of two numbers to be zero, either one of the numbers must be zero. So, we have two cases:

1. $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$. This means that both $\vert x + y \vert - 10 = 0$ and $\vert x - y \vert - 10 = 0$. Solving these two equations gives us $x + y = 10$ and $x - y = 10$ or $x + y = 10$ and $x - y = -10$. The first pair of equations gives us $x = 5$ and $y = 5$, and the second pair gives us $x = 0$ and $y = 10$ or $x = 10$ and $y = 0$. So, we have three points $(5, 5)$, $(0, 10)$, and $(10, 0)$ that satisfy this case.

2. $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$. This means that both $\vert x \vert - 8 = 0$ and $\vert y \vert - 8 = 0$. Solving these two equations gives us $x = 8$ and $y = 8$. So, we have one point $(8, 8)$ that satisfies this case.

Now, we have the vertices of the polygon: $(5, 5)$, $(0, 10)$, $(10, 0)$, and $(8, 8)$. To find the area of the polygon, we can use the Shoelace Formula. The Shoelace Formula states that if the vertices of a polygon are $(x_1, y_1)$, $(x_2, y_2)$, ..., $(x_n, y_n)$, then the area of the polygon is given by
$$\frac{1}{2} \vert (x_1y_2 + x_2y_3 + \cdots + x_ny_1) - (y_1x_2 + y_2x_3 + \cdots + y_nx_1) \vert.$$
Applying the Shoelace Formula to the vertices $(5, 5)$, $(0, 10)$, $(10, 0)$, and $(8, 8)$, we get
$$\frac{1}{2} \vert (5 \cdot 10 + 0 \cdot 0 + 10 \cdot 8 + 8 \cdot 5) - (10 \cdot 0 + 5 \cdot 10 + 0 \cdot 8 + 8 \cdot 5) \vert = \frac{1}{2} \vert (50 + 0 + 80 + 40) - (0 + 50 + 0 + 40) \vert = \frac{1}{2} \vert 170 - 90 \vert = \frac{1}{2} \cdot 80 = 40.$$
So, the area of the convex polygon is 40 square units. The answer is: $40$
