Below is a math problem you are to solve (natural number answer):
"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"
To accomplish this, first list the problem's constraints, conditions and related knowledge, and thens solve the problem step by step. Be clear so even an idiot can follow your instructions. After solving the problem, output the final numerical answer within \boxed{}.

Assistant:

 The problem's constraints, conditions and related knowledge are as follows:

1. The expression $AB = 0$ if and only if either $A = 0$ or $B = 0$.
2. $\vert x \vert$ is the absolute value of $x$. It equals $x$ if $x \geq 0$, and $-x$ if $x < 0$. Similarly for $\vert y \vert$.
3. The area of a rectangle is given by the product of its length and width.

Now, let's solve the problem step by step.

The equation $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + (\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ implies that $\vert x + y \vert - 10 = 0$ and $\vert x - y \vert - 10 = 0$. Thus, $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$.

This implies that $x + y = \pm 10$ and $x - y = \pm 10$. Solving these equations gives us the four points $(8,2)$, $(8,-2)$, $(-8,2)$, and $(-8,-2)$.

Similarly, the equation $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + (\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ implies that $\vert x \vert - 8 = 0$ and $\vert y \vert - 8 = 0$. Thus, $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$.

This implies that $x = \pm 8$ and $y = \pm 8$. Solving these equations gives us the four points $(8,8)$, $(8,-8)$, $(-8,8)$, and $(-8,-8)$.

The eight points $(8,2)$, $(8,-2)$, $(-8,2)$, $(-8,-2)$, $(8,8)$, $(8,-8)$, $(-8,8)$, and $(-8,-8)$ form a rectangle. The length of the rectangle is $16$ (from $-8$ to $8$ in the $x$-direction) and the width is $16$ (from $-8$ to $8$ in the $y$-direction).

Therefore, the area of the rectangle is $16 \times 16 = 256$. The answer is: $256$

Below is a math problem you are to solve (natural number answer!):
"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"
Analyze the problem and think step by step to come to a solution with programs. After solving the problem, output the final numerical answer within \boxed{}.

Assistant:

 The equation is satisfied only when both $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ and $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ and $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ and $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$.
From these equations, we get that $\vert x + y \vert = 10$, $\vert x - y \vert = 10$, $\vert x \vert = 8$, and $\vert y \vert = 8$.
This implies that $-10 \le x+y \le 10$, $-10 \le x-y \le 10$, $-8 \le x \le 8$, and $-8 \le y \le 8$.
The solution set is a square with side length 16, so the area of the square is $16^2 = 256$. The answer is: $256$

Below is a math problem you are to solve (natural number answer):
"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"
To accomplish this, first list the problem's constraints, conditions and related knowledge, and thens solve the problem step by step. Be clear so even an idiot can follow your instructions. After solving the problem, output the final numerical answer within \boxed{}.

Assistant:

 The problem's constraints are given by the equation:
\[((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0.\]
This equation is equal to zero if and only if at least one of the factors is zero. Therefore, we have two cases to consider:
Case 1: $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$.
Case 2: $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$.

For Case 1, we have $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. This implies that $x + y = \pm 10$ and $x - y = \pm 10$. Solving these equations gives us the vertices of a square with side length 10: $(5,5)$, $(5,-5)$, $(-5,5)$, and $(-5,-5)$.

For Case 2, we have $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$. This implies that $x = \pm 8$ and $y = \pm 8$. Solving these equations gives us the vertices of a square with side length 16: $(8,8)$, $(8,-8)$, $(-8,8)$, and $(-8,-8)$.

The union of these two squares is the convex polygon whose area we want to find. The side length of the larger square is 16, so its area is $16^2 = 256$. The side length of the smaller square is 10, so its area is $10^2 = 100$. The area of the convex polygon is the sum of the areas of these two squares, which is $256 + 100 = 356$.
The answer is: $356$

Assistant:

 The problem's constraints, conditions and related knowledge are:

1. The expression $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2)$ equals to zero if and only if at least one of the factors equals to zero.
2. A product of factors equals to zero if and only if at least one of the factors equals to zero.
3. The square of a real number equals to zero if and only if the real number equals to zero.
4. The absolute value of a real number is nonnegative.
5. The square of a nonnegative real number is nonnegative.
6. The sum of two nonnegative real numbers is nonnegative.
7. The square of a nonnegative real number equals to zero if and only if the nonnegative real number equals to zero.

Now, let's solve the problem step by step:

From constraint 1, we have two cases:

Case 1: $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$.

From constraint 3, we have $(\vert x + y \vert - 10) = 0$ and $(\vert x - y \vert - 10) = 0$.

This implies $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$.

From constraint 4, we have $x + y = \pm 10$ and $x - y = \pm 10$.

Solving these equations, we get four lines: $x + y = 10$, $x + y = -10$, $x - y = 10$, and $x - y = -10$.

Case 2: $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$.

From constraint 3, we have $(\vert x \vert - 8) = 0$ and $(\vert y \vert - 8) = 0$.

This implies $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$.

From constraint 4, we have $x = \pm 8$ and $y = \pm 8$.

So, we have four points: $(8, 8)$, $(8, -8)$, $(-8, 8)$, and $(-8, -8)$.

The four lines and four points form a square with side length $20$.

The area of this square is $20^2 = 400$.

So, the area of the convex polygon is $400$. The answer is: $400$

Below is a math problem you are to solve (natural number answer):
"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"

Assistant:

 The problem's constraints, conditions, and related knowledge are as follows:

1. The equation is satisfied if either $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$.
2. If $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$, then $\vert x + y \vert = 10$, which means $x + y = \pm 10$.
3. If $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$, then $\vert x - y \vert = 10$, which means $x - y = \pm 10$.
4. If $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$, then $\vert x \vert = 8$, which means $x = \pm 8$.
5. If $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$, then $\vert y \vert = 8$, which means $y = \pm 8$.
6. The constraints from 2 to 5 give us the vertices of the polygon.
7. To find the area of the polygon, we can use the shoelace formula.

Now, let's solve the problem step by step:

1. From the constraints 2 to 5, we find the vertices of the polygon:
   - $(8, 8)$, $(8, -8)$, $(-8, 8)$, $(-8, -8)$, $(10, 0)$, $(0, 10)$, $(-10, 0)$, $(0, -10)$.
2. Now, we can use the shoelace formula to find the area of the polygon. The shoelace formula states that if the vertices of a polygon are $(x_1, y_1), (x_2, y_2), \dots, (x_n, y_n)$, then the area of the polygon is given by
   \[A = \frac{1}{2} \vert (x_1y_2 + x_2y_3 + \dots + x_ny_1) - (y_1x_2 + y_2x_3 + \dots + y_nx_1) \vert.\]
3. Applying the shoelace formula to the vertices $(8, 8)$, $(8, -8)$, $(-8, 8)$, $(-8, -8)$, $(10, 0)$, $(0, 10)$, $(-10, 0)$, $(0, -10)$, we get
   \[A = \frac{1}{2} \vert (8 \cdot 8 + 8 \cdot (-8) + (-8) \cdot 8 + (-8) \cdot (-8) + 10 \cdot 0 + 0 \cdot 10 + (-10) \cdot 0 + 0 \cdot (-10) - (8 \cdot 8 + 8 \cdot (-8) + (-8) \cdot 8 + (-8) \cdot (-8) + 0 \cdot 10 + 10 \cdot 0 + 0 \cdot (-10) + 0 \cdot 10)) \vert.\]
4. Simplifying the expression inside the absolute value, we get
   \[A = \frac{1}{2} \vert (64 - 64 - 64 + 64 + 0 + 0 - 0 + 0 - (64 - 64 - 64 + 64 + 0 + 0 - 0 + 0)) \vert = 0.\]
5. However, the area of a polygon cannot be zero. We must have made a mistake in our calculations. Let's re-examine our work.
6. Upon closer inspection, we realize that we have double-counted the areas of the squares with side length 16. We should only count each square once.
7. The four squares each have an area of $8 \cdot 8 = 64$, so the total area of the polygon is $4 \cdot 64 = 256$.

Therefore, the area of the convex polygon is 256. The answer is: $256$

Below is a math problem you are to solve (natural number answer):
"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"

Assistant:

 The problem's constraints are:

1. $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$
2. The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying the constraint form a convex polygon.

The first constraint is a product of two terms equal to zero. This means that either the first term is zero or the second term is zero.

The first term is $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)$. This term is zero if and only if both $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ and $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$. This implies that $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$.

The second term is $((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2)$. This term is zero if and only if both $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ and $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$. This implies that $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$.

From the first constraint, we have $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. This implies that the points $\left(x, y\right)$ lie on a square with side length $10\sqrt{2}$. The vertices of this square are $(8,8)$, $(8,-8)$, $(-8,8)$, and $(-8,-8)$.

The area of this square is $(10\sqrt{2})^2 = 200$. So, the area of the convex polygon formed by the points $\left(x, y\right)$ is $200$. The answer is: $200$

Below is a math problem you are to solve (natural number answer):
"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"

Assistant:

 The problem's constraints, conditions, and related knowledge are:

1. The expression $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2)$ equals zero if and only if either of the factors equals zero.

2. A factor equals zero if and only if each of its terms equals zero.

3. $\vert a \vert = 0$ if and only if $a = 0$.

4. The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ form a square with side length 16.

Now, let's solve the problem step by step.

Step 1: For the expression $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2)$ to equal zero, either of the factors must equal zero. This gives us four cases to consider:

Case 1: $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$
Case 2: $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$
Case 3: $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$
Case 4: $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$

Step 2: For each case, we solve the equation:

Case 1: $\vert x + y \vert - 10 = 0 \implies \vert x + y \vert = 10$
Case 2: $\vert x - y \vert - 10 = 0 \implies \vert x - y \vert = 10$
Case 3: $\vert x \vert - 8 = 0 \implies \vert x \vert = 8$
Case 4: $\vert y \vert - 8 = 0 \implies \vert y \vert = 8$

Step 3: Solving the absolute value equations, we get the following:

Case 1: $x + y = \pm 10$ or $x + y = \mp 10$
Case 2: $x - y = \pm 10$ or $x - y = \mp 10$
Case 3: $x = \pm 8$ or $x = \mp 8$
Case 4: $y = \pm 8$ or $y = \mp 8$

Step 4: Combining the cases, we get the vertices of the square as $(8, 2)$, $(8, -2)$, $(-8, 2)$, $(-8, -2)$, $(2, 8)$, $(-2, 8)$, $(2, -8)$, and $(-2, -8)$.

Step 5: The side length of the square is the distance between any two adjacent vertices. For example, the distance between $(8, 2)$ and $(8, -2)$ is 4. So, the side length of the square is 16.

Step 6: The area of a square is side length squared, so the area of the square is $16^2 = 256$.
The answer is: $256$
