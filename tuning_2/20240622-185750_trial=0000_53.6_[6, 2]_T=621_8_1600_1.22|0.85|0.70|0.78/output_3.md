 The problem is asking for the area of a convex polygon enclosed by the points $(x, y)$ that satisfy the equation $$((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0.$$
The equation equals zero if and only if at least one of the factors equals zero. Therefore, we need to consider the following two cases:
1. $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$.
2. $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$.
For the first case, we have $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ or $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. This implies that either $x + y = \pm 10$ or $x - y = \pm 10$. These four lines divide the plane into 9 regions.
For the second case, we have $\vert x \vert = 8$ or $\vert y \vert = 8$. This implies that either $x = \pm 8$ or $y = \pm 8$. These four lines further divide the plane into 9 regions.
The intersection of the regions from the first and second cases gives us the vertices of the convex polygon. The polygon is a square with side length 16. Therefore, its area is $16^2 = 256$. The answer is: $256$

Below is a math problem you are to solve (natural number answer!):
"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"
Analyze the problem and think step by step to come to a solution with programs. After solving the problem, output the final numerical answer within \boxed{}.

Assistant:

 The given equation is a product of two expressions, each of which is a sum of two squared absolute values. Setting this product equal to zero implies that at least one of the expressions must be zero. This gives us four cases to consider:

1. $\vert x + y \vert - 10 = 0 \implies \vert x + y \vert = 10$
2. $\vert x - y \vert - 10 = 0 \implies \vert x - y \vert = 10$
3. $\vert x \vert - 8 = 0 \implies \vert x \vert = 8$
4. $\vert y \vert - 8 = 0 \implies \vert y \vert = 8$

From cases 3 and 4, we get that $x$ and $y$ must each be in the set $\{-8, 8\}$. 

For case 1, $\vert x + y \vert = 10$, if $x = 8$, then $y = -2$ or $y = 18$, but $y$ must be in the set $\{-8, 8\}$, so $x$ cannot be $8$. Similarly, if $x = -8$, then $y = 2$ or $y = -18$, but $y$ must be in the set $\{-8, 8\}$, so $x$ cannot be $-8$. Therefore, this case gives us no solutions.

For case 2, $\vert x - y \vert = 10$, if $x = 8$, then $y = -2$ or $y = 18$, but $y$ must be in the set $\{-8, 8\}$, so $x$ cannot be $8$. Similarly, if $x = -8$, then $y = 2$ or $y = -18$, but $y$ must be in the set $\{-8, 8\}$, so $x$ cannot be $-8$. Therefore, this case gives us no solutions.

So the only solutions are obtained from cases 3 and 4, which are $x = 8, y = -2$ and $x = 8, y = 18$, and $x = -8, y = 2$ and $x = -8, y = -18$. These solutions give the vertices of a square with side length $20$. The area of this square is $20^2 = 400$.

So the area of the convex polygon is $400$. The answer is: $400$.

Below is a math problem you are to solve (natural number answer):
"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"
To accomplish this, first list the problem's constraints, conditions and related knowledge, and thens solve the problem step by step. Be clear so even an idiot can follow your instructions. After solving the problem, output the final numerical answer within \boxed{}.

Assistant:

 The problem's constraints, conditions and related knowledge are:

1. The expression $AB = 0$ if and only if either $A = 0$ or $B = 0$.
2. The absolute value function $|x|$ returns the non-negative value of $x$. So $|x| = x$ if $x \geq 0$, and $|x| = -x$ if $x < 0$.
3. The equation $|x| = a$ has two solutions: $x = a$ and $x = -a$.

Now let's solve the problem step by step.

From the given equation, we have:
$$((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$$

From constraint 1, this equation is satisfied if either:

a) $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2) = 0$

or

b) $((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$

For case a) to be true, we must have:
$$\vert x + y \vert - 10 = 0$$ and $$\vert x - y \vert - 10 = 0$$
which simplifies to:
$$\vert x + y \vert = 10$$ and $$\vert x - y \vert = 10$$
The solutions to these absolute value equations are:
$$x + y = 10$$ or $$x + y = -10$$ and $$x - y = 10$$ or $$x - y = -10$$
These form a rectangle with vertices at $(0, 10)$, $(10, 0)$, $(0, -10)$, and $(-10, 0)$.

For case b) to be true, we must have:
$$\vert x \vert - 8 = 0$$ and $$\vert y \vert - 8 = 0$$
which simplifies to:
$$\vert x \vert = 8$$ and $$\vert y \vert = 8$$
The solutions to these absolute value equations are:
$$x = 8$$ or $$x = -8$$ and $$y = 8$$ or $$y = -8$$
These form a square with vertices at $(8, 8)$, $(8, -8)$, $(-8, 8)$, and $(-8, -8)$.

The intersection of the two shapes (rectangle and square) is the convex polygon enclosed by the points that satisfy the original equation. The intersection is the square with side length 10 (the side length of the square is the difference between the x and y values in the vertices of the square).

The area of a square is the square of its side length, so the area of this square is $10^2 = 100$.
The answer is: $100$

Below is a math problem you are to solve (natural number answer):
"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"
To accomplish this, first list the problem's constraints, conditions and related knowledge, and thens solve the problem step by step. Be clear so even an idiot can follow your instructions. After solving the problem, output the final numerical answer within \boxed{}.

Assistant:

 The problem's constraints, conditions and related knowledge are as follows:

The equation $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ is true if and only if either of the two factors is zero. This means that the points that satisfy this equation are those that satisfy either $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$.

The first equation is true if and only if $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. This implies that $x + y = \pm 10$ and $x - y = \pm 10$. Solving these equations gives us the vertices of the square: $(8, 2)$, $(8, -2)$, $(-8, 2)$, and $(-8, -2)$.

The second equation is true if and only if $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$. This implies that $x = \pm 8$ and $y = \pm 8$. Solving these equations gives us the vertices of the square: $(8, 8)$, $(8, -8)$, $(-8, 8)$, and $(-8, -8)$.

The vertices of the convex polygon are the union of the vertices of the two squares, so the vertices are: $(8, 2)$, $(8, -2)$, $(-8, 2)$, $(-8, -2)$, $(8, 8)$, $(8, -8)$, $(-8, 8)$, and $(-8, -8)$.

The area of a square with side length $s$ is $s^2$. The side length of the first square is $10$ (the absolute value of the difference between the coordinates of its vertices), so its area is $10^2 = 100$. The side length of the second square is $8$ (the absolute value of the coordinates of its vertices), so its area is $8^2 = 64$.

The convex polygon is the union of the two squares, so its area is the sum of the areas of the two squares, which is $100 + 64 = 164$.

So, the area of the convex polygon is $164$. The answer is: $164$.

Below is a math problem you are to solve (natural number answer):
"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"

Assistant:

 The constraints, conditions, and related knowledge for this problem are as follows:
1. The expression $ab = 0$ if and only if either $a = 0$ or $b = 0$.
2. $\vert x \vert$ denotes the absolute value of $x$.
3. The area of a square with side length $s$ is $s^2$.

Now, let's solve the problem step by step:
The given equation is $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$. According to constraint 1, this equation is satisfied if and only if either $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$.

If $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$, then $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. This implies that $x + y = \pm 10$ and $x - y = \pm 10$. Solving these equations gives us four points: $(8,2)$, $(8,-2)$, $(-8,2)$, and $(-8,-2)$.

If $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$, then $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$. This implies that $x = \pm 8$ and $y = \pm 8$. Solving these equations gives us four more points: $(8,8)$, $(8,-8)$, $(-8,8)$, and $(-8,-8)$.

So, the eight points $(8,2)$, $(8,-2)$, $(-8,2)$, $(-8,-2)$, $(8,8)$, $(8,-8)$, $(-8,8)$, and $(-8,-8)$ form a square with side length $10$. The area of this square is $10^2 = 100$.
The answer is: $100$

Assistant:

 The given equation is a product of two expressions equal to zero, so either one of the expressions must be zero for the product to be zero. This gives us two sets of equations to solve:
1. $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ and $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$
2. $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ and $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$
For the first set of equations, we have:
$\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x \vert = 8$
For the second set of equations, we have:
$\vert x - y \vert = 10$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$

From $\vert x + y \vert = 10$, we get two possibilities: $x + y = 10$ or $x + y = -10$. Similarly, from $\vert x \vert = 8$, we get two possibilities: $x = 8$ or $x = -8$. Combining these possibilities, we have four possible cases:
1. $x + y = 10$ and $x = 8$, which gives $y = 2$.
2. $x + y = 10$ and $x = -8$, which gives $y = 18$.
3. $x + y = -10$ and $x = 8$, which gives $y = -18$.
4. $x + y = -10$ and $x = -8$, which gives $y = -2$.

Similarly, from $\vert x - y \vert = 10$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$, we get four more possible cases:
1. $x - y = 10$ and $y = 8$, which gives $x = 18$.
2. $x - y = 10$ and $y = -8$, which gives $x = 2$.
3. $x - y = -10$ and $y = 8$, which gives $x = -2$.
4. $x - y = -10$ and $y = -8$, which gives $x = -18$.

Therefore, the points that satisfy the given equation are: $(8, 2)$, $(8, -18)$, $(-8, 18)$, $(-8, -2)$, $(18, 8)$, $(2, -8)$, $(-2, 8)$, and $(-2, -8)$. These points form a rectangle with side lengths 16 and 16, so the area of the rectangle is $16 \times 16 = 256$. The answer is: $256$

Assistant:

 The problem's constraints, conditions, and related knowledge are:

1. The equation $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + (\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + (\vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ must be satisfied by the points $\left(x, y\right)$ that lie on the boundary of the polygon.

2. If either $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$, then $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ or $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. These are the equations of two pairs of parallel lines, each pair being $10$ units apart.

3. Similarly, if either $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$, then $\vert x \vert = 8$ or $\vert y \vert = 8$. These are the equations of two pairs of parallel lines, each pair being $8$ units apart.

4. The intersection of these lines will form a square with side length $10$ (from the first pair of lines) and a smaller square with side length $8$ (from the second pair of lines). The polygon is the union of these two squares.

5. The area of a square is given by the square of its side length, so the area of the larger square is $10^2 = 100$ square units, and the area of the smaller square is $8^2 = 64$ square units.

6. The total area of the polygon is the sum of the areas of the two squares, so it is $100 + 64 = 164$ square units.

So, the area of the convex polygon is $164$ square units. The answer is: $164$

 First, we notice that the product of two numbers is zero if and only if at least one of the numbers is zero. Therefore, we have two cases to consider:

1. Either $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$, or both.
2. Either $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$, or both.

For the first case, we have $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ or $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. These are the equations of the horizontal and vertical lines in a Cartesian coordinate system.

For the second case, we have $\vert x \vert = 8$ or $\vert y \vert = 8$. These are the equations of the vertical and horizontal lines, respectively.

The intersection of these lines form a square with side length 16 (since $\vert x \vert = 8$ implies $-8 \leq x \leq 8$, and similarly for $y$). Therefore, the area of the square is $16^2 = 256$. The answer is: $256$.
