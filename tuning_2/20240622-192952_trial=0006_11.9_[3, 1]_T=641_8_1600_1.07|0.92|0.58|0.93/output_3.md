Below is a math problem you are to solve (natural number answer):
"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"
To accomplish this, first list the problem's constraints, conditions and related knowledge, and thens solve the problem step by step. Be clear so even an idiot can follow your instructions. After solving the problem, output the final numerical answer within \boxed{}.

Assistant:

 The constraints, conditions, and related knowledge for this problem are:

1. The equation $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ implies $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$, which means $x + y = \pm 10$ and $x - y = \pm 10$. Solving these equations gives us the vertices of a square with side length 10.

2. The equation $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ implies $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$, which means $x = \pm 8$ and $y = \pm 8$. This forms a square with side length 16.

3. The intersection of the two squares forms a smaller square with side length 8 (the intersection of the squares with side lengths 10 and 16).

4. The area of a square is given by the formula $s^2$, where $s$ is the length of a side of the square.

Now, we can solve the problem step by step:

The side length of the smaller square is 8, so the area of the convex polygon is $8^2 = 64$.
The answer is: $64$.

Below is a math problem you are to solve (natural number answer!):
"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"
Analyze the problem and think step by step to come to a solution with programs. After solving the problem, output the final numerical answer within \boxed{}.

Assistant:

 The given equation is satisfied only when both of the factors are zero. This happens when each of the absolute values equals to 10 or 8.

We can consider four cases:
1. $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x \vert = 8$
2. $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$
3. $\vert x - y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x \vert = 8$
4. $\vert x - y \vert = 10$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$

For each of these cases, we can draw the lines on a coordinate plane and determine the vertices of the polygon. 

1. $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ gives $x + y = 10$ and $x + y = -10$.
2. $\vert x \vert = 8$ gives $x = 8$ and $x = -8$.
3. $\vert y \vert = 8$ gives $y = 8$ and $y = -8$.
4. $\vert x - y \vert = 10$ gives $x - y = 10$ and $x - y = -10$.

By drawing these lines, we find that the vertices of the polygon are:
(8, 0), (0, 8), (-8, 0), (0, -8), (8, -10), (-8, 10), (8, 10), and (-8, -10).

The polygon is a square with side length of 10 units. The area of a square is the side length squared, so the area of the polygon is $10^2 = 100$.

Therefore, the area of the convex polygon is 100 square units. The answer is: $100$

Assistant:

 The problem's constraints, conditions, and related knowledge include:

1. The equation $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ implies $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$, which leads to $x + y = \pm 10$ and $x - y = \pm 10$. These four lines form a square with side length 10. The vertices of this square are $(0, 10)$, $(0, -10)$, $(10, 0)$, and $(-10, 0)$.

2. The equation $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ implies $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$, which leads to $x = \pm 8$ and $y = \pm 8$. These four lines form a square with side length 16. The vertices of this square are $(8, 0)$, $(-8, 0)$, $(0, 8)$, and $(0, -8)$.

By examining the coordinates of the vertices of both squares, we can see that the intersection of the two squares is a square with side length 8. The area of this square is $8^2 = 64$. Therefore, the area of the convex polygon is 64 square units. The answer is: $64$

Below is a math problem you are to solve (natural number answer):
"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"

Assistant:

 The given equation is $ ((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$.
For the product of two factors to be zero, either one of the factors must be zero. So we have two cases to consider:

Case 1: $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$.
This implies that $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$.
The only way this can be true is if $x = \pm 10$ and $y = \pm 10$.

Case 2: $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$.
This implies that $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$.
The only way this can be true is if $x = \pm 8$ and $y = \pm 8$.

So the points satisfying the equation are: $(\pm 10, \pm 10)$ and $(\pm 8, \pm 8)$.
Plotting these points, we can see that they form a square with side length 20 (the square with vertices $(\pm 10, \pm 10)$).

The area of this square is $20^2 = 400$.
The answer is: $400$

Below is a math problem you are to solve (natural number answer):
"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"
To accomplish this, first list the problem's constraints, conditions and related knowledge, and thens solve the problem step by step. Be clear so even an idiot can follow your instructions. After solving the problem, output the final numerical answer within \boxed{}.

Assistant:

 The problem's constraints are given by the equation:
\[((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0\]
This equation is equal to zero if either of the two factors is equal to zero. This gives us two sets of constraints:

1. $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ and $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ and $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$
2. $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ and $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ and $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$

For the first set of constraints:
$(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ implies $\vert x + y \vert = 10$. This gives us $x + y = \pm 10$.
$(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ implies $\vert x \vert = 8$, which gives us $x = \pm 8$.
$(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ implies $\vert y \vert = 8$, which gives us $y = \pm 8$.
The solutions for the first set of constraints are the points where $x = -8$ and $y = 8$, $x = 8$ and $y = 8$, $x = -8$ and $y = -8$, and $x = 8$ and $y = -8$. These points form a rectangle with side lengths 16 and 16, so its area is $16 \times 16 = 256$.

For the second set of constraints:
$(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ implies $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. This gives us $x - y = \pm 10$.
$(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ implies $\vert x \vert = 8$, which gives us $x = \pm 8$.
$(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ implies $\vert y \vert = 8$, which gives us $y = \pm 8$.
The solutions for the second set of constraints are the points where $x = -8$ and $y = 8$, $x = 8$ and $y = 8$, $x = -8$ and $y = -8$, and $x = 8$ and $y = -8$. These points form the same rectangle as before.

Since the points satisfying the equation form a rectangle with side lengths 16 and 16, the area of this convex polygon is 256. The answer is: $256$

Assistant:

 The problem's constraints, conditions, and related knowledge are as follows:

The equation $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + (\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + (\vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ must be satisfied for the points $(x, y)$ to be enclosed by the polygon.

From the equation, we have two cases:

1. $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + (\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2) = 0$ and $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + (\vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$.
2. $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + (\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2) = 0$ or $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + (\vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$.

From the first case, we have $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ and $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$, which implies $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. The only way this can be true is if $x = y = 5$ or $x = -y = -5$.

From the second case, we have $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + (\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2) = 0$ if and only if $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + (\vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$. This implies $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$, which gives $x = 8$ or $x = -8$, and $y = 8$ or $y = -8$.

So the points $(x, y)$ that satisfy the equation are $(5, 5)$, $(-5, -5)$, $(8, 8)$, $(-8, -8)$, $(8, -8)$, $(-8, 8)$, $(5, -5)$, and $(-5, 5)$. These points form a square with side length 10, so the area of the square is $10^2 = 100$. Therefore, the area of the convex polygon is $100$ square units. The answer is: $100$

 The given equation is $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$. For the product of two numbers to be zero, either the first number must be zero or the second number must be zero. Therefore, we have two cases to consider:

Case 1: $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$. This is only possible if both $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ and $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$. This implies $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. Solving these equations gives us $x + y = 10$ or $x + y = -10$ and $x - y = 10$ or $x - y = -10$. This results in four lines: $x + y = 10$, $x + y = -10$, $x - y = 10$, and $x - y = -10$.

Case 2: $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$. This is only possible if both $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ and $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$. This implies $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$. Solving these equations gives us $x = 8$ or $x = -8$ and $y = 8$ or $y = -8$. This results in four lines: $x = 8$, $x = -8$, $y = 8$, and $y = -8$.

The four lines from Case 1 and the four lines from Case 2 form a square with side length 10. The area of this square is $10 \times 10 = 100$. Therefore, the area of the convex polygon is 100 square units. The answer is: $100$.

Below is a math problem you are to solve (natural number answer):
"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"
To accomplish this, first list the problem's constraints, conditions and related knowledge, and thens solve the problem step by step. Be clear so even an idiot can follow your instructions. After solving the problem, output the final numerical answer within \boxed{}.

Assistant:

 The problem's constraint is that the expression $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$.
This expression equals to zero if and only if either of the two factors equals to zero.
The first factor equals to zero if and only if $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$.
This means $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ or $\vert x - y \vert = 10$.
The second factor equals to zero if and only if $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$.
This means $\vert x \vert = 8$ or $\vert y \vert = 8$.
Combining these constraints, we can conclude that the points $(x, y)$ satisfying the constraint must satisfy either $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x \vert = 8$, or $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$, or $\vert x - y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x \vert = 8$, or $\vert x - y \vert = 10$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$.
These four equations represent four lines in the coordinate plane. The area of the convex polygon enclosed by these lines can be calculated by finding the area of the rectangle and subtracting the areas of the four triangles that are formed by the lines outside the rectangle.
The rectangle has sides of length $20$ and $16$, so its area is $20 \times 16 = 320$.
Each triangle has a base and height of $8$, so its area is $0.5 \times 8 \times 8 = 32$.
There are four triangles, so the total area of the triangles is $4 \times 32 = 128$.
Therefore, the area of the convex polygon is $320 - 128 = 192$. The answer is: 192
