 The problem asks for the number of positive integers $m$ for which the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has four distinct solutions.

The equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ can be rewritten as $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$.

The absolute value function $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert$ has a piecewise form. Let $f(x) = \vert x - 1 \vert - 2$, then
\[f(x) = \begin{cases}
-(x - 1) - 2 = -x + 3, & \text{if } x < 1 \\
(x - 1) - 2 = x - 3, & \text{if } x > 1
\end{cases}\]
The graph of $f(x)$ consists of two line segments: $f(x) = -x + 3$ for $x < 1$, and $f(x) = x - 3$ for $x > 1$.

The graph of $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert = \frac{m}{100}$ will be two shifted and scaled versions of the graph of $f(x)$. The equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert = \frac{m}{100}$ will have four distinct solutions if and only if the horizontal line $y = \frac{m}{100}$ intersects the graph of $f(x)$ at four points.

From the graph of $f(x)$, we see that the horizontal line $y = \frac{m}{100}$ intersects the graph of $f(x)$ at four points if and only if $0 < \frac{m}{100} < 1$. This is equivalent to $0 < m < 100$.

Therefore, the number of positive integers $m$ for which the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has four distinct solutions is the number of positive integers in the interval $(0, 100)$, which is 99.
The value of $m$ that satisfies this condition is 99. The answer is: $1$

 The problem asks for how many positive integers $m$ does the equation $| |x-1| -2 |=\frac{m}{100}$ have four distinct solutions.

To solve this problem, we first need to know that the equation $| |x-1| -2 |=\frac{m}{100}$ will have four distinct solutions if and only if $0 < \frac{m}{100} \le 2$. The reason is that $| |x-1| -2 |$ is a quantity that oscillates between 0 and 2, and the equation will have solutions when the right side $\frac{m}{100}$ falls into this interval.

If we multiply all sides of the inequality $0 < \frac{m}{100} \le 2$ by 100, we get $0 < m \le 200$. This inequality tells us that $m$ must be a positive integer that is less than or equal to 200, but strictly greater than 0.

The positive integers that satisfy these conditions are the integers from 1 to 200, inclusive. However, we need to count how many of these integers satisfy the condition of the equation having four distinct solutions.

From the inequality $0 < \frac{m}{100} \le 2$, we can see that the value of $m$ that makes $\frac{m}{100} = 2$ is $m = 200$. And the value of $m$ that makes $\frac{m}{100} = 0$ is $m = 0$, but this doesn't make sense in the context of the problem as it would make the right side of the equation equal to zero and the equation would have at most two solutions, not four.

Therefore, we are looking for the positive integers $m$ such that $0 < m < 200$ and $1 \le \frac{m}{100} \le 2$. This means $100 < m \le 200$.

The positive integers $m$ that satisfy these conditions are the integers from 101 to 200, inclusive. To count these integers, we can subtract the smallest integer in this range from the largest, and then add 1. That is, $200 - 101 + 1 = 99$.

So, there are 99 positive integers $m$ such that the equation $| |x-1| -2 |=\frac{m}{100}$ has four distinct solutions. The answer is: $\boxed{99}$.

Assistant:

 The equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has $4$ distinct solutions. The absolute value function makes the equation more complex, so we'll break it down into cases based on the value inside the absolute value.

Case 1: When $\vert x-1 \vert -2 \geq 0$, we have $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert = \vert x-1 \vert -2$. The equation then becomes $\vert x-1 \vert -2 = \frac{m}{100}$.

Case 2: When $\vert x-1 \vert -2 < 0$, we have $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert = -( \vert x-1 \vert -2) = 2 - \vert x-1 \vert$. The equation then becomes $2 - \vert x-1 \vert = \frac{m}{100}$.

For each of these cases, we'll solve the resulting equation and count the number of distinct solutions.

Case 1: $\vert x-1 \vert -2 = \frac{m}{100}$. This can be rewritten as $\vert x-1 \vert = \frac{m}{100} + 2$. The absolute value splits into two separate equations:

1. $x-1 = \frac{m}{100} + 2$
2. $-(x-1) = \frac{m}{100} + 2$, which simplifies to $x-1 = -(\frac{m}{100} + 2)$.

For each of these equations, we'll solve for $x$ and count the number of distinct solutions.

For equation 1, $x = \frac{m}{100} + 3$. This has one solution if $\frac{m}{100} + 3 > 1$ (i.e., $m > -200$), and no solutions if $m < -200$.

For equation 2, $x = -(\frac{m}{100} + 2) + 1 = 1 - \frac{m}{100} - 2 = - \frac{m}{100} - 1$. This has one solution if $- \frac{m}{100} - 1 > 1$ (i.e., $m < -100$), and no solutions if $m > -100$.

So, for Case 1, we have two distinct solutions if $-200 < m < -100$.

Case 2: $2 - \vert x-1 \vert = \frac{m}{100}$. This can be rewritten as $\vert x-1 \vert = 2 - \frac{m}{100}$. The absolute value splits into two separate equations:

1. $x-1 = 2 - \frac{m}{100}$
2. $-(x-1) = 2 - \frac{m}{100}$, which simplifies to $x-1 = \frac{m}{100} - 2$.

For each of these equations, we'll solve for $x$ and count the number of distinct solutions.

For equation 1, $x = 3 - \frac{m}{100}$. This has one solution if $3 - \frac{m}{100} > 1$ (i.e., $m < 200$), and no solutions if $m > 200$.

For equation 2, $x = \frac{m}{100} - 2 + 1 = \frac{m}{100} - 1$. This has one solution if $\frac{m}{100} - 1 > 1$ (i.e., $m > 100$), and no solutions if $m < 100$.

So, for Case 2, we have two distinct solutions if $100 < m < 200$.

Combining both cases, we find that the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has $4$ distinct solutions when $-200 < m < -100$ or $100 < m < 200$. This is a range of $100$ possible values of $m$ (from $-199$ to $-99$, and from $101$ to $199$). So there are $100$ values of $m$ for which the equation has $4$ distinct solutions. The answer is: $100$

 The problem asks for how many positive integers $m$ the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has $4$ distinct solutions.

The equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ can be rewritten as $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ and $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=-\frac{m}{100}$.

For each of these two equations, we need to solve the absolute value equations. The absolute value equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has $4$ distinct solutions if and only if $0 < \frac{m}{100} < 3$. This is because the graph of $y = \vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert$ is a V-shape with the peaks at $x = 1 \pm 2$, and the distance between the peaks is $4$. So for the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ to have $4$ distinct solutions, the "height" $\frac{m}{100}$ must be between $0$ and $3$.

Similarly, the absolute value equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=-\frac{m}{100}$ has no solutions because the left-hand side is always nonnegative, while the right-hand side is always nonpositive.

Therefore, we only need to consider the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$. We have $0 < \frac{m}{100} < 3$, so $0 < m < 300$.

The number of positive integers $m$ in the range $0 < m < 300$ is $299$. Therefore, there are $299$ positive integers $m$ for which the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has $4$ distinct solutions.
The answer is: $299$

Assistant:

 First, let's understand the problem. We are given an equation with absolute value functions and we are asked to find out for how many positive integers $m$ the equation has $4$ distinct solutions.

The equation is \[\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}.\]

This equation can have at most $4$ distinct solutions. The right side of the equation $\frac{m}{100}$ is a positive number because $m$ is a positive integer, so the absolute value on both sides will split into two cases.

Case 1: $\vert x-1 \vert -2 = \frac{m}{100}$ and $\vert x-1 \vert -2 = -\frac{m}{100}$.

Case 2: $-\vert x-1 \vert +2 = \frac{m}{100}$ and $-\vert x-1 \vert +2 = -\frac{m}{100}$.

Each of these cases will give us two equations, and each equation will have two sub-cases based on the absolute value. 

For each of these sub-cases, we need to solve the equation and see if it gives us $4$ distinct solutions. If it does, then that value of $m$ is a solution. 

We need to find the value of $m$ that makes the equation have $4$ distinct solutions. 

After solving the equations for each case and sub-case, we find that the value of $m$ that makes the equation have $4$ distinct solutions is $m=200$.

So, the number of positive integers $m$ for which the equation has $4$ distinct solutions is $1$. The answer is: $1$. However, it seems we made a mistake. Let's correct this.

Upon further inspection, we realized that we misunderstood the question. The question is asking for the number of positive integers $m$ that make the equation have $4$ distinct solutions. We mistakenly thought the question was asking for the value of $m$ that makes the equation have $4$ distinct solutions.

After revisiting the problem and re-solving for each case and sub-case, we find that the value of $m$ that makes the equation have $4$ distinct solutions is $m=200$.

However, we are asked for the number of positive integers $m$ that make the equation have $4$ distinct solutions. 

We have found that $m=200$ is the only value that makes the equation have $4$ distinct solutions. So, there is only $1$ positive integer $m$ that makes the equation have $4$ distinct solutions.

Therefore, the number of positive integers $m$ for which the equation has $4$ distinct solutions is $1$.
The value of $m$ that makes the equation have $4$ distinct solutions is $200$. But the question asks for the number of positive integers $m$ that make the equation have $4$ distinct solutions, not the value of $m$.

After careful review of the problem and our work, we realize that we misunderstood the question. The question is actually asking for the number of positive integers $m$ that make the equation have $4$ distinct solutions.

We have found that $m=200$ is the only value that makes the equation have $4$ distinct solutions. So, there is only $1$ positive integer $m$ that makes the equation have $4$ distinct solutions.

Therefore, the number of positive integers $m$ for which the equation has $4$ distinct solutions is $1$.
The answer is: $1$

Assistant:

 The equation has four distinct solutions. This implies that the right-hand side of the equation $\frac{m}{100}$ must be positive (since the absolute value cannot be negative). Therefore, $m > 0$.

The right-hand side of the equation is $\frac{m}{100}$, which is a positive fraction. On the other hand, the left-hand side of the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert$ is an absolute value function with four distinct solutions. This implies that the value of the absolute value function must cover the range $[0, 2]$. This is because the maximum value of the absolute value function is $2$ (when the absolute value is equal to $2$), and the minimum value is $0$ (when the absolute value is equal to $0$).

Therefore, we need to find the value of $m$ such that $\frac{m}{100}$ falls in the range $[0, 2]$. This means $0 < \frac{m}{100} < 2$. Solving these inequalities gives $0 < m < 200$.

However, $m$ must be a positive integer. So, the possible values of $m$ are the integers from $1$ to $199$.

Now we need to find how many of these values make the original equation have four distinct solutions. By observation, we can see that for each integer value of $m$ in the range $1 \leq m < 200$, the equation has exactly four distinct solutions.

Therefore, the number of positive integers $m$ for which the equation has four distinct solutions is the number of integers from $1$ to $199$, inclusive. This is simply $199$.
The value of $m$ is $199$. The answer is: $199$

 The problem requires us to find the number of positive integers $m$ for which the equation $| |x-1| -2| = \frac{m}{100}$ has exactly four distinct solutions.

First, we know that the right side of the equation, $\frac{m}{100}$, must be positive. This implies that $m$ must be a positive integer.

Next, we consider the number of solutions to the equation $| |x-1| -2| = k$, where $k$ is a positive constant. The expression $| |x-1| -2|$ can take on three different values: $2-k$, $k$, and $2+k$. If $2-k>0$, that is, $k<2$, the equation has no solution. If $2+k>0$, that is, $k>-2$, the equation will always have at least two solutions.

The interesting case is when $0 \le k \le 2$. In this case, the equation $| |x-1| -2| = k$ has exactly two solutions when $|x-1| = 2-k$, and exactly two solutions when $|x-1| = 2+k$. The total number of solutions is then four. This happens when $k=1$, which means the right side of the equation is $\frac{1}{100}$.

Therefore, there is only one positive integer $m$ that satisfies the condition, and that is $m=100$. The answer is: $1$

Assistant:

 The equation $|\vert x-1 \vert -2|=\frac{m}{100}$ has four distinct solutions. This means that the right-hand side, $\frac{m}{100}$, must be equal to one of the four possible forms that $|\vert x-1 \vert -2|$ can take to have four distinct solutions.

1. $|\vert x-1 \vert -2|=0$: In this case, $|\vert x-1 \vert -2|=0$ implies $|\vert x-1 \vert =2$, which further implies $\vert x-1 \vert =2$ or $\vert x-1 \vert =-2$. The first equation gives two solutions: $x=3$ and $x=-1$. The second equation doesn't yield any real solutions. So, the case $|\vert x-1 \vert -2|=0$ doesn't result in four distinct solutions.

2. $|\vert x-1 \vert -2|=1$: In this case, $|\vert x-1 \vert -2|=1$ implies $\vert x-1 \vert -2=1$ or $\vert x-1 \vert -2=-1$. The first equation gives two solutions: $x=4$ and $x=0$. The second equation gives two solutions: $x=3$ and $x=-1$. So, the case $|\vert x-1 \vert -2|=1$ gives four distinct solutions.

3. $|\vert x-1 \vert -2|=2$: In this case, $|\vert x-1 \vert -2|=2$ implies $\vert x-1 \vert -2=2$ or $\vert x-1 \vert -2=-2$. The first equation gives two solutions: $x=5$ and $x=-1$. The second equation doesn't yield any real solutions. So, the case $|\vert x-1 \vert -2|=2$ doesn't result in four distinct solutions.

4. $|\vert x-1 \vert -2|=3$: In this case, $|\vert x-1 \vert -2|=3$ implies $\vert x-1 \vert -2=3$ or $\vert x-1 \vert -2=-3$. The first equation gives two solutions: $x=6$ and $x=-2$. The second equation doesn't yield any real solutions. So, the case $|\vert x-1 \vert -2|=3$ doesn't result in four distinct solutions.

Therefore, the only possible value of $m$ is the one that makes $|\vert x-1 \vert -2|=\frac{m}{100}$ equal to 1. So we have $\frac{m}{100}=1$, which gives $m=100$. Thus, the only possible value of $m$ is $100$. The answer is: $1$
