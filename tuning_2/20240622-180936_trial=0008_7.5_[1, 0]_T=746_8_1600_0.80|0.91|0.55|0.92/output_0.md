 The parabola $y = kx^2 - 2kx + l$ intersects the line $y = 4$ at two points $A$ and $B$. This means that when we substitute $y = 4$ into the equation of the parabola, we get a quadratic equation. So we have:
\[4 = kx^2 - 2kx + l.\]
Rearranging the equation gives us:
\[kx^2 - 2kx + (l - 4) = 0.\]
This is a quadratic equation, and we know that it has two solutions (the x-coordinates of points $A$ and $B$), which are distance 6 apart. Let's denote these solutions as $x_1$ and $x_2$, where $|x_1 - x_2| = 6$. By Vieta's formulas, we know that $x_1 + x_2 = \frac{2k}{k} = 2$ and $x_1x_2 = \frac{l - 4}{k}$.

Now we need to find the sum of the squares of the distances from $A$ and $B$ to the origin. The distance from a point $(x, y)$ to the origin $(0, 0)$ is $\sqrt{x^2 + y^2}$. For point $A$ with coordinates $(x_1, 4)$, the distance to the origin is $\sqrt{x_1^2 + 4^2} = \sqrt{x_1^2 + 16}$. Similarly, for point $B$ with coordinates $(x_2, 4)$, the distance to the origin is $\sqrt{x_2^2 + 16}$.

The sum of the squares of the distances from $A$ and $B$ to the origin is:
\[(\sqrt{x_1^2 + 16})^2 + (\sqrt{x_2^2 + 16})^2 = x_1^2 + 16 + x_2^2 + 16 = x_1^2 + x_2^2 + 32.\]

We know that $(x_1 + x_2)^2 = x_1^2 + 2x_1x_2 + x_2^2$, so we can substitute $x_1 + x_2 = 2$ and $x_1x_2 = \frac{l - 4}{k}$ to get:
\[4^2 = x_1^2 + 2\left(\frac{l - 4}{k}\right) + x_2^2,\]
which simplifies to:
\[16 = x_1^2 + x_2^2 + 2\left(\frac{l - 4}{k}\right).\]

Now we can substitute this into the sum of the squares of the distances:
\[x_1^2 + x_2^2 + 32 = 16 - 2\left(\frac{l - 4}{k}\right) + 32 = 48 - 2\left(\frac{l - 4}{k}\right).\]

We know that $|x_1 - x_2| = 6$, and by the difference of squares identity, we have $(x_1 - x_2)^2 = (x_1 + x_2)^2 - 4x_1x_2$, so:
\[6^2 = 2^2 - 4\left(\frac{l - 4}{k}\right).\]

Solving this equation gives:
\[36 = 4 - 4\left(\frac{l - 4}{k}\right).\]

Rearranging and simplifying gives:
\[4\left(\frac{l - 4}{k}\right) = -32,\]
which simplifies to:
\[\frac{l - 4}{k} = -8.\]

Multiplying both sides by $k$ gives:
\[l - 4 = -8k.\]

Solving for $l$ gives:
\[l = 4 - 8k.\]

Substituting this into the equation $48 - 2\left(\frac{l - 4}{k}\right)$ gives:
\[48 - 2\left(\frac{4 - 8k - 4}{k}\right) = 48 - 2\left(\frac{-8k}{k}\right) = 48 + 16 = 64.\]

So the sum of the squares of the distances from $A$ and $B$ to the origin is 64. The answer is: $64$

The sum of the squares of the distances from $A$ and $B$ to the origin is $\frac{(|\sqrt{k} - \sqrt{k - l + 4}|^2 + |\sqrt{k} + \sqrt{k - l + 4}|^2)}{k}$.
However, we know that the distance between $A$ and $B$ is 6, and we can use the fact that the distance between two points $(x_1, y_1)$ and $(x_2, y_2)$ is $\sqrt{(x_2 - x_1)^2 + (y_2 - y_1)^2}$.
So, we can set up the equation $\sqrt{(x_2 - x_1)^2 + (y_2 - y_1)^2} = 6$.
Substituting the expressions for the coordinates of $A$ and $B$ into the equation, we get $\sqrt{(2\sqrt{k})^2 + (0)^2} = 6$.
Simplifying, we get $2\sqrt{k} = 6$, so $\sqrt{k} = 3$ and $k = 9$.
Now we can substitute $k = 9$ into the expression for the sum of the squares of the distances to find the numerical value.

Let's substitute $k = 9$ into the expression:

The sum of the squares of the distances from $A$ and $B$ to the origin is $\frac{| \sqrt{13 - l} - 3 |^2}{9} + \frac{| \sqrt{13 - l} + 3 |^2}{9}$.

We also know that the distance between $A$ and $B$ is 6, so we can set up the equation $\sqrt{(2\sqrt{k})^2 + (0)^2} = 6$ and solve for $l$.

Assistant:

 The parabola $y = kx^2 - 2kx + l$ intersects the line $y = 4$ at two points $A$ and $B$. So we have $kx^2 - 2kx + l = 4$. The distance between these two points is 6, and we need to find the sum of the squares of the distances from $A$ and $B$ to the origin.

Let's call the $x$-coordinates of $A$ and $B$ as $x_1$ and $x_2$ respectively. Then the distance between $A$ and $B$ is $|x_2 - x_1| = 6$. The distance from a point $(x, y)$ to the origin $(0, 0)$ is $\sqrt{x^2 + y^2}$, so the square of the distance from $A$ to the origin is $x_1^2 + 4^2 = x_1^2 + 16$, and the square of the distance from $B$ to the origin is $x_2^2 + 4^2 = x_2^2 + 16$. The sum of the squares of the distances from $A$ and $B$ to the origin is therefore $(x_1^2 + 16) + (x_2^2 + 16) = x_1^2 + x_2^2 + 32$.

We need to solve the equation $kx^2 - 2kx + l = 4$ to find $x_1$ and $x_2$. This is a quadratic equation, and its solutions are given by $x = \frac{2k \pm \sqrt{(2k)^2 - 4k(l - 4)}}{2k} = 1 \pm \frac{\sqrt{4k^2 - 4k(l - 4)}}{2k} = 1 \pm \frac{\sqrt{4k^2 - 4kl + 16k}}{2k}$.

The distance between these two points is $|(1 + \frac{\sqrt{4k^2 - 4kl + 16k}}{2k}) - (1 - \frac{\sqrt{4k^2 - 4kl + 16k}}{2k})| = \frac{2\sqrt{4k^2 - 4kl + 16k}}{2k} = \frac{2\sqrt{4k(k - l + 4)}}{2k} = \frac{2\sqrt{4(k - l + 4)}}{k} = 6$.

Squaring both sides gives $\frac{4(k - l + 4)}{k^2} = 36$, so $k - l + 4 = 9k^2$. Rearranging terms gives $9k^2 - k + l = 4$.

Now we substitute $l = 4 - k + 9k^2$ into the equation $x_1^2 + x_2^2 + 32$. We have $x_1^2 + x_2^2 + 32 = (1 + \frac{\sqrt{4k^2 - 4kl + 16k}}{2k})^2 + (1 - \frac{\sqrt{4k^2 - 4kl + 16k}}{2k})^2 + 32$.

Expanding and simplifying, we get $x_1^2 + x_2^2 + 32 = 2 + 2\left(\frac{4k^2 - 4kl + 16k}{4k^2}\right) + 32 = 34 + 2\left(1 - \frac{l}{k} + 4/k\right)$.

Substituting $l = 4 - k + 9k^2$ gives $x_1^2 + x_2^2 + 32 = 34 + 2\left(1 - \frac{4 - k + 9k^2}{k} + \frac{4}{k}\right) = 34 + 2\left(\frac{k - 4 + 9k^2 + 4}{k}\right) = 34 + 2\left(\frac{9k^2 + k}{k}\right) = 34 + 18k + 2 = 36 + 18k$.

Finally, we substitute $k = \frac{6^2}{2*6} = 3$ into the equation $x_1^2 + x_2^2 + 32 = 36 + 18k$ to get $x_1^2 + x_2^2 + 32 = 36 + 18*3 = 36 + 54 = 90$.

So the sum of the squares of the distances from $A$ and $B$ to the origin is 90. The answer is: $90$

 The parabola $y = kx^2 - 2kx + l$ intersects the line $y = 4$ at two points $A$ and $B$. These points are distance 6 apart. We are asked to find the sum of the squares of the distances from $A$ and $B$ to the origin.

First, we set $y = 4$ to find the $x$-coordinates of $A$ and $B$:
$$4 = kx^2 - 2kx + l.$$
Rearranging terms gives us the quadratic equation:
$$kx^2 - 2kx + (l - 4) = 0.$$
Let $x_1$ and $x_2$ be the roots of this equation, which represent the $x$-coordinates of points $A$ and $B$. We are given that $|x_1 - x_2| = 6/\sqrt{1^2 + 0^2} = 6$. By Vieta's formulas, we have $x_1 + x_2 = \frac{2k}{k} = 2$ and $x_1x_2 = \frac{l - 4}{k}$.

By the distance formula, the distance from a point $(x, y)$ to the origin is $\sqrt{x^2 + y^2}$. The distance from point $A$ (or $B$) to the origin is $\sqrt{x_1^2 + 4^2}$. We are asked to find the sum of the squares of these distances, which is:
$$(x_1^2 + 16) + (x_2^2 + 16) = x_1^2 + x_2^2 + 32.$$

We know that $(x_1 + x_2)^2 = x_1^2 + 2x_1x_2 + x_2^2$, so we can substitute the values we know to get:
$$2^2 = x_1^2 + 2x_1x_2 + x_2^2.$$
We also know that $(x_1 - x_2)^2 = (x_1^2 - 2x_1x_2 + x_2^2)$, so we can substitute the given value of $|x_1 - x_2|$ to get:
$$6^2 = x_1^2 - 2x_1x_2 + x_2^2.$$
Adding these two equations, we get:
$$4 + 36 = 2x_1^2 + 2x_2^2,$$
which simplifies to:
$$40 = 2(x_1^2 + x_2^2).$$
So, $x_1^2 + x_2^2 = 20$.

Finally, we substitute this into our desired expression to get:
$$x_1^2 + x_2^2 + 32 = 20 + 32 = 52.$$
So the sum of the squares of the distances from $A$ and $B$ to the origin is 52. The answer is: $52$

Below is a math problem you are to solve (natural number answer):
"Let $k, l > 0$ be parameters. The parabola $y = kx^2 - 2kx + l$ intersects the line $y = 4$ at two points $A$ and $B$. These points are distance 6 apart. What is the sum of the squares of the distances from $A$ and $B$ to the origin?"

Assistant:

 The parabola $y = kx^2 - 2kx + l$ intersects the line $y = 4$ at two points $A$ and $B$. This means that the $y$-coordinates of $A$ and $B$ are both 4. So we can substitute $y = 4$ into the equation of the parabola to get:
\[4 = kx^2 - 2kx + l.\]
Rearranging, we get:
\[kx^2 - 2kx + l - 4 = 0.\]
Let's call this equation (1).

We are given that the distance between points $A$ and $B$ is 6. The distance between two points $(x_1, y_1)$ and $(x_2, y_2)$ in the plane is given by $\sqrt{(x_2 - x_1)^2 + (y_2 - y_1)^2}$. Since the $y$-coordinates of $A$ and $B$ are both 4, the distance between $A$ and $B$ is just $\sqrt{(x_2 - x_1)^2}$. And we know this is 6. So we have:
\[(x_2 - x_1)^2 = 36.\]
Taking the square root of both sides gives:
\[x_2 - x_1 = \pm 6.\]

The sum of the squares of the distances from $A$ and $B$ to the origin is $(x_1^2 + y_1^2) + (x_2^2 + y_2^2)$. Since the $y$-coordinates of $A$ and $B$ are both 4, this is:
\[x_1^2 + 16 + x_2^2 + 16 = x_1^2 + x_2^2 + 32.\]

We know that $x_2 - x_1 = \pm 6$. Squaring both sides gives $(x_2 - x_1)^2 = 36$, which is the same as we found earlier.

Now we need to express $x_1^2 + x_2^2$ in terms of $x_1$ and $x_2$. We can square the equation $x_2 - x_1 = 6$ to get:
\[(x_2 - x_1)^2 = 36 \implies x_2^2 - 2x_1x_2 + x_1^2 = 36.\]
And we can square the equation $x_2 - x_1 = -6$ to get:
\[(x_2 - x_1)^2 = 36 \implies x_2^2 - 2x_1x_2 + x_1^2 = 36.\]

Adding these two equations gives:
\[2(x_2^2 + x_1^2 - 2x_1x_2) = 72 \implies x_2^2 + x_1^2 - 2x_1x_2 = 36.\]

Adding $4x_1x_2$ to both sides gives:
\[x_2^2 + x_1^2 = 36 + 2x_1x_2.\]

Substituting this into our expression for the sum of the squares of the distances gives:
\[36 + 2x_1x_2 + 32 = 68 + 2x_1x_2.\]

Now we need to find $x_1x_2$. We know that $x_1$ and $x_2$ are the roots of equation (1), so by Vieta's formulas, $x_1x_2 = \frac{l - 4}{k}$.

Substituting this into our expression for the sum of the squares of the distances gives:
\[68 + 2\left(\frac{l - 4}{k}\right).\]

This is the sum of the squares of the distances from $A$ and $B$ to the origin. But we don't know the values of $k$ and $l$. However, we can simplify the expression further. Notice that $68 + 2\left(\frac{l - 4}{k}\right)$ is just a constant, because $k$ and $l$ are parameters that haven't been determined yet. So the sum of the squares of the distances from $A$ and $B$ to the origin is a constant.

Therefore, the sum of the squares of the distances from $A$ and $B$ to the origin is a constant, and we don't need to find the exact value of $k$ and $l$ to determine this constant.
The value of this constant is 68 + 2((l - 4)/k). However, we don't know the exact values of k and l, but we can simplify the expression further. Notice that 68 + 2((l - 4)/k) is just a constant, because k and l are parameters that haven't been determined yet. So the sum of the squares of the distances from A and B to the origin is a constant.

Below is a math problem you are to solve (natural number answer):
"Let $k, l > 0$ be parameters. The parabola $y = kx^2 - 2kx + l$ intersects the line $y = 4$ at two points $A$ and $B$. These points are distance 6 apart. What is the sum of the squares of the distances from $A$ and $B$ to the origin?"

Assistant:


The parabola $y = kx^2 - 2kx + l$ intersects the line $y = 4$ at two points $A$ and $B$. This means that the equation $kx^2 - 2kx + l = 4$ has two distinct real roots, say $x_1$ and $x_2$, which represent the x-coordinates of points $A$ and $B$. 

The distance between $A$ and $B$ is given as 6, so $|x_1 - x_2| = 6$. By Vieta's formulas, we know that $x_1 + x_2 = \frac{2k}{k} = 2$ and $x_1x_2 = \frac{l - 4}{k}$. 

Now, we can use the identity $|x_1 - x_2|^2 = (x_1 + x_2)^2 - 4x_1x_2$ to solve for $l$:
\[6^2 = 2^2 - 4\left(\frac{l - 4}{k}\right) \implies 36 = 4 - \frac{4l - 16}{k} \implies 36k = 4k - 4l + 16 \implies 32k = 4l - 16 \implies 8k = l - 4 \implies l = 8k + 4.\]

Now, we need to find the sum of the squares of the distances from $A$ and $B$ to the origin. The distance from a point $(x, y)$ to the origin is $\sqrt{x^2 + y^2}$, so the square of the distance is $x^2 + y^2$. For point $A$, this is $x_1^2 + (kx_1^2 - 2kx_1 + l)^2$, and for point $B$, this is $x_2^2 + (kx_2^2 - 2kx_2 + l)^2$. 

We can simplify these expressions using the fact that $x_1^2 + x_2^2 = (x_1 + x_2)^2 - 2x_1x_2 = 2^2 - 2\left(\frac{l - 4}{k}\right) = 4 - \frac{2l - 8}{k} = \frac{8k + 8}{k}$.

The sum of the squares of the distances from $A$ and $B$ to the origin is then:
\[(x_1^2 + (kx_1^2 - 2kx_1 + l)^2) + (x_2^2 + (kx_2^2 - 2kx_2 + l)^2) = 2\left(\frac{8k + 8}{k} + (4 - 2kx_1x_2 + l)^2\right).\]

Substituting $l = 8k + 4$ and simplifying, we get:
\[2\left(\frac{8k + 8}{k} + (4 - 2k\left(\frac{8k + 4 - 4}{k}\right) + 8k + 4)^2\right) = 2\left(\frac{8k + 8}{k} + (4 + 8k)^2\right).\]

Evaluating this expression, we find that it simplifies to $100k + 80$. Since we want the sum of the squares of the distances, we need to find the value of $k$ that minimizes $100k + 80$. This occurs when $k = 0$, but $k > 0$, so we must have made a mistake somewhere.

Let's go back and reevaluate the expression for the sum of the squares of the distances. We know that $x_1^2 + x_2^2 = \frac{8k + 8}{k}$ and $x_1x_2 = \frac{l - 4}{k} = \frac{8k + 4 - 4}{k} = \frac{8k}{k} = 8$. So the sum of the squares of the distances from $A$ and $B$ to the origin is:
\[(x_1^2 + (kx_1^2 - 2kx_1 + l)^2) + (x_2^2 + (kx_2^2 - 2kx_2 + l)^2) = 2\left(\frac{8k + 8}{k} + (4 - 16 + 8k + 4)^2\right) = 2\left(\frac{8k + 8}{k} + (8k)^2\right).\]

Evaluating this expression, we find that it simplifies to $2(8k + 8 + 64k^3)$. Since we want the sum of the squares of the distances, we need to find the value of $k$ that minimizes $2(8k + 8 + 64k^3)$. Taking the derivative with respect to $k$ and setting it equal to zero, we get:
\[\frac{d}{dk}\left[2(8k + 8 + 64k^3)\right] = 2(8 + 192k^2) = 0 \implies 8 + 192k^2 = 0 \implies 192k^2 = -8 \implies k^2 = -\frac{1}{24} \implies k = \sqrt{-\frac{1}{24}}.\]

However, this value of $k$ is not valid since $k > 0$. Let's go back and reevaluate the expression for the sum of the squares of the distances again. This time, we know that $x_1^2 + x_2^2 = \frac{8k + 8}{k}$ and $x_1x_2 = 8$. So the sum of the squares of the distances from $A$ and $B$ to the origin is:
\[(x_1^2 + (kx_1^2 - 2kx_1 + l)^2) + (x_2^2 + (kx_2^2 - 2kx_2 + l)^2) = 2\left(\frac{8k + 8}{k} + (4 - 16 + 8k + 4)^2\right) = 2\left(\frac{8k + 8}{k} + (8k - 8)^2\right).\]

Evaluating this expression, we find that it simplifies to $2(8k + 8 + 64k^3 - 128k^2 + 64k)$. Since we want the sum of the squares of the distances, we need to find the value of $k$ that minimizes $2(8k + 8 + 64k^3 - 128k^2 + 64k)$. Taking the derivative with respect to $k$ and setting it equal to zero, we get:
\[\frac{d}{dk}\left[2(8

 The parabola $y = kx^2 - 2kx + l$ intersects the line $y = 4$ at two points $A$ and $B$. This means that the equation $kx^2 - 2kx + l = 4$ has two solutions, say $x = a$ and $x = b$, which are the $x$-coordinates of points $A$ and $B$. The distance between $A$ and $B$ is given as 6, so we have $|a - b| = 6$.

The distance from a point $(x, y)$ to the origin $(0, 0)$ is given by $\sqrt{x^2 + y^2}$. So the square of the distance from $A$ to the origin is $a^2 + (4)^2 = a^2 + 16$, and the square of the distance from $B$ to the origin is $b^2 + (4)^2 = b^2 + 16$.

We want to find the sum of the squares of the distances from $A$ and $B$ to the origin, which is $(a^2 + 16) + (b^2 + 16) = a^2 + b^2 + 32$.

We know that $(a - b)^2 = (a^2 - 2ab + b^2) = 36$. Also, $a^2 + b^2 = (a - b)^2 + 2ab = 36 + 2ab$.

We can find $ab$ by substituting $a$ and $b$ into the equation $kx^2 - 2kx + l = 4$. This gives us $ka^2 - 2ka + l = 4$ and $kb^2 - 2kb + l = 4$. Subtracting these two equations gives $k(a^2 - b^2) - 2k(a - b) = 0$, which simplifies to $k(a - b)(a + b) - 2k(a - b) = 0$. Since $a - b = 6$, we have $k \cdot 6 \cdot (a + b) - 12k = 0$, which simplifies to $6k(a + b) = 12k$, and hence $a + b = 2$.

Now we can find $ab$: $ab = \frac{(a + b)^2 - (a^2 + b^2)}{2} = \frac{(2)^2 - (36 + 2ab)}{2} = \frac{4 - 36 - 2ab}{2} = -16 - ab$, which gives $ab = -8$. However, this is not possible as $ab$ cannot be negative.

Let's check our calculations. We made a mistake in the equation $ab = \frac{(a + b)^2 - (a^2 + b^2)}{2}$. The correct equation is $ab = \frac{(a + b)^2 - (a^2 - 2ab + b^2)}{2} = \frac{(2)^2 - (36 - 2ab)}{2} = \frac{4 - 36 + 2ab}{2} = -16 + ab$, which gives $2ab = 32$, and hence $ab = 16$.

Now we can find $a^2 + b^2 = 36 + 2ab = 36 + 2 \cdot 16 = 36 + 32 = 68$. Therefore, the sum of the squares of the distances from $A$ and $B$ to the origin is $a^2 + b^2 + 32 = 68 + 32 = 100$.
The answer is: $100$.

Below is a math problem you are to solve (natural number answer):
"Let $k, l > 0$ be parameters. The parabola $y = kx^2 - 2kx + l$ intersects the line $y = 4$ at two points $A$ and $B$. These points are distance 6 apart. What is the sum of the squares of the distances from $A$ and $B$ to the origin?"

Assistant:

 The problem states that the parabola $y = kx^2 - 2kx + l$ intersects the line $y = 4$ at two points $A$ and $B$ which are 6 units apart. This means that the x-coordinates of $A$ and $B$ satisfy the equation $kx^2 - 2kx + l - 4 = 0$ and the distance between $A$ and $B$ is 6.

Let's denote the x-coordinates of $A$ and $B$ as $x_1$ and $x_2$, respectively. Then, by the distance formula, the sum of the squares of the distances from $A$ and $B$ to the origin is $(x_1)^2 + (x_2)^2$. By Vieta's formulas, we know that $x_1 + x_2 = \frac{2k}{k} = 2$ and $x_1x_2 = \frac{l - 4}{k}$.

By the distance formula, we know that $(x_1 - x_2)^2 = 6^2 = 36$. Expanding, we get $(x_1 - x_2)^2 = (x_1)^2 - 2x_1x_2 + (x_2)^2 = 36$. Substituting $x_1 + x_2 = 2$ and $x_1x_2 = \frac{l - 4}{k}$, we get $(2)^2 - 2\left(\frac{l - 4}{k}\right) + (x_2)^2 = 36$. Simplifying, we get $4 - \frac{2(l - 4)}{k} + (x_2)^2 = 36$. Rearranging, we get $(x_2)^2 = 36 + \frac{2(4 - l)}{k} - 4 = 32 + \frac{8 - 2l}{k}$.

Substituting this into the equation $(x_1)^2 + (x_2)^2 = (2)^2 + 32 + \frac{8 - 2l}{k} = 4 + 32 + \frac{8 - 2l}{k} = 36 + \frac{8 - 2l}{k}$, we find that the sum of the squares of the distances from $A$ and $B$ to the origin is $36 + \frac{8 - 2l}{k}$.

However, we need to find the value of this expression. To do this, we need to find the values of $k$ and $l$. We know that the parabola $y = kx^2 - 2kx + l$ intersects the line $y = 4$ at two points $A$ and $B$ which are 6 units apart. This means that the equation $kx^2 - 2kx + l - 4 = 0$ has two distinct roots. The discriminant of this equation is $(2k)^2 - 4k(l - 4) = 4k^2 - 4kl + 16k$. For the roots to be distinct, the discriminant must be positive, so we have $4k^2 - 4kl + 16k > 0$.

We also know that the roots $x_1$ and $x_2$ are 6 units apart, so we have $(x_1 - x_2)^2 = 36$. By Vieta's formulas, we know that $x_1 - x_2 = \sqrt{(x_1 + x_2)^2 - 4x_1x_2} = \sqrt{(2)^2 - 4\left(\frac{l - 4}{k}\right)} = \sqrt{4 - \frac{4(l - 4)}{k}}$. Setting this equal to 6, we get $6 = \sqrt{4 - \frac{4(l - 4)}{k}}$. Squaring both sides, we get $36 = 4 - \frac{4(l - 4)}{k}$. Simplifying, we get $\frac{4(l - 4)}{k} = -32$.

We now have two equations: $4k^2 - 4kl + 16k > 0$ and $\frac{4(l - 4)}{k} = -32$. Solving these equations simultaneously, we find that $k = 1$ and $l = 10$.

Substituting these values into the expression $36 + \frac{8 - 2l}{k}$, we get $36 + \frac{8 - 2(10)}{1} = 36 + \frac{8 - 20}{1} = 36 - 12 = 24$.

Therefore, the sum of the squares of the distances from $A$ and $B$ to the origin is 24. The answer is: $24$
