Below is a math problem you are to solve (natural number answer):
"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"
To accomplish this, first list the problem's constraints, conditions and related knowledge, and thens solve the problem step by step. Be clear so even an idiot can follow your instructions. After solving the problem, output the final numerical answer within \boxed{}.

Assistant:

 The problem's constraints, conditions and related knowledge are:
1. The equation is satisfied only when at least one of the factors is zero.
2. The factors are products of two quadratic expressions.
3. Each quadratic expression is a square, so it is always non-negative.
4. Therefore, each factor is zero only when both quadratic expressions are zero.
5. The quadratic expressions are zero only when their arguments are zero.
6. The arguments of the quadratic expressions are absolute values of the variables, which are always non-negative.
7. Therefore, each factor is zero only when the absolute values of the variables are equal to the given values.
8. This translates to four conditions on the variables $x$ and $y$:
   - $\vert x + y \vert = 10$
   - $\vert x - y \vert = 10$
   - $\vert x \vert = 8$
   - $\vert y \vert = 8$
9. The first two conditions represent lines in the coordinate plane, and the last two conditions represent squares with side length 8 centered at the origin.
10. The intersection of these lines and squares encloses a convex polygon.
11. To find the area of this polygon, we need to find the vertices of the polygon.

To solve the problem step by step:
1. From $\vert x + y \vert = 10$, we have $x + y = \pm 10$. This gives us two lines: $x + y = 10$ and $x + y = -10$.
2. From $\vert x - y \vert = 10$, we have $x - y = \pm 10$. This gives us two more lines: $x - y = 10$ and $x - y = -10$.
3. From $\vert x \vert = 8$, we have $x = \pm 8$. This gives us two lines: $x = 8$ and $x = -8$.
4. From $\vert y \vert = 8$, we have $y = \pm 8$. This gives us two more lines: $y = 8$ and $y = -8$.
5. The intersection of these lines gives us the vertices of the polygon.
6. The vertices are: $(8, 2)$, $(8, -2)$, $(-8, 2)$, $(-8, -2)$, $(2, 8)$, $(-2, 8)$, $(2, -8)$, and $(-2, -8)$.
7. The polygon is a square with side length 10 (the diagonal of the squares with side length 8).
8. The area of the square is $\frac{10^2}{2} = 50$.

The answer is: $50$

Below is a math problem you are to solve (natural number answer):
"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"
To accomplish this, first list the problem's constraints, conditions and related knowledge, and thens solve the problem step by step. Be clear so even an idiot can follow your instructions. After solving the problem, output the final numerical answer within \boxed{}.

Assistant:

 The problem's constraints, conditions, and related knowledge are as follows:

1. The equation is given as $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$.
2. The points $(x, y)$ that satisfy this equation form a convex polygon.
3. To find the area of this polygon, we need to identify the vertices of the polygon and then use a formula to compute the area.

Now, let's solve the problem step by step:

Step 1: The equation is a product of two terms equal to zero, so either the first term is zero or the second term is zero. This gives us two cases to consider:

Case 1: $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$.
This equation is satisfied only when both $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ and $( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$. This implies that $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. Solving these equations gives us $x + y = \pm 10$ and $x - y = \pm 10$. These are the equations of four lines. The vertices of the polygon formed by the intersection of these lines are $(0, 10)$, $(0, -10)$, $(10, 0)$, and $(-10, 0)$.

Case 2: $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$.
This equation is satisfied only when both $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ and $( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$. This implies that $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$. Solving these equations gives us $x = \pm 8$ and $y = \pm 8$. The vertices of the polygon formed by the intersection of these lines are $(8, 8)$, $(8, -8)$, $(-8, 8)$, and $(-8, -8)$.

Step 2: The vertices of the polygon are $(0, 10)$, $(0, -10)$, $(10, 0)$, $(-10, 0)$, $(8, 8)$, $(8, -8)$, $(-8, 8)$, and $(-8, -8)$.

Step 3: To find the area of the polygon, we can divide it into two rectangles. The first rectangle has vertices $(0, 10)$, $(10, 0)$, $(0, -10)$, and $(10, 0)$, and its area is $10 \times 20 = 200$. The second rectangle has vertices $(8, 8)$, $(8, -8)$, $(-8, 8)$, and $(-8, -8)$, and its area is $16 \times 16 = 256$. The total area of the polygon is $200 + 256 = 456$.

So, the area of the convex polygon is 456 square units. The answer is: $456$

Below is a math problem you are to solve (natural number answer):
"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"

Assistant:

 The problem's constraints, conditions and related knowledge are as follows:

1. The equation $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ must be satisfied for all points $(x, y)$ in the polygon.
2. The polygon is convex.
3. The area of the polygon is to be found.

To solve this problem, we need to understand the properties of the absolute value function and how it affects the given equation. The absolute value function $\vert x \vert$ is defined as $x$ if $x \geq 0$ and $-x$ if $x < 0$. Therefore, the expression $\vert x \vert - a = 0$ implies that $x = a$ or $x = -a$.

Now let's analyze the given equation:

The equation is equal to zero if either $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2) = 0$ or $((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$.

From the first case, we have $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. This implies that $x + y = \pm 10$ and $x - y = \pm 10$. Solving these equations, we get the points $(5, 5)$, $(5, -5)$, $(-5, 5)$, and $(-5, -5)$.

From the second case, we have $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$. This implies that $x = \pm 8$ and $y = \pm 8$. Solving these equations, we get the points $(8, 8)$, $(8, -8)$, $(-8, 8)$, and $(-8, -8)$.

Therefore, the polygon is a square with side length 10 units. The area of a square is given by the square of the length of its side, so the area of the polygon is $10^2 = 100$ square units.
The answer is: $100$

Below is a math problem you are to solve (natural number answer):
"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"

Assistant:

 The problem's constraints, conditions and related knowledge are as follows:

The equation is given as:
$$((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0.$$

This equation equals zero if either of the two factors equals zero. So we have two cases to consider:

1. $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$
2. $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$

For the first case, we have:
$$\vert x + y \vert = 10, \quad \vert x - y \vert = 10.$$
This implies that $x + y = \pm 10$ and $x - y = \pm 10$. Solving these equations, we find that the points $(x, y)$ must satisfy one of the following four conditions:
$$x + y = 10, \quad x + y = -10, \quad x - y = 10, \quad x - y = -10.$$

For the second case, we have:
$$\vert x \vert = 8, \quad \vert y \vert = 8.$$
This implies that $x = \pm 8$ and $y = \pm 8$. So the points $(x, y)$ must satisfy one of the following four conditions:
$$x = 8, \quad x = -8, \quad y = 8, \quad y = -8.$$

Combining these two cases, we find that the points $(x, y)$ that satisfy the equation must lie on the square with vertices at $(\pm 8, 8)$, $(\pm 8, -8)$, $(8, \pm 8)$, and $(-8, \pm 8)$. The side length of this square is $16$, so its area is $16^2 = 256$. The answer is: $256$

"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"

Assistant:

 The problem's constraints are given by the equation
\[((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0.\]
This equation is equal to zero if and only if at least one of the factors is equal to zero. Therefore, we have two cases to consider:

1. $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$.
2. $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$.

For the first case, we have $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. This implies that $x + y = \pm 10$ and $x - y = \pm 10$. Solving these equations gives us four lines: $x + y = 10$, $x + y = -10$, $x - y = 10$, and $x - y = -10$. These lines form a square with side length $20$.

For the second case, we have $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$. This implies that $x = \pm 8$ and $y = \pm 8$. These four lines form a square with side length $16$.

The convex polygon formed by the intersection of these two squares is a smaller square with side length $16 - 20/2 = 16 - 10 = 6$. Therefore, the area of the convex polygon is $6^2 = 36$. The answer is: $36$

Assistant:

 The problem's constraints, conditions, and related knowledge are as follows:

1. The expression $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ must hold for all points $(x, y)$ that are inside the polygon.
2. The expression equals zero if either of the two factors equals zero.
3. A factor equals zero if any of its terms equals zero.
4. The absolute value function $\vert x \vert$ is defined as $x$ if $x \geq 0$ and $-x$ if $x < 0$.

Now, let's solve the problem step by step:

1. If $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$, then $\vert x + y \vert = 10$. This implies that $x + y = 10$ or $x + y = -10$.
2. If $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$, then $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. This implies that $x - y = 10$ or $x - y = -10$.
3. If $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$, then $\vert x \vert = 8$. This implies that $x = 8$ or $x = -8$.
4. If $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$, then $\vert y \vert = 8$. This implies that $y = 8$ or $y = -8$.

By combining these conditions, we can deduce that the polygon is a square with side length 16 (since the distances from the origin to the points $(8,8)$, $(8,-8)$, $(-8,8)$, and $(-8,-8)$ are all 16). Therefore, the area of the polygon is $16^2 = 256$.
The answer is: $256$

Assistant:

 The given equation is $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$.
For the product of two numbers to be zero, either one of the numbers must be zero. Thus, we have two cases to consider:

Case 1: $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$. This implies that $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. The only way this can happen is if $x = \pm 10$ and $y = \pm 10$.

Case 2: $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$. This implies that $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$. The only way this can happen is if $x = \pm 8$ and $y = \pm 8$.

So the points that satisfy the equation are $(\pm 10, \pm 10)$ and $(\pm 8, \pm 8)$. These points form a square with side length 20. The area of this square is $20^2 = 400$. The answer is: $400$

Below is a math problem you are to solve (natural number answer):
"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"
To accomplish this, first list the problem's constraints, conditions and related knowledge, and thens solve the problem step by step. Be clear so even an idiot can follow your instructions. After solving the problem, output the final numerical answer within \boxed{}.

Assistant:

 The problem's constraints, conditions, and related knowledge are as follows:

1. The equation is a product of two expressions equal to zero, so either the first expression is zero or the second expression is zero.
2. The absolute value function $|x|$ is equal to $x$ if $x \geq 0$, and $-x$ if $x < 0$.
3. The square of an expression is zero if and only if the expression itself is zero.

Now, let's solve the problem step by step:

Step 1: Solve $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$.
From the constraint 3, we know that if a square is zero, then the expression inside the square must be zero. So, we have $\vert x + y \vert - 10 = 0$, which simplifies to $\vert x + y \vert = 10$. This means that $x + y = 10$ or $x + y = -10$.

Step 2: Solve $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$.
Similarly, we have $\vert x - y \vert - 10 = 0$, which simplifies to $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. This means that $x - y = 10$ or $x - y = -10$.

Step 3: Solve $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$.
Again, we have $\vert x \vert - 8 = 0$, which simplifies to $\vert x \vert = 8$. This means that $x = 8$ or $x = -8$.

Step 4: Solve $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$.
Similarly, we have $\vert y \vert - 8 = 0$, which simplifies to $\vert y \vert = 8$. This means that $y = 8$ or $y = -8$.

Step 5: Combine the solutions from steps 1 to 4.
The solutions from steps 1 to 4 give us a total of 8 pairs of $(x, y)$: $(10, 0)$, $(-10, 0)$, $(0, 10)$, $(0, -10)$, $(8, 2)$, $(8, -10)$, $(-8, 10)$, $(-8, -2)$.

Step 6: Plot the points and determine the convex polygon.
Plotting these points on a coordinate plane, we find that they form a square with side length 16.

Step 7: Calculate the area of the square.
The area of a square is given by the square of the length of its side. So, the area of this square is $16^2 = 256$.
The answer is: $256$.
