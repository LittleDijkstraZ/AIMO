 The given equation is the product of two functions equaling zero. This means that either the first function equals zero or the second function equals zero. 

For the first function $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$, we know that the square of a number is zero if and only if the number itself is zero. Therefore, we must have $\vert x + y \vert - 10 = 0$ and $\vert x - y \vert - 10 = 0$, which simplify to $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. These two equations represent two lines in the plane, and the set of points satisfying either of these equations is the set of all points that lie on these two lines.

For the second function $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$, we again have that the square of a number is zero if and only if the number itself is zero. Therefore, we must have $\vert x \vert - 8 = 0$ and $\vert y \vert - 8 = 0$, which simplify to $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$. These two equations represent two circles in the plane, centered at the origin with radius 8. The set of points satisfying either of these equations is the set of all points that lie on these two circles.

The set of points that satisfy either of these conditions is the set of points that lie on the boundary of a polygon, which is a square with side length 20. The area of this square is $20^2 = 400$.

Therefore, the area of the convex polygon is $\boxed{400}$.

 The area of the polygon is given by the product of the lengths of its sides, which are both 16. Therefore, the area of the convex polygon is $16 \times 16 = 256$.

```python

def polygon_area():
    """The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"""
    side_length = 16

Below is a math problem you are to solve (natural number answer):
"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"
To accomplish this, first list the problem's constraints, conditions and related knowledge, and thens solve the problem step by step. Be clear so even an idiot can follow your instructions. After solving the problem, output the final numerical answer within \boxed{}.

Assistant:

 The problem is to find the area of the convex polygon formed by the points that satisfy the equation.
The equation is:
$$((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0.$$
This equation is the product of two expressions that are both equal to zero. So either the first expression is zero, or the second expression is zero.
For the first expression to be zero, either $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$.
This means that $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ or $\vert x - y \vert = 10$.
For the second expression to be zero, either $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$.
This means that $\vert x \vert = 8$ or $\vert y \vert = 8$, or equivalently, $-8 \leq x \leq 8$ and $-8 \leq y \leq 8$.
Combining these results, the possible solutions are $(x, y)$ such that either $\vert x + y \vert = 10$, $\vert x - y \vert = 10$, $-8 \leq x \leq 8$, or $-8 \leq y \leq 8$.
The region formed by these constraints is a square with side length $16$, so its area is $16^2 = 256$.
Thus, the area of the convex polygon is 256.
The answer is: $256$

"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"

Assistant:


First, we note that the product of two quantities is zero if and only if at least one of the quantities is zero. Hence, we can break the given equation into two separate cases to simplify the problem:

1. $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$
2. $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$

Case 1: $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$
For the sum of two absolute values to be zero, both absolute values must be zero, which means $x + y = 10$ and $x - y = 10$. Adding these two equations, we have $2x = 20$, so $x = 10$. Subtracting the second equation from the first, we have $2y = 0$, so $y = 0$. Therefore, the only solution to this case is the point $(10, 0)$.

Case 2: $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$
For the sum of two absolute values to be zero, both absolute values must be zero, which means $x = 8$ and $y = 8$. Therefore, the only solution to this case is the point $(8, 8)$.

Thus, the equation encloses only two points: $(10, 0)$ and $(8, 8)$. Drawing these points on the coordinate plane, we note that they form a rectangle with side lengths $10 - 0 = 10$ and $8 - 0 = 8$. The area of this rectangle is $10 \times 8 = 80$. Hence, the area of the convex polygon is $80$. The answer is: $80$

"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"

 The equation $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ is true if and only if at least one of the factors is equal to zero. 
This means that either $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$.
The first factor equals zero if and only if $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$, which are the equations of two lines passing through the origin at a $45^\circ$ angle to the x and y axes.
The second factor equals zero if and only if $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$, which are the equations of two circles centered at the origin with radius 8.
The intersection of these lines and circles is a square with side length 16.
The area of this square is $16^2 = 256$. The answer is: $256$
