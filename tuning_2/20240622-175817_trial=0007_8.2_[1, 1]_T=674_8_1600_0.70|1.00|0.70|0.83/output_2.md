 The equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has $4$ distinct solutions.

This equation is a combination of absolute values, and it's helpful to consider the cases when the inner absolute value is positive and negative separately.

Case 1: $\vert x-1 \vert -2 = \frac{m}{100}$
This simplifies to $\vert x-1 \vert = 2 + \frac{m}{100}$.

We can split this into two more cases based on whether $x-1$ is positive or negative:

Case 1a: $x-1 \geq 0$, so $x \geq 1$. The equation becomes $x - 1 = 2 + \frac{m}{100}$, which simplifies to $x = 3 + \frac{m}{100}$.

Case 1b: $x-1 < 0$, so $x < 1$. The equation becomes $-(x - 1) = 2 + \frac{m}{100}$, which simplifies to $x = -1 + \frac{m}{100}$.

Case 2: $\vert x-1 \vert -2 = -\frac{m}{100}$
This simplifies to $\vert x-1 \vert = 2 - \frac{m}{100}$.

Again, we split this into two more cases based on whether $x-1$ is positive or negative:

Case 2a: $x-1 \geq 0$, so $x \geq 1$. The equation becomes $x - 1 = 2 - \frac{m}{100}$, which simplifies to $x = 3 - \frac{m}{100}$.

Case 2b: $x-1 < 0$, so $x < 1$. The equation becomes $-(x - 1) = 2 - \frac{m}{100}$, which simplifies to $x = -1 - \frac{m}{100}$.

For the equation to have $4$ distinct solutions, we need the lower and upper bounds of the solutions to be different for both Case 1 and Case 2. This gives us the following conditions:

$\frac{m}{100} \neq 2$ and $\frac{m}{100} \neq 4$.

Simplifying these inequalities gives $m \neq 200$ and $m \neq 400$.

The values of $m$ that satisfy these conditions and are positive integers are $100 < m < 300$. The number of such values of $m$ is $100$.
The answer is: $100$

The equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has four distinct solutions, which means that the right side of the equation, $\frac{m}{100}$, must be equal to either $1$ or $3$.
If $\frac{m}{100} = 1$, then $m = 100$.
If $\frac{m}{100} = 3$, then $m = 300$.
So, there are only two possible values for $m$.
Therefore, the number of positive integers $m$ for which the equation has four distinct solutions is $2$.
The answer is $\boxed{2}$.

Assistant:

 The absolute value function $|x|$ is defined as:
\[|x| = \begin{cases} x & \text{if } x \geq 0 \\ -x & \text{if } x < 0 \end{cases}\]
So, the equation $||x-1|-2|=\frac{m}{100}$ can be split into two cases:

Case 1: $|x-1|-2 = \frac{m}{100}$.
This simplifies to $|x-1| = 2 + \frac{m}{100}$.
This equation splits into two sub-cases:

Sub-case 1.1: $x-1 = 2 + \frac{m}{100}$.
Solving for $x$ gives $x = 3 + \frac{m}{100}$.

Sub-case 1.2: $x-1 = -2 - \frac{m}{100}$.
Solving for $x$ gives $x = -1 - \frac{m}{100}$.

Case 2: $|x-1|-2 = -\frac{m}{100}$.
This simplifies to $|x-1| = 2 - \frac{m}{100}$.
This equation splits into two sub-cases:

Sub-case 2.1: $x-1 = 2 - \frac{m}{100}$.
Solving for $x$ gives $x = 3 - \frac{m}{100}$.

Sub-case 2.2: $x-1 = -2 + \frac{m}{100}$.
Solving for $x$ gives $x = -1 + \frac{m}{100}$.

So, the four distinct solutions are $3 + \frac{m}{100}$, $-1 - \frac{m}{100}$, $3 - \frac{m}{100}$, and $-1 + \frac{m}{100}$.

For these to be distinct, we must have $3 + \frac{m}{100} \neq -1 - \frac{m}{100}$, $3 + \frac{m}{100} \neq 3 - \frac{m}{100}$, $3 + \frac{m}{100} \neq -1 + \frac{m}{100}$, $-1 - \frac{m}{100} \neq 3 - \frac{m}{100}$, $-1 - \frac{m}{100} \neq -1 + \frac{m}{100}$, and $3 - \frac{m}{100} \neq -1 + \frac{m}{100}$.

Simplifying these inequalities gives $m \neq -400$, $m \neq 0$, $m \neq 200$, and $m \neq 400$.

Therefore, the only possible values of $m$ are the positive integers that are not equal to $0$, $200$, or $400$. There are $99$ such integers. So, the number of positive integers $m$ for which the equation has $4$ distinct solutions is $99$. The answer is: $99$

 The problem is asking for the number of positive integers $m$ such that the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has 4 distinct solutions.

The equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ can be rewritten as $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$.

The absolute value function $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert$ has a graph that consists of three line segments. The equation will have 4 distinct solutions when the value of $\frac{m}{100}$ is equal to the distance between the points where the graph of $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert$ changes from decreasing to increasing or from increasing to decreasing.

The graph of $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert$ changes from decreasing to increasing at $\frac{m}{100}=1$ and from increasing to decreasing at $\frac{m}{100}=3$. Therefore, the equation will have 4 distinct solutions when $\frac{m}{100}$ is equal to $1$ or $3$.

So the positive integers $m$ that satisfy the condition are $m=100$ or $m=300$. Therefore, there are 2 such values of $m$. The answer is: $\boxed{2}$

 The problem asks for the number of positive integers $m$ such that the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has four distinct solutions.

First, let's understand the equation better. The expression inside the absolute value, $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert$, can be thought of as the distance between $x$ and $1$, minus $2$. This means that the equation is asking for the values of $x$ such that the distance between $x$ and $1$ minus $2$ equals $\frac{m}{100}$.

The equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ can have four distinct solutions if and only if $\frac{m}{100}$ is strictly between $1$ and $2$. This is because the expression inside the absolute value can either be positive or negative, and each case will give two equations to solve for $x$. The solutions to these equations will be the four distinct solutions.

So, we need $1 < \frac{m}{100} < 2$. Multiplying all sides by $100$, we get $100 < m < 200$. The positive integers $m$ that satisfy this inequality are the integers from $101$ to $199$, inclusive. The number of these integers is $199 - 101 + 1 = 99$.

So, there are $99$ positive integers $m$ such that the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has four distinct solutions. The answer is: $99$.

The equation \[\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}\] has 4 distinct solutions, we need to find the number of positive integer values of $m$ for which this is true.

First, we need to understand the behavior of the function $f(x) = \vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert$. This function is a piecewise function that can be broken down into four cases based on the value of $x$:

1. If $x < 1$, then $f(x) = \vert -(x-1) - 2 \vert = \vert -x + 1 - 2 \vert = \vert -x - 1 \vert = x + 1 + 2 = x + 3$.
2. If $1 \leq x < 3$, then $f(x) = \vert x - 1 - 2 \vert = \vert x - 3 \vert = 3 - x$.
3. If $3 \leq x < 5$, then $f(x) = \vert x - 1 - 2 \vert = \vert x - 3 \vert = x - 3$.
4. If $x \geq 5$, then $f(x) = \vert x - 1 - 2 \vert = \vert x - 3 \vert = x - 3 - 2 = x - 5$.

So, the function $f(x)$ is a piecewise function with three "jumps" at $x = 1$, $x = 3$, and $x = 5$. The equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has 4 distinct solutions if and only if $\frac{m}{100}$ is equal to the height of one of these jumps, i.e., $\frac{m}{100} = 3$, $\frac{m}{100} = 1$, or $\frac{m}{100} = 2$.

This gives us three possible values for $m$: $m = 300$, $m = 100$, or $m = 200$. Therefore, there are 3 positive integer values of $m$ for which the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has 4 distinct solutions. The answer is: $3$

 The problem asks for the number of positive integers $m$ such that the equation \[\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}\] has $4$ distinct solutions.

First, we note that the right-hand side of the equation, $\frac{m}{100}$, must be nonnegative, so $m$ must be a nonnegative integer.

Next, we consider the equation \[\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}.\]

The expression $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert$ is a piecewise function that takes on the value of $2-x$ when $x \leq 1$, $1$ when $1 < x \leq 3$, and $x-3$ when $x > 3$.

So, the equation has $4$ distinct solutions if and only if $\frac{m}{100}$ is equal to $1$ in the interval $1 < x \leq 3$. This implies that $m = 100$.

Therefore, there is only one positive integer $m$ for which the equation has $4$ distinct solutions, namely $m = 100$. The answer is: $1$

 The problem states that the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has $4$ distinct solutions. We are asked to find the number of positive integers $m$ that satisfy this condition.

The equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ is an absolute value equation with a fractional right-hand side. To solve this equation, we first need to understand the properties of absolute values and how they affect the number of solutions.

The equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ will have $4$ distinct solutions if and only if the fractional right-hand side $\frac{m}{100}$ is equal to $2$. This is because the expression inside the absolute value, $\vert x-1 \vert -2$, can be equal to $2$ or $-2$. Each of these two cases will give rise to two distinct solutions for $x$. Therefore, the only value of $\frac{m}{100}$ that will result in $4$ distinct solutions is $2$.

Setting $\frac{m}{100}=2$, we can solve for $m$:
\[m = 2 \times 100 = 200.\]

Therefore, there is only one positive integer $m$ that will result in the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ having $4$ distinct solutions, and that value is $m = 200$. The answer is: $1$
