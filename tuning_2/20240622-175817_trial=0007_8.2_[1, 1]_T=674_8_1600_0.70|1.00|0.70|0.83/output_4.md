 We are given the following two conditions:
1. $f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$
2. $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$

We need to find the value of $f(100)$.

First, let's find the value of $f(1)$ using the second condition. We have:
$$f(2) = 2f(1) + 1.$$
Since $2 = 2(1)$, we can substitute $n = 1$ into the first condition to get:
$$f(f(f(1))) = 8(1) - 7 = -1.$$
Since the function $f$ maps from $\mathbb{N}$ to $\mathbb{N}$, the value $f(f(f(1))) = -1$ is not possible. So, we must have made a mistake in our reasoning. Let's go back and check our work.

When we substituted $n = 1$ into the first condition, we got $f(f(f(1))) = -1$. However, this doesn't make sense because the function $f$ maps from $\mathbb{N}$ to $\mathbb{N}$, and negative numbers are not in the natural numbers. We must have made an error in our reasoning.

Let's try a different approach. We know that $f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$. If we set $n = 1$, we get:
$$f(f(f(1))) = 8(1) - 7 = 1.$$
This means that $f(f(f(1))) = 1$. Now we can substitute $n = f(1)$ into the second condition to get:
$$f(2f(1)) = 2f(f(1)) + 1.$$
Since $f(f(f(1))) = 1$, we have $2f(1) = f(1) + 1$. Solving for $f(1)$, we get $f(1) = 1$.

Now that we know $f(1) = 1$, we can substitute $n = 1$ into the second condition to get:
$$f(2) = 2f(1) + 1 = 2(1) + 1 = 3.$$
And we can substitute $n = 2$ into the second condition to get:
$$f(4) = 2f(2) + 1 = 2(3) + 1 = 7.$$
And we can substitute $n = 4$ into the second condition to get:
$$f(8) = 2f(4) + 1 = 2(7) + 1 = 15.$$
And so on...

We can continue this process to find $f(100)$. By continuing this process, we find that $f(100) = 191$.

Therefore, the value of $f(100)$ is $191$. The answer is: $191$

Assistant:

 To find the value of $f(100)$, we need to first understand the properties of the function $f(n)$ given the two conditions $f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$ and $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$.

Let's start with $n=1$. From the second condition, we have $f(2) = 2f(1) + 1$. Since $f(f(f(1))) = 8*1 - 7 = -1$, we know that $f(1)$ must be a value such that $f(f(1)) = 1$. From the second condition, we can deduce that $f(1)$ must be an odd number, because $2f(1) + 1$ is always odd.

Now let's consider the first condition. If $n=1$, we have $f(f(f(1))) = 8*1 - 7 = -1$. Since $f(f(1))$ must be an even number (as it equals to 1), we can see that the first condition cannot be true for $n=1$. 

However, if we assume that $f(1)$ is an odd number, then $f(f(1))$ must be an even number as well. Let's assume $f(1) = 1$, then $f(2) = 2*1 + 1 = 3$, and $f(3) = 2*3 + 1 = 7$. If we substitute $n=1$ into the first condition, we get $f(f(f(1))) = f(f(1)) = f(7) = 8*1 - 7 = 1$, which matches the first condition. So we can conclude that $f(1) = 1$.

Now we can use the second condition to find $f(2)$, $f(3)$, $f(4)$, ... and so on. After a few steps, we find that $f(100) = 199$.

So the value of $f(100)$ is $199$.
The answer is: $199$

 To solve this problem, we need to find the value of $f(100)$ given the conditions $f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$ and $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$.
We can start by finding the value of $f(1)$ using the second condition.
Since $2 \cdot 1 = 2$, we have $f(2) = 2f(1) + 1$.
But we also know that $f(f(f(1))) = 8 \cdot 1 - 7 = -1$, and since $f(f(f(1))) = f(f(2))$ (because $f(2) = 2f(1) + 1$), we have $f(f(2)) = -1$.
Substituting $f(2) = 2f(1) + 1$ into $f(f(2)) = -1$, we get $f(2f(1) + 1) = -1$.
Now we can use the second condition again to find $f(1)$.
Since $2 \cdot 1 = 2$, we have $f(2) = 2f(1) + 1$.
Substituting $f(2) = -1$, we get $-1 = 2f(1) + 1$.
Solving for $f(1)$, we find $f(1) = -1$.
Now we can use the first condition to find $f(100)$.
We know that $f(f(f(100))) = 8 \cdot 100 - 7 = 793$.
Since $f(f(f(100))) = f(f(101))$ (because $f(101) = f(f(f(100))) = 793$), we have $f(f(101)) = 793$.
Again using the second condition, we can find $f(101)$.
Since $2 \cdot 100 = 200$, we have $f(200) = 2f(100) + 1$.
Substituting $f(200) = 793$, we get $793 = 2f(100) + 1$.
Solving for $f(100)$, we find $f(100) = \frac{793 - 1}{2} = 396$.
Therefore, the value of $f(100)$ is $396$.
The answer is: $396$

To find $f(100)$, we need to first understand the given function $f$. We know that $f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$ and $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$.

Let's start by plugging $n=1$ into the second equation. We get $f(2)=2f(1)+1$.

Now, let's plug $n=2$ into the second equation. We get $f(4)=2f(2)+1$.

And let's plug $n=4$ into the second equation. We get $f(8)=2f(4)+1$.

Continuing this pattern, we can see that $f(2^k)=2f(2^{k-1})+1$.

Now, let's use the first equation to find $f(1)$. We know that $f(f(f(1)))=8*1-7=1$. Since $f(f(f(1)))=1$, and $f(f(1))$ must be an integer, the only possible value for $f(1)$ is 1. So $f(1)=1$.

Now, we can use the second equation to find $f(2)$. We get $f(2)=2f(1)+1=2*1+1=3$.

Now, we can find $f(4)$ using $f(4)=2f(2)+1=2*3+1=7$.

And we can find $f(8)$ using $f(8)=2f(4)+1=2*7+1=15$.

Continuing this pattern, we find that $f(2^k)=2^k+2^{k-1}-1$.

Now, we can use this pattern to find $f(100)$. First, we express 100 as a power of 2: $100=2^2*5^2$. So $f(100)=f(2^2*5^2)=f(2^2*5^2)=f(2^2)*f(5^2)$.

We know that $f(2^2)=2^2+2^{2-1}-1=4+2-1=5$ and $f(5^2)=5^2+5^{2-1}-1=25+5-1=31$.

So $f(100)=f(2^2)*f(5^2)=5*31=155$.

Therefore, $f(100)=155$. The answer is: $155$

Assistant:

 First, let's list the problem's constraints, conditions and related knowledge:

1. The function $f: \mathbb N \to \mathbb N$ satisfies the following two conditions for all positive integers $n$: $f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$ and $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$.
2. We are to calculate $f(100)$.

To solve this problem, we can start by calculating the value of $f(100)$ using the given conditions.

From the second condition, we have $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$. Let's plug in $n=50$ to get $f(100) = 2f(50) + 1$.

Now we need to find the value of $f(50)$. We can use the second condition again, but this time with $n=25$: $f(50) = 2f(25) + 1$.

Continuing this process, we need to find the values of $f(25)$, $f(12.5)$, and so on. However, we notice that the first condition $f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$ can be used to our advantage.

If we let $n=1$ in the first condition, we get $f(f(f(1)))=8*1-7=1$. Since $f(f(f(1)))=1$, it follows that $f(1)$ must be a number $x$ such that $f(x)=1$.

Now we can use the second condition to find the value of $x$: $f(2) = 2f(1) + 1 = 2x + 1$. Since $f(2)$ must be a number $y$ such that $f(y)=2$, we have $2x + 1 = 2$. Solving for $x$, we get $x=1/2$. However, this doesn't make sense as the function $f$ is defined only on natural numbers.

Let's try another approach. If we let $n=1$ in the first condition again, we get $f(f(f(1)))=8*1-7=1$. Since $f(f(f(1)))=1$, it follows that $f(1)$ must be a number $x$ such that $f(x)=1$.

Now we can use the second condition to find the value of $x$: $f(2) = 2f(1) + 1 = 2x + 1$. Since $f(2)$ must be a number $y$ such that $f(y)=2$, we have $2x + 1 = 2$. Solving for $x$, we get $x=1$. So $f(1) = 1$.

Now we can continue the process to find the values of $f(25)$, $f(50)$, and $f(100)$.

$f(25) = 2f(12.5) + 1$.

Using the first condition, we have $f(f(f(12.5)))=8*12.5-7=88$. Since $f(f(f(12.5)))=88$, it follows that $f(12.5)$ must be a number $z$ such that $f(z)=88$.

Unfortunately, without more information, we cannot directly find the value of $f(12.5)$ from the given conditions. However, we can notice that the function $f$ is periodic with a period of 1. This means that $f(n+1)=f(n)$ for all $n$. Therefore, $f(12.5) = f(1)$, and we can continue the process:

$f(25) = 2f(1) + 1 = 2*1 + 1 = 3$.

$f(50) = 2f(25) + 1 = 2*3 + 1 = 7$.

$f(100) = 2f(50) + 1 = 2*7 + 1 = 15$.

Therefore, $f(100) = 15$.
The answer is: $15$

The function $f: \mathbb N \to \mathbb N$ satisfies two conditions:
1. $f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$.
2. $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$.
We are asked to find $f(100)$.

First, let's find $f(f(100))$ using the second condition. We have:
\[f(2 \cdot 100) = 2f(100) + 1.\]
This simplifies to:
\[f(200) = 2f(100) + 1.\]

Then, let's find $f(f(f(100)))$ using the first condition:
\[f(f(f(100))) = 8 \cdot 100 - 7 = 793.\]

Now we can substitute $f(200)$ from the equation we found earlier into the equation $f(f(f(100))) = 793$:
\[f(f(f(100))) = f(200) = 793.\]

This gives us the equation:
\[2f(100) + 1 = 793.\]

Subtracting 1 from both sides gives:
\[2f(100) = 792.\]

Dividing both sides by 2 gives:
\[f(100) = 396.\]

So, the value of $f(100)$ is 396.
The answer is: $396$

 We are given two conditions for the function $f: \mathbb N \to \mathbb N$. The first condition is $f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$ and the second condition is $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$. We are asked to find the value of $f(100)$.

Let's start by finding $f(1)$. By setting $n=1$ in the second condition, we get $f(2)=2f(1)+1$. Since $f(f(f(1)))=8*1-7=1$, we have $f(f(1))=1$. Again applying the second condition, we get $f(2)=2f(1)+1$. But we also know from the first condition that $f(2)=f(f(1))=1$. So we have $2f(1)+1=1$, which implies $f(1)=0$.

Now we can find $f(2)$ using the second condition: $f(2)=2f(1)+1=2*0+1=1$.

Next, we find $f(3)$ using the second condition: $f(3)=2f(1.5)+1=2*f(1)+1=2*0+1=1$.

We can see a pattern here: $f(1)=0$, $f(2)=1$, $f(3)=1$, and so on. It seems like $f(n)=0$ when $n$ is odd and $f(n)=1$ when $n$ is even.

Now we can find $f(100)$. Since $100$ is even, we have $f(100)=1$.

So the value of $f(100)$ is $1$. The answer is: $1$

Assistant:

 The problem gives us two conditions for the function $f(n)$:
1. $f(f(f(n))) = 8n - 7$.
2. $f(2n) = 2f(n) + 1$.

We want to find the value of $f(100)$.

First, let's try to find $f(1)$ using the second condition:
$f(2) = 2f(1) + 1$.

Now, let's use the first condition with $n = 1$:
$f(f(f(1))) = 8*1 - 7 = -1$.

But since $f(n)$ is a function from $\mathbb{N}$ to $\mathbb{N}$, $f(f(f(1)))$ must be a positive integer. This means that $f(f(1))$ must be $1$ because the only way for $f(1)$ to satisfy $f(f(1)) = 1$ in the first condition is if $f(1) = 1$.

Now we can substitute $f(1) = 1$ into the second condition to find $f(2)$:
$f(2) = 2*1 + 1 = 3$.

Now let's use the second condition again to find $f(3)$:
$f(4) = 2*3 + 1 = 7$.

Now let's use the first condition with $n = 3$:
$f(f(f(3))) = 8*3 - 7 = 19$.

Since $f(f(3))$ is the same as $f(4)$, we know that $f(f(3)) = 7$. Now we can substitute $f(3) = 4$ into this equation to find $f(7)$:
$f(7) = 19$.

Now let's use the second condition with $n = 4$:
$f(8) = 2*7 + 1 = 15$.

Now let's use the first condition with $n = 7$:
$f(f(f(7))) = 8*7 - 7 = 51$.

Since $f(f(7))$ is the same as $f(8)$, we know that $f(f(7)) = 15$. Now we can substitute $f(7) = 19$ into this equation to find $f(15)$:
$f(15) = 51$.

Now let's use the second condition with $n = 8$:
$f(16) = 2*15 + 1 = 31$.

Now let's use the first condition with $n = 15$:
$f(f(f(15))) = 8*15 - 7 = 113$.

Since $f(f(15))$ is the same as $f(16)$, we know that $f(f(15)) = 31$. Now we can substitute $f(15) = 51$ into this equation to find $f(31)$:
$f(31) = 113$.

Now let's use the second condition with $n = 16$:
$f(32) = 2*31 + 1 = 63$.

Now let's use the first condition with $n = 31$:
$f(f(f(31))) = 8*31 - 7 = 241$.

Since $f(f(31))$ is the same as $f(32)$, we know that $f(f(31)) = 63$. Now we can substitute $f(31) = 113$ into this equation to find $f(63)$:
$f(63) = 241$.

Now let's use the second condition with $n = 32$:
$f(64) = 2*63 + 1 = 127$.

Now let's use the first condition with $n = 63$:
$f(f(f(63))) = 8*63 - 7 = 503$.

Since $f(f(63))$ is the same as $f(64)$, we know that $f(f(63)) = 127$. Now we can substitute $f(63) = 241$ into this equation to find $f(127)$:
$f(127) = 503$.

At this point, we notice a pattern: the values of $f(n)$ are always one less than a power of $2$. Specifically, $f(n) = 2^k - 1$, where $k$ is the number of times we applied the function $f$ to $n$.

So, to find $f(100)$, we need to find the number of times we need to apply the function $f$ to $100$ to get a value that is one less than a power of $2$.

After testing a few values, we find that after applying the function $f$ three times to $100$, we get a value that is one less than a power of $2$:
$f(f(f(100))) = 8*100 - 7 = 793$.

Since $f(f(100))$ is the same as $f(f(f(f(100)))) = f(793)$, we know that $f(793)$ is a power of $2$ minus $1$. The largest power of $2$ that is less than $793$ is $512$, so $f(793) = 512 - 1 = 511$.

Now we can substitute $f(100) = 793$ into this equation to find $f(511)$:
$f(511) = 2^9 - 1 = 511$.

Therefore, $f(100) = 793$.
The value of $f(100)$ is $793$. The answer is: $793$
