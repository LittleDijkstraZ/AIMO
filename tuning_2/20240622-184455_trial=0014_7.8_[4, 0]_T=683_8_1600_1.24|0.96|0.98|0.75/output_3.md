Below is a math problem you are to solve (natural number answer):
"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"
To accomplish this, first list the problem's constraints, conditions and related knowledge, and thens solve the problem step by step. Be clear so even an idiot can follow your instructions. After solving the problem, output the final numerical answer within \boxed{}.

Assistant:

 The problem's constraints are the absolute value equations. Absolute values are always non-negative, so if the product of two quantities is zero, then at least one of the quantities must be zero. This gives us four equations to solve for the values of x and y:

1. $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0 \Rightarrow \vert x + y \vert = 10$
2. $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0 \Rightarrow \vert x - y \vert = 10$
3. $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0 \Rightarrow \vert x \vert = 8$
4. $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0 \Rightarrow \vert y \vert = 8$

Solving these equations, we get the four vertices of the polygon:
1. $(8, 8)$
2. $(8, -8)$
3. $(-8, 8)$
4. $(-8, -8)$

The polygon is a square with side length of 16 units. The area of a square is given by the formula $s^2$, where $s$ is the length of a side. So the area of this square is $16^2 = 256$. The answer is: $256$.

Assistant:

 The equation provides constraints on $x$ and $y$. The product of two quantities equals zero if and only if at least one of the quantities equals zero. Therefore, this equation is satisfied if either of the following two conditions holds:

(1) $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ and $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ and $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ and $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$.

(2) $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$.

For condition (1) to hold, we must have $\vert x + y \vert = 10$, $\vert x \vert = 8$, $\vert x - y \vert = 10$, and $\vert y \vert = 8$. These imply that the solution is a square with side length 16.

For condition (2) to hold, we must have at least one of the four conditions $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$, $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$, $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$, or $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ is true. However, these conditions are the same as in condition (1), so the solution is still a square with side length 16.

Therefore, the area of the convex polygon is $16^2 = 256$.
The answer is: $256$

Below is a math problem you are to solve (natural number answer):
"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"

Assistant:

 The equation given is $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + (\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + (\vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$. This equation equals to zero if and only if both terms equal to zero. This means

1. $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ and $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ which implies $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. This results in the system of equations $x+y = 10$ and $x-y = 10$ or $x+y = -10$ and $x-y = -10$. The solutions for these system of equations are $(5,5)$ and $(-5,-5)$.

2. $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ and $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ which implies $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$. This results in the system of equations $x=8$ and $y=8$ or $x=-8$ and $y=-8$. The solutions for this system of equations are $(8,8)$, $(-8,8)$, $(8,-8)$ and $(-8,-8)$.

So, the points that satisfy the equation are $(5,5)$, $(-5,-5)$, $(8,8)$, $(-8,8)$, $(8,-8)$ and $(-8,-8)$. These points form a square with side length $10$ (the distance between $(5,5)$ and $(-5,-5)$ or $(8,8)$ and $(-8,-8)$, for example), and thus the area of this square is $10 \times 10 = 100$. The answer is: $100$ square units. $\boxed{100}$

"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"

Assistant:

 The problem is asking for the area of the convex polygon enclosed by the points that satisfy the equation $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + (\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + (\vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$.

The equation is equal to zero if and only if either $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$.

Each of these cases gives us a constraint on $x$ and $y$. Specifically:

1. $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ gives $\vert x + y \vert = 10$, so $x + y = \pm 10$.
2. $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ gives $\vert x - y \vert = 10$, so $x - y = \pm 10$.
3. $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ gives $\vert x \vert = 8$, so $x = \pm 8$.
4. $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ gives $\vert y \vert = 8$, so $y = \pm 8$.

The intersection points are found by solving the system of equations formed by the constraints from the above four cases:

- The intersection of $x + y = 10$ and $x - y = 10$ is $(x, y) = (10, 0)$.
- The intersection of $x + y = 10$ and $x - y = -10$ is $(x, y) = (0, -10)$.
- The intersection of $x + y = -10$ and $x - y = 10$ is $(x, y) = (-10, 0)$.
- The intersection of $x + y = -10$ and $x - y = -10$ is $(x, y) = (0, 10)$.
- The intersection of $x + y = 10$ and $x = 8$ is $(x, y) = (8, 2)$.
- The intersection of $x + y = 10$ and $x = -8$ is $(x, y) = (-8, 18)$.
- The intersection of $x + y = -10$ and $x = 8$ is $(x, y) = (8, -18)$.
- The intersection of $x + y = -10$ and $x = -8$ is $(x, y) = (-8, -2)$.
- The intersection of $x - y = 10$ and $x = 8$ is $(x, y) = (8, -2)$.
- The intersection of $x - y = 10$ and $x = -8$ is $(x, y) = (-8, -18)$.
- The intersection of $x - y = -10$ and $x = 8$ is $(x, y) = (8, 18)$.
- The intersection of $x - y = -10$ and $x = -8$ is $(x, y) = (-8, 2)$.
- The intersection of $y = 8$ and $x - y = 10$ is $(x, y) = (18, 8)$.
- The intersection of $y = 8$ and $x - y = -10$ is $(x, y) = (-2, 8)$.
- The intersection of $y = -8$ and $x - y = 10$ is $(x, y) = (2, -8)$.
- The intersection of $y = -8$ and $x - y = -10$ is $(x, y) = (-18, -8)$.
- The intersection of $x = 8$ and $y = 8$ is $(x, y) = (8, 8)$.
- The intersection of $x = 8$ and $y = -8$ is $(x, y) = (8, -8)$.
- The intersection of $x = -8$ and $y = 8$ is $(x, y) = (-8, 8)$.
- The intersection of $x = -8$ and $y = -8$ is $(x, y) = (-8, -8)$.

The 16 points above are the vertices of the polygon. These points form a square with side length 20. The area of the square is $20^2 = 400$.

Therefore, the area of the convex polygon is 400 square units. The answer is: $400$

Below is a math problem you are to solve (natural number answer):
"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"
To accomplish this, first list the problem's constraints, conditions and related knowledge, and thens solve the problem step by step. Be clear so even an idiot can follow your instructions. After solving the problem, output the final numerical answer within \boxed{}.

Assistant:

 Step 1: Understanding the Problem
The given equation is $0 = ((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2)$. This equation is satisfied if and only if either of the two factors on the left side is zero. This gives us two sets of constraints:

1. $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$.
2. $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$.

Step 2: Analyze the Constraints
For the first set of constraints, $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. This implies that $x + y = 10$ or $x + y = -10$ and $x - y = 10$ or $x - y = -10$. Solving these equations gives us the vertices of the polygon: $(5,5)$, $(5,-5)$, $(-5,5)$, and $(-5,-5)$.

For the second set of constraints, $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$. This implies that $x = 8$ or $x = -8$ and $y = 8$ or $y = -8$. Solving these equations gives us the vertices of the polygon: $(8,8)$, $(8,-8)$, $(-8,8)$, and $(-8,-8)$.

Step 3: Determine the Convex Polygon
Combining the vertices from both sets of constraints, we have a polygon with vertices at $(5,5)$, $(5,-5)$, $(-5,5)$, $(-5,-5)$, $(8,8)$, $(8,-8)$, $(-8,8)$, and $(-8,-8)$. This polygon is a square with side length 10.

Step 4: Calculate the Area of the Square
The area of a square is given by the formula $s^2$, where $s$ is the length of a side. In this case, $s = 10$. So, the area of the square is $10^2 = 100$.
The answer is: $100$

"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"
To accomplish this, first list the problem's constraints, conditions and related knowledge, and thens solve the problem step by step. Be clear so even an idiot can follow your instructions. After solving the problem, output the final numerical answer within \boxed{}.

Assistant:

 The problem's constraints, conditions and related knowledge is as follows:
The equation given is $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$. For the product of two numbers to be zero, either the first number must be zero or the second number must be zero.
If $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$, then $\vert x + y \vert = 10$. This means $x + y = 10$ or $x + y = -10$.
If $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$, then $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. This means $x - y = 10$ or $x - y = -10$.
If $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$, then $\vert x \vert = 8$. This means $x = 8$ or $x = -8$.
If $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$, then $\vert y \vert = 8$. This means $y = 8$ or $y = -8$.
To solve the system of equations, we can find the intersection points:
For $x + y = 10$ and $x - y = 10$, we get $x = 10$ and $y = 0$.
For $x + y = 10$ and $x - y = -10$, we get $x = 0$ and $y = 10$.
For $x + y = -10$ and $x - y = 10$, we get $x = -10$ and $y = -20$.
For $x + y = -10$ and $x - y = -10$, we get $x = -10$ and $y = 0$.
For $x = 8$ and $y = 8$, we get the point (8, 8).
For $x = 8$ and $y = -8$, we get the point (8, -8).
For $x = -8$ and $y = 8$, we get the point (-8, 8).
For $x = -8$ and $y = -8$, we get the point (-8, -8).
So the points are (0, 10), (10, 0), (-10, -20), (-10, 0), (8, 8), (8, -8), (-8, 8), and (-8, -8).
These points form a square with side length 20 units. The area of the square is $20^2 = 400$ square units.
So the area of the convex polygon is 400 square units. The answer is: $400$

Below is a math problem you are to solve (natural number answer):
"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"

Assistant:

 The problem's constraints, conditions and related knowledge are as follows:

1. The equation to be solved is $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + (\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + (\vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$.
2. We want to find the area of the convex polygon enclosed by the points that satisfy this equation.

The equation equals to 0 if and only if either $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$, $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$, $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$, or $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$.

Setting each of these expressions equal to 0 gives us the following system of equations:

$\vert x + y \vert = 10$, $\vert x - y \vert = 10$, $\vert x \vert = 8$, or $\vert y \vert = 8$.

Solving each of these equations, we get the following points: $(8, 2)$, $(8, -2)$, $(8, 0)$, $(-8, 2)$, $(-8, -2)$, $(-8, 0)$, $(2, 8)$, $(-2, 8)$, $(0, 8)$, $(2, -8)$, $(-2, -8)$, and $(0, -8)$.

Plotting these points on a coordinate plane, we find that they form a square with side length 16. The area of this square is $16^2 = 256$. Therefore, the area of the convex polygon enclosed by the points that satisfy the given equation is 256 square units. The answer is: $\boxed{256}$

Below is a math problem you are to solve (natural number answer):
"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"
To accomplish this, first list the problem's constraints, conditions and related knowledge, and thens solve the problem step by step. Be clear so even an idiot can follow your instructions. After solving the problem, output the final numerical answer within \boxed{}.

Assistant:

 The first step is to understand the constraints of the problem.
The equation gives us two conditions:
1. Either $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$
2. Either $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$

For the first condition, this means that $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ or $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. Considering the absolute values, this gives us four lines: $x + y = 10$, $x + y = -10$, $x - y = 10$, and $x - y = -10$.

For the second condition, this means that $\vert x \vert = 8$ or $\vert y \vert = 8$. Considering the absolute values, this gives us four lines: $x = 8$, $x = -8$, $y = 8$, and $y = -8$.

These eight lines form a rectangle with side lengths of 16 and 20. To find its area, multiply the side lengths: $16 \times 20 = 320$. Therefore, the area of the convex polygon is 320 square units. The answer is: $320$
