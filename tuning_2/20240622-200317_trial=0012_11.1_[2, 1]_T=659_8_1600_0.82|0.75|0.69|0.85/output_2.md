"For how many positive integers $m$ does the equation \[\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}\] have $4$ distinct solutions?"

Assistant:

 The problem asks for the number of positive integers $m$ such that the equation \[\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}\] has $4$ distinct solutions.

The equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ is equivalent to a pair of equations $\vert x-1 \vert -2 = \pm \frac{m}{100}$.

Solving these equations, we get:

1. $\vert x-1 \vert -2 = \frac{m}{100} \implies \vert x-1 \vert = \frac{m}{100} + 2$.
2. $\vert x-1 \vert -2 = -\frac{m}{100} \implies \vert x-1 \vert = 2 - \frac{m}{100}$.

For each of these equations, we have two sub-cases:

1.1. $\vert x-1 \vert = \frac{m}{100} + 2 \implies x-1 = \frac{m}{100} + 2$ or $x-1 = -\left(\frac{m}{100} + 2\right)$.
1.2. $\vert x-1 \vert = 2 - \frac{m}{100} \implies x-1 = 2 - \frac{m}{100}$ or $x-1 = -\left(2 - \frac{m}{100}\right)$.

For each of these sub-cases, we have two more sub-sub-cases:

1.1.1. $x-1 = \frac{m}{100} + 2 \implies x = \frac{m}{100} + 3$.
1.1.2. $x-1 = -\left(\frac{m}{100} + 2\right) \implies x = - \frac{m}{100} - 1$.
1.2.1. $x-1 = 2 - \frac{m}{100} \implies x = 3 - \frac{m}{100}$.
1.2.2. $x-1 = -\left(2 - \frac{m}{100}\right) \implies x = -1 + \frac{m}{100}$.

For the equation to have four distinct solutions, the four expressions for $x$ must be distinct. This means that none of the expressions can be equal to each other for different values of $m$. 

By comparing the expressions, we can see that:

- $x = \frac{m}{100} + 3$ and $x = 3 - \frac{m}{100}$ cannot be equal for any $m$, because they would imply $\frac{m}{100} = - \frac{m}{100}$, which only holds when $m = 0$. However, $m$ must be a positive integer, so this case is not possible.
- $x = - \frac{m}{100} - 1$ and $x = -1 + \frac{m}{100}$ cannot be equal for any $m$, because they would imply $- \frac{m}{100} - 1 = -1 + \frac{m}{100}$, which simplifies to $- \frac{m}{100} = \frac{m}{100}$, which only holds when $m = 0$. Again, this is not possible because $m$ must be a positive integer.
- $x = \frac{m}{100} + 3$ and $x = -1 + \frac{m}{100}$ cannot be equal for any $m$, because they would imply $\frac{m}{100} + 3 = -1 + \frac{m}{100}$, which simplifies to $4 = -1$, which is not possible.
- $x = - \frac{m}{100} - 1$ and $x = 3 - \frac{m}{100}$ cannot be equal for any $m$, because they would imply $- \frac{m}{100} - 1 = 3 - \frac{m}{100}$, which simplifies to $-1 = 3$, which is not possible.

The only way for the four expressions for $x$ to be distinct is if the expressions for $x$ in cases 1.1.1 and 1.2.1 are equal to each other, and the expressions for $x$ in cases 1.1.2 and 1.2.2 are equal to each other. This means that:

$\frac{m}{100} + 3 = 3 - \frac{m}{100} \implies \frac{m}{100} = 0 \implies m = 0$.
$- \frac{m}{100} - 1 = -1 + \frac{m}{100} \implies - \frac{m}{100} = \frac{m}{100} \implies m = 0$.

However, $m$ cannot be $0$ because the equation would become $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=0$, which implies $\vert x-1 \vert -2 = 0$, and then $\vert x-1 \vert = 2$. This has two solutions, $x = 3$ and $x = -1$, but not four distinct solutions.

Therefore, there must be an error in our reasoning. Let's go back and check our work.

Upon closer inspection, we realize that we made a mistake in our reasoning. The expressions for $x$ in cases 1.1.1 and 1.2.1 are equal to each other, and the expressions for $x$ in cases 1.1.2 and 1.2.2 are equal to each other, but these equalities only hold when $m = 0$. However, as we mentioned earlier, $m$ cannot be $0$ because the equation would not have four distinct solutions.

Our mistake was in assuming that the expressions for $x$ in cases 1.1.1 and 1.2.1 (or 1.1.2 and 1.2.2) must be equal to each other for all values of $m$. This is not necessarily true.

Let's reconsider the problem. The equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has four distinct solutions if and only if the equations $\vert x-1 \vert -2 = \frac{m}{100}$ and $\vert x-1 \vert -2 = -\frac{m}{100}$ each have two distinct solutions.

The equation $\vert x-1 \vert -2 = \frac{m}{100}$ is equivalent to $\vert x-1 \vert = \frac{m}{100} + 2$. This equation has two solutions if and only if $\frac{m}{100} +

Assistant:

 The given equation is $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$.
The number of distinct solutions of this equation is equal to 4 if and only if $\frac{m}{100}=1$.
This is because the expression on the left side of the equation, $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert$, can take on the values of 0, 1, 2, or 3, and only when $\frac{m}{100}=1$ it takes on the value of 1 exactly 4 times.
Therefore, we need to solve the equation $\frac{m}{100}=1$ for $m$.

Assistant:


The equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has 4 distinct solutions. We need to find the number of positive integers $m$ for which this is true.

The right-hand side of the equation, $\frac{m}{100}$, must be positive, so $m$ must be positive.

The absolute value function makes the expression inside it non-negative. So, $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert$ is either 0 or greater than or equal to 0.

If $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=0$, then $\vert x-1 \vert = 2$, which implies $x-1 = 2$ or $x-1 = -2$. Solving these equations gives $x = 3$ or $x = -1$. So, the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=0$ has two solutions, $x = 3$ and $x = -1$.

If $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert > 0$, then $\vert x-1 \vert -2 = \frac{m}{100}$ or $\vert x-1 \vert -2 = -\frac{m}{100}$.

For $\vert x-1 \vert -2 = \frac{m}{100}$, we have $\vert x-1 \vert = 2 + \frac{m}{100}$. This implies $x-1 = 2 + \frac{m}{100}$ or $x-1 = -2 - \frac{m}{100}$. Solving these equations gives $x = 3 + \frac{m}{100}$ or $x = -1 - \frac{m}{100}$.

For $\vert x-1 \vert -2 = -\frac{m}{100}$, we have $\vert x-1 \vert = 2 - \frac{m}{100}$. This implies $x-1 = 2 - \frac{m}{100}$ or $x-1 = -2 + \frac{m}{100}$. Solving these equations gives $x = 3 - \frac{m}{100}$ or $x = -1 + \frac{m}{100}$.

So, the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has 4 distinct solutions if and only if $\frac{m}{100}$ is strictly between -1 and 2. This is equivalent to $-100 < m < 200$.

The positive integers $m$ that satisfy this inequality are the integers from 1 to 199. So, there are 199 positive integers $m$ for which the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has 4 distinct solutions. The answer is: $199$

Assistant:

 The problem asks for the number of positive integers $m$ such that the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has four distinct solutions.

First, let's analyze the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$.

The expression $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert$ can take on three different values:
1. If $\vert x-1 \vert -2 \geq 0$, then $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert = \vert x-1 \vert -2$.
2. If $0 > \vert x-1 \vert -2 > -2$, then $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert = -( \vert x-1 \vert -2) = 2 - \vert x-1 \vert$.
3. If $\vert x-1 \vert -2 \leq -2$, then $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert = -( \vert x-1 \vert -2) = 2 - \vert x-1 \vert$.

So the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ can be rewritten as:
1. $\vert x-1 \vert -2 = \frac{m}{100}$ or $\vert x-1 \vert -2 = -\frac{m}{100}$.
2. $2 - \vert x-1 \vert = \frac{m}{100}$ or $2 - \vert x-1 \vert = -\frac{m}{100}$.

Now let's analyze each case:

1. $\vert x-1 \vert -2 = \frac{m}{100}$:
   $\vert x-1 \vert = \frac{m}{100} + 2$.
   This equation has two solutions for each value of $m$ such that $\frac{m}{100} + 2 > 0$, i.e., $m > -200$.

2. $\vert x-1 \vert -2 = -\frac{m}{100}$:
   $\vert x-1 \vert = 2 - \frac{m}{100}$.
   This equation has two solutions for each value of $m$ such that $2 - \frac{m}{100} > 0$, i.e., $m < 200$.

3. $2 - \vert x-1 \vert = \frac{m}{100}$:
   $\vert x-1 \vert = 2 - \frac{m}{100}$.
   This equation has two solutions for each value of $m$ such that $2 - \frac{m}{100} > 0$, i.e., $m < 200$.

4. $2 - \vert x-1 \vert = -\frac{m}{100}$:
   $\vert x-1 \vert = 2 + \frac{m}{100}$.
   This equation has no solution for any value of $m$ since $2 + \frac{m}{100} > 0$ for all $m$.

So the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has four distinct solutions if and only if $m$ is an integer in the interval $(0, 200)$. Therefore, the number of such positive integers $m$ is 200. The answer is: $200$

 The equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has 4 distinct solutions if and only if $\frac{m}{100} = 1$. This is because the expression on the left side of the equation, $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert$, can take on values from 0 to 3 only, and it equals 1 exactly when it has 4 distinct solutions. So we have $\frac{m}{100} = 1$, which implies $m = 100$. Therefore, there is only one positive integer $m$ for which the equation has 4 distinct solutions, and that is $m = 100$. The answer is: $1$

Assistant:

 The problem states that the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has $4$ distinct solutions. We need to find the value of $m$ that satisfies this condition.

First, let's consider the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$. The right-hand side of this equation, $\frac{m}{100}$, is a positive number because $m$ is a positive integer. The number of distinct solutions of the equation depends on the value of $\frac{m}{100}$.

The equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has $4$ distinct solutions when $\frac{m}{100}$ is equal to $2$. This is because the expression inside the absolute value, $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert$, can be either $2$, $-2$, $0$, or some other positive number. When it equals $2$, we get $4$ distinct solutions.

So, we need to find the value of $m$ such that $\frac{m}{100}=2$. To do this, we can multiply both sides of the equation by $100$ to get $m=200$.

Therefore, the value of $m$ that makes the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ have $4$ distinct solutions is $200$. The answer is: $200$

 The equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has 4 distinct solutions. This equation involves absolute values, which can make it a bit tricky to solve. However, we can break it down into cases based on the value of $x$.

Case 1: $x \geq 3$
In this case, $\vert x-1 \vert = x-1$, and $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert = \vert x-1-2 \vert = \vert x-3 \vert$. So the equation becomes $\vert x-3 \vert = \frac{m}{100}$. This gives us two sub-cases:

Sub-case 1.1: $x-3 = \frac{m}{100} \Rightarrow x = 3 + \frac{m}{100}$.
Sub-case 1.2: $-(x-3) = \frac{m}{100} \Rightarrow x = 3 - \frac{m}{100}$.

Case 2: $1 \leq x < 3$
In this case, $\vert x-1 \vert = 1-x$, and $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert = \vert 1-x-2 \vert = \vert -x-1 \vert = \vert x+1 \vert$. So the equation becomes $\vert x+1 \vert = \frac{m}{100}$. This gives us two sub-cases:

Sub-case 2.1: $x+1 = \frac{m}{100} \Rightarrow x = \frac{m}{100} - 1$.
Sub-case 2.2: $-(x+1) = \frac{m}{100} \Rightarrow x = -1 - \frac{m}{100}$.

Case 3: $x < 1$
In this case, $\vert x-1 \vert = 1-x$, and $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert = \vert 1-x-2 \vert = \vert -x-1 \vert = \vert x+1 \vert$. So the equation becomes $\vert x+1 \vert = \frac{m}{100}$. This gives us two sub-cases:

Sub-case 3.1: $x+1 = \frac{m}{100} \Rightarrow x = \frac{m}{100} - 1$.
Sub-case 3.2: $-(x+1) = \frac{m}{100} \Rightarrow x = -1 - \frac{m}{100}$.

Now, we need to find the values of $m$ for which the four solutions from the sub-cases are distinct. After some calculations, we find that the only values of $m$ that work are $m = 200, 300, 400, \dots, 900$. So there are 600 possible values of $m$.
The answer is: $1$

Assistant:

 The equation has 4 distinct solutions, which means the right side of the equation, $\frac{m}{100}$, must be equal to one of the four values that make the left side of the equation, $| |x-1|-2|$, have 4 distinct solutions.

The function $| |x-1|-2|$ has a "V" shape with two "humps" on the x-axis. The first hump is at $x=1-2= -1$ and the second hump is at $x=1+2=3$. The distance between the humps is 4 units.

For the equation $| |x-1|-2|=\frac{m}{100}$ to have 4 distinct solutions, the right side, $\frac{m}{100}$, must be equal to one of the four values that make the left side of the equation have 4 distinct solutions. These four values are:

1. The height of the first hump minus the distance between the humps, which is $2-4=-2$.
2. The distance between the humps minus the height of the second hump, which is $4-2=2$.
3. The height of the first hump plus the distance between the humps, which is $2+4=6$.
4. The distance between the humps plus the height of the second hump, which is $4+2=6$.

So, the equation $| |x-1|-2|=\frac{m}{100}$ has 4 distinct solutions when $\frac{m}{100}$ is equal to -2, 2, 6, or 6.

However, we are only interested in the positive integers $m$, so we discard the negative value of -2.

Therefore, the possible values of $m$ are 200 and 600.
The answer is: $2$
