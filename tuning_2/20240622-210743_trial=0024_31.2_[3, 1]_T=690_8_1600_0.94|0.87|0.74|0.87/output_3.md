Below is a math problem you are to solve (natural number answer):
"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"

Assistant:

 The given equation is of the form $AB = 0$, where $A$ and $B$ are two expressions. This equation is satisfied when either $A = 0$ or $B = 0$. Therefore, the given equation is equivalent to two separate conditions:

1. $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$
2. $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$

For the first condition, both terms must be zero, which implies that $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. This means that $x + y = \pm 10$ and $x - y = \pm 10$. Solving these equations, we get the lines $x + y = 10$, $x + y = -10$, $x - y = 10$, and $x - y = -10$.

For the second condition, both terms must be zero, which implies that $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$. This means that $x = \pm 8$ and $y = \pm 8$. So we get the lines $x = 8$, $x = -8$, $y = 8$, and $y = -8$.

The lines $x + y = 10$, $x + y = -10$, $x - y = 10$, and $x - y = -10$ form a square with side length $10\sqrt{2}$, and the lines $x = 8$, $x = -8$, $y = 8$, and $y = -8$ form a square with side length 16. The convex polygon enclosed by these lines is the intersection of these two squares, which is also a square.

The side length of this square is the smaller of the side lengths of the two squares, which is 10$\sqrt{2}$. Therefore, the area of the convex polygon is $(10\sqrt{2})^2 = 200$. The answer is: $200$

Assistant:

 The given equation is a product of two terms equal to zero, so either the first term is zero or the second term is zero.
The first term is zero when $|x+y| = 10$ and $|x-y| = 10$.
The second term is zero when $|x| = 8$ and $|y| = 8$.
The first set of equations implies that $x+y = \pm 10$ and $x-y = \pm 10$. Solving these equations, we get the vertices of the polygon as $(0, 10)$, $(0, -10)$, $(10, 0)$, $(-10, 0)$, $(8, 2)$, $(8, -2)$, $(-8, 2)$, and $(-8, -2)$.
The second set of equations implies that $x = \pm 8$ and $y = \pm 8$.
The polygon is a square with side length $20$.
The area of the square is $20^2 = 400$. The answer is: $400$

Below is a math problem you are to solve (natural number answer):
"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"

Assistant:

 The given equation is $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$.

The product of two factors equals zero if and only if at least one of the factors is zero. Therefore, the equation is satisfied if either:

1. $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$, or
2. $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$.

For the first case, both $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2$ and $( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2$ must be zero. This means $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. This implies that $x + y = \pm 10$ and $x - y = \pm 10$. Solving these equations gives the vertices of the polygon as $(0, 10)$, $(0, -10)$, $(10, 0)$, and $(-10, 0)$.

For the second case, both $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2$ and $( \vert y \vert - 8)^2$ must be zero. This means $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$. This implies that $x = \pm 8$ and $y = \pm 8$. Solving these equations gives the vertices of the polygon as $(8, 8)$, $(8, -8)$, $(-8, 8)$, and $(-8, -8)$.

Combining the vertices from both cases, we find that the polygon is a square with side length $10$. The area of a square is the side length squared, so the area of this square is $10^2 = 100$.

Therefore, the area of the convex polygon is $100$. The answer is: $100$

Below is a math problem you are to solve (natural number answer!):
"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"
Analyze the problem and think step by step to come to a solution with programs. After solving the problem, output the final numerical answer within \boxed{}.

Assistant:

 The problem statement is asking for the area of the convex polygon formed by the points that satisfy the given equation. The equation is $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + (\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + (\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$. 

The equation equals zero if and only if either $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$, $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$, $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$, or $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$. 

These equations are satisfied if and only if $\vert x + y \vert = 10$, $\vert x - y \vert = 10$, $\vert x \vert = 8$, or $\vert y \vert = 8$.

The solutions to $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$ are the lines $x + y = 10$, $x + y = -10$, $x - y = 10$, and $x - y = -10$. The solutions to $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$ are the lines $x = 8$, $x = -8$, $y = 8$, and $y = -8$.

The points that satisfy the given equation are the intersection points of these lines. These lines enclose a square with side length 16. The area of this square is $16^2 = 256$.

So, the area of the convex polygon is 256.

Here is a Python function to calculate the area of the polygon:
```python


INTERMEDIATE OUT :

def polygon_area():
    """The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"""
    side_length = 16
    area = side_length ** 2
    return area

result = polygon_area()
print(result)
```

CODE RESULTS 256

INTERMEDIATE OUT :
```output
256
```
The area of the convex polygon is $256$. The answer is $\boxed{256}$.

Below is a math problem you are to solve (natural number answer):
"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"
To accomplish this, first list the problem's constraints, conditions and related knowledge, and thens solve the problem step by step. Be clear so even an idiot can follow your instructions. After solving the problem, output the final numerical answer within \boxed{}.

Assistant:

 The problem's constraints, conditions, and related knowledge are as follows:

1. The equation is equal to zero, so one of the factors must be zero.
2. The absolute value function $\vert x \vert$ is always non-negative, so $\vert x \vert - a = 0$ implies $\vert x \vert = a$.
3. The absolute value of a real number is equal to its distance from zero on the number line. So $\vert x \vert = a$ implies $x = a$ or $x = -a$.

Now let's solve the problem step by step:

The equation given is $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$. For this equation to be true, one of the factors must be zero. So either:

1. $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$, or
2. $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$.

From the first case, we have $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ and $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$. This implies $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. By the absolute value property, this gives us two pairs of equations:

1. $x + y = 10$ and $x - y = 10$, which simplifies to $x = 10$ and $y = 0$.
2. $x + y = -10$ and $x - y = -10$, which simplifies to $x = -10$ and $y = 0$.

From the second case, we have $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ and $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$. This implies $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$. By the absolute value property, this gives us four possibilities:

1. $x = 8$ and $y = 8$.
2. $x = 8$ and $y = -8$.
3. $x = -8$ and $y = 8$.
4. $x = -8$ and $y = -8$.

So the points that satisfy the equation are $(10, 0)$, $(-10, 0)$, $(8, 8)$, $(8, -8)$, $(-8, 8)$, and $(-8, -8)$. These points form a square with side length $20$. The area of the square is side length squared, which is $20^2 = 400$. So the area of the convex polygon is $400$.
The answer is: $400$

"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"

Assistant:

 The problem's constraints, conditions, and related knowledge are:

1. The equation $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ is given.
2. The points $(x, y)$ that satisfy this equation form a convex polygon.
3. The area of this convex polygon is to be found.

To solve the problem, we first need to analyze the equation.

The equation $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ is equal to zero if and only if either of the two factors is zero. This gives us two cases:

Case 1: $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$. This is possible only if $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. This implies that $x + y = \pm 10$ and $x - y = \pm 10$. Solving these equations, we get the points $(5,5)$, $(5,-5)$, $(-5,5)$, and $(-5,-5)$.

Case 2: $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$. This is possible only if $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$. This implies that $x = \pm 8$ and $y = \pm 8$. Solving these equations, we get the points $(8,8)$, $(8,-8)$, $(-8,8)$, and $(-8,-8)$.

Now, plotting these points on the coordinate plane, we can see that they form a square with side length $10$. The area of this square is $10^2 = 100$. Therefore, the area of the convex polygon formed by the points $(x, y)$ that satisfy the given equation is $100$.
The answer is: $100$

"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"

Assistant:

 The problem's constraints are given by the equation
\[((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0.\]
This equation is equal to zero if and only if at least one of the factors is equal to zero. This gives us two cases to consider:

Case 1: $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$.
This equation is only possible if $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. This means $x + y = \pm 10$ and $x - y = \pm 10$. Solving these equations, we find that the points satisfying these conditions are $(10,0)$, $(-10,0)$, $(0,10)$, and $(0,-10)$.

Case 2: $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$.
This equation is only possible if $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$. This means $x = \pm 8$ and $y = \pm 8$. Solving these equations, we find that the points satisfying these conditions are $(8,8)$, $(8,-8)$, $(-8,8)$, and $(-8,-8)$.

The points from both cases together form a square with side length $20$. The area of this square is $20^2 = 400$. So, the area of the convex polygon is $400$. The answer is: $400$

Below is a math problem you are to solve (natural number answer):
"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"
To accomplish this, first list the problem's constraints, conditions and related knowledge, and thens solve the problem step by step. Be clear so even an idiot can follow your instructions. After solving the problem, output the final numerical answer within \boxed{}.

Assistant:

 The problem's constraints, conditions and related knowledge are:

1. The equation is equal to zero, which means that either the first term or the second term must be zero.
2. The absolute value function $|\cdot|$ makes the expression nonnegative.
3. The square of a nonnegative number is zero if and only if the number itself is zero.
4. The area of a convex polygon can be found using the shoelace formula or by breaking it down into triangles and summing their areas.

Now, let's solve the problem step by step:

Step 1: The first term is $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)$. If this term is zero, then $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. This means $x + y = \pm 10$ and $x - y = \pm 10$. We can solve these equations to get the four lines $x + y = 10$, $x + y = -10$, $x - y = 10$, and $x - y = -10$.

Step 2: The second term is $((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2)$. If this term is zero, then $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$. This means $x = \pm 8$ and $y = \pm 8$. We can get the four lines $x = 8$, $x = -8$, $y = 8$, and $y = -8$.

Step 3: The intersection of the lines from Step 1 and Step 2 forms a square with side length 10 (since the distance between the lines $x + y = 10$ and $x + y = -10$ is 10, and similarly for the other two pairs of lines).

Step 4: The area of a square is the square of the length of one side, so the area of the square is $10^2 = 100$.
The answer is: $100$
