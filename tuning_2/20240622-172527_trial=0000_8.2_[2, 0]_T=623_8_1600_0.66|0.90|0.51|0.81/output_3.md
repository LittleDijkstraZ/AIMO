 The given equation is a product of two terms equal to zero. This means that either the first term is zero or the second term is zero. 

Let's analyze the two terms separately:

1. For the first term, $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$, this is only possible if $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. This means that $x + y = \pm 10$ and $x - y = \pm 10$. Solving these equations gives us the vertices of the square: $(0, 10)$, $(0, -10)$, $(10, 0)$, and $(-10, 0)$.

2. For the second term, $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$, this is only possible if $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$. This means that $x = \pm 8$ and $y = \pm 8$. Solving these equations gives us the vertices of the square: $(8, 0)$, $(-8, 0)$, $(0, 8)$, and $(0, -8)$.

The convex polygon formed by the union of these two squares is a $16 \times 16$ square. The area of this square is $16^2 = 256$. So, the area of the convex polygon is 256.

Here is a Python code to calculate the area:

```python

def area_of_polygon():
    """The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"""
    side_length = 16
    area = side_length ** 2
    return area

result = area_of_polygon()
print(result)
```

The area of the convex polygon is $256$. The answer is $\boxed{256}$.

 The given equation is a product of two terms equal to zero. Therefore, either the first term is zero or the second term is zero.

The first term is zero when $\vert x + y \vert - 10 = 0$ or $\vert x - y \vert - 10 = 0$. These equations simplify to $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. The solutions to these equations are all the points in the plane that are at a distance of 10 units from the lines $x + y = 10$, $x + y = -10$, $x - y = 10$, and $x - y = -10$. These lines form a rectangle with vertices at $(0, 10)$, $(10, 0)$, $(0, -10)$, and $(-10, 0)$.

The second term is zero when $\vert x \vert - 8 = 0$ or $\vert y \vert - 8 = 0$. These equations simplify to $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$. The solutions to these equations are all the points in the plane that are at a distance of 8 units from the $x$-axis and the $y$-axis. These lines form a square with vertices at $(8, 8)$, $(8, -8)$, $(-8, 8)$, and $(-8, -8)$.

The intersection of the rectangle and the square is the convex polygon whose area we are to find. The vertices of this polygon are the intersection points of the rectangle and the square. These intersection points are $(8, 8)$, $(8, -8)$, $(-8, 8)$, and $(-8, -8)$.

The area of a rectangle is given by the product of its length and width. The length of the rectangle is $20$ and the width is $20$, so the area of the rectangle is $20 \times 20 = 400$.

The area of a square is given by the square of the length of one of its sides. The side length of the square is $16$, so the area of the square is $16 \times 16 = 256$.

The area of the convex polygon is the area of the rectangle minus the area of the square, which is $400 - 256 = 144$.

Therefore, the area of the convex polygon is $144$. The answer is: $144$

Below is a math problem you are to solve (natural number answer):
"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"
To accomplish this, first list the problem's constraints, conditions and related knowledge, and thens solve the problem step by step. Be clear so even an idiot can follow your instructions. After solving the problem, output the final numerical answer within \boxed{}.

Assistant:

 The problem's constraints, conditions, and related knowledge are as follows:

1. The equation is $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$.
2. The product of two numbers is zero if and only if at least one of the numbers is zero.
3. Therefore, either $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$.
4. If a square of a real number is zero, then the number itself must be zero. Therefore, either $\vert x + y \vert - 10 = 0$ and $\vert x - y \vert - 10 = 0$ or $\vert x \vert - 8 = 0$ and $\vert y \vert - 8 = 0$.
5. Solving the above equations, we get four sets of solutions: $(x, y) = (8, 8)$, $(x, y) = (8, -8)$, $(x, y) = (-8, 8)$, and $(x, y) = (-8, -8)$.
6. These points form a square with side length 16.
7. The area of a square is the square of its side length. Therefore, the area of the square is $16^2 = 256$.

So, the area of the convex polygon is 256. The answer is: $256$

Below is a math problem you are to solve (natural number answer!):
"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"
Analyze the problem and think step by step to come to a solution with programs. After solving the problem, output the final numerical answer within \boxed{}.

Assistant:

 The problem statement is quite complex, but we can simplify it. The expression $A \cdot B = 0$ means that either $A = 0$ or $B = 0$. Therefore, the given equation is equivalent to the following system of equations:

1. $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$
2. $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$
3. $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$
4. $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$

From equations 3 and 4, we get that $|x| = 8$ and $|y| = 8$, which means $-8 \leq x, y \leq 8$.

From equations 1 and 2, we get that $|x + y| = 10$ and $|x - y| = 10$. These equations represent the equations of two lines in the plane: $x + y = 10$ and $x + y = -10$, $x - y = 10$ and $x - y = -10$. By plotting these lines, we find that they form a square with side length 10. The area of this square is $10^2 = 100$. Therefore, the area of the convex polygon is 100 square units. The answer is: $100$

The first term is zero when either $|x + y| - 10 = 0$ or $|x - y| - 10 = 0$, which simplifies to $|x + y| = 10$ or $|x - y| = 10$. These are the equations of two lines passing through the origin with slopes 1 and -1 respectively.

The intersection points of these lines form a square with side length 16. The area of this square is $16^2 = 256$. Therefore, the area of the convex polygon is 256 square units.
