 The problem is asking for how many values of $m$ the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has four distinct solutions.

The equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ can be rewritten as a piecewise function:
\[
\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\begin{cases}
\vert x-1 \vert -2 = \frac{m}{100}, &\text{if } \vert x-1 \vert -2 \ge 0 \\
-(\vert x-1 \vert -2) = \frac{m}{100}, &\text{if } \vert x-1 \vert -2 < 0
\end{cases}
\]

This simplifies to:
\[
\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\begin{cases}
\vert x-1 \vert -2 = \frac{m}{100}, &\text{if } x \ge 3 \\
2 - \vert x-1 \vert = \frac{m}{100}, &\text{if } x < 1 \\
\vert x-1 \vert -2 = -\frac{m}{100}, &\text{if } 1 \le x \le 3 \\
2 - \vert x-1 \vert = -\frac{m}{100}, &\text{if } x > 3
\end{cases}
\]

Each of these cases gives two linear equations in $x$. We can solve these equations and find the number of distinct solutions for each case.

For the first case ($x \ge 3$), we have $\vert x-1 \vert -2 = \frac{m}{100}$, which simplifies to $x-1 -2 = \frac{m}{100}$, or $x = \frac{m}{100} + 3$. This gives one solution.

For the second case ($x < 1$), we have $2 - \vert x-1 \vert = \frac{m}{100}$, which simplifies to $2 - (1 - x) = \frac{m}{100}$, or $x = 1 - \frac{m}{100}$. This gives one solution.

For the third case ($1 \le x \le 3$), we have $\vert x-1 \vert -2 = -\frac{m}{100}$, which simplifies to $x-1 -2 = -\frac{m}{100}$, or $x = 1 - \frac{m}{100}$. This gives one solution.

For the fourth case ($x > 3$), we have $2 - \vert x-1 \vert = -\frac{m}{100}$, which simplifies to $2 - (x-1) = -\frac{m}{100}$, or $x = 3 + \frac{m}{100}$. This gives one solution.

So, for each value of $m$, we get four distinct solutions. The problem asks for how many values of $m$ there are exactly four distinct solutions. This means we are looking for the number of positive integers $m$ such that $\frac{m}{100} < 2$. The largest such $m$ is $200$, so the number of such $m$ is $200$.

Therefore, there are 200 positive integers $m$ for which the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has four distinct solutions. The answer is: $200$

 The problem is asking for how many positive integers $m$ does the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ have $4$ distinct solutions.

This equation is a piecewise function, which can be solved by considering different cases based on the value of $x$.

The piecewise function can be rewritten as:

- If $x \geq 3$, then the equation becomes $\vert x-3 \vert = \frac{m}{100}$. This gives us two equations: $x-3 = \frac{m}{100}$ and $-(x-3) = \frac{m}{100}$. Solving these two equations gives us $x = 3 + \frac{m}{100}$ and $x = 3 - \frac{m}{100}$.
- If $1 \leq x < 3$, then the equation becomes $\vert x-1 -2 \vert = \frac{m}{100}$, which simplifies to $\vert x-3 \vert = \frac{m}{100}$. This leads to the same solutions as in the previous case.
- If $x < 1$, then the equation becomes $\vert -x+1 -2 \vert = \frac{m}{100}$, which simplifies to $\vert -x-1 \vert = \frac{m}{100}$, or $\vert x+1 \vert = \frac{m}{100}$. This gives us two equations: $x+1 = \frac{m}{100}$ and $-(x+1) = \frac{m}{100}$, which simplify to $x = \frac{m}{100} - 1$ and $x = -1 - \frac{m}{100}$.

For the equation to have four distinct solutions, the two positive solutions must be greater than 1 and the two negative solutions must be less than 1. This means $\frac{m}{100} - 1 > 1$ and $-1 - \frac{m}{100} < 1$. Solving these inequalities gives $m > 200$ and $m < -200$. However, $m$ must be a positive integer, so there are no values of $m$ that satisfy these conditions.

Therefore, the number of positive integers $m$ for which the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has $4$ distinct solutions is $0$. The answer is: $0$

 The problem asks for the number of positive integers $m$ such that the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has $4$ distinct solutions.

This equation is a piecewise function, and its solutions depend on the value of $\frac{m}{100}$. The piecewise function can be split into three cases based on the value of $\frac{m}{100}$:
1. When $\frac{m}{100} < 2$, the equation becomes $\vert x-1 \vert -2 = \frac{m}{100}$, which simplifies to $\vert x-1 \vert = 2 + \frac{m}{100}$. This equation has two solutions: $x = 1 + 2 + \frac{m}{100} = 3 + \frac{m}{100}$ and $x = 1 - 2 - \frac{m}{100} = -1 - \frac{m}{100}$.
2. When $2 \leq \frac{m}{100} < 4$, the equation becomes $\vert x-1 \vert -2 = \frac{m}{100}$, which simplifies to $\vert x-1 \vert = 2 + \frac{m}{100}$. This equation has two solutions: $x = 1 + 2 + \frac{m}{100} = 3 + \frac{m}{100}$ and $x = 1 - 2 - \frac{m}{100} = -1 - \frac{m}{100}$.
3. When $\frac{m}{100} \geq 4$, the equation becomes $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$, which simplifies to $\vert x-1 \vert -2 = \frac{m}{100}$, which further simplifies to $\vert x-1 \vert = 2 + \frac{m}{100}$. This equation has two solutions: $x = 1 + 2 + \frac{m}{100} = 3 + \frac{m}{100}$ and $x = 1 - 2 - \frac{m}{100} = -1 - \frac{m}{100}$.

From the above analysis, we can see that the equation has 4 distinct solutions when $2 \leq \frac{m}{100} < 4$. This means $\frac{m}{100}$ should be in the range $[2, 4)$. Therefore, $m$ should be in the range $[200, 400)$. The number of positive integers in this range is $400 - 200 + 1 = 201$.

So, the number of positive integers $m$ such that the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has $4$ distinct solutions is $201$.

Assistant:

 The problem asks for the number of positive integers $m$ such that the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has four distinct solutions.

The equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ is a piecewise function, and it has four distinct solutions when $\frac{m}{100}$ is equal to $1$ or $3$.

If $\frac{m}{100}=1$, then $m=100$.
If $\frac{m}{100}=3$, then $m=300$.

Therefore, there are two possible values of $m$, namely $100$ and $300$. The positive integers $m$ that satisfy the equation are $100$ and $300$. The number of such integers is $2$. The answer is: $2$

Assistant:

 The number of distinct solutions to the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ is equal to 4 if and only if $\frac{m}{100} = 2$.
To see this, note that the expression $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert$ can take on the values $0$, $1$, $2$, and $3$ only.
If $\frac{m}{100} > 2$, then the equation has less than 4 distinct solutions.
If $\frac{m}{100} < 2$, then the equation has more than 4 distinct solutions.
Therefore, the only value of $m$ that works is $m=200$.

So the number of positive integers $m$ for which the equation has 4 distinct solutions is 1. The answer is: $1$

Assistant:

 The problem states that the equation \[\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}\] has $4$ distinct solutions. The right side of the equation, $\frac{m}{100}$, must be positive, so $m$ must be positive. The left side of the equation, $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert$, is the absolute value of the difference between the absolute value of $x-1$ and $2$. This expression is equal to a positive number if and only if the absolute value of $x-1$ is greater than $2$. Therefore, the solutions to the equation are the values of $x$ that satisfy $\vert x-1 \vert > 2$. These are the values of $x$ that are less than $-1$ or greater than $3$.

The equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has $4$ distinct solutions if and only if $\frac{m}{100}$ is equal to the distance between the lines $x=-1$ and $x=3$, which is $4$. Therefore, we must have $\frac{m}{100}=4$, so $m=400$.
The value of $m$ that satisfies the equation is $400$. The answer is: $1$

 The problem asks for the number of positive integers $m$ such that the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has $4$ distinct solutions.

The equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ can be rewritten as $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=0.01m$.

The equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=0$ has three solutions: $x=3$, $x=1$, and $x=-1$. This is because $\vert x-1 \vert -2=0$ has solutions when $\vert x-1 \vert=2$, which gives $x=3$ and $x=-1$, and $\vert x-1 \vert=0$, which gives $x=1$.

For the equation to have four distinct solutions, one of the "islands" of the absolute value function must be shifted up or down by $0.01m$. This will create a new solution somewhere between the two existing solutions.

For the island to be shifted up by $0.01m$, we must have $2-0.01m>0$, or $m<200$. The island can be shifted down by $0.01m$ if $0.01m<2$, or $m<200$.

So the value of $m$ must be such that $0<m<200$. The positive integers in this range are the integers from $1$ to $199$.

Therefore, there are $199$ positive integers $m$ for which the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has $4$ distinct solutions. The answer is: $199$.

Assistant:

 The equation \[\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}\] has 4 distinct solutions.
We know that $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert$ is a function that has a graph of a "V" shape with the vertex at $(1,2)$.
The value of $\frac{m}{100}$ determines the width of the "V" shape.
For the equation to have 4 distinct solutions, the "V" shape must be wide enough to intersect the x-axis at 4 distinct points.
This means that $\frac{m}{100}$ must be greater than 2 but less than 3.
So, $2 < \frac{m}{100} < 3$.
Multiplying all sides of the inequalities by 100 gives $200 < m < 300$.
The positive integers $m$ that satisfy this inequality are the integers from 201 to 299, inclusive.
To find the number of these integers, we subtract the smallest integer from the largest integer and add 1.
So, the number of positive integers $m$ is $299 - 201 + 1 = 99$.
The answer is: $99$
