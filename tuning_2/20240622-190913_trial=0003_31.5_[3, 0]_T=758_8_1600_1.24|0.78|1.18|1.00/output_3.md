 The problem's constraints, conditions, and related knowledge are:

1. The equation $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ has only one solution: $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. This implies $x + y = \pm 10$ and $x - y = \pm 10$. Solving these equations gives us the vertices of the polygon: $(0, 10), (0, -10), (10, 0), (-10, 0)$.
2. The equation $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ has only one solution: $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$. This implies $x = \pm 8$ and $y = \pm 8$. So the vertices of the polygon also include $(8, 8), (8, -8), (-8, 8), (-8, -8)$.
3. To find the area of the polygon, we can divide it into four triangles formed by the origin and two adjacent vertices. The area of each triangle can be found using the formula $\frac{1}{2} \times \text{base} \times \text{height}$. For example, the triangle formed by $(0, 0)$, $(0, 10)$, and $(10, 0)$ has a base of 10 and a height of 10, so its area is $\frac{1}{2} \times 10 \times 10 = 50$.
4. The total area of the polygon is the sum of the areas of the four triangles. The areas of the other three triangles can be calculated similarly:
   - Triangle formed by $(0, 0)$, $(0, -10)$, and $(-10, 0)$: Area = 50.
   - Triangle formed by $(0, 0)$, $(10, 0)$, and $(8, 8)$: Area = 40.
   - Triangle formed by $(0, 0)$, $(-10, 0)$, and $(-8, -8)$: Area = 40.
5. The total area of the polygon is $50 + 50 + 40 + 40 = 180$.

So the area of the convex polygon is 180 square units. The answer is: $180$

Below is a math problem you are to solve (natural number answer):
"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"

Assistant:

 The problem's constraints, conditions and related knowledge are:
1. The equation is given as $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$.
2. If the product of two numbers is zero, then at least one of the numbers must be zero. Therefore, either $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$.
3. For a square of a real number to be zero, the number itself must be zero. Therefore, either $\vert x + y \vert - 10 = 0$, $\vert x - y \vert - 10 = 0$, $\vert x \vert - 8 = 0$, or $\vert y \vert - 8 = 0$.
4. Solving these equations gives us the possible values of $x$ and $y$.

Now, let's solve the problem step by step:

1. From $\vert x + y \vert - 10 = 0$, we have $\vert x + y \vert = 10$. This implies that $x + y = \pm 10$. Similarly, from $\vert x - y \vert - 10 = 0$, we have $\vert x - y \vert = 10$, which implies that $x - y = \pm 10$.
2. From $\vert x \vert - 8 = 0$, we have $\vert x \vert = 8$, which implies that $x = \pm 8$. Similarly, from $\vert y \vert - 8 = 0$, we have $\vert y \vert = 8$, which implies that $y = \pm 8$.
3. Combining these results, we find that the possible combinations of $(x, y)$ are $(\pm 8, \pm 8)$, $(\pm 10, 0)$, $(0, \pm 10)$.
4. These points form a square with side length $10$, so the area of the square is $10^2 = 100$.

The area of the convex polygon is $100$. The answer is: $100$

Below is a math problem you are to solve (natural number answer):
"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"

Assistant:

 First, we need to understand the constraints of the problem. The equation given is $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$. In mathematics, the product of two numbers is zero if and only if at least one of the numbers is zero. So, this equation is equivalent to either $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$.

For the first equation, $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$, the only way this equation can be true is if $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. This implies that $x + y = \pm 10$ and $x - y = \pm 10$. Solving these equations, we get $x = y = 5$ or $x = -y = 5$. So, the points $(x, y)$ that satisfy this equation are $(5, 5)$ and $(5, -5)$.

For the second equation, $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$, the only way this equation can be true is if $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$. This implies that $x = \pm 8$ and $y = \pm 8$. So, the points $(x, y)$ that satisfy this equation are $(8, 8)$, $(8, -8)$, $(-8, 8)$, and $(-8, -8)$.

Now, we plot these points on a coordinate plane and connect them to form a polygon. The polygon formed is a square with side length 10 units. The area of a square is given by side length squared, so the area of this square is $10^2 = 100$ square units. Therefore, the area of the convex polygon enclosed by the points $(x, y)$ is 100 square units. The answer is: $100$

Below is a math problem you are to solve (natural number answer):
"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"

Assistant:

 First, we need to understand the problem and its constraints. The equation given is:
$$((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0.$$
For the product of two numbers to be zero, either one of the numbers must be zero. Therefore, we have two cases to consider:

Case 1: $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$. This implies that $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. These conditions can only be satisfied if $x = 0$ and $y = 0$.

Case 2: $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$. This implies that $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$. These conditions can only be satisfied if $-8 \leq x \leq 8$ and $-8 \leq y \leq 8$.

Combining these results, we find that the points $\left(x, y\right)$ that satisfy the original equation lie on a square with side length $16$ (from $-8$ to $8$ in both the $x$ and $y$ directions). The area of this square is $16^2 = 256$. Therefore, the area of the convex polygon is $256$ square units. The answer is: $256$

Below is a math problem you are to solve (natural number answer):
"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"

Assistant:

 First, let's analyze the problem. The expression $AB=0$ implies that either $A=0$ or $B=0$. So, the equation is satisfied if either of the following two sets of conditions is met:

1. $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ and $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ and $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ and $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$.
2. $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ and $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ and $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ and $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$.

From the first set of conditions, we have:

- $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ implies that $x + y = 10$ or $x + y = -10$.
- $\vert x \vert = 8$ implies that $x = 8$ or $x = -8$.
- $\vert x - y \vert = 10$ implies that $x - y = 10$ or $x - y = -10$.
- $\vert y \vert = 8$ implies that $y = 8$ or $y = -8$.

From the second set of conditions, there are no additional solutions because all four absolute value expressions must be equal to zero. Therefore, the solutions are the intersections of the following four lines:

- $x + y = 10$, $x + y = -10$, $x - y = 10$, $x - y = -10$, $x = 8$, $x = -8$, $y = 8$, and $y = -8$.

These lines form a square with side length 10. The area of this square is $10^2 = 100$. Therefore, the area of the convex polygon is 100 square units. The answer is: $100$

Assistant:

 The problem's constraints, conditions, and related knowledge are as follows:
1. The equation is $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$.
2. This equation is equal to zero if and only if either of the two factors is equal to zero.
3. The equation $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ implies $\vert x + y \vert = 10$.
4. The equation $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ implies $\vert x - y \vert = 10$.
5. The equation $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ implies $\vert x \vert = 8$.
6. The equation $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ implies $\vert y \vert = 8$.
7. From 3 and 5, we have $-8 \leq x, y \leq 8$.
8. From 4, we have either $x + y = 10$ or $x + y = -10$.
9. From 4, we also have either $x - y = 10$ or $x - y = -10$.
10. By considering all possible combinations of the above equations, we find that the points $(x, y)$ that satisfy the equation are the vertices of a square with side length 10.

Now, let's solve the problem step by step:
1. From 10, we know that the points $(x, y)$ that satisfy the equation are the vertices of a square with side length 10.
2. The area of a square is given by the formula $s^2$, where $s$ is the side length.
3. So, the area of the square is $10^2 = 100$.

Therefore, the area of the convex polygon enclosed by the points $(x, y)$ that satisfy the equation is 100 square units. The answer is: $\boxed{100}$
