 The problem asks for how many positive integers $m$ does the equation \[\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}\] have $4$ distinct solutions.

First, we need to understand the equation better. The equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ is a piecewise function with four cases to consider based on the absolute value inside the absolute value:

1. When $x-1 \ge 2$, we have $|x-1-2|=|x-3|=\frac{m}{100}$. This simplifies to $|x-3|=\frac{m}{100}$.
2. When $1 \le x-1 < 2$, we have $|(x-1)-2|=|x-3|=\frac{m}{100}$. This simplifies to $|-x+3|=\frac{m}{100}$.
3. When $0 \le x-1 < 1$, we have $|-(x-1)-2|=|-x+3|=\frac{m}{100}$. This simplifies to $|-x+3|=\frac{m}{100}$.
4. When $x-1 < 0$, we have $-(x-1)-2=-x+1=\frac{m}{100}$. This simplifies to $|-x+1|=\frac{m}{100}$.

Now, let's analyze each case:

1. In the first case, $|x-3|=\frac{m}{100}$ has two solutions $x=3+\frac{m}{100}$ and $x=3-\frac{m}{100}$.
2. In the second case, $|-x+3|=\frac{m}{100}$ has two solutions $x=3+\frac{m}{100}$ and $x=3-\frac{m}{100}$.
3. In the third case, $|-x+3|=\frac{m}{100}$ has two solutions $x=3+\frac{m}{100}$ and $x=3-\frac{m}{100}$.
4. In the fourth case, $|-x+1|=\frac{m}{100}$ has two solutions $x=1+\frac{m}{100}$ and $x=1-\frac{m}{100}$.

So, in all cases, we have two solutions for each case. The total number of solutions for the equation is 4.

Therefore, for the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ to have $4$ distinct solutions, there must be one value of $m$ such that $\frac{m}{100} \neq 0$. The smallest positive integer value for $m$ is $1$.

So, there is only one positive integer $m$ that makes the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ have $4$ distinct solutions, which is $m=1$.
The answer is: $1$

Assistant:

 First, let's list the problem's constraints, conditions, and related knowledge.

The equation is $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$.

We want to find the number of positive integers $m$ for which the equation has $4$ distinct solutions.

We know that the absolute value function makes a value positive, so $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert$ is always nonnegative.

The right side of the equation, $\frac{m}{100}$, is also nonnegative since $m$ is a positive integer.

This means that the equation is equivalent to the pair of equations $\vert x-1 \vert -2 = \frac{m}{100}$ and $\vert x-1 \vert -2 = -\frac{m}{100}$.

Next, let's solve the problem step by step.

First, we can rewrite the absolute value equations as $\vert x-1 \vert = 2 + \frac{m}{100}$ and $\vert x-1 \vert = 2 - \frac{m}{100}$.

The left side of these equations, $\vert x-1 \vert$, is nonnegative, so the right sides must also be nonnegative. This gives us the constraints $2 - \frac{m}{100} \geq 0$ and $2 + \frac{m}{100} \geq 0$.

Solving these constraints, we find that $m \leq 200$ and $m \geq -200$. However, $m$ must be a positive integer, so the only valid constraint is $m \leq 200$.

Next, we need to find the number of values of $m$ for which the original equation has $4$ distinct solutions.

This happens when the two equations $\vert x-1 \vert = 2 + \frac{m}{100}$ and $\vert x-1 \vert = 2 - \frac{m}{100}$ each have two distinct solutions.

For $\vert x-1 \vert = 2 + \frac{m}{100}$ to have two distinct solutions, we need $2 + \frac{m}{100} > 0$, which gives us $m > -200$.

For $\vert x-1 \vert = 2 - \frac{m}{100}$ to have two distinct solutions, we need $2 - \frac{m}{100} > 0$, which gives us $m < 200$.

Combining these inequalities, we find that $-200 < m < 200$.

Since $m$ is a positive integer, the possible values of $m$ are the integers from $1$ to $199$.

However, we want the number of values of $m$ for which the original equation has $4$ distinct solutions.

For each value of $m$, the original equation is equivalent to a pair of equations with two distinct solutions each.

So, for each value of $m$, the original equation has $4$ distinct solutions.

Therefore, the number of positive integers $m$ for which the equation has $4$ distinct solutions is simply the number of integers from $1$ to $199$, which is $199$.
The answer is: $199$

 The problem states that the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has 4 distinct solutions. The equation involves absolute values, which makes it a bit complicated. However, we can break it down and solve it step by step.

Step 1: Simplify the equation
First, let's get rid of the fraction on the right side. Multiply both sides by 100 to get $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert = m$.

Step 2: Understand the structure of the equation
The equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert = m$ can be interpreted as: the distance between $x$ and 1, and then the distance of that result from 2, is equal to $m$. This is a "double absolute value" equation, which typically has four cases to consider.

Step 3: Solve the equation
To find the number of solutions for $m$, we need to consider the different cases for the absolute value equations. The equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert = m$ breaks down into four cases:

Case 1: $x-1 \ge 2$, which simplifies to $x \ge 3$. The equation becomes $\vert x-1-2 \vert = m$, or $\vert x-3 \vert = m$. This gives us two sub-cases: $x-3 = m$ or $x-3 = -m$, or $x = m+3$ or $x = 3-m$.

Case 2: $1 \le x \le 2$, which simplifies to $1 \le x \le 2$. The equation becomes $\vert x-1+2 \vert = m$, or $\vert x+1 \vert = m$. This gives us two sub-cases: $x+1 = m$ or $x+1 = -m$, or $x = m-1$ or $x = -m-1$. However, since $1 \le x \le 2$, only $x = m-1$ is valid.

Case 3: $x \le 1$, which simplifies to $x \le 1$. The equation becomes $\vert 1-x-2 \vert = m$, or $\vert -x-1 \vert = m$, or $\vert x+1 \vert = m$. This gives us two sub-cases: $x+1 = m$ or $x+1 = -m$, or $x = m-1$ or $x = -m-1$. However, since $x \le 1$, only $x = -m-1$ is valid.

Now we need to count the number of distinct solutions for each case and add them up.

Case 1 gives us 2 solutions: $x = m+3$ and $x = 3-m$.
Case 2 gives us 1 solution: $x = m-1$.
Case 3 gives us 1 solution: $x = -m-1$.

So the total number of distinct solutions is 4. This means that for each value of $m$, the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert = m$ has exactly 4 distinct solutions. Therefore, there is only one value of $m$ that satisfies this condition: $m = 1$.
The answer is: $1$

Assistant:

 First, we need to understand the problem and the conditions that need to be satisfied for the equation to have 4 distinct solutions.

The equation is \[\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}\].

We know that this equation will have 4 distinct solutions if and only if $\frac{m}{100}$ is strictly between 1 and 2 (i.e., $1 < \frac{m}{100} < 2$). This is because the function $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert$ has a "V" shape with vertices at $x=1$ and $x=3$, and the value of $\frac{m}{100}$ determines the "width" of the "V" shape.

So we need to find the values of $m$ such that $1 < \frac{m}{100} < 2$. Multiplying all parts of the inequality by 100 gives $100 < m < 200$.

The positive integers $m$ that satisfy this inequality are exactly the integers from 101 to 199, inclusive. There are $199 - 101 + 1 = 99$ such integers.

Therefore, the number of positive integers $m$ for which the equation has 4 distinct solutions is 99. The answer is: $99$

Assistant:

 The equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has 4 distinct solutions.
We know that the absolute value function $\vert x \vert$ is defined as:
\[
\vert x \vert = 
\begin{cases} 
x & \text{if } x \geq 0 \\
-x & \text{if } x < 0 
\end{cases}
\]
So the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ can be split into two cases:

Case 1: $\vert x-1 \vert -2 = \frac{m}{100}$.
In this case, $\vert x-1 \vert = 2 + \frac{m}{100}$.
This gives us two sub-cases:

Sub-case 1.1: $x-1 = 2 + \frac{m}{100}$.
Solving this equation gives $x = 3 + \frac{m}{100}$.

Sub-case 1.2: $-(x-1) = 2 + \frac{m}{100}$.
Solving this equation gives $x = -1 + \frac{m}{100}$.

Case 2: $\vert x-1 \vert -2 = -\frac{m}{100}$.
In this case, $\vert x-1 \vert = 2 - \frac{m}{100}$.
This gives us two sub-cases:

Sub-case 2.1: $x-1 = 2 - \frac{m}{100}$.
Solving this equation gives $x = 3 - \frac{m}{100}$.

Sub-case 2.2: $-(x-1) = 2 - \frac{m}{100}$.
Solving this equation gives $x = -1 - \frac{m}{100}$.

Now we need to find the values of $m$ such that these four solutions are distinct.

We can see that the solutions are distinct if and only if the denominators $\frac{m}{100}$ are different.

This means that $m$ must be a multiple of 100.

However, we also need the absolute values of the four solutions to be less than 3 (since the absolute value of $x-1$ is at most 2).

Checking the four solutions, we find that only the solution $x = 3 - \frac{m}{100}$ satisfies this condition.

Setting $x = 3 - \frac{m}{100} < 3$, we find that $m > 0$.

Therefore, the only values of $m$ that satisfy all the conditions are the multiples of 100 that are greater than 0.

Since $m$ must be a positive integer, the number of such values of $m$ is the number of positive multiples of 100.

Since there are 100 positive multiples of 100 less than or equal to 10000 (the maximum value of $m$ given that $\frac{m}{100} < 3$), there are 100 values of $m$ that satisfy the conditions.
The answer is: $100$

The problem asks for the number of positive integers $m$ such that the equation \[\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}\] has $4$ distinct solutions.

To start solving the problem, we first note that the right side of the equation, $\frac{m}{100}$, must be positive, so $m$ must be a positive integer.

Next, we consider the absolute value function $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert$. This function is a piecewise function that can take on the values of $0$, $1$, or $3$ for different ranges of $x$.

The function equals $0$ when $\vert x-1 \vert = 2$, which gives us $x = 3$ or $x = -1$.
The function equals $1$ when $1 < \vert x-1 \vert < 3$, which gives us $-1 < x < 3$ but $x \neq 1$.
The function equals $3$ when $\vert x-1 \vert > 3$, which gives us $x < -1$ or $x > 3$.

So the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has $4$ distinct solutions when $\frac{m}{100}$ is equal to $1$. Therefore, $m = 100$.

So the only positive integer $m$ for which the equation has $4$ distinct solutions is $100$. The answer is: $\boxed{1}$

The problem is asking for the number of positive integers $m$ such that the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has $4$ distinct solutions.

The equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ involves absolute values, which make it difficult to solve directly. However, we can simplify it by considering the different cases for the absolute values.

Case 1: If $\vert x-1 \vert -2 \ge 0$, then the equation becomes $\vert x-1 \vert -2 = \frac{m}{100}$. We can further simplify this to $\vert x-1 \vert = 2 + \frac{m}{100}$. This gives us two sub-cases:

Sub-case 1.1: If $x-1 \ge 0$, then $x-1 = 2 + \frac{m}{100}$, which simplifies to $x = 3 + \frac{m}{100}$.
Sub-case 1.2: If $x-1 < 0$, then $-(x-1) = 2 + \frac{m}{100}$, which simplifies to $x = -1 + \frac{m}{100}$.

Case 2: If $\vert x-1 \vert -2 < 0$, then the equation becomes $-\vert x-1 \vert +2 = \frac{m}{100}$. We can further simplify this to $\vert x-1 \vert = 2 - \frac{m}{100}$. This gives us two sub-cases:

Sub-case 2.1: If $x-1 \ge 0$, then $x-1 = 2 - \frac{m}{100}$, which simplifies to $x = 3 - \frac{m}{100}$.
Sub-case 2.2: If $x-1 < 0$, then $-(x-1) = 2 - \frac{m}{100}$, which simplifies to $x = -1 - \frac{m}{100}$.

Now we need to find the values of $m$ for which these equations have 4 distinct solutions. This occurs when the four equations from the sub-cases intersect each other in a non-trivial way. By plotting these equations, we find that the only way this can happen is when $0 < \frac{m}{100} < 2$. This gives us $0 < m < 200$. The positive integers $m$ in this range are from $1$ to $199$, making a total of $199$ values. However, we need to check if all these values result in 4 distinct solutions.

After checking, we find that for $1 \le m \le 100$, the four equations from the sub-cases intersect each other in a non-trivial way, giving 4 distinct solutions. For $101 \le m \le 199$, the four equations do not intersect each other in a non-trivial way, giving only 2 or 3 distinct solutions. Therefore, the number of positive integers $m$ for which the equation has 4 distinct solutions is $100$. The answer is: $100$

Assistant:

 First, let's break down the problem. The equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has 4 distinct solutions. We need to find out for how many positive integers $m$ this is true.

The absolute value function $\vert x \vert$ splits the number line into two halves. For any $x$, $\vert x \vert = x$ if $x \geq 0$ and $\vert x \vert = -x$ if $x < 0$. So, the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ can be split into two cases based on the value of $\vert x-1 \vert$.

Case 1: If $\vert x-1 \vert \geq 2$, then $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert = \vert x-1 \vert - 2$. So the equation becomes $\vert x-1 \vert - 2 = \frac{m}{100}$, or $\vert x-1 \vert = 2 + \frac{m}{100}$. This gives us two sub-cases:

Sub-case 1.1: If $x-1 \geq 2$, then $x \geq 3$, and the equation becomes $x - 1 = 2 + \frac{m}{100}$, or $x = 3 + \frac{m}{100}$.

Sub-case 1.2: If $x-1 < 2$, then $x < 3$, and the equation becomes $1 - x = 2 + \frac{m}{100}$, or $x = -1 - \frac{m}{100}$.

Case 2: If $\vert x-1 \vert < 2$, then $-2 < x-1 < 2$, or $-1 < x < 3$. In this case, $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert = 2 - \vert x-1 \vert$, so the equation becomes $2 - \vert x-1 \vert = \frac{m}{100}$. This gives us two sub-cases:

Sub-case 2.1: If $x-1 \geq 0$, then $x \geq 1$, and the equation becomes $2 - (x - 1) = \frac{m}{100}$, or $x = 1 - \frac{m}{100}$.

Sub-case 2.2: If $x-1 < 0$, then $x < 1$, and the equation becomes $2 - (1 - x) = \frac{m}{100}$, or $x = - \frac{m}{100}$.

Now, we need to find the values of $m$ for which each of these cases and sub-cases have 4 distinct solutions. 

For Case 1.1, $x = 3 + \frac{m}{100}$, this gives a solution only if $3 + \frac{m}{100} < 3$, which is not possible.
For Case 1.2, $x = -1 - \frac{m}{100}$, this gives a solution only if $-1 - \frac{m}{100} > -1$, which is not possible.
For Case 2.1, $x = 1 - \frac{m}{100}$, this gives a solution only if $1 - \frac{m}{100} < 1$, which is possible if $m > 0$.
For Case 2.2, $x = - \frac{m}{100}$, this gives a solution only if $- \frac{m}{100} < 1$, which is possible if $m > -100$. But $m$ is a positive integer, so the only case that gives 4 distinct solutions is Case 2.1 with $m > 0$.

Now, we need to find the number of positive integers $m$ for which the equation $x = 1 - \frac{m}{100}$ has 4 distinct solutions. This happens when $1 - \frac{m}{100} > -1$, or $m < 100$. And $1 - \frac{m}{100} < 3$, or $m > -80$. The positive integers $m$ that satisfy both conditions are $1, 2, 3, ..., 99$. So there are 99 such positive integers $m$.

The answer is: $\boxed{99}$
