 The problem states that the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has $4$ distinct solutions. We know that $\frac{m}{100}$ is a positive number, so $m$ must be a positive integer.

The equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ can be solved by considering the cases for the absolute values separately.

Case 1: $\vert x-1 \vert -2 = \frac{m}{100}$
This gives us two sub-cases:
Sub-case 1.1: $\vert x-1 \vert -2 > 0$, so $\vert x-1 \vert = 2 + \frac{m}{100}$. This gives us two more sub-cases:
Sub-case 1.1.1: $x-1 = 2 + \frac{m}{100}$, so $x = 3 + \frac{m}{100}$.
Sub-case 1.1.2: $x-1 = -(2 + \frac{m}{100})$, so $x = -1 - \frac{m}{100}$.

Sub-case 1.2: $\vert x-1 \vert -2 < 0$, so $\vert x-1 \vert = 2 - \frac{m}{100}$. This gives us two more sub-cases:
Sub-case 1.2.1: $x-1 = 2 - \frac{m}{100}$, so $x = 3 - \frac{m}{100}$.
Sub-case 1.2.2: $x-1 = -(2 - \frac{m}{100})$, so $x = -1 + \frac{m}{100}$.

Case 2: $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert = -\frac{m}{100}$
However, the left side of the equation is always nonnegative, while the right side is always nonpositive, so there are no solutions in this case.

Now we need to find the values of $m$ for which the four solutions from the first case are distinct. This means that the four expressions for $x$ in terms of $m$ must be different.

For Sub-case 1.1.1: $x = 3 + \frac{m}{100}$
For Sub-case 1.1.2: $x = -1 - \frac{m}{100}$
For Sub-case 1.2.1: $x = 3 - \frac{m}{100}$
For Sub-case 1.2.2: $x = -1 + \frac{m}{100}$

For these expressions to be distinct, we need $\frac{m}{100}$ to be different in each case. This means that $m$ cannot be a multiple of $100$. Therefore, the value of $m$ must be a positive integer that is not a multiple of $100$.

To count the number of such $m$ in the range $1$ to $100$, we can count the multiples of $100$ and subtract from the total number of positive integers up to $100$. The multiples of $100$ in the range $1$ to $100$ are just $100$ itself, so there is $1$ multiple of $100$. The total number of positive integers up to $100$ is $100$. Therefore, the number of positive integers $m$ in the range $1$ to $100$ that are not multiples of $100$ is $100 - 1 = 99$.

Therefore, the number of positive integers $m$ such that the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has $4$ distinct solutions is $99$. The answer is: $99$

Assistant:

 The problem is asking for how many positive integers $m$ the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has $4$ distinct solutions.

The equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ is equivalent to the system of equations:

1. $\vert x-1 \vert -2 = \frac{m}{100}$
2. $\vert x-1 \vert -2 = -\frac{m}{100}$
3. $-\vert x-1 \vert +2 = \frac{m}{100}$
4. $-\vert x-1 \vert +2 = -\frac{m}{100}$

Each of these equations has a graph that is a pair of vertical lines. The distance between the lines in each pair is $\frac{m}{100}$, and the average of the x-coordinates of the lines in each pair is $1$.

For the first equation, the distance between the lines is $2+\frac{m}{100}$, and for the second equation, the distance between the lines is $2-\frac{m}{100}$. For the third equation, the distance between the lines is $2+\frac{m}{100}$, and for the fourth equation, the distance between the lines is $2-\frac{m}{100}$.

For the equation to have 4 distinct solutions, the distances between the lines in the pairs must be positive, which means $2-\frac{m}{100}>0$ and $2+\frac{m}{100}>0$. This implies that $0<m<200$.

Also, for the equation to have 4 distinct solutions, the distances between the lines in the pairs must be different. This means that $2+\frac{m}{100} \neq 2-\frac{m}{100}$, or $\frac{m}{100} \neq -\frac{m}{100}$, or $m \neq 0$.

Therefore, the possible values of $m$ are the positive integers from $1$ to $199$, inclusive. The number of these integers is $199$. The answer is: $199$

Assistant:


The equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has four distinct solutions. This means that the right side of the equation, $\frac{m}{100}$, must be equal to one of the four possible values that make the left side of the equation equal to four distinct values.

The left side of the equation, $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert$, can take on the values $0, 1, 2, 3$ or $4$. For it to be equal to $4$, $\vert x-1 \vert -2$ must be equal to $2$. This implies that $\vert x-1 \vert = 4$, and therefore $x-1 = 4$ or $x-1 = -4$. This gives us the solutions $x = 5$ and $x = -3$.

For the left side of the equation to be equal to $3$, $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert$ must be equal to $3$. This implies that $\vert x-1 \vert -2 = 3$ or $\vert x-1 \vert -2 = -3$. Solving these two equations gives us the solutions $x = 6$ and $x = -2$.

For the left side of the equation to be equal to $2$, $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert$ must be equal to $2$. This implies that $\vert x-1 \vert -2 = 2$ or $\vert x-1 \vert -2 = -2$. Solving these two equations gives us the solutions $x = 3$ and $x = -1$.

Finally, for the left side of the equation to be equal to $1$, $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert$ must be equal to $1$. This implies that $\vert x-1 \vert -2 = 1$ or $\vert x-1 \vert -2 = -1$. Solving these two equations gives us the solutions $x = 4$ and $x = 0$.

So, the possible values of $\frac{m}{100}$ are $1, 2, 3, 4$. This means that $m$ can be $100, 200, 300, 400$. Therefore, there are four possible values for $m$. The answer is: $4$

Assistant:

 The problem asks for the number of positive integers $m$ such that the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has four distinct solutions.

The equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ is a piecewise function with four cases to consider:

1. When $\vert x-1 \vert -2 > 0$, we have $\vert x-1 \vert -2 = \frac{m}{100}$.
2. When $\vert x-1 \vert -2 < 0$, we have $-( \vert x-1 \vert -2) = \frac{m}{100}$.
3. When $\vert x-1 \vert -2 = 0$, we have $\vert x-1 \vert = 2$.
4. When $\frac{m}{100} = 0$, we have $m = 0$.

The third case gives us two solutions: $x = 3$ and $x = -1$. The fourth case does not give us any solutions since $m$ cannot be $0$.

The first case gives us two more solutions:

$\vert x-1 \vert -2 = \frac{m}{100} \implies \vert x-1 \vert = 2 + \frac{m}{100}$.

So $x - 1 = 2 + \frac{m}{100}$ or $x - 1 = -(2 + \frac{m}{100})$.

The second case gives us two more solutions:

$-( \vert x-1 \vert -2) = \frac{m}{100} \implies \vert x-1 \vert -2 = -\frac{m}{100}$.

So $x - 1 = 2 - \frac{m}{100}$ or $x - 1 = -(2 - \frac{m}{100})$.

For each of these four cases, we need to find the value of $m$ such that the solutions are distinct.

By solving the above equations, we find that $m$ must be equal to $100$ to make the solutions distinct.

Therefore, there is only one positive integer $m$ that satisfies the condition, and that is $m = 100$. The answer is: $1$

Assistant:

 The equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has 4 distinct solutions. This equation is a type of absolute value equation, which can be solved by breaking it down into cases based on the value inside the absolute value signs.

First, let's consider the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$. The expression inside the absolute value, $\vert x-1 \vert -2$, can be either positive or negative. This gives us two cases to consider:

1. $\vert x-1 \vert -2 = \frac{m}{100}$: In this case, we have $\vert x-1 \vert = \frac{m}{100} + 2$. The absolute value can be positive or negative, so we have two sub-cases:
   a. $x-1 = \frac{m}{100} + 2$: Solving for $x$ gives $x = \frac{m}{100} + 3$.
   b. $x-1 = -\left(\frac{m}{100} + 2\right)$: Solving for $x$ gives $x = 1 - \frac{m}{100} - 2 = - \frac{m}{100} - 1$.

2. $\vert x-1 \vert -2 = -\frac{m}{100}$: In this case, we have $\vert x-1 \vert = 2 - \frac{m}{100}$. Again, the absolute value can be positive or negative, so we have two sub-cases:
   a. $x-1 = 2 - \frac{m}{100}$: Solving for $x$ gives $x = 3 - \frac{m}{100}$.
   b. $x-1 = -\left(2 - \frac{m}{100}\right)$: Solving for $x$ gives $x = -1 + \frac{m}{100}$.

So, we have a total of 4 possible solutions for $x$:
$$x = \frac{m}{100} + 3, - \frac{m}{100} - 1, 3 - \frac{m}{100}, -1 + \frac{m}{100}.$$

For these solutions to be distinct, the four expressions must be different for different values of $m$. This means that the expressions $\frac{m}{100} + 3, - \frac{m}{100} - 1, 3 - \frac{m}{100}, -1 + \frac{m}{100}$ must all be different.

By analyzing these expressions, we can see that they are all different for different values of $m$. Therefore, for any positive integer $m$, the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ will have 4 distinct solutions.

So, the number of positive integers $m$ for which the equation has 4 distinct solutions is the set of all positive integers, which is infinite. However, the question asks for the number of positive integers $m$ such that the equation has 4 distinct solutions and $\frac{m}{100} < 2$. This is because the absolute value expression inside the outer absolute value, $\vert x-1 \vert -2$, can be at most 2.

So, we need to find the number of positive integers $m$ such that $\frac{m}{100} < 2$, or $m < 200$. The positive integers $m$ that satisfy this condition are the integers from 1 to 199, inclusive. There are 199 such integers.

Therefore, the number of positive integers $m$ for which the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has 4 distinct solutions is 199. The answer is: $199$

Assistant:

 The equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has 4 distinct solutions. This means that the right side of the equation, $\frac{m}{100}$, must be equal to one of the four values that make the left side of the equation equal to 2. The four values are:

1. When $\vert x-1 \vert -2 = 2$, we get $\vert x-1 \vert = 4$, which gives us $x-1 = 4$ or $x-1 = -4$. So, $x = 5$ or $x = -3$.
2. When $\vert x-1 \vert -2 = -2$, we get $\vert x-1 \vert = 0$, which gives us $x = 1$.

Therefore, the left side of the equation takes on the values 2, 0, 2, and 0 in some order. This means that $\frac{m}{100}$ must be one of the values 2, 0, 2, or 0 in some order. The only way this is possible is if $\frac{m}{100} = 2$. Therefore, $m = 200$.

So, there is only one positive integer $m$ for which the equation has 4 distinct solutions, and that is $m = 200$. The answer is: $1$

Assistant:

 The problem asks for the number of positive integers $m$ such that the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has four distinct solutions.

First, we know that the absolute value function $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert$ will be equal to a nonnegative number. Therefore, the right side of the equation, $\frac{m}{100}$, must also be nonnegative, which implies that $m$ must be a nonnegative integer.

The function $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert$ will be equal to a positive number when $\frac{m}{100} > 0$, which is always true since $m$ is a positive integer.

Now, let's consider the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$. The expression inside the absolute value, $\vert x-1 \vert -2$, will be equal to $\frac{m}{100}$ or $-\frac{m}{100}$. This gives us two equations:

1. $\vert x-1 \vert -2 = \frac{m}{100}$
2. $\vert x-1 \vert -2 = -\frac{m}{100}$

For each of these equations, we can further break down the absolute value into two cases:

1.1. $x-1 -2 = \frac{m}{100}$ or $x-1 -2 = -\frac{m}{100}$
1.2. $-(x-1) -2 = \frac{m}{100}$ or $-(x-1) -2 = -\frac{m}{100}$

2.1. $x-1 -2 = \frac{m}{100}$ or $x-1 -2 = -\frac{m}{100}$
2.2. $-(x-1) -2 = \frac{m}{100}$ or $-(x-1) -2 = -\frac{m}{100}$

Each of these cases gives us two equations to solve, resulting in a total of 8 equations to solve. Solving each of these equations will give us the values of $x$ that satisfy the original equation.

The number of distinct solutions to the original equation will be equal to the number of positive integers $m$ such that the sum of the solutions to the eight derived equations is equal to 4.

To find the value of $m$ that satisfies this condition, we can use trial and error by plugging in different values of $m$ into the derived equations and checking the number of distinct solutions.

After performing this trial and error process, we find that the value of $m$ that results in four distinct solutions is $m=200$.

Therefore, there is only one positive integer $m$ that satisfies the condition of the original problem, and that is $m=200$. The answer is: $1$

Assistant:

 The equation has 4 distinct solutions, which means the expression inside the absolute value, $|x-1|-2$, must take on the values $\frac{m}{100}$, $-\frac{m}{100}$, $\frac{m}{100}+2$, and $-\frac{m}{100}+2$ exactly once.
This implies that the values of $|x-1|-2$ must be in the interval $[0,2]$.
So, we have the inequality $0 \leq |x-1|-2 \leq 2$.
This simplifies to $2 \leq |x-1| \leq 4$.
This further simplifies to $4 \leq x-1 \leq 6$ or $-6 \leq x-1 \leq -4$.
So, we have $4 \leq x-1 \leq 6$ or $-6 \leq x-1 \leq -4$.
Solving these inequalities gives $5 \leq x \leq 7$ or $-5 \leq x \leq -3$.
The number of distinct integer solutions in each case is 3.
Therefore, the value of $m$ must be such that $\frac{m}{100}=1$ or $\frac{m}{100}=2$.
Solving these equations gives $m=100$ or $m=200$.
So, there are 2 possible values of $m$. The answer is: $2$
