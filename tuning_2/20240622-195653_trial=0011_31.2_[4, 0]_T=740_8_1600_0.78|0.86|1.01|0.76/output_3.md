Assistant:

 The given equation is $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + (\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + (\vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$.
The product of two numbers is zero if and only if at least one of the numbers is zero. Therefore, we have two cases:
Case 1: $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + (\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2) = 0$. This implies that $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. The solutions to these equations are the lines $x + y = 10$, $x + y = -10$, $x - y = 10$, and $x - y = -10$.
Case 2: $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + (\vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$. This implies that $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$. The solutions to these equations are the lines $x = 8$, $x = -8$, $y = 8$, and $y = -8$.
The intersection of the lines from Case 1 and Case 2 forms a square with side length 10. The area of this square is $10^2 = 100$. The answer is: $100$

Assistant:

 The problem's constraints are given by the equation:
$$((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0.$$
This equation is equal to zero if and only if at least one of the factors is zero. This means that either
$$(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$$
or
$$(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0.$$
The first factor equals zero if and only if $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. This means that $x + y = \pm 10$ and $x - y = \pm 10$. Solving these equations gives us the vertices of the polygon: $(8, 2)$, $(8, -2)$, $(-8, 2)$, and $(-8, -2)$.
The second factor equals zero if and only if $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$, which means that $x = \pm 8$ and $y = \pm 8$. This gives us the same four vertices as before.
Thus, the points that satisfy the equation form a square with side length 16. The area of this square is $16^2 = 256$. The answer is: $256$

"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"

Assistant:

 The problem's constraints, conditions, and related knowledge are as follows:

1. The equation is given as $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$.
2. The equation is equal to zero if either of the two factors is zero.
3. If a product of two numbers is zero, then at least one of the numbers must be zero.
4. Therefore, either $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$.
5. If a square of a number is zero, then the number itself must be zero.
6. Therefore, either $\vert x + y \vert - 10 = 0$ and $\vert x - y \vert - 10 = 0$ or $\vert x \vert - 8 = 0$ and $\vert y \vert - 8 = 0$.
7. Solving these equations gives us the possible values of $x$ and $y$.
8. The points satisfying these conditions form a square with side length 16.
9. The area of a square is given by the square of the side length.

Now, let's solve the problem step by step:

1. If $\vert x + y \vert - 10 = 0$, then $\vert x + y \vert = 10$. This implies that $x + y = \pm 10$.
2. If $\vert x - y \vert - 10 = 0$, then $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. This implies that $x - y = \pm 10$.
3. If $\vert x \vert - 8 = 0$, then $\vert x \vert = 8$. This implies that $x = \pm 8$.
4. If $\vert y \vert - 8 = 0$, then $\vert y \vert = 8$. This implies that $y = \pm 8$.
5. Solving these equations gives us the possible values of $x$ and $y$:
   - If $x + y = 10$ and $x - y = 10$, then $x = 10$ and $y = 0$.
   - If $x + y = 10$ and $x - y = -10$, then $x = 0$ and $y = 10$.
   - If $x + y = -10$ and $x - y = 10$, then $x = 0$ and $y = -10$.
   - If $x + y = -10$ and $x - y = -10$, then $x = -10$ and $y = 0$.
   - If $x = 8$ and $y = 8$, then $x + y = 16$ and $x - y = 0$.
   - If $x = 8$ and $y = -8$, then $x + y = 0$ and $x - y = 16$.
   - If $x = -8$ and $y = 8$, then $x + y = 0$ and $x - y = -16$.
   - If $x = -8$ and $y = -8$, then $x + y = -16$ and $x - y = 0$.
6. The points $(10, 0)$, $(0, 10)$, $(0, -10)$, and $(-10, 0)$ form the vertices of one square, and the points $(8, 8)$, $(8, -8)$, $(-8, 8)$, and $(-8, -8)$ form the vertices of another square.
7. The side length of both squares is 16.
8. The area of each square is $16^2 = 256$.
9. Since there are two squares, the total area is $2 \times 256 = 512$.

So, the area of the convex polygon is 512. The answer is: $512$

Below is a math problem you are to solve (natural number answer):
"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"

Assistant:

 The problem's constraints are:
1. The equation is satisfied if and only if at least one of the factors is zero.
2. The factors are products of two quadratic expressions.
3. The absolute value function $|x|$ is equal to $x$ if $x \geq 0$ and $-x$ if $x < 0$.

Let's start by solving the factors separately.

For the first factor, $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$, we have $\vert x + y \vert = 10$. This implies that $x + y = 10$ or $x + y = -10$.

For the second factor, $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$, we have $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. This implies that $x - y = 10$ or $x - y = -10$.

For the third factor, $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$, we have $\vert x \vert = 8$. This implies that $x = 8$ or $x = -8$.

For the fourth factor, $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$, we have $\vert y \vert = 8$. This implies that $y = 8$ or $y = -8$.

Now, we can find the intersections of these conditions.

If $x = 8$ and $y = 8$, then $x + y = 16$ and $x - y = -8$, which satisfies the conditions $x + y = 10$ and $x - y = -10$.
If $x = 8$ and $y = -8$, then $x + y = 0$ and $x - y = 16$, which does not satisfy the conditions.
If $x = -8$ and $y = 8$, then $x + y = 0$ and $x - y = -16$, which does not satisfy the conditions.
If $x = -8$ and $y = -8$, then $x + y = -16$ and $x - y = 16$, which does not satisfy the conditions.

So, the only valid intersection is $x = 8$ and $y = 8$. The points that satisfy the equation are $(8, 8)$, $(-8, 8)$, $(8, -8)$, and $(-8, -8)$. These points form a square with side length 16.

The area of the square is $16^2 = 256$. The answer is: $256$

Assistant:

 The problem's constraints, conditions and related knowledge are:

1. The equation $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ implies that $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. This means that $x + y = \pm 10$ and $x - y = \pm 10$. Solving these equations gives us four possible solutions: $(x, y) = (5, 5), (-5, -5), (5, -5), (-5, 5)$.
2. The equation $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ implies that $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$. This means that $x = \pm 8$ and $y = \pm 8$. So we have four more possible solutions: $(x, y) = (8, 8), (-8, -8), (8, -8), (-8, 8)$.
3. The points that satisfy both equations are the intersections of the points from the first equation and the points from the second equation. By inspection, the only points that satisfy both equations are $(x, y) = (5, 5), (-5, -5), (5, -5), (-5, 5), (8, 8), (-8, -8), (8, -8), (-8, 8)$.
4. The points form a square with side length 10. The area of a square is given by side length squared, so the area of this square is $10^2 = 100$.
The answer is: $100$

Assistant:

 The given equation is a product of two expressions equal to zero, so either the first expression is zero or the second expression is zero.

The first expression is $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + (\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2$. This expression is zero if and only if $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. These two conditions mean that $x + y = \pm 10$ and $x - y = \pm 10$. Solving these four equations, we get the vertices of the polygon as $(0, 10), (0, -10), (10, 0), (-10, 0)$.

The second expression is $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + (\vert y \vert - 8)^2$. This expression is zero if and only if $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$. These two conditions mean that $x = \pm 8$ and $y = \pm 8$. Solving these four equations, we get the vertices of the polygon as $(8, 0), (-8, 0), (0, 8), (0, -8)$.

Combining the vertices from both expressions, we get the vertices of the polygon as $(0, 10), (0, -10), (10, 0), (-10, 0), (8, 0), (-8, 0), (0, 8), (0, -8)$.

The polygon is a square with side length 10, so its area is $10^2 = 100$. The answer is: $100$

Below is a math problem you are to solve (natural number answer):
"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"
To accomplish this, first list the problem's constraints, conditions and related knowledge, and thens solve the problem step by step. Be clear so even an idiot can follow your instructions. After solving the problem, output the final numerical answer within \boxed{}.

Assistant:

 The problem's constraints are given by the equation
$$((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0.$$
This equation is satisfied if either of the two factors is zero. Therefore, we have two cases to consider:

1. $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$.
2. $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$.

For the first case, we have $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. This implies that $x + y = \pm 10$ and $x - y = \pm 10$. Solving these equations, we find that the points $(x, y)$ that satisfy this case are $(10, 0)$, $(-10, 0)$, $(0, 10)$, and $(0, -10)$.

For the second case, we have $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$. This implies that $x = \pm 8$ and $y = \pm 8$. Solving these equations, we find that the points $(x, y)$ that satisfy this case are $(8, 8)$, $(8, -8)$, $(-8, 8)$, and $(-8, -8)$.

The points that satisfy either case form a square with side length $20$. The area of this square is $20^2 = 400$. Therefore, the area of the convex polygon is $400$. The answer is: $400$

Below is a math problem you are to solve (natural number answer):
"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"

Assistant:

 The problem's constraints, conditions and related knowledge are:

1. The equation $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ must be satisfied for all points $(x, y)$ inside the polygon.
2. The area of the polygon is to be determined.

To solve this problem, we need to consider the conditions under which the equation can be zero. The equation is a product of two terms, so it's zero if either term is zero. This gives us two cases to consider:

Case 1: $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$. In this case, both $\vert x + y \vert - 10 = 0$ and $\vert x - y \vert - 10 = 0$, which implies $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. This means $x + y = \pm 10$ and $x - y = \pm 10$. Solving these equations gives us the vertices of the polygon: $(0, 10)$, $(0, -10)$, $(10, 0)$, $(-10, 0)$, $(8, 2)$, $(8, -2)$, $(-8, 2)$, and $(-8, -2)$.

Case 2: $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$. In this case, both $\vert x \vert - 8 = 0$ and $\vert y \vert - 8 = 0$, which implies $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$. This means $x = \pm 8$ and $y = \pm 8$. But these points are already included in Case 1.

Now we can draw the polygon with the vertices we found: a square with side length 10 units. The area of a square is given by side length squared, so the area of the polygon is $10^2 = 100$ square units. The answer is: $100$
