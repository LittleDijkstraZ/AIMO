Below is a math problem you are to solve (natural number answer):
"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"
To accomplish this, first list the problem's constraints, conditions and related knowledge, and thens solve the problem step by step. Be clear so even an idiot can follow your instructions. After solving the problem, output the final numerical answer within \boxed{}.

Assistant:

 The problem's constraints, conditions, and related knowledge are as follows:

1. $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0 \implies \vert x + y \vert = 10 \implies x + y = \pm 10$.
2. $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0 \implies \vert x - y \vert = 10 \implies x - y = \pm 10$.
3. $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0 \implies \vert x \vert = 8 \implies x = \pm 8$.
4. $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0 \implies \vert y \vert = 8 \implies y = \pm 8$.

From (1) and (2), we have four pairs of $x$ and $y$: $(x, y) = (10, 0), (-10, 0), (0, 10), (0, -10)$.
From (3) and (4), we have four pairs of $x$ and $y$: $(x, y) = (8, 0), (-8, 0), (0, 8), (0, -8)$.

Combining these two sets of points, we have the eight vertices of the convex polygon: $(10, 0), (-10, 0), (0, 10), (0, -10), (8, 0), (-8, 0), (0, 8), (0, -8)$.

Plotting these points on a coordinate plane, we observe that the convex polygon is a square with side length 16 units. Therefore, the area of the convex polygon is $16^2 = 256$. The answer is: $256$.

Below is a math problem you are to solve (natural number answer):
"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"

Assistant:

 The first step in solving the problem is to understand the constraints and conditions given.

$(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ and $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$

From the first equation, we have:
$\vert x + y \vert - 10 = 0$ and $\vert x - y \vert - 10 = 0$, which implies $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. This means $x + y = \pm 10$ and $x - y = \pm 10$.

From the second equation, we have:
$\vert x \vert - 8 = 0$ and $\vert y \vert - 8 = 0$, which implies $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$. This means $x = \pm 8$ and $y = \pm 8$.

By combining these constraints, we can determine the vertices of the polygon formed by the points $\left(x, y\right)$. The vertices are the points where the constraints intersect.

For $x + y = 10$ and $x = 8$, we have $y = 2$.
For $x + y = 10$ and $y = 8$, we have $x = 2$.
For $x + y = -10$ and $x = 8$, we have $y = -18$.
For $x + y = -10$ and $y = 8$, we have $x = -18$.

Similarly, for $x - y = 10$ and $x = 8$, we have $y = -2$.
For $x - y = 10$ and $y = 8$, we have $x = 18$.
For $x - y = -10$ and $x = 8$, we have $y = 18$.
For $x - y = -10$ and $y = 8$, we have $x = -2$.

So the vertices of the polygon are $(8, 2)$, $(2, 8)$, $(-18, -8)$, $(-8, -18)$, $(8, -2)$, $(18, 8)$, $(-8, 18)$, $(-2, 8)$.

The polygon formed is a square with side length $20$. To find the area of the square, we use the formula for the area of a square: $A = \text{side}^2$. In this case, $A = 20^2 = 400$.
The answer is: $400$

Below is a math problem you are to solve (natural number answer):
"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"

Assistant:

 The problem's constraints, conditions and related knowledge include:

1. The expression $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2)$ equals to $0$.
2. The expression can only equal to $0$ if either the first or the second factor equals to $0$.
3. The first factor equals to $0$ when $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ or $\vert x - y \vert = 10$.
4. The second factor equals to $0$ when $\vert x \vert = 8$ or $\vert y \vert = 8$.
5. The absolute value function $\vert a \vert = b$ can be broken down into two cases: $a = b$ or $a = -b$.
6. Thus, we have four cases to consider for the first factor:
    a. $x + y = 10$ or $x + y = -10$.
    b. $x - y = 10$ or $x - y = -10$.
7. And four cases to consider for the second factor:
    a. $x = 8$ or $x = -8$.
    b. $y = 8$ or $y = -8$.
8. Solving these equations, we obtain the vertices of the polygon.
9. To find the area of the polygon, we can use the shoelace formula.

Step by step solution:

1. For the first factor, we have four cases:
   a. $x + y = 10$ or $x + y = -10$.
   b. $x - y = 10$ or $x - y = -10$.
   These cases give us the lines $x + y = 10$, $x + y = -10$, $x - y = 10$, and $x - y = -10$.

2. For the second factor, we have four cases:
   a. $x = 8$ or $x = -8$.
   b. $y = 8$ or $y = -8$.
   These cases give us the lines $x = 8$, $x = -8$, $y = 8$, and $y = -8$.

3. The intersection points of these lines are the vertices of the polygon:
   $(8,0)$, $(0,8)$, $(-8,0)$, $(0,-8)$, $(8,2)$, $(2,8)$, $(-8,0)$, $(0,-8)$, $(8,-2)$, and $(-2,-8)$.

4. To find the area of the polygon, we can use the shoelace formula. The shoelace formula states that if the vertices of a polygon are $(x_1, y_1), (x_2, y_2), \ldots, (x_n, y_n)$, then the area of the polygon is given by:
$$A = \frac{1}{2} |(x_1y_2 + x_2y_3 + \ldots + x_ny_1) - (y_1x_2 + y_2x_3 + \ldots + y_nx_1)|.$$

5. Applying the shoelace formula to the vertices $(8,0)$, $(0,8)$, $(-8,0)$, $(0,-8)$, $(8,2)$, $(2,8)$, $(-8,0)$, $(0,-8)$, $(8,-2)$, and $(-2,-8)$, we get:
$$A = \frac{1}{2} |(8*8 + 0*2 + -8*0 + 0*-8 + 8*2 + 2*8 + -8*0 + 0*-8 + 8*-2 + -2*-8) - (0*8 + 8*0 + 0*0 + -8*2 + 8*0 + 2*0 + 0*0 + -8*-2 + 0*8 + -2*-8)|.$$

6. Simplifying the expression, we get:
$$A = \frac{1}{2} |(64 + 0 + 0 + 0 + 16 + 16 + 0 + 0 - 16 - 16) - (0 + 0 + 0 - 16 + 0 + 0 + 0 + 16 + 0 + 16)|.$$

7. Further simplification gives:
$$A = \frac{1}{2} |(64 + 32 - 32)| = \frac{1}{2} |64| = 32.$$

So, the area of the convex polygon is $32$ square units. The answer is: $32$

Below is a math problem you are to solve (natural number answer):
"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"

Assistant:

 Step 1: List the constraints, conditions and related knowledge.
The problem's constraint is that the product of two expressions must be zero, which means each expression must be zero separately. This gives us the following four conditions:
$$\vert x + y \vert - 10 = 0,$$
$$\vert x - y \vert - 10 = 0,$$
$$\vert x \vert - 8 = 0,$$
$$\vert y \vert - 8 = 0.$$

Step 2: Solve the conditions to find the vertices of the polygon.
The conditions can be simplified to:
$$\vert x + y \vert = 10,$$
$$\vert x - y \vert = 10,$$
$$\vert x \vert = 8,$$
$$\vert y \vert = 8.$$

From $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$, we can have the following eight solutions for $(x, y)$:
$$(8, 0), (-8, 0), (0, 8), (0, -8), (8, 0), (-8, 0), (0, 8), (0, -8).$$

Now we need to check which of these points satisfy the conditions $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. By checking, we find that only $(8, 0), (-8, 0), (0, 8),$ and $(0, -8)$ satisfy these conditions. Therefore, the four vertices of the polygon are $(8, 0), (-8, 0), (0, 8),$ and $(0, -8)$.

Step 3: Find the area of the polygon.
The polygon is a square with side length 16 (since the distance between $(8, 0)$ and $(-8, 0)$ is 16 or the distance between $(0, 8)$ and $(0, -8)$ is 16). The area of the square is therefore $16^2 = 256$. The answer is: $256$

Below is a math problem you are to solve (natural number answer!):
"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"
Analyze the problem and think step by step to come to a solution with programs. After solving the problem, output the final numerical answer within \boxed{}.

Assistant:


The problem statement is quite complex, but the essence of it can be simplified as follows:

The points $(x, y)$ that satisfy the equation in the problem must satisfy either $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$, $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$, $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$, or $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$. 

Each of these four equations corresponds to a line in the $x$-$y$ plane, so the points that satisfy the original equation must lie on one of these four lines.

These lines form a square with side length 16, and the area of this square is $16^2 = 256$. Therefore, the area of the convex polygon is 256.

The Python code to compute the area of the square is as follows:

```python


INTERMEDIATE OUT :

def square_area():
    """The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"""
    side_length = 16
    area = side_length ** 2
    return area

result = square_area()
print(result)
```

CODE RESULTS 256

INTERMEDIATE OUT :
```output
256
```
The area of the convex polygon is $256$. Therefore, the answer is $\boxed{256}$.
