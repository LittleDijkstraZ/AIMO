Below is a math problem you are to solve (natural number answer):
"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"
To accomplish this, first list the problem's constraints, conditions and related knowledge, and thens solve the problem step by step. Be clear so even an idiot can follow your instructions. After solving the problem, output the final numerical answer within \boxed{}.

Assistant:

 The given equation is a product of two expressions equal to zero, so either the first expression is zero or the second expression is zero. This gives us two sets of equations to solve:

1. $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ and $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$.
2. $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ and $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$.

From the first set of equations, we have $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x \vert = 8$. This implies that $-10 \leq x + y \leq 10$ and $-8 \leq x \leq 8$. Similarly, from the second set of equations, we have $\vert x - y \vert = 10$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$. This implies that $-10 \leq x - y \leq 10$ and $-8 \leq y \leq 8$.

The solution to these inequalities is a square with side length $16$ (since the maximum and minimum values of $x$ and $y$ are $8$ and $-8$, respectively). Therefore, the area of the square is $16^2 = 256$. The answer is: $256$

Below is a math problem you are to solve (natural number answer!):
"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"
Analyze the problem and think step by step to come to a solution with programs. After solving the problem, output the final numerical answer within \boxed{}.

Assistant:

 The given equation is a product of two expressions equal to zero, so either the first expression is zero or the second expression is zero.

The first expression is $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)$, which is zero if and only if both $\vert x + y \vert - 10 = 0$ and $\vert x - y \vert - 10 = 0$, which means $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. This implies that $x + y = \pm 10$ and $x - y = \pm 10$, which give us the lines $x + y = 10$, $x + y = -10$, $x - y = 10$, and $x - y = -10$.

The second expression is $((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2)$, which is zero if and only if both $\vert x \vert - 8 = 0$ and $\vert y \vert - 8 = 0$, which means $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$. This implies that $x = \pm 8$ and $y = \pm 8$, which give us the lines $x = 8$, $x = -8$, $y = 8$, and $y = -8$.

The intersection of these lines form a square with side length 10, so the area of the square is $10^2 = 100$. The answer is: $100$

Below is a math problem you are to solve (natural number answer):
"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"

Assistant:

 The problem's constraints are as follows:

1. $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0 \Rightarrow \vert x + y \vert = 10$.
2. $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0 \Rightarrow \vert x - y \vert = 10$.
3. $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0 \Rightarrow \vert x \vert = 8$.
4. $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0 \Rightarrow \vert y \vert = 8$.

From conditions 1 and 2, we have $x + y = \pm 10$ and $x - y = \pm 10$. Solving these four equations, we get the following four pairs of $(x, y)$: $(6, 4)$, $(6, -4)$, $(-6, 4)$, and $(-6, -4)$.

From conditions 3 and 4, we have $x = \pm 8$ and $y = \pm 8$. Solving these four equations, we get the following four pairs of $(x, y)$: $(8, 0)$, $(8, 0)$, $(0, 8)$, and $(0, -8)$.

Combining the solutions from conditions 1-4, we get the following eight points: $(6, 4)$, $(6, -4)$, $(-6, 4)$, $(-6, -4)$, $(8, 0)$, $(8, 0)$, $(0, 8)$, and $(0, -8)$. These points form a square with side length 10. The area of this square is $10^2 = 100$.
The answer is: $100$

Below is a math problem you are to solve (natural number answer):
"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"

Assistant:

 The problem's constraints are:

1. The equation is satisfied if either of the factors is zero.
2. $|x+y|$ and $|x-y|$ are always greater than or equal to zero.
3. $|x|$ and $|y|$ are also always greater than or equal to zero.

From the first constraint, we have two cases to consider:

Case 1: $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$. This implies $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ or $\vert x - y \vert = 10$.

Case 2: $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$. This implies $\vert x \vert = 8$ or $\vert y \vert = 8$.

From Case 1, we have four lines: $x + y = \pm 10$ and $x - y = \pm 10$. From Case 2, we have four more lines: $x = \pm 8$ and $y = \pm 8$.

The intersection points of these lines are: $(8, 2)$, $(8, -2)$, $(-8, 2)$, $(-8, -2)$, $(2, 8)$, $(-2, 8)$, $(2, -8)$, and $(-2, -8)$. These points form a square with side length 16.

The area of this square is $16^2 = 256$. The answer is: $256$.

Below is a math problem you are to solve (natural number answer):
"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"

Assistant:

 The problem's constraints are as follows:

1. The equation is true if and only if either $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$, or $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$.
2. The absolute value function $\vert a \vert$ is equal to $a$ if $a \geq 0$, and $-a$ if $a < 0$.
3. The equation $(\vert a \vert - b)^2 = 0$ is true if and only if $\vert a \vert = b$.

From constraint 3, we can deduce that:

1. If $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$, then $\vert x + y \vert = 10$, which means $x + y = \pm 10$.
2. If $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$, then $\vert x - y \vert = 10$, which means $x - y = \pm 10$.
3. If $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$, then $\vert x \vert = 8$, which means $x = \pm 8$.
4. If $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$, then $\vert y \vert = 8$, which means $y = \pm 8$.

Now, we can solve these equations to find the vertices of the polygon:

1. If $x + y = 10$, then $y = 10 - x$. Substituting into $y = 8$, we get $10 - x = 8$, so $x = 2$. Thus, we have the vertex $(2, 8)$.
2. If $x + y = -10$, then $y = -10 - x$. Substituting into $y = 8$, we get $-10 - x = 8$, so $x = -18$. Thus, we have the vertex $(-18, 8)$.
3. If $x - y = 10$, then $x = y + 10$. Substituting into $x = 8$, we get $8 = y + 10$, so $y = -2$. Thus, we have the vertex $(8, -2)$.
4. If $x - y = -10$, then $x = y - 10$. Substituting into $x = 8$, we get $8 = y - 10$, so $y = 18$. Thus, we have the vertex $(8, 18)$.
5. If $x = 8$, then substituting into $x + y = 10$, we get $8 + y = 10$, so $y = 2$. Thus, we have the vertex $(8, 2)$.
6. If $x = -8$, then substituting into $x + y = 10$, we get $-8 + y = 10$, so $y = 18$. Thus, we have the vertex $(-8, 18)$.
7. If $y = 8$, then substituting into $x + y = 10$, we get $x + 8 = 10$, so $x = 2$. Thus, we have the vertex $(2, 8)$.
8. If $y = -8$, then substituting into $x + y = 10$, we get $x - 8 = 10$, so $x = 18$. Thus, we have the vertex $(18, -8)$.

However, we can see that the vertices $(2, 8)$ and $(8, 2)$ are duplicates, as are the vertices $(-18, 8)$ and $(8, -2)$, and the vertices $(8, 18)$ and $(-8, 18)$. So, the distinct vertices are $(2, 8)$, $(-18, 8)$, $(8, -2)$, and $(8, 18)$.

The polygon is a rectangle with side lengths 18 - (-18) = 36 and 8 - (-2) = 10. The area of a rectangle is the product of its side lengths, so the area of the polygon is $36 \times 10 = 360$. The answer is: $360$

Below is a math problem you are to solve (natural number answer):
"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"

Assistant:

 The problem's constraints, conditions and related knowledge are as follows:

1. The expression $A \cdot B = 0$ if and only if $A = 0$ or $B = 0$.
2. $\vert x \vert = a$ implies $x = a$ or $x = -a$.
3. The area of a square with side length $s$ is $s^2$.

Now, let's solve the problem step by step:

Given the equation $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$, we can apply constraint 1 to get:

$(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$.

From constraint 2, we know that $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ or $\vert x - y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x \vert = 8$ or $\vert y \vert = 8$.

These conditions represent four lines in the coordinate plane:

1. $x + y = 10$ or $x + y = -10$.
2. $x - y = 10$ or $x - y = -10$.
3. $x = 8$ or $x = -8$.
4. $y = 8$ or $y = -8$.

The intersections of these lines form a square with side length $20$.

Therefore, the area of the convex polygon is the area of the square, which is $20^2 = 400$. The answer is: $400$

Assistant:

 The problem's constraints are given by the equation
\[((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0.\]
This equation is equal to zero if either of the two factors is zero. Thus, we have two cases to consider:

Case 1: $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$. This implies that $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. The only way this can happen is if $x = \pm 10$ and $y = \pm 10$. This gives us four points: $(10, 10)$, $(10, -10)$, $(-10, 10)$, and $(-10, -10)$.

Case 2: $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$. This implies that $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$. The only way this can happen is if $x = \pm 8$ and $y = \pm 8$. This gives us four more points: $(8, 8)$, $(8, -8)$, $(-8, 8)$, and $(-8, -8)$.

Now we have a total of eight points: $(10, 10)$, $(10, -10)$, $(-10, 10)$, $(-10, -10)$, $(8, 8)$, $(8, -8)$, $(-8, 8)$, and $(-8, -8)$. These points form a square with side length $20$. The area of this square is $20^2 = 400$.

Therefore, the area of the convex polygon is $400$. The answer is: $400$

 The problem's constraints are given by the equation
$$((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0.$$
This equation is equal to zero if either of the two factors is zero. Therefore, we have two cases to consider:
Case 1: $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$. This can only happen if $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. These two equations imply that $x + y = \pm 10$ and $x - y = \pm 10$. Solving these four equations gives us the vertices of the polygon: $(0, 10), (0, -10), (10, 0), (-10, 0)$.
Case 2: $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$. This can only happen if $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$. These two equations imply that $x = \pm 8$ and $y = \pm 8$. Solving these four equations gives us the vertices of the polygon: $(8, 8), (8, -8), (-8, 8), (-8, -8)$.
Combining the vertices from both cases, we find that the polygon is a square with side length 10. The area of this square is $10^2 = 100$. Therefore, the area of the convex polygon is 100. The answer is: $100$
