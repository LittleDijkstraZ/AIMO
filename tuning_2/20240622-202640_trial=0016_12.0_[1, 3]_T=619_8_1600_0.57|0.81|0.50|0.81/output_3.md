Below is a math problem you are to solve (natural number answer):
"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"
To accomplish this, first list the problem's constraints, conditions and related knowledge, and thens solve the problem step by step. Be clear so even an idiot can follow your instructions. After solving the problem, output the final numerical answer within \boxed{}.

Assistant:

 The problem's constraints, conditions and related knowledge are as follows:

1. The equation $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ must be satisfied by the points $(x, y)$ that lie on the boundary of the polygon.
2. The area of the polygon is to be found.

To solve this problem, we first note that the product of two numbers is zero if and only if at least one of the numbers is zero. Therefore, the equation $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ is satisfied if either of the following two conditions is true:

1. $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$.
2. $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$.

For the first condition to be true, both $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ and $( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$, which implies $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. This gives us two lines: $x + y = 10$ and $x - y = 10$.

For the second condition to be true, both $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ and $( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$, which implies $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$. This gives us two lines: $x = 8$ and $y = 8$.

The four lines $x + y = 10$, $x - y = 10$, $x = 8$, and $y = 8$ enclose a rectangle. The vertices of this rectangle are $(8,2)$, $(8,-2)$, $(-2,8)$, and $(10,0)$.

To find the area of this rectangle, we can use the formula for the area of a rectangle, which is the product of its length and width. The length of the rectangle is the distance between the points $(8,2)$ and $(8,-2)$, which is $4$ units. The width of the rectangle is the distance between the points $(8,2)$ and $(-2,8)$, which is $6$ units. Therefore, the area of the rectangle is $4 \times 6 = 24$ square units.

So, the area of the convex polygon is $24$ square units. The answer is: $24$

Assistant:

 The problem's constraints, conditions, and related knowledge are as follows:

1. The equation is $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + (\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + (\vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$.
2. The product of two numbers is zero if and only if at least one of the numbers is zero.
3. The square of a real number is zero if and only if the number itself is zero.
4. The absolute value of a real number is zero if and only if the number is zero.

From these constraints, conditions, and related knowledge, we can deduce that either $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$, $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$, $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$, or $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$.

This implies that either $\vert x + y \vert = 10$, $\vert x - y \vert = 10$, $\vert x \vert = 8$, or $\vert y \vert = 8$.

The solutions to these equations are:

1. $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ gives $x + y = 10$ or $x + y = -10$.
2. $\vert x - y \vert = 10$ gives $x - y = 10$ or $x - y = -10$.
3. $\vert x \vert = 8$ gives $x = 8$ or $x = -8$.
4. $\vert y \vert = 8$ gives $y = 8$ or $y = -8$.

The solutions to these equations form a square with side length 16. The area of this square is $16^2 = 256$.

So, the area of the convex polygon is 256. The answer is: $256$

Below is a math problem you are to solve (natural number answer):
"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"

 The problem's constraints, conditions, and related knowledge are:

1. The equation $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ must be satisfied for all points $(x, y)$ inside the polygon.
2. The equation is equal to zero if either of the two factors is zero.
3. A point $(x, y)$ satisfies the first factor if either $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ or $\vert x - y \vert = 10$.
4. A point $(x, y)$ satisfies the second factor if either $\vert x \vert = 8$ or $\vert y \vert = 8$.
5. The lines $\vert x + y \vert = 10$, $\vert x - y \vert = 10$, $\vert x \vert = 8$, and $\vert y \vert = 8$ form a rectangle.
6. The length of the rectangle is $20$ (from $-10$ to $10$ on the $x$ and $y$ axes) and the width is $16$ (from $-8$ to $8$ on the $x$ and $y$ axes).
7. The area of a rectangle is given by the product of its length and width.

Now, let's solve the problem step by step:

1. The length of the rectangle is $20$ and the width is $16$.
2. To find the area of the rectangle, multiply the length and the width: $20 \times 16 = 320$.

Therefore, the area of the convex polygon is $320$. The answer is: $320$

Below is a math problem you are to solve (natural number answer!):
"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"
Analyze the problem and think step by step to come to a solution with programs. After solving the problem, output the final numerical answer within \boxed{}.

Assistant:

 The given equation is a product of two expressions equal to zero, which means that either one of the expressions is zero. Therefore, we have two cases to consider:

1. $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$.
2. $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$.

For the first case, we have $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ or $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. This implies that the points $(x, y)$ lie on the lines $x + y = 10$, $x + y = -10$, $x - y = 10$, or $x - y = -10$.

For the second case, we have $\vert x \vert = 8$ or $\vert y \vert = 8$. This implies that the points $(x, y)$ lie on the lines $x = 8$, $x = -8$, $y = 8$, or $y = -8$.

The points that satisfy both cases are the intersections of these lines. These lines form a square with side length 16. The area of this square is $16^2 = 256$. So, the area of the convex polygon is 256.

The answer is: $256$

"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"

 The problem's constraints, conditions, and related knowledge are as follows:

1. The equation $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ is true if and only if either of the two factors is zero.

2. A product of factors is zero if and only if at least one of the factors is zero.

3. Therefore, either $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$.

4. If a square of a real number is zero, then the number itself must be zero. So, we have two cases to consider:

   a. $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$. This implies that $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. The only way this can happen is if $x = y = 5$ or $x = -y = -5$.

   b. $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$. This implies that $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$. The only way this can happen is if $x = 8$ or $x = -8$, and $y = 8$ or $y = -8$.

5. Combining the two cases, we find that the points $(x, y)$ that satisfy the equation are $(5, 5)$, $(-5, -5)$, $(8, 8)$, $(-8, -8)$, $(8, -8)$, and $(-8, 8)$.

6. These points form a square with side length 10. The area of a square is the side length squared, so the area of this square is $10^2 = 100$.
The answer is: $100$

Below is a math problem you are to solve (natural number answer):
"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"

 The problem's constraints, conditions and related knowledge are as follows:

1. The equation $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ must be satisfied for all points $(x, y)$ in the polygon.
2. The polygon is convex.

To solve this problem, we need to find the set of points $(x, y)$ that satisfy the equation and then determine the area of the polygon they enclose.

From the equation, we can see that the product of two terms must be zero for the equation to hold. This means that either the first term is zero or the second term is zero.

If the first term is zero, we have:
$$(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0.$$
This can only be true if $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. This implies that $x + y = \pm 10$ and $x - y = \pm 10$. Solving these equations, we find that the points that satisfy this condition are $(x, y) = (5, 5), (5, -5), (-5, 5), (-5, -5)$.

If the second term is zero, we have:
$$(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0.$$
This can only be true if $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$. This implies that $x = \pm 8$ and $y = \pm 8$. Solving these equations, we find that the points that satisfy this condition are $(x, y) = (8, 8), (8, -8), (-8, 8), (-8, -8)$.

Combining these two sets of points, we find that the polygon is a square with side length 10. The area of a square is the side length squared, so the area of the polygon is $10^2 = 100$.
The answer is: $100$

Assistant:

 The problem's constraints, conditions, and related knowledge are:

1. The equation $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ must be satisfied for all points $(x, y)$ inside the polygon.
2. The absolute value function $\vert x \vert$ returns the non-negative value of $x$.
3. The square of a real number is always non-negative.
4. The product of two non-negative numbers is zero if and only if at least one of the numbers is zero.

Now, let's solve the problem step by step:

From the problem's constraints, we know that either $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$.

If $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$, then $\vert x + y \vert = 10$, which means $x + y = \pm 10$.
If $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$, then $\vert x - y \vert = 10$, which means $x - y = \pm 10$.
If $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$, then $\vert x \vert = 8$, which means $x = \pm 8$.
If $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$, then $\vert y \vert = 8$, which means $y = \pm 8$.

The solutions to these equations are the vertices of the polygon:

1. $(8, 0)$, $(0, 8)$, $(-8, 0)$, $(0, -8)$, $(8, 2)$, $(2, 8)$, $(-8, -2)$, $(-2, -8)$, $(8, -2)$, $(-2, 8)$, $(2, -8)$, $(-8, 2)$.

The polygon is a regular dodecagon (12-sided polygon) with side length 2 and a circumradius of 8.

The area of a regular dodecagon with side length $a$ and circumradius $r$ is given by the formula $A = 3ar$.

Substituting $a = 2$ and $r = 8$ into the formula, we get $A = 3(2)(8) = 48$.

So, the area of the convex polygon is 48 square units. The answer is: $48$

Assistant:

 The problem's constraints, conditions and related knowledge are as follows:

1. The equation is given as $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$.
2. The equation is equal to zero if either of the two factors is zero.
3. A product of factors is zero if and only if at least one of the factors is zero.
4. Therefore, either $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$.
5. If a square of a real number is zero, then the number itself must be zero. Therefore, either $\vert x + y \vert - 10 = 0$ and $\vert x - y \vert - 10 = 0$ or $\vert x \vert - 8 = 0$ and $\vert y \vert - 8 = 0$.
6. Solving these equations gives us the coordinates of the vertices of the polygon.
7. The area of the polygon can be found by counting the number of unit squares it encloses.

Now, let's solve the problem step by step:

1. From $\vert x + y \vert - 10 = 0$, we have $\vert x + y \vert = 10$, which implies $x + y = \pm 10$.
2. From $\vert x - y \vert - 10 = 0$, we have $\vert x - y \vert = 10$, which implies $x - y = \pm 10$.
3. From $\vert x \vert - 8 = 0$, we have $\vert x \vert = 8$, which implies $x = \pm 8$.
4. From $\vert y \vert - 8 = 0$, we have $\vert y \vert = 8$, which implies $y = \pm 8$.
5. Solving these equations, we find the vertices of the polygon to be $(8, 8)$, $(8, -8)$, $(-8, 8)$, and $(-8, -8)$.
6. The polygon is a square with side length 16.
7. The area of the square is $16^2 = 256$.

Therefore, the area of the convex polygon is 256 square units. The answer is: $256$
