 The problem's constraints, conditions, and related knowledge are:

1. The equation $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ must be satisfied for all points $(x, y)$ inside the polygon.
2. The absolute value function $\vert x \vert$ is defined as $x$ if $x \geq 0$ and $-x$ if $x < 0$.
3. The area of a polygon can be found using the shoelace formula.

Now, let's solve the problem step by step:

Step 1: The equation $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ is satisfied if either of the factors is zero. This gives us two sets of conditions:

- $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$, which implies $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$.
- $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$, which implies $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$.

Step 2: The conditions $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$ imply that the points $(x, y)$ lie on a square with side length 20. The vertices of this square are $(8, 8)$, $(8, -8)$, $(-8, 8)$, and $(-8, -8)$.

Step 3: The conditions $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$ imply that the points $(x, y)$ lie on a square with side length 16. The vertices of this square are $(8, 8)$, $(-8, 8)$, $(-8, -8)$, and $(8, -8)$.

Step 4: Comparing the two squares, we see that the square with side length 20 encloses the square with side length 16. Therefore, the convex polygon formed by the points $(x, y)$ is the square with side length 16.

Step 5: The area of a square with side length $s$ is $s^2$. So, the area of the convex polygon is $16^2 = 256$.
The answer is: $256$

Below is a math problem you are to solve (natural number answer!):
"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"
Analyze the problem and think step by step to come to a solution with programs. After solving the problem, output the final numerical answer within \boxed{}.

Assistant:

 The given equation is a product of two expressions equal to zero, which means that either one of the expressions must be zero. This gives us two separate conditions:

1. $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$
2. $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$

For the first condition, both terms must be zero, which implies that $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. This means that $x + y = \pm 10$ and $x - y = \pm 10$. Solving these equations gives us the vertices of the square: $(8, 2), (8, -2), (-8, -2), (-8, 2)$.

For the second condition, both terms must be zero, which implies that $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$. This means that $x = \pm 8$ and $y = \pm 8$. Solving these equations gives us the vertices of the square: $(8, 8), (8, -8), (-8, -8), (-8, 8)$.

Combining these two sets of vertices, we see that the points satisfying the given equation form a 8x8 square. The area of this square is $8^2 = 64$. So the area of the convex polygon is 64 square units.

Here is a Python code to calculate the area:

```python

def area_of_polygon():
    """The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"""
    side_length = 8
    area = side_length ** 2
    return area

result = area_of_polygon()
print(result)
```

CODE RESULTS 64

INTERMEDIATE OUT :
```output

```
The area of the convex polygon is $64$ square units. The answer is $\boxed{64}$.

Below is a math problem you are to solve (natural number answer):
"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"

Assistant:

 The problem's constraints are given by the equation
$$((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0.$$
This equation is equal to zero if and only if either of the two factors is equal to zero. Therefore, we have two cases to consider:

Case 1: $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$. This equation is satisfied if and only if $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. This means that the points $(x, y)$ lie on the lines $x + y = 10$ and $x - y = 10$. The intersection of these lines is at $(5, 5)$.

Case 2: $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$. This equation is satisfied if and only if $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$. This means that the points $(x, y)$ lie on the lines $x = 8$ and $y = 8$. The intersection of these lines is at $(8, 8)$.

The points that satisfy the original equation are those that lie on the lines $x + y = 10$, $x - y = 10$, $x = 8$, and $y = 8$. These lines enclose a rectangle with vertices at $(5, 5)$, $(8, 8)$, $(8, 5)$, and $(5, 8)$. The lengths of the sides of the rectangle are 3 units in the $x$ direction and 3 units in the $y$ direction. Therefore, the area of the rectangle is $3 \times 3 = 9$ square units. The answer is: $9$

Below is a math problem you are to solve (natural number answer):
"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"
To accomplish this, first list the problem's constraints, conditions and related knowledge, and thens solve the problem step by step. Be clear so even an idiot can follow your instructions. After solving the problem, output the final numerical answer within \boxed{}.

Assistant:

 The problem's constraints, conditions, and related knowledge are as follows:

1. The equation is given as: $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$.
2. The equation is equal to zero if either of the two factors is zero.
3. For the first factor to be zero, either $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$. This implies that $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ or $\vert x - y \vert = 10$.
4. For the second factor to be zero, either $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$. This implies that $\vert x \vert = 8$ or $\vert y \vert = 8$.
5. The absolute value equations can be rewritten as:
   - $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ implies $x + y = 10$ or $x + y = -10$.
   - $\vert x - y \vert = 10$ implies $x - y = 10$ or $x - y = -10$.
   - $\vert x \vert = 8$ implies $x = 8$ or $x = -8$.
   - $\vert y \vert = 8$ implies $y = 8$ or $y = -8$.
6. By solving these equations, we find the points that satisfy the conditions:
   - For $x + y = 10$ and $x = 8$, we get $y = 2$.
   - For $x + y = 10$ and $x = -8$, we get $y = 18$, which is not possible since $\vert y \vert = 8$.
   - For $x + y = -10$ and $x = 8$, we get $y = -18$, which is not possible since $\vert y \vert = 8$.
   - For $x + y = -10$ and $x = -8$, we get $y = 2$.
   - For $x - y = 10$ and $x = 8$, we get $y = -2$.
   - For $x - y = 10$ and $x = -8$, we get $y = -18$, which is not possible since $\vert y \vert = 8$.
   - For $x - y = -10$ and $x = 8$, we get $y = 18$, which is not possible since $\vert y \vert = 8$.
   - For $x - y = -10$ and $x = -8$, we get $y = 2$.
   - For $x = 8$ and $y = 2$, the equation is satisfied.
   - For $x = 8$ and $y = -2$, the equation is satisfied.
   - For $x = -8$ and $y = 2$, the equation is satisfied.
   - For $x = -8$ and $y = -2$, the equation is satisfied.
7. Therefore, the points that satisfy the equation are $(8, 2)$, $(8, -2)$, $(-8, 2)$, and $(-8, -2)$.
8. These points form a square with side length 16.
9. The area of a square is given by side length squared, so the area of this square is $16^2 = 256$.

So, the area of the convex polygon is 256 square units. The answer is: $256$

Assistant:

 The problem's constraints, conditions, and related knowledge are as follows:

1. The equation is satisfied if either of the factors is equal to zero.
2. The factors are products of two quadratic expressions.
3. Each quadratic expression is a square, so it is always non-negative.
4. Therefore, the equation is satisfied if either of the quadratic expressions is equal to zero.
5. The quadratic expressions are of the form $(|x| - a)^2 + (|y| - b)^2 = 0$, which implies that $|x| = a$ and $|y| = b$.
6. This means that $x = a$ or $x = -a$, and $y = b$ or $y = -b$.
7. Therefore, the points that satisfy the equation are the intersections of the lines $x = 8$, $x = -8$, $y = 8$, and $y = -8$.
8. These lines form a square with side length 16.
9. The area of a square is given by the square of the length of its side, so the area of the square is $16^2 = 256$.

So, the area of the convex polygon is 256. The answer is: $256$

"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"

 The problem's constraints, conditions and related knowledge are:

1. The equation $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ must be satisfied for all points $(x, y)$ inside the polygon.
2. The expression is equal to zero if and only if either the first factor or the second factor is zero.
3. The absolute value function $\vert x \vert$ is defined as $x$ if $x \geq 0$ and $-x$ if $x < 0$.
4. The area of a polygon can be found using the shoelace formula.

Now, let's solve the problem step by step:

Step 1: The first factor of the equation is $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)$. This factor is zero if and only if both $(\vert x + y \vert - 10) = 0$ and $(\vert x - y \vert - 10) = 0$. This implies that $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. The only way this can happen is if $x = \pm 10$ and $y = \pm 10$.

Step 2: The second factor of the equation is $((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2)$. This factor is zero if and only if both $(\vert x \vert - 8) = 0$ and $(\vert y \vert - 8) = 0$. This implies that $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$. The only way this can happen is if $x = \pm 8$ and $y = \pm 8$.

Step 3: Combining the constraints from steps 1 and 2, we find that the polygon is a square with side length 20.

Step 4: The area of a square is given by the side length squared. So, the area of the polygon is $20^2 = 400$.

The answer is: $400$

1. The equation is given as $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$.
2. The equation is equal to zero if either of the two factors is zero.
3. The absolute value function $\vert x \vert$ is defined as $x$ if $x \geq 0$ and $-x$ if $x < 0$.
4. The absolute value of a number is always non-negative.
5. The square of a non-negative number is also non-negative.
6. Therefore, for the first factor to be zero, we must have $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ and $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$.
7. This implies that $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$.
8. For the second factor to be zero, we must have $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ and $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$.
9. This implies that $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$.
10. Combining the constraints from the first and second factors, we have $\vert x + y \vert = 10$, $\vert x - y \vert = 10$, $\vert x \vert = 8$, and $\vert y \vert = 8$.
11. Solving these constraints, we find that the points $(x, y)$ that satisfy the equation are the vertices of a square with side length 10, centered at the origin, and with vertices on the lines $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$.
12. The area of a square is given by the square of the length of its side.
13. Therefore, the area of the convex polygon is $10^2 = 100$.

The answer is: $100$

Below is a math problem you are to solve (natural number answer):
"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"

Assistant:

 The problem's constraints, conditions and related knowledge are:

1. The equation is satisfied if either of the factors is zero.
2. $|x|$ and $|y|$ are both greater than or equal to 0.
3. $|x+y|$ and $|x-y|$ are both greater than or equal to 0.

Now, let's solve the problem step by step:

Step 1: For the first factor to be zero, either $|x+y| - 10 = 0$ or $|x-y| - 10 = 0$. This implies $|x+y| = 10$ or $|x-y| = 10$.

Step 2: For the second factor to be zero, either $|x| - 8 = 0$ or $|y| - 8 = 0$. This implies $|x| = 8$ or $|y| = 8$.

Step 3: Combining the results from steps 1 and 2, we have four cases to consider:

Case 1: $|x+y| = 10$ and $|x| = 8$. This implies $x = 8$ or $x = -8$. If $x = 8$, then $y = 2$ or $y = -18$. If $x = -8$, then $y = 18$ or $y = -2$. These give us four points: $(8, 2)$, $(8, -18)$, $(-8, 18)$, and $(-8, -2)$.

Case 2: $|x+y| = 10$ and $|y| = 8$. This implies $y = 8$ or $y = -8$. If $y = 8$, then $x = 2$ or $x = -18$. If $y = -8$, then $x = 18$ or $x = -2$. These give us four more points: $(2, 8)$, $(-18, 8)$, $(18, -8)$, and $(-2, -8)$.

Case 3: $|x-y| = 10$ and $|x| = 8$. This case is symmetric to Case 1, and gives us the same four points.

Case 4: $|x-y| = 10$ and $|y| = 8$. This case is symmetric to Case 2, and gives us the same four points.

Step 4: The eight points form a square with side length 20. The area of the square is $20^2 = 400$.

Therefore, the area of the convex polygon is 400 square units. The answer is: $400$
