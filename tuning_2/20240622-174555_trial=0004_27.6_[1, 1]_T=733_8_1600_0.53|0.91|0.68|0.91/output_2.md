 The problem asks for the number of positive integers $m$ such that the equation \[\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}\] has $4$ distinct solutions.

The equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ is a piecewise function, and it has $4$ distinct solutions if and only if the right-hand side $\frac{m}{100}$ falls into a specific range.

The function $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert$ has a graph that is a "V" shape with the "valleys" at $x=1\pm2$, i.e., at $x=-1$ and $x=3$. The function equals $\frac{m}{100}$ at these points when $\frac{m}{100}=2$, i.e., $m=200$.

The function also equals $\frac{m}{100}$ at the "peaks" of the "V" shape, which are the midpoints between the "valleys", i.e., at $x=1\pm1$, i.e., at $x=0$ and $x=2$. The function equals $\frac{m}{100}$ at these points when $\frac{m}{100}=1$, i.e., $m=100$.

Therefore, the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has $4$ distinct solutions when $\frac{m}{100}$ falls into the range from $1$ to $2$, i.e., when $m$ is an integer from $100$ to $200$ inclusive.

The number of such integers is $200 - 100 + 1 = 101$.

So the number of positive integers $m$ such that the equation \[\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}\] has $4$ distinct solutions is $101$. The answer is: $101$

 The problem is asking for how many positive integers $m$ does the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ have $4$ distinct solutions.

First, let's simplify the equation. Since $\frac{m}{100}$ is a positive number, the number of solutions will depend on the value of $\frac{m}{100}$. The equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ will have four distinct solutions when $\frac{m}{100}$ is equal to $2$.

To see why, let's consider the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=2$.

The equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=2$ can be solved by breaking it down into two separate cases:

Case 1: $\vert x-1 \vert -2 = 2$.

In this case, we have $\vert x-1 \vert = 4$. This gives us two sub-cases:

Sub-case 1.1: $x-1 = 4$, which gives $x = 5$.

Sub-case 1.2: $x-1 = -4$, which gives $x = -3$.

Case 2: $\vert x-1 \vert -2 = -2$.

In this case, we have $\vert x-1 \vert = 0$. This gives us one sub-case:

Sub-case 2.1: $x-1 = 0$, which gives $x = 1$.

So, the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=2$ has four distinct solutions: $x = -3, 1, 5$.

Therefore, the value of $m$ that makes the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ have four distinct solutions is $m = 200$.

So, the only positive integer $m$ that satisfies the condition is $m = 200$. The answer is: $1$

The problem asks for the number of positive integers $m$ for which the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has four distinct solutions.

First, we need to understand the behavior of the function $f(x) = \vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert$. The function has four "steps" at $x=1 \pm 2$ and $x=1$, where the function changes its slope. Thus, the function takes the value of $\frac{m}{100}$ at four distinct points.

The function $f(x)$ takes the value of $1$ at $x=1-2= -1$, $0$ at $x=1-1=0$, $1$ at $x=1+1=2$, and $2$ at $x=1+2=3$. Therefore, for the equation $f(x) = \frac{m}{100}$ to have four distinct solutions, we must have $\frac{m}{100}$ in the range $(0,1)$. This means $0 < \frac{m}{100} < 1$, or equivalently, $0 < m < 100$. The positive integers $m$ that satisfy this inequality are exactly the integers from $1$ to $99$.

Therefore, there are $99$ positive integers $m$ for which the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has four distinct solutions. The answer is: $99$

Assistant:

 The equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has $4$ distinct solutions.

We know that the absolute value function $\vert x \vert$ is defined as:
\[\vert x \vert = \begin{cases}
x & \text{if } x \geq 0 \\
-x & \text{if } x < 0
\end{cases}\]
So, the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ can be split into two cases:

Case 1: $\vert x-1 \vert -2 = \frac{m}{100}$ or $\vert x-1 \vert -2 = -\frac{m}{100}$.

Case 2: $-\vert x-1 \vert +2 = \frac{m}{100}$ or $-\vert x-1 \vert +2 = -\frac{m}{100}$.

For each of these cases, we can solve the equation $\vert x-1 \vert = a$ as $x-1 = a$ or $x-1 = -a$.

For Case 1, we have:
1. $\vert x-1 \vert -2 = \frac{m}{100} \implies \vert x-1 \vert = 2 + \frac{m}{100}$. This gives us two equations:
   a. $x-1 = 2 + \frac{m}{100} \implies x = 3 + \frac{m}{100}$,
   b. $x-1 = -2 - \frac{m}{100} \implies x = -1 - \frac{m}{100}$.
2. $\vert x-1 \vert -2 = -\frac{m}{100} \implies \vert x-1 \vert = 2 - \frac{m}{100}$. This gives us two equations:
   a. $x-1 = 2 - \frac{m}{100} \implies x = 3 - \frac{m}{100}$,
   b. $x-1 = -2 + \frac{m}{100} \implies x = -1 + \frac{m}{100}$.

For Case 2, we have:
1. $-\vert x-1 \vert +2 = \frac{m}{100} \implies \vert x-1 \vert = 2 - \frac{m}{100}$. This gives us two equations:
   a. $x-1 = 2 - \frac{m}{100} \implies x = 3 - \frac{m}{100}$,
   b. $x-1 = -2 + \frac{m}{100} \implies x = -1 + \frac{m}{100}$.
2. $-\vert x-1 \vert +2 = -\frac{m}{100} \implies \vert x-1 \vert = 2 + \frac{m}{100}$. This gives us two equations:
   a. $x-1 = 2 + \frac{m}{100} \implies x = 3 + \frac{m}{100}$,
   b. $x-1 = -2 - \frac{m}{100} \implies x = -1 - \frac{m}{100}$.

Comparing the solutions from the four cases, we find that the solutions are all the same. Therefore, we only need to consider one of the cases.

The solutions for $x$ are: $x = 3 + \frac{m}{100}$, $x = 3 - \frac{m}{100}$, $x = -1 + \frac{m}{100}$, and $x = -1 - \frac{m}{100}$.

For the equation to have $4$ distinct solutions, the values of $\frac{m}{100}$ must be different and non-zero. This means that $m$ must be a multiple of $100$.

Let's find the range of $m$ such that the solutions are all positive.

For $x = 3 + \frac{m}{100}$, we need $3 + \frac{m}{100} > 0 \implies m > -300$.
For $x = 3 - \frac{m}{100}$, we need $3 - \frac{m}{100} > 0 \implies m < 300$.
For $x = -1 + \frac{m}{100}$, we need $-1 + \frac{m}{100} > 0 \implies m > 100$.
For $x = -1 - \frac{m}{100}$, we need $-1 - \frac{m}{100} > 0 \implies m < -100$.

Combining these conditions, we find that $-300 < m < -100$ or $100 < m < 300$. However, $m$ must be a multiple of $100$, so the possible values of $m$ are $100, 200, 300$.

Therefore, there are $3$ possible values of $m$ such that the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has $4$ distinct solutions. The answer is: $3$

 The problem asks for the number of positive integers $m$ such that the equation \[\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}\] has 4 distinct solutions.

The equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ involves absolute values, which makes it a bit tricky to solve directly. However, we can simplify the problem by considering the different cases for the absolute values.

When $\vert x-1 \vert -2$ is positive, we have $\vert x-1 \vert -2 = \frac{m}{100}$. This simplifies to $\vert x-1 \vert = 2 + \frac{m}{100}$.

When $\vert x-1 \vert -2$ is negative, we have $-( \vert x-1 \vert -2) = \frac{m}{100}$, which simplifies to $\vert x-1 \vert = 2 - \frac{m}{100}$.

Now we have two cases to consider:

1. $\vert x-1 \vert = 2 + \frac{m}{100}$: This gives us two equations: $x-1 = 2 + \frac{m}{100}$ and $-(x-1) = 2 + \frac{m}{100}$. The first equation simplifies to $x = 3 + \frac{m}{100}$, and the second equation simplifies to $x = -1 + \frac{m}{100}$.

2. $\vert x-1 \vert = 2 - \frac{m}{100}$: This gives us two equations: $x-1 = 2 - \frac{m}{100}$ and $-(x-1) = 2 - \frac{m}{100}$. The first equation simplifies to $x = 3 - \frac{m}{100}$, and the second equation simplifies to $x = -1 + \frac{m}{100}$.

Comparing the four equations we have, we see that $x = 3 + \frac{m}{100}$ and $x = 3 - \frac{m}{100}$ are the same equation, and $x = -1 + \frac{m}{100}$ is repeated twice. Therefore, we only have three distinct equations: $x = 3 + \frac{m}{100}$, $x = -1 + \frac{m}{100}$, and $x = 3 - \frac{m}{100}$.

For these equations to have 4 distinct solutions, the values of $\frac{m}{100}$ must be different for the three equations. This means that $m$ must be different multiples of 100 for the three equations. The only way this can happen is if $m$ is a multiple of 100.

The smallest positive integer value of $m$ that makes the three equations distinct is $m=100$, and the largest value of $m$ that still gives 4 distinct solutions is $m=100$. Therefore, the only positive integer value of $m$ that satisfies the condition is $m=100$. So, there is only one positive integer $m$ that makes the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ have 4 distinct solutions. The answer is: $1$

 The problem states that the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has $4$ distinct solutions.

The equation involves absolute values, which makes it a bit tricky to solve. However, we can break it down into cases based on the value inside the absolute value.

Case 1: If $\vert x-1 \vert -2 \geq 0$, then $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert = \vert x-1 \vert -2$. So the equation becomes $\vert x-1 \vert -2 = \frac{m}{100}$.

Case 2: If $\vert x-1 \vert -2 < 0$, then $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert = -( \vert x-1 \vert -2) = 2 - \vert x-1 \vert$. So the equation becomes $2 - \vert x-1 \vert = \frac{m}{100}$.

For each case, we need to solve the equation and find the number of solutions. Then, we add up the number of solutions from both cases to get the total number of solutions.

Case 1: $\vert x-1 \vert -2 = \frac{m}{100}$. Adding $2$ to both sides gives $\vert x-1 \vert = 2 + \frac{m}{100}$. This equation has two solutions if $2 + \frac{m}{100} > 0$, which simplifies to $m > -200$. The two solutions are $x = 1 \pm (2 + \frac{m}{100})$.

Case 2: $2 - \vert x-1 \vert = \frac{m}{100}$. Subtracting $2$ from both sides gives $-\vert x-1 \vert = -\frac{m}{100}$, or $\vert x-1 \vert = \frac{m}{100}$. This equation has two solutions if $\frac{m}{100} \geq 0$, which simplifies to $m \geq 0$. The two solutions are $x = 1 \pm \frac{m}{100}$.

The total number of solutions is the sum of the number of solutions from both cases. From Case 1, we have 2 solutions. From Case 2, we have 2 solutions. Therefore, the total number of solutions is 4.

So, the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has 4 distinct solutions when $m$ is in the range $(-200, 0]$. However, $m$ must be a positive integer. Therefore, the only value of $m$ that satisfies the conditions is $m = 100$.

Therefore, there is only one positive integer $m$ for which the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has 4 distinct solutions, and that is $m = 100$. The answer is: $1$

Assistant:

 The equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has 4 distinct solutions.
We know that the absolute value function $\vert x \vert$ is a piecewise function defined as:
\[\vert x \vert = \begin{cases} x & \text{if } x \geq 0 \\ -x & \text{if } x < 0 \end{cases}\]
So, the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ can be rewritten as:
\[\vert x-1 \vert -2 = \pm \frac{m}{100}\]
\[\vert x-1 \vert = 2 \pm \frac{m}{100}\]
Now, we have two cases to consider:
Case 1: $\vert x-1 \vert = 2 + \frac{m}{100}$
This gives us two sub-cases:
Sub-case 1.1: $x-1 = 2 + \frac{m}{100}$, so $x = 3 + \frac{m}{100}$.
Sub-case 1.2: $-(x-1) = 2 + \frac{m}{100}$, so $x = -1 + \frac{m}{100}$.
Case 2: $\vert x-1 \vert = 2 - \frac{m}{100}$
This gives us two sub-cases:
Sub-case 2.1: $x-1 = 2 - \frac{m}{100}$, so $x = 3 - \frac{m}{100}$.
Sub-case 2.2: $-(x-1) = 2 - \frac{m}{100}$, so $x = -1 - \frac{m}{100}$.
For the equation to have 4 distinct solutions, the ranges of the four solutions must be disjoint. This means that the following inequalities must hold:
\[\frac{m}{100} > 1 \quad \text{and} \quad 3 - \frac{m}{100} > -1 - \frac{m}{100}\]
Solving these inequalities gives:
\[m > 100 \quad \text{and} \quad 3 > -1\]
The second inequality is always true, so we only need to consider the first inequality.
Therefore, the value of $m$ must be greater than 100. The largest integer value of $m$ that satisfies this condition is 9999. However, we need to find the number of positive integer values of $m$ that satisfy the condition.
Since $m$ starts from 101, the number of positive integer values of $m$ is $9999 - 100 + 1 = 9900$.
However, we need to find the number of positive integer values of $m$ for which the equation has 4 distinct solutions.
By checking the values of $m$ from 101 to 9999, we find that the equation has 4 distinct solutions when $m$ is a multiple of 100.
The number of multiples of 100 from 101 to 9999 is $\left\lfloor \frac{9999}{100} \right\rfloor = 99$.
Therefore, the number of positive integer values of $m$ for which the equation has 4 distinct solutions is 99. The answer is: 99

Assistant:

 The equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has $4$ distinct solutions.

First, we need to understand the behavior of the function $f(x) = \vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert$.

The function $f(x)$ is a piecewise function with $4$ pieces:

1. For $x < -1$, $f(x) = -(x - 1 + 2) = -x + 1$.
2. For $-1 \leq x < 1$, $f(x) = -(x - 1 - 2) = -x + 3$.
3. For $1 \leq x < 3$, $f(x) = x - 1 - 2 = x - 3$.
4. For $x \geq 3$, $f(x) = x - 1 + 2 = x + 1$.

The function $f(x)$ is a V-shaped graph with vertices at $x = -1, 1, 3$.

Now, we want to find the values of $m$ such that the equation $f(x) = \frac{m}{100}$ has $4$ distinct solutions.

This means that the value $\frac{m}{100}$ must fall strictly between the minimum and maximum values of $f(x)$.

The minimum value of $f(x)$ is $0$ and the maximum value is $2$.

So, we have $0 < \frac{m}{100} < 2$, which gives $0 < m < 200$.

The positive integers $m$ that satisfy this inequality are $1, 2, ..., 199$.

However, we are asked for the number of positive integers $m$ such that the equation has $4$ distinct solutions.

By observation of the graph of $f(x)$, we can see that $f(x) = \frac{m}{100}$ has $4$ distinct solutions when $\frac{m}{100} = 1$.

Therefore, there is only one value of $m$ that satisfies the given conditions, and that is $m = 100$.

So, the number of positive integers $m$ for which the equation has $4$ distinct solutions is $1$. The answer is: $1$
