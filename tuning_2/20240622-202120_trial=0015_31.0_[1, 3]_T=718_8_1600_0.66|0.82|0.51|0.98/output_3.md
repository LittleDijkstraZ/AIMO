Below is a math problem you are to solve (natural number answer):
"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"
To accomplish this, first list the problem's constraints, conditions and related knowledge, and thens solve the problem step by step. Be clear so even an idiot can follow your instructions. After solving the problem, output the final numerical answer within \boxed{}.

Assistant:

 The problem's constraints, conditions, and related knowledge are as follows:

1. The equation $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ is true if and only if either of the two factors is zero.
2. A product is zero if and only if at least one of its factors is zero.
3. For a product of two factors to be zero, either both factors are zero or one of the factors is zero.
4. The absolute value function $|x|$ is always nonnegative, so $|x| - a = 0$ if and only if $|x| = a$.
5. The absolute value function $|x|$ is equal to $x$ if $x \geq 0$ and $-x$ if $x < 0$.

Now, let's solve the problem step by step:

1. If $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$, then $\vert x + y \vert = 10$. By the property of absolute value, this means either $x + y = 10$ or $x + y = -10$.
2. If $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$, then $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. Similarly, this means either $x - y = 10$ or $x - y = -10$.
3. If $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$, then $\vert x \vert = 8$. This means either $x = 8$ or $x = -8$.
4. If $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$, then $\vert y \vert = 8$. This means either $y = 8$ or $y = -8$.

By combining these conditions, we can see that the points $(x, y)$ that satisfy the original equation must lie on the lines $x + y = 10$, $x + y = -10$, $x - y = 10$, $x - y = -10$, $x = 8$, $x = -8$, $y = 8$, and $y = -8$. These lines enclose a rectangle with vertices at $(8, 2)$, $(8, -6)$, $(-8, 6)$, and $(-8, -2)$.

To find the area of this rectangle, we can use the formula for the area of a rectangle, which is length times width. The length of the rectangle is the difference in the x-coordinates of its vertices, which is $8 - (-8) = 16$. The width of the rectangle is the difference in the y-coordinates of its vertices, which is $6 - (-2) = 8$. Therefore, the area of the rectangle is $16 \times 8 = 128$.
The answer is: $128$

Below is a math problem you are to solve (natural number answer):
"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"

Assistant:

 The problem's constraints, conditions, and related knowledge are:

1. The equation is given as $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$.
2. The equation is equal to zero if and only if either of the two factors is equal to zero.
3. The absolute value function $\vert x \vert$ is defined as $x$ if $x \geq 0$ and $-x$ if $x < 0$.
4. The area of a convex polygon can be found using the shoelace formula.

Now, let's solve the problem step by step:

Step 1: Find the points that satisfy the equation.

If either of the factors is equal to zero, the entire equation is equal to zero. So we have two cases to consider:

Case 1: $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ and $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$.
This implies that $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$.
From the absolute value definition, we have four possible combinations:
1. $x + y = 10$ and $x - y = 10$. Solving this system of equations gives $x = 10$ and $y = 0$.
2. $x + y = 10$ and $x - y = -10$. Solving this system of equations gives $x = 0$ and $y = 10$.
3. $x + y = -10$ and $x - y = 10$. Solving this system of equations gives $x = -10$ and $y = 0$.
4. $x + y = -10$ and $x - y = -10$. Solving this system of equations gives $x = 0$ and $y = -10$.

Case 2: $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ and $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$.
This implies that $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$.
From the absolute value definition, we have four possible combinations:
1. $x = 8$ and $y = 8$.
2. $x = 8$ and $y = -8$.
3. $x = -8$ and $y = 8$.
4. $x = -8$ and $y = -8$.

Step 2: List all the points.
Combining the results from Case 1 and Case 2, we have the following points:
$(10, 0)$, $(0, 10)$, $(-10, 0)$, $(0, -10)$, $(8, 8)$, $(8, -8)$, $(-8, 8)$, and $(-8, -8)$.

Step 3: Determine the shape of the polygon.
Plotting these points on a coordinate plane, we can see that they form a square with side length 20.

Step 4: Calculate the area of the polygon.
The area of a square is given by side length squared. So the area of this square is $20^2 = 400$.

The answer is: $400$

"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"

 The problem's constraints, conditions and related knowledge are as follows:

1. The equation $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ must be satisfied for all points $(x, y)$ in the polygon.
2. The absolute value function $\vert x \vert$ is defined as $x$ if $x \geq 0$ and $-x$ if $x < 0$.
3. The area of a polygon can be found using the shoelace formula.

Now, let's solve the problem step by step:

From the equation $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$, we have two cases:

Case 1: $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$. This implies that $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. This means that $x + y = \pm 10$ and $x - y = \pm 10$. Solving these equations, we get the four lines $x + y = 10$, $x + y = -10$, $x - y = 10$, and $x - y = -10$.

Case 2: $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$. This implies that $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$. This means that $x = \pm 8$ and $y = \pm 8$. So we have the four lines $x = 8$, $x = -8$, $y = 8$, and $y = -8$.

The intersection of these lines form a square with side length 10 (from the lines $x + y = 10$ and $x - y = 10$). The vertices of this square are $(8, 2)$, $(-8, 2)$, $(-8, -2)$, and $(8, -2)$.

To find the area of this square, we can use the formula for the area of a square, which is the side length squared. The side length is 10, so the area is $10^2 = 100$.

Therefore, the area of the convex polygon is 100. The answer is: $100$

Below is a math problem you are to solve (natural number answer):
"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"

Assistant:

 The problem's constraints, conditions and related knowledge are:

1. The equation $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ must be satisfied for all points $(x, y)$ inside the polygon.
2. The equation is equal to zero if either of the two factors is zero.
3. The factors are products of two quadratic expressions.
4. Each quadratic expression is equal to zero if its argument (the value inside the absolute value) is zero.
5. The absolute value of a number is zero only if the number itself is zero.

Now, let's solve the problem step by step:

Step 1: Setting each factor to zero
For the first factor, we have $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ and $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$. This implies that $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$.
For the second factor, we have $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ and $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$. This implies that $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$.

Step 2: Solving the equations
From $\vert x + y \vert = 10$, we have $x + y = 10$ or $x + y = -10$.
From $\vert x - y \vert = 10$, we have $x - y = 10$ or $x - y = -10$.
From $\vert x \vert = 8$, we have $x = 8$ or $x = -8$.
From $\vert y \vert = 8$, we have $y = 8$ or $y = -8$.

Step 3: Finding the intersection points
By solving the system of equations, we find the intersection points:
- For $x = 8$ and $y = 8$, we have $x + y = 16$ and $x - y = 0$, which satisfy both conditions. So, one point is $(8, 8)$.
- For $x = 8$ and $y = -8$, we have $x + y = 0$ and $x - y = 16$, which satisfy both conditions. So, another point is $(8, -8)$.
- For $x = -8$ and $y = 8$, we have $x + y = 0$ and $x - y = -16$, which satisfy both conditions. So, another point is $(-8, 8)$.
- For $x = -8$ and $y = -8$, we have $x + y = -16$ and $x - y = 0$, which satisfy both conditions. So, another point is $(-8, -8)$.

Step 4: Plotting the points
The four points form a square with side length 16.

Step 5: Calculating the area
The area of the square is side length squared, which is $16^2 = 256$.
The answer is: $256$

Assistant:

 The given equation is a product of two expressions equal to zero. This means that either the first expression is zero or the second expression is zero. 

The first expression is $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)$. This expression is zero if and only if both $\vert x + y \vert - 10 = 0$ and $\vert x - y \vert - 10 = 0$, which means $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. The solutions to these equations are all points $(x, y)$ that are at a distance of 10 units from the origin in the $x+y$ and $x-y$ directions. These are the lines $x+y=10$ and $x+y=-10$, $x-y=10$ and $x-y=-10$.

The second expression is $((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2)$. This expression is zero if and only if both $\vert x \vert - 8 = 0$ and $\vert y \vert - 8 = 0$, which means $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$. The solutions to these equations are all points $(x, y)$ that are at a distance of 8 units from the origin in the $x$ and $y$ directions. These are the lines $x=8$ and $x=-8$, $y=8$ and $y=-8$.

The intersection of these lines form a square with side length 10 (since the distance from the origin to the lines $x+y=10$ or $x-y=10$ is 10/sqrt(2) = 5*sqrt(2), and the distance from the origin to the lines $x=8$ or $y=8$ is 8). The area of this square is $10^2 = 100$.

So, the area of the convex polygon is 100.

Below is a math problem you are to solve (natural number answer):
"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"
To accomplish this, first list the problem's constraints, conditions and related knowledge, and thens solve the problem step by step. Be clear so even an idiot can follow your instructions. After solving the problem, output the final numerical answer within \boxed{}.

Assistant:

 The problem's constraints, conditions, and related knowledge are as follows:

1. The equation is given as $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$.
2. The equation is equal to zero if either of the two factors is zero.
3. The factors are products of two quadratic equations.
4. The solution to a quadratic equation is given by $x = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}$.
5. The absolute value function $|x|$ can be expressed as a piecewise function: $|x| = x$ if $x \geq 0$ and $|x| = -x$ if $x < 0$.

Now, let's solve the problem step by step:

Step 1: Set each factor equal to zero and solve for $x$ and $y$.

For the first factor:
$(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0 \implies \vert x + y \vert = 10 \implies x + y = \pm 10$.
Similarly, $\vert x - y \vert = 10 \implies x - y = \pm 10$.

For the second factor:
$(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0 \implies \vert x \vert = 8 \implies x = \pm 8$.
Similarly, $\vert y \vert = 8 \implies y = \pm 8$.

Step 2: Solve the system of equations formed by the intersections of the lines $x + y = \pm 10$, $x - y = \pm 10$, $x = \pm 8$, and $y = \pm 8$.

The intersections are as follows:
- $x + y = 10$ and $x = 8$ gives $y = 2$.
- $x + y = 10$ and $y = 8$ gives $x = 2$.
- $x + y = 10$ and $x = -8$ gives $y = 18$.
- $x + y = 10$ and $y = -8$ gives $x = 18$.
- $x - y = 10$ and $x = 8$ gives $y = -2$.
- $x - y = 10$ and $y = 8$ gives $x = 18$.
- $x - y = 10$ and $x = -8$ gives $y = -18$.
- $x - y = 10$ and $y = -8$ gives $x = -2$.
- $x = 8$ and $y = 8$ gives $x = y = 8$.
- $x = 8$ and $y = -8$ gives $x = 8, y = -8$.
- $x = -8$ and $y = 8$ gives $x = -8, y = 8$.
- $x = -8$ and $y = -8$ gives $x = y = -8$.

Step 3: Plot the points on a coordinate plane and connect them to form the polygon.

The points form a square with side length 16.

Step 4: Calculate the area of the square.

The area of a square is given by side length squared, so the area of this square is $16^2 = 256$.

Therefore, the area of the convex polygon is 256 square units. The answer is: $256$

"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"

Assistant:

 The problem's constraints are given by the equation:
$$((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0.$$
For the product of two numbers to be zero, either one of the numbers must be zero. Therefore, we have two cases to consider:

Case 1: $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$.
This implies that $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$.
The solutions to these equations are the lines $x + y = 10$, $x + y = -10$, $x - y = 10$, and $x - y = -10$. These lines form a rectangle with vertices at $(10, 0)$, $(0, 10)$, $(-10, 0)$, and $(0, -10)$.

Case 2: $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$.
This implies that $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$.
The solutions to these equations are the lines $x = 8$, $x = -8$, $y = 8$, and $y = -8$. These lines form a square with vertices at $(8, 8)$, $(8, -8)$, $(-8, 8)$, and $(-8, -8)$.

The intersection of the two regions defined by the cases is the square with side length 10 (formed by the intersection of the rectangle and the square). The area of this square is $10^2 = 100$. The answer is: $100$

Below is a math problem you are to solve (natural number answer):
"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"

Assistant:

 The problem's constraints, conditions and related knowledge are:

1. The equation is a product of two terms equal to zero, so either the first term is zero or the second term is zero.
2. The absolute value function $|x|$ is equal to $x$ if $x \geq 0$ and $-x$ if $x < 0$.
3. The square of an absolute value, $|x|^2$, is always nonnegative and equal to $x^2$.

Now, let's solve the problem step by step.

Step 1: Solve the equations

If either of the terms in the product is zero, then the entire product is zero. So we have two cases to consider:

Case 1: $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$. This implies $\vert x + y \vert = 10$. This means $x + y = 10$ or $x + y = -10$.

Case 2: $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$. This implies $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. This means $x - y = 10$ or $x - y = -10$.

Case 3: $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$. This implies $\vert x \vert = 8$. This means $x = 8$ or $x = -8$.

Case 4: $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$. This implies $\vert y \vert = 8$. This means $y = 8$ or $y = -8$.

Step 2: Analyze the solutions

By combining the solutions from the four cases, we can see that the points $(x, y)$ that satisfy the equation must lie on the lines $x + y = 10$, $x + y = -10$, $x - y = 10$, $x - y = -10$, $x = 8$, $x = -8$, $y = 8$, and $y = -8$. These lines enclose a square with side length 8.

Step 3: Calculate the area of the square

The area of a square is given by the square of the length of its side. So the area of the square is $8^2 = 64$.
The answer is: $64$
