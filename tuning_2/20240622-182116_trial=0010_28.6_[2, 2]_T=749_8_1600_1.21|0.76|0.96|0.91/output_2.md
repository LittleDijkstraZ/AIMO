The equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has 4 distinct solutions, we need to find the value of $m$.

Firstly, we notice that $\frac{m}{100}$ is a positive number, so $m$ must be a positive integer. Also, the number of solutions of the equation is determined by the value of $\frac{m}{100}$, because the function $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert$ takes on the value from $0$ to $3$ when its argument changes from $0$ to $4$, and the number of its roots is equal to the number of times it equals the value of $\frac{m}{100}$. Therefore, for the equation to have 4 distinct solutions, $\frac{m}{100}$ must be equal to $1$ or $2$.

If $\frac{m}{100} = 1$, then $m = 100$.
If $\frac{m}{100} = 2$, then $m = 200$.

So, the possible values of $m$ are $100$ and $200$. However, since we need the number of positive integers, there is only one value of $m$, which is $200$. Therefore, the number of positive integers $m$ that make the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ have $4$ distinct solutions is $1$. The answer is: 1

 The equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has 4 distinct solutions. This means that the absolute value expression on the left-hand side will be equal to $\frac{m}{100}$, $\frac{-m}{100}$, $\frac{m}{100} - 2$, and $\frac{m}{100} + 2$.

We know that the absolute value of a number cannot be negative, so $\frac{-m}{100}$ will never be equal to the left-hand side. Therefore, we only need to consider the cases where $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ and $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100} - 2$.

When $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$, the equation $\vert x-1 \vert -2 = \pm \frac{m}{100}$ gives us two sub-equations: $\vert x-1 \vert -2 = \frac{m}{100}$ and $\vert x-1 \vert -2 = -\frac{m}{100}$.

Solving these sub-equations, we get $\vert x-1 \vert = 2 + \frac{m}{100}$ and $\vert x-1 \vert = 2 - \frac{m}{100}$. The first sub-equation has two solutions when $2 + \frac{m}{100} > 0$, or $m > -200$. The second sub-equation has no solution when $2 - \frac{m}{100} < 0$, or $m > 200$. Therefore, the first sub-equation gives us solutions when $m > -200$ and $m \leq 200$.

When $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100} - 2$, the equation $\vert x-1 \vert -2 = \pm (\frac{m}{100} - 2)$ gives us two sub-equations: $\vert x-1 \vert -2 = \frac{m}{100} - 2$ and $\vert x-1 \vert -2 = -(\frac{m}{100} - 2)$, which simplify to $\vert x-1 \vert = \frac{m}{100}$ and $\vert x-1 \vert = 4 - \frac{m}{100}$.

The first sub-equation has two solutions when $\frac{m}{100} > 0$, or $m > 0$. The second sub-equation has two solutions when $4 - \frac{m}{100} > 0$, or $m < 400$. Therefore, the second sub-equation gives us solutions when $0 < m < 400$.

Combining the constraints from both cases, we find that the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has 4 distinct solutions when $0 < m \leq 200$. There are 200 positive integers in this range.
The answer is: $200$.

Assistant:

 First, let's break down the problem into smaller parts and solve each part step by step.

1. The equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has 4 distinct solutions.

2. We know that the number of solutions to the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=k$ is dependent on the value of $k$. Specifically, the equation has:
   - 4 distinct solutions if $0<k<1$.
   - 3 distinct solutions if $k=1$.
   - 2 distinct solutions if $k>1$.

3. Therefore, in order for the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ to have 4 distinct solutions, we must have $0<\frac{m}{100}<1$.

4. This inequality simplifies to $0<m<100$. So $m$ is a positive integer between 1 and 99 inclusive.

Now, we just need to count the number of positive integers in this range. The positive integers from 1 to 99 inclusive are 99 in total.

Therefore, there are 99 positive integers $m$ for which the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has 4 distinct solutions.
The answer is: $99$.

Assistant:

 The problem states that we need to find the number of positive integers $m$ such that the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has $4$ distinct solutions.

Firstly, we notice that the right-hand side of the equation, $\frac{m}{100}$, is always positive. This means that the absolute value of the left-hand side, $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert$, must also be positive. This implies that $\vert x-1 \vert -2 > 0$, or equivalently, $\vert x-1 \vert > 2$. This further implies that $x-1 > 2$ or $x-1 < -2$, which gives us $x > 3$ or $x < -1$. So the solutions for $x$ must be in the set $(-\infty, -1) \cup (3, \infty)$.

Next, we notice that the expression inside the absolute value on the left-hand side, $\vert x-1 \vert -2$, can be either positive or negative. So we have two cases to consider:

1. If $\vert x-1 \vert -2 > 0$, then the equation becomes $\vert x-1 \vert -2 = \frac{m}{100}$. Adding $2$ to both sides gives $\vert x-1 \vert = \frac{m}{100} + 2$. This implies that $x-1 = \frac{m}{100} + 2$ or $x-1 = -(\frac{m}{100} + 2)$. Solving these equations gives $x = \frac{m}{100} + 3$ or $x = 1 - \frac{m}{100} - 2 = - \frac{m}{100} - 1$. These are the solutions for $x$ in the set $(3, \infty)$.

2. If $\vert x-1 \vert -2 < 0$, then the equation becomes $-\vert x-1 \vert +2 = \frac{m}{100}$. This simplifies to $\vert x-1 \vert = 2 - \frac{m}{100}$. This implies that $x-1 = 2 - \frac{m}{100}$ or $x-1 = - (2 - \frac{m}{100}) = \frac{m}{100} - 2$. Solving these equations gives $x = 3 - \frac{m}{100}$ or $x = - \frac{m}{100} - 1$. These are the solutions for $x$ in the set $(-\infty, -1)$.

So in total, we have four distinct solutions: $x = \frac{m}{100} + 3$, $x = - \frac{m}{100} - 1$, $x = 3 - \frac{m}{100}$, and $x = - \frac{m}{100} - 1$. To have exactly $4$ distinct solutions, we need the value of $\frac{m}{100}$ to be less than $2$ so that the solutions $x = \frac{m}{100} + 3$ and $x = 3 - \frac{m}{100}$ are in the set $(3, \infty)$, and the value of $-\frac{m}{100}$ to be greater than $-1$ so that the solutions $x = - \frac{m}{100} - 1$ and $x = -1 + \frac{m}{100}$ are in the set $(-\infty, -1)$. This gives us $-1 < -\frac{m}{100} < 2$, or equivalently, $100 < m < 200$.

The positive integers $m$ in the range $(100, 200)$ are the numbers from $101$ to $199$, inclusive. The number of such integers is $199 - 101 + 1 = 99$. So there are $99$ positive integers $m$ such that the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has $4$ distinct solutions. The answer is: $\boxed{99}$.

Assistant:

 The problem states that the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has $4$ distinct solutions. We know that the absolute value function has a property that $|a|=a$ if $a \geq 0$ and $|a|=-a$ if $a<0$. So we can split the absolute value function in the equation into two cases.

Case 1: $\vert x-1 \vert -2=\frac{m}{100}$
In this case, $\vert x-1 \vert = \frac{m}{100} + 2$. So we have two sub-cases:

Sub-case 1.1: $x-1 = \frac{m}{100} + 2$. Solving for $x$ gives $x = \frac{m}{100} + 3$.
Sub-case 1.2: $-(x-1) = \frac{m}{100} + 2$, which simplifies to $x = 1 - \frac{m}{100} - 2 = - \frac{m}{100} - 1$.

Case 2: $\vert x-1 \vert -2=-\frac{m}{100}$. In this case, $\vert x-1 \vert = 2 - \frac{m}{100}$. So we have two sub-cases:

Sub-case 2.1: $x-1 = 2 - \frac{m}{100}$, which simplifies to $x = 3 - \frac{m}{100}$.
Sub-case 2.2: $-(x-1) = 2 - \frac{m}{100}$, which simplifies to $x = -1 + \frac{m}{100}$.

Now we need to find the values of $m$ such that the four solutions from the above sub-cases are distinct.

For Case 1, the solutions are $\frac{m}{100} + 3$ and $- \frac{m}{100} - 1$. For these to be distinct, we need $\frac{m}{100} + 3 \neq - \frac{m}{100} - 1$, which simplifies to $m \neq -50$.

For Case 2, the solutions are $3 - \frac{m}{100}$ and $-1 + \frac{m}{100}$. For these to be distinct, we need $3 - \frac{m}{100} \neq -1 + \frac{m}{100}$, which simplifies to $m \neq 200$.

Therefore, the values of $m$ that satisfy the conditions are those that satisfy $m \neq -50$ and $m \neq 200$. The positive integers that satisfy these conditions are the positive integers from 1 to 199, excluding 50 and 200. The number of such integers is $199 - 2 = 197$. Therefore, the value of $m$ for which the equation has 4 distinct solutions is 197. The answer is: $197$

 The problem states that we need to find the number of positive integers $m$ such that the equation \[\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}\] has $4$ distinct solutions.

First, we notice that the right-hand side of the equation, $\frac{m}{100}$, must be positive, which implies that $m$ must be a positive integer.

The left-hand side of the equation, $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert$, is the absolute value of the absolute value of $x-1$ minus $2$. This expression is always nonnegative, and it equals $0$ when $\vert x-1 \vert = 2$, which gives us $x = 3$ or $x = -1$. So the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert = 0$ has two solutions: $x = 3$ and $x = -1$.

Now, for the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ to have four distinct solutions, the value of $\frac{m}{100}$ must be strictly greater than $0$ and strictly less than the distance between the two solutions $3$ and $-1$, which is $4$. Therefore, we have $0 < \frac{m}{100} < 4$, which implies $0 < m < 400$.

The positive integers $m$ that satisfy this inequality are $1, 2, 3, ..., 399$. So there are $399$ such integers.

However, we must also consider the fact that the left-hand side of the equation is an absolute value, which means it is symmetric about the line $x = 1$. This implies that for each solution $x$ in the interval $( -1, 3)$, there is another solution $x'$ in the interval $(3, \infty)$. Therefore, the number of distinct solutions of the equation must be even.

We know that the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert = 0$ has two solutions, and the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert = \frac{m}{100}$ for any positive integer $m$ has at least four distinct solutions. So the number of solutions of the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert = \frac{m}{100}$ must be even and greater than $2$. The only even number that satisfies these conditions is $4$.

Therefore, the number of positive integers $m$ such that the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert = \frac{m}{100}$ has $4$ distinct solutions is $1$. The only positive integer $m$ that satisfies this condition is $100$. So the number of positive integers $m$ is $1$. The answer is: 1

 The problem asks for the number of positive integers $m$ for which the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has 4 distinct solutions.

First, let's analyze the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$.

The expression $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert$ can take on three values: $0$, $\frac{m}{100}$, and $2-\frac{m}{100}$.

If $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=0$, then $\vert x-1 \vert = 2$, so $x = 3$ or $x = -1$.

If $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$, then $\vert x-1 \vert = 2 + \frac{m}{100}$ or $\vert x-1 \vert = 2 - \frac{m}{100}$. Solving these two equations gives us the solutions $x = 1 + 2 + \frac{m}{100} = 3 + \frac{m}{100}$ and $x = 1 + 2 - \frac{m}{100} = 3 - \frac{m}{100}$ and $x = 1 - 2 + \frac{m}{100} = \frac{m}{100}$ and $x = 1 - 2 + \frac{m}{100} = -\frac{m}{100}$.

If $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=2-\frac{m}{100}$, then $\vert x-1 \vert = 4 - \frac{m}{100}$. This gives us the solutions $x = 1 + 4 - \frac{m}{100} = 5 - \frac{m}{100}$ and $x = 1 - 4 + \frac{m}{100} = -\frac{m}{100}$.

We are looking for the values of $m$ for which these four equations give 4 distinct solutions.

For the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=0$, the solutions are $x = 3$ and $x = -1$.

For the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$, the solutions are $x = 3 + \frac{m}{100}$, $x = 3 - \frac{m}{100}$, $x = \frac{m}{100}$, and $x = -\frac{m}{100}$. These four solutions are distinct if and only if $\frac{m}{100} \neq 2$, i.e., $m \neq 200$.

For the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=2-\frac{m}{100}$, the solutions are $x = 5 - \frac{m}{100}$ and $x = -\frac{m}{100}$. These two solutions are distinct from the previous four solutions if and only if $5 - \frac{m}{100} \neq 3 + \frac{m}{100}$, $5 - \frac{m}{100} \neq 3 - \frac{m}{100}$, $5 - \frac{m}{100} \neq \frac{m}{100}$, $5 - \frac{m}{100} \neq -\frac{m}{100}$, $3 + \frac{m}{100} \neq -\frac{m}{100}$, $3 - \frac{m}{100} \neq -\frac{m}{100}$, $\frac{m}{100} \neq -\frac{m}{100}$. These conditions are satisfied if and only if $m \neq 0$.

Therefore, the only values of $m$ for which the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has 4 distinct solutions are the positive integers $m$ such that $0 < m < 200$. The number of such positive integers is $199$.
The answer is: $199$

 The problem is asking for the number of positive integers $m$ such that the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has exactly 4 distinct solutions.

First, let's understand the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$. This equation involves absolute values, which makes it a bit complicated. However, we can break it down into cases based on the value of $x$.

Case 1: $x \geq 1$
In this case, the equation becomes $\vert x-1-2 \vert = \frac{m}{100}$, which simplifies to $\vert x-3 \vert = \frac{m}{100}$. This equation has two solutions: $x = 3 + \frac{m}{100}$ and $x = 3 - \frac{m}{100}$.

Case 2: $x < 1$
In this case, the equation becomes $\vert -(x-1)-2 \vert = \frac{m}{100}$, which simplifies to $\vert -x+1-2 \vert = \frac{m}{100}$, and then $\vert -x-1 \vert = \frac{m}{100}$, which further simplifies to $\vert x+1 \vert = \frac{m}{100}$. This equation also has two solutions: $x = -1 - \frac{m}{100}$ and $x = -1 + \frac{m}{100}$.

So in total, we have 4 solutions: $x = 3 + \frac{m}{100}$, $x = 3 - \frac{m}{100}$, $x = -1 - \frac{m}{100}$, and $x = -1 + \frac{m}{100}$.

For the equation to have exactly 4 distinct solutions, we need $\frac{m}{100} > 2$ to avoid overlapping between the two cases, and $\frac{m}{100} < 1$ to ensure all solutions are distinct. This gives $200 > m > 100$. The only positive integer in this range is $m = 101$.

So, there is only one value of $m$ that makes the equation have exactly 4 distinct solutions, and that is $m = 101$. The answer is: $1$
