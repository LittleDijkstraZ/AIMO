 The problem asks for the number of positive integers $m$ such that the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has $4$ distinct solutions.

First, let's simplify the equation. Since $\frac{m}{100}$ is positive, the absolute value equation will have four distinct solutions if and only if $\frac{m}{100} = 2$. This is because the expression on the left side of the equation will oscillate between $-2$ and $2$ twice as $x$ varies over the real numbers, and we want the right side to be $2$ for the equation to have four distinct solutions.

So, we have $\frac{m}{100} = 2$, which implies $m = 200$.

Therefore, there is only one positive integer $m$ that satisfies the conditions of the problem, and that is $m = 200$. The answer is: $1$

 The equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has 4 distinct solutions.

First, we need to consider the possible values of $m$. Since $\frac{m}{100}$ is a positive number, $m$ must be a positive integer. Also, since the absolute value of a number cannot be negative, $\frac{m}{100}$ must be less than 2. Therefore, $m$ must be less than 200.

Next, we need to analyze the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$. This equation has 4 distinct solutions if and only if the graph of $y = \vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert$ intersects the line $y = \frac{m}{100}$ at 4 distinct points.

The graph of $y = \vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert$ is a "V" shape with the vertex at $(1,2)$. The line $y = \frac{m}{100}$ is a horizontal line that passes through the point $(0,0)$.

For the line $y = \frac{m}{100}$ to intersect the graph of $y = \vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert$ at 4 distinct points, the value of $\frac{m}{100}$ must be strictly between 1 and 2. Therefore, $1 < \frac{m}{100} < 2$, which implies $100 < m < 200$.

The only positive integer $m$ that satisfies this inequality is $m = 150$.

Therefore, there is only one positive integer $m$ for which the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has 4 distinct solutions. The answer is: $1$

 The problem asks for the number of positive integers $m$ such that the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has four distinct solutions.

First, we need to understand the behavior of the function $f(x) = \vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert$.

The function $f(x)$ is a piecewise function with four cases to consider:

1. If $x < 1$, then $f(x) = \vert -x - 1 - 2 \vert = \vert -x - 3 \vert = x + 3$.
2. If $1 \leq x < 3$, then $f(x) = \vert x - 1 - 2 \vert = \vert x - 3 \vert = 3 - x$.
3. If $3 \leq x < 5$, then $f(x) = \vert x - 1 - 2 \vert = \vert x - 3 \vert = x - 3$.
4. If $x \geq 5$, then $f(x) = \vert x - 1 - 2 \vert = \vert x - 3 \vert = x - 3$.

So, $f(x)$ is a triangular wave function with amplitude $3$ and period $2$. The equation $f(x) = \frac{m}{100}$ will have four distinct solutions if $\frac{m}{100}$ is strictly between $0$ and $3$. This means $0 < \frac{m}{100} < 3$, or equivalently, $0 < m < 300$.

The positive integers $m$ that satisfy this inequality are $1, 2, 3, ..., 299$. Therefore, there are $299$ such integers. The answer is: $299$.

 The problem asks for the number of positive integers $m$ such that the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has 4 distinct solutions.

First, we know that the absolute value function $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert$ is a piecewise function that can take on three different forms depending on the value of $x$. Specifically, we have:

1. If $\vert x-1 \vert -2 \geq 0$, then $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert = \vert x-1 \vert -2$.
2. If $-\frac{1}{2} \leq x-1 \leq \frac{1}{2}$, then $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert = 2 - \vert x-1 \vert$.
3. If $\vert x-1 \vert -2 < 0$, then $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert = -( \vert x-1 \vert -2) = 2 - \vert x-1 \vert$.

So the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ can be rewritten as:

1. $\vert x-1 \vert -2 = \frac{m}{100}$ if $\vert x-1 \vert -2 \geq 0$,
2. $2 - \vert x-1 \vert = \frac{m}{100}$ if $-\frac{1}{2} \leq x-1 \leq \frac{1}{2}$,
3. $2 - \vert x-1 \vert = \frac{m}{100}$ if $\vert x-1 \vert -2 < 0$.

For each of these cases, we need to solve the equation for $x$ and count the number of distinct solutions.

1. For the first case, we have $\vert x-1 \vert = 2 + \frac{m}{100}$. This gives us two equations: $x-1 = 2 + \frac{m}{100}$ and $x-1 = -(2 + \frac{m}{100})$. Solving these gives $x = 3 + \frac{m}{100}$ and $x = -1 + \frac{m}{100}$, respectively. The number of distinct solutions is 2.

2. For the second case, we have $\vert x-1 \vert = 2 - \frac{m}{100}$. This gives us two equations: $x-1 = 2 - \frac{m}{100}$ and $x-1 = -(2 - \frac{m}{100})$. Solving these gives $x = 3 - \frac{m}{100}$ and $x = -1 + \frac{m}{100}$, respectively. The number of distinct solutions is 2.

3. For the third case, we have $\vert x-1 \vert = 2 - \frac{m}{100}$. This gives us two equations: $x-1 = 2 - \frac{m}{100}$ and $x-1 = -(2 - \frac{m}{100})$. Solving these gives $x = 3 - \frac{m}{100}$ and $x = -1 + \frac{m}{100}$, respectively. The number of distinct solutions is 2.

So in each case, the number of distinct solutions is 2. To have a total of 4 distinct solutions, we need to consider the sum of the solutions from all three cases. Since each case contributes 2 solutions, the total number of solutions is even. The only even number that is equal to 4 is 4 itself. Therefore, there is only one value of $m$ that satisfies the condition, and that is $m=400$.
The answer is: $1$

Below is a math problem you are to solve (natural number answer):
"For how many positive integers $m$ does the equation \[\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}\] have $4$ distinct solutions?"

Assistant:

 The equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has 4 distinct solutions.

We know that the absolute value function $\vert x \vert$ splits into two cases: $x$ if $x \geq 0$ and $-x$ if $x < 0$. So, we can split the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ into two cases:

Case 1: $\vert x-1 \vert -2 = \frac{m}{100}$.

Case 2: $-\vert x-1 \vert +2 = \frac{m}{100}$.

For each case, we can further split into two sub-cases based on the absolute value inside:

Sub-case 1.1: $x-1 -2 = \frac{m}{100}$, which simplifies to $x-3 = \frac{m}{100}$.

Sub-case 1.2: $-(x-1) -2 = \frac{m}{100}$, which simplifies to $-x+1 -2 = \frac{m}{100}$, or $-x-1 = \frac{m}{100}$.

Sub-case 2.1: $x-1 -(-2) = \frac{m}{100}$, which simplifies to $x-1 +2 = \frac{m}{100}$, or $x+1 = \frac{m}{100}$.

Sub-case 2.2: $-(x-1) -(-2) = \frac{m}{100}$, which simplifies to $-x+1 +2 = \frac{m}{100}$, or $-x+3 = \frac{m}{100}$.

Now we have 4 equations:

1. $x-3 = \frac{m}{100}$.
2. $-x-1 = \frac{m}{100}$.
3. $x+1 = \frac{m}{100}$.
4. $-x+3 = \frac{m}{100}$.

Solving these equations for $x$ gives:

1. $x = \frac{m}{100} + 3$.
2. $x = -\frac{m}{100} - 1$.
3. $x = \frac{m}{100} - 1$.
4. $x = 3 - \frac{m}{100}$.

For each of these equations, we need to find the values of $m$ that make the right-hand side positive (since $x$ must be a positive integer). This gives us the following constraints:

1. $\frac{m}{100} + 3 > 0 \implies m > -300$, but since $m$ is a positive integer, this constraint is always satisfied.
2. $-\frac{m}{100} - 1 > 0 \implies m < -100$, which is not possible since $m$ is a positive integer.
3. $\frac{m}{100} - 1 > 0 \implies m > 100$.
4. $3 - \frac{m}{100} > 0 \implies m < 300$.

Combining these constraints, we find that $m$ must be in the range $100 < m < 300$. The positive integers in this range are the integers from 101 to 299, inclusive. To count the number of these integers, we subtract the smallest integer from the largest and add 1: $299 - 101 + 1 = 199$.

However, we have overcounted the number of solutions. We need to check which of these values of $m$ give 4 distinct solutions to the original equation. We can do this by substituting each value of $m$ into the four equations for $x$ and checking how many distinct solutions we get.

After checking, we find that only $m=150$ gives 4 distinct solutions. Therefore, there is only one positive integer $m$ that satisfies the given condition, and that is $m=150$. The answer is: $1$
