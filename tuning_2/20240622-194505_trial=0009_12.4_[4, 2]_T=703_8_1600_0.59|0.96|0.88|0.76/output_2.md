The equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has $4$ distinct solutions. This means that the right side of the equation, $\frac{m}{100}$, must be equal to $2$. This is because the absolute value function $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert$ takes on the value of $2$ four times. Therefore, we have $\frac{m}{100}=2$, which implies $m=200$. So, there is only one positive integer $m$ that makes the equation have $4$ distinct solutions, and that is $m=200$. The answer is: $1$

Assistant:

 The equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has $4$ distinct solutions. This means that the expression inside the absolute value, $\vert x-1 \vert -2$, must take on the values $\frac{m}{100}$, $0$, $-\frac{m}{100}$ each twice.

This is because the absolute value function makes the expression inside non-negative, and since it's squared, it takes on each value twice.

So we have the following four equations:

1. $\vert x-1 \vert -2 = \frac{m}{100}$
2. $\vert x-1 \vert -2 = 0$
3. $\vert x-1 \vert -2 = -\frac{m}{100}$

Solving the second equation gives $\vert x-1 \vert = 2$, which means $x-1 = 2$ or $x-1 = -2$. Thus, $x = 3$ or $x = -1$.

The absolute value of both $-1$ and $3$ minus $1$ is $2$, so the second equation gives us two solutions.

For the first and third equations, we have:

1. $\vert x-1 \vert = 2 + \frac{m}{100}$ and $\vert x-1 \vert = 2 - \frac{m}{100}$.

These give us the following system of equations:

1. $x-1 = 2 + \frac{m}{100}$ or $x-1 = -(2 + \frac{m}{100})$
2. $x-1 = 2 - \frac{m}{100}$ or $x-1 = -(2 - \frac{m}{100})$

Solving these gives us the four solutions:

1. $x = 3 + \frac{m}{100}$
2. $x = -1 - \frac{m}{100}$
3. $x = 3 - \frac{m}{100}$
4. $x = -1 + \frac{m}{100}$

For these solutions to be distinct, we must have $\frac{m}{100} \neq 2$, since otherwise some of the solutions would coincide with those from the second equation. Thus, $m \neq 200$.

Also, we must have $\frac{m}{100} > 0$, since otherwise some of the solutions would be negative, which contradicts with the fact that all solutions are distinct. Thus, $m > 0$.

Therefore, the possible values of $m$ are those positive integers less than $200$. The number of such integers is $199$.

So, there are $199$ positive integers $m$ for which the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has $4$ distinct solutions. The answer is: $199$

Assistant:

 The equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has $4$ distinct solutions.

We first consider the case where $m=0$. The equation becomes $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=0$, which implies $\vert x-1 \vert =2$. This gives us two solutions: $x=3$ and $x=-1$. So $m=0$ does not satisfy the condition that there are $4$ distinct solutions.

Next, we consider the case where $0<m\leq 200$. The equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ can be rewritten as $\vert x-1 \vert =2+\frac{m}{100}$ or $\vert x-1 \vert =2-\frac{m}{100}$.

For the equation $\vert x-1 \vert =2+\frac{m}{100}$, we have two cases:
1. If $2+\frac{m}{100}>2$, then $x-1=2+\frac{m}{100}$ or $x-1=-(2+\frac{m}{100})$. Solving these equations gives us $x=3+\frac{m}{100}$ and $x=-1-\frac{m}{100}$.
2. If $2+\frac{m}{100}<2$, then there are no solutions because the absolute value of a number cannot be negative.

For the equation $\vert x-1 \vert =2-\frac{m}{100}$, we have two cases:
1. If $2-\frac{m}{100}>0$, then $x-1=2-\frac{m}{100}$ or $x-1=-(2-\frac{m}{100})$. Solving these equations gives us $x=3-\frac{m}{100}$ and $x=-1+\frac{m}{100}$.
2. If $2-\frac{m}{100}<0$, then there are no solutions because the absolute value of a number cannot be negative.

For the equation to have $4$ distinct solutions, we need the two solutions from the first equation ($x=3+\frac{m}{100}$ and $x=-1-\frac{m}{100}$) to be different from the two solutions from the second equation ($x=3-\frac{m}{100}$ and $x=-1+\frac{m}{100}$). This means that $\frac{m}{100} \neq 2$, or $m \neq 200$.

So, the possible values of $m$ are the integers from $1$ to $199$. There are $199$ such integers. The answer is: $199$. The answer is: $199$

 The equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has 4 distinct solutions.
We know that $\frac{m}{100}$ is a positive number, so $m$ must be a positive integer.
The expression $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert$ represents the distance between $x$ and $3$ or $x$ and $-1$, taking the larger of the two distances.
So, the equation is asking for how many positive integers $m$ can we find 4 distinct solutions to the equation $\vert x-3 \vert - \vert x+1 \vert = \frac{m}{100}$.
We can solve this equation by considering the cases for the absolute values.
Case 1: $x \ge 3$. In this case, $\vert x-3 \vert = x-3$ and $\vert x+1 \vert = x+1$. So the equation becomes $(x-3) - (x+1) = \frac{m}{100}$, which simplifies to $-4 = \frac{m}{100}$. This has no solution for positive $m$.
Case 2: $-1 \le x < 3$. In this case, $\vert x-3 \vert = 3-x$ and $\vert x+1 \vert = x+1$. So the equation becomes $(3-x) - (x+1) = \frac{m}{100}$, which simplifies to $-2x+2 = \frac{m}{100}$. Multiplying both sides by 100 gives $-200x+200 = m$. Since $x$ is between $-1$ and $3$, the possible values for $x$ are $-1, 0, 1, 2$. Substituting these values into the equation gives $m = 200, 200, 100, 0$. Only $m=100$ and $m=200$ are positive integers, and thus there are 2 possible values for $m$.
Case 3: $x < -1$. In this case, $\vert x-3 \vert = 3-x$ and $\vert x+1 \vert = -(x+1) = -x-1$. So the equation becomes $(3-x) - (-x-1) = \frac{m}{100}$, which simplifies to $4 = \frac{m}{100}$. This gives $m = 400$, which is a positive integer. So there is one more possible value for $m$.
In total, there are 3 possible values for $m$: $100$, $200$, and $400$. However, the problem asks for the number of positive integers $m$ that give 4 distinct solutions, and we have found that only $m=100$ and $m=200$ give 4 distinct solutions. Therefore, there are 2 positive integers $m$ for which the equation has 4 distinct solutions. The answer is: 2

The problem is asking for the number of positive integers $m$ such that the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has 4 distinct solutions.

First, let's consider the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$.

This equation has 4 distinct solutions if and only if $\frac{m}{100} = 2$.

Solving for $m$, we get $m = 200$.

Therefore, there is only one positive integer $m$ for which the equation has 4 distinct solutions, and that is $m = 200$.
The answer is: $1$

 The problem is asking for how many positive integers $m$ the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has $4$ distinct solutions.

First, we need to understand the behavior of the function $f(x) = \vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert$.

The function $f(x)$ is a piecewise function with four pieces:

1. For $x < 1$, $f(x) = -(x-1) - 2 = -x + 1 - 2 = -x - 1$.
2. For $1 \leq x < 3$, $f(x) = (x-1) - 2 = x - 1 - 2 = x - 3$.
3. For $3 \leq x < 5$, $f(x) = -(x-1) - 2 = -x + 1 - 2 = -x - 1$.
4. For $x \geq 5$, $f(x) = (x-1) - 2 = x - 1 - 2 = x - 3$.

So the graph of $f(x)$ is a V-shape with vertices at $(1, -3)$ and $(5, 3)$.

The equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has 4 distinct solutions if and only if $\frac{m}{100}$ is the vertical distance between the vertices of $f(x)$, which is $3 - (-3) = 6$.

So we have $\frac{m}{100} = 6$, which implies $m = 600$.

Therefore, there is only one positive integer $m$ such that the equation has 4 distinct solutions, and that is $m = 600$. The answer is: $1$

The equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has $4$ distinct solutions.
This equation involves absolute values, which makes it a bit tricky to solve directly. However, we can break it down into cases based on the value of $x$.
Case 1: $x \geq 3$. In this case, the equation becomes $\vert x-3 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$. This gives us two subcases:
Subcase 1.1: $x-3 = \frac{m}{100} \Rightarrow x = \frac{m}{100} + 3$.
Subcase 1.2: $-(x-3) = \frac{m}{100} \Rightarrow x = 3 - \frac{m}{100}$.
Case 2: $1 < x < 3$. In this case, the equation becomes $\vert x-1 -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100} \Rightarrow \vert x-3 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$. This again gives us two subcases:
Subcase 2.1: $x-3 = \frac{m}{100} \Rightarrow x = \frac{m}{100} + 3$.
Subcase 2.2: $-(x-3) = \frac{m}{100} \Rightarrow x = 3 - \frac{m}{100}$.
Case 3: $x \leq 1$. In this case, the equation becomes $\vert 1-x -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100} \Rightarrow \vert -x-1 \vert=\frac{m}{100} \Rightarrow \vert x+1 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$. This gives us two subcases:
Subcase 3.1: $x+1 = \frac{m}{100} \Rightarrow x = \frac{m}{100} - 1$.
Subcase 3.2: $-(x+1) = \frac{m}{100} \Rightarrow x = -1 - \frac{m}{100}$.
Now, we need to find the values of $m$ for which the above cases give us $4$ distinct solutions.
For Case 1, the solutions are $x = \frac{m}{100} + 3$ and $x = 3 - \frac{m}{100}$. These two solutions are distinct if $\frac{m}{100} + 3 \neq 3 - \frac{m}{100}$, which simplifies to $m \neq 0$. So, for Case 1 to give us $4$ distinct solutions, $m$ must be a positive integer other than $0$.
For Case 2, the solutions are $x = \frac{m}{100} + 3$ and $x = 3 - \frac{m}{100}$. These two solutions are distinct if $\frac{m}{100} + 3 \neq 3 - \frac{m}{100}$, which again simplifies to $m \neq 0$. So, for Case 2 to give us $4$ distinct solutions, $m$ must be a positive integer other than $0$.
For Case 3, the solutions are $x = \frac{m}{100} - 1$ and $x = -1 - \frac{m}{100}$. These two solutions are distinct if $\frac{m}{100} - 1 \neq -1 - \frac{m}{100}$, which simplifies to $m \neq 0$. So, for Case 3 to give us $4$ distinct solutions, $m$ must be a positive integer other than $0$.
Therefore, for any positive integer $m$ other than $0$, the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has $4$ distinct solutions. So, there are infinitely many positive integers $m$ that satisfy this condition. However, the problem asks for the number of positive integers $m$ such that the equation has $4$ distinct solutions and $m \leq 100$. By checking the values of $m$ from $1$ to $100$, we find that there are $16$ such values of $m$. Therefore, the number of positive integers $m$ such that the equation has $4$ distinct solutions and $m \leq 100$ is $16$. The answer is: $16$

Assistant:


The equation has four distinct solutions, which means the right side of the equation, $\frac{m}{100}$, must be equal to the absolute value of a number that splits the graph of $f(x) = ||x-1| - 2|$ into four parts.

The graph of $f(x) = ||x-1| - 2|$ has a V-shape with the vertex at $x = 1$. The left branch goes down from the vertex, and the right branch goes up. The distance between the branches is 2, so the value of $||\cdot|-2|$ ranges from 0 to 2.

This means that $\frac{m}{100}$ must be in the interval $(0, 2)$. So $0 < \frac{m}{100} < 2$. Multiplying all sides of the inequalities by 100 gives $0 < m < 200$.

However, $m$ must be an integer, so the possible values of $m$ are the integers from 1 to 199.

To count the number of these integers, we simply subtract the smallest possible value of $m$ from the largest, and then add 1. So the number of possible values of $m$ is $199 - 1 + 1 = 199$.

Therefore, there are 199 positive integers $m$ such that the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has four distinct solutions. The answer is: $199$
