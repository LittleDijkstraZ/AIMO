Below is a math problem you are to solve (natural number answer):
"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"
To accomplish this, first list the problem's constraints, conditions and related knowledge, and thens solve the problem step by step. Be clear so even an idiot can follow your instructions. After solving the problem, output the final numerical answer within \boxed{}.

Assistant:

 The problem's constraints are as follows:

1. The expression $A = ((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2)$ equals $0$.
2. We are looking for the area of the convex polygon enclosed by the points that satisfy the constraint.

The expression $A = 0$ implies that either the first factor or the second factor is equal to $0$. 

For the first factor to be $0$, we need either $(\vert x + y \vert - 10) = 0$ or $(\vert x - y \vert - 10) = 0$. This implies that $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ or $\vert x - y \vert = 10$.

For the second factor to be $0$, we need either $(\vert x \vert - 8) = 0$ or $(\vert y \vert - 8) = 0$. This implies that $\vert x \vert = 8$ or $\vert y \vert = 8$.

The solutions to these equations are:

For $\vert x + y \vert = 10$, the solutions are the lines $x + y = 10$ and $x + y = -10$.

For $\vert x - y \vert = 10$, the solutions are the lines $x - y = 10$ and $x - y = -10$.

For $\vert x \vert = 8$, the solutions are the lines $x = 8$ and $x = -8$.

For $\vert y \vert = 8$, the solutions are the lines $y = 8$ and $y = -8$.

These lines form a square with side length $10$ (the distance between the lines $x + y = 10$ and $x + y = -10$), so the area of the square is $10^2 = 100$. The answer is: $100$

Below is a math problem you are to solve (natural number answer!):
"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"
Analyze the problem and think step by step to come to a solution with programs. After solving the problem, output the final numerical answer within \boxed{}.

Assistant:

 The given equation is a product of two terms equal to zero, so either the first term is zero or the second term is zero.
The first term is zero when either $|x + y| - 10 = 0$ or $|x - y| - 10 = 0$, which simplifies to $|x + y| = 10$ or $|x - y| = 10$.
The second term is zero when either $|x| - 8 = 0$ or $|y| - 8 = 0$, which simplifies to $|x| = 8$ or $|y| = 8$.
The solutions to these equations are the lines $x + y = \pm 10$, $x - y = \pm 10$, $x = \pm 8$, and $y = \pm 8$.
These lines form a rectangle with side lengths 16 and 20.
The area of this rectangle is $16 \times 20 = 320$.
So the area of the convex polygon is 320.
The answer is: $320$

Below is a math problem you are to solve (natural number answer):
"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"
To accomplish this, first list the problem's constraints, conditions and related knowledge, and thens solve the problem step by step. Be clear so even an idiot can follow your instructions. After solving the problem, output the final numerical answer within \boxed{}.

Assistant:

 The problem's constraints, conditions and related knowledge are as follows:

The equation $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ must be satisfied for all points $(x, y)$ inside the polygon.

The equation equals zero if and only if both factors equal zero. Therefore, we have two cases to consider:

1. $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$. This implies that $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. This means that $x + y = \pm 10$ and $x - y = \pm 10$. Solving these equations gives us the vertices of the square: $(8, 2)$, $(8, -2)$, $(-8, -2)$, and $(-8, 2)$.

2. $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$. This implies that $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$. This means that $x = \pm 8$ and $y = \pm 8$. Solving these equations gives us the vertices of the square: $(8, 8)$, $(8, -8)$, $(-8, -8)$, and $(-8, 8)$.

Combining these two cases, we find that the polygon is a square with side length 16. The area of a square is given by the square of the length of its side, so the area of the polygon is $16^2 = 256$. The answer is: $256$

Below is a math problem you are to solve (natural number answer):
"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"

Assistant:

 The problem's constraints, conditions and related knowledge are:

1. The equation is given as $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$.
2. The equation is equal to zero if either of the two factors is zero.
3. The absolute value function $|\cdot|$ is always nonnegative.
4. The square of a real number is zero if and only if the number itself is zero.

Now, let's solve the problem step by step:

Step 1: The first factor of the equation is $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)$. This factor is zero if and only if both $(\vert x + y \vert - 10) = 0$ and $(\vert x - y \vert - 10) = 0$. This implies that $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. This means that $x + y = \pm 10$ and $x - y = \pm 10$. Solving these equations, we get the points $(5,5)$, $(5,-5)$, $(-5,5)$, and $(-5,-5)$.

Step 2: The second factor of the equation is $((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2)$. This factor is zero if and only if both $(\vert x \vert - 8) = 0$ and $(\vert y \vert - 8) = 0$. This implies that $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$. This means that $x = \pm 8$ and $y = \pm 8$. Solving these equations, we get the points $(8,0)$, $(0,8)$, $(-8,0)$, and $(0,-8)$.

Step 3: The points satisfying the equation are the intersections of the points from Step 1 and Step 2. By plotting these points, we can see that they form a square with side length $10$.

Step 4: The area of a square with side length $s$ is $s^2$. So, the area of the square formed by the points is $10^2 = 100$.
The answer is: $100$

Below is a math problem you are to solve (natural number answer):
"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"

Assistant:

 The problem's constraints, conditions, and related knowledge are as follows:

1. The equation is satisfied if either of the factors is zero.
2. The factors are expressions that are squared, so they are always non-negative.
3. Therefore, for the equation to be satisfied, either of the following must be true:
   a. $(\vert x + y \vert - 10) = 0$ or $(\vert x - y \vert - 10) = 0$
   b. $(\vert x \vert - 8) = 0$ or $(\vert y \vert - 8) = 0$

Now, let's solve each case:

Case a:
$\vert x + y \vert - 10 = 0$ implies $\vert x + y \vert = 10$, which means $x + y = \pm 10$.
$\vert x - y \vert - 10 = 0$ implies $\vert x - y \vert = 10$, which means $x - y = \pm 10$.

Case b:
$\vert x \vert - 8 = 0$ implies $\vert x \vert = 8$, which means $x = \pm 8$.
$\vert y \vert - 8 = 0$ implies $\vert y \vert = 8$, which means $y = \pm 8$.

Combining the results from both cases, we find that the points that satisfy the equation are:
$(8, 8)$, $(-8, 8)$, $(8, -8)$, $(-8, -8)$, $(10, 0)$, $(-10, 0)$, $(0, 10)$, and $(0, -10)$.

These points form a square with side length 16 (from $(8, 8)$ to $(-8, -8)$ or from $(8, -8)$ to $(-8, 8)$), so the area of the square is $16^2 = 256$. The answer is: $256$

Below is a math problem you are to solve (natural number answer):
"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"

Assistant:

 The problem's constraints are as follows:

1. The expression $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$.
2. The points $(x, y)$ that satisfy this expression form a convex polygon.

The conditions for the expression to be equal to zero are:

1. Either $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2) = 0$ or $((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$.
2. If $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2) = 0$, then $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$, which implies $x = \pm 10$ and $y = \pm 10$.
3. If $((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$, then $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$, which implies $x = \pm 8$ and $y = \pm 8$.

The related knowledge is that the absolute value function $|x|$ is equal to $x$ if $x \geq 0$ and $-x$ if $x < 0$.

Now, let's solve the problem step by step:

1. The points $(x, y)$ that satisfy $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2) = 0$ form a square with vertices at $(\pm 10, \pm 10)$.
2. The points $(x, y)$ that satisfy $((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ form a square with vertices at $(\pm 8, \pm 8)$.
3. The intersection of these two squares is the convex polygon formed by the vertices $(\pm 8, \pm 8)$ and $(\pm 10, \pm 10)$.

The side length of the larger square is 20, and the side length of the smaller square is 16. The area of the convex polygon is the area of the larger square minus the area of the smaller square:

\[Area = (20)^2 - (16)^2 = 400 - 256 = 144.\]

So the area of the convex polygon is 144 square units. The answer is: $144$

 The problem's constraints, conditions, and related knowledge are as follows:

1. The equation is given as $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$.
2. The product of two numbers is zero if and only if at least one of the numbers is zero.
3. Therefore, either $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$.
4. For the first equation to be zero, both $\vert x + y \vert - 10 = 0$ and $\vert x - y \vert - 10 = 0$, which implies $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$.
5. For the second equation to be zero, both $\vert x \vert - 8 = 0$ and $\vert y \vert - 8 = 0$, which implies $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$.
6. The absolute value of a number is equal to the number itself if the number is non-negative, and the negation of the number if the number is negative.
7. Therefore, the constraints for the first equation are $x + y = \pm 10$ and $x - y = \pm 10$.
8. The constraints for the second equation are $x = \pm 8$ and $y = \pm 8$.
9. Solving these constraints, we get the vertices of the polygon as $(8,8)$, $(-8,8)$, $(-8,-8)$, and $(8,-8)$.
10. The polygon is a square with side length 16.
11. The area of a square is given by the square of its side length, so the area of this square is $16^2 = 256$.

So, the area of the convex polygon is 256 square units. The answer is: $256$

Below is a math problem you are to solve (natural number answer):
"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"

Assistant:

 The problem's constraints, conditions, and related knowledge are:

1. The equation is satisfied if either of the factors is zero.
2. The absolute value function $|x|$ is equal to $x$ if $x \geq 0$, and $-x$ if $x < 0$.
3. The area of a rectangle with side lengths $a$ and $b$ is $ab$.

Now, let's solve the problem step by step.

Step 1: The first factor of the equation is $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)$. This factor is zero if both $(\vert x + y \vert - 10) = 0$ and $(\vert x - y \vert - 10) = 0$. This implies that $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. The only way this can happen is if $x = 5$ and $y = 5$.

Step 2: The second factor of the equation is $((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2)$. This factor is zero if both $(\vert x \vert - 8) = 0$ and $(\vert y \vert - 8) = 0$. This implies that $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$. The only way this can happen is if $-8 \leq x \leq 8$ and $-8 \leq y \leq 8$.

Step 3: Combining the constraints from steps 1 and 2, we find that the points $(x, y)$ that satisfy the equation are those that lie in a square with side length 10 centered at $(5, 5)$, with $-8 \leq x \leq 8$ and $-8 \leq y \leq 8$.

Step 4: To find the area of this square, we simply multiply the side lengths. The side length is 10, so the area is $10 \times 10 = 100$.
The answer is: $100$
