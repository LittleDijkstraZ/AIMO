Below is a math problem you are to solve (natural number answer):
"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"
To accomplish this, first list the problem's constraints, conditions and related knowledge, and thens solve the problem step by step. Be clear so even an idiot can follow your instructions. After solving the problem, output the final numerical answer within \boxed{}.

Assistant:

 The problem's constraints are:
1. The equation must be satisfied for the points $(x, y)$ that are enclosed by the polygon.
2. The equation must not be satisfied for the points $(x, y)$ outside of the polygon.

The equation given is $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$.

According to the zero product property, the product of two factors is zero if and only if at least one of the factors is zero. Thus, the equation is satisfied if either of the following conditions is met:

1. $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$.
2. $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$.

For the first condition to be true, both $\vert x + y \vert - 10 = 0$ and $\vert x - y \vert - 10 = 0$, which implies $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. This means that the points $(x, y)$ must lie on the lines $x + y = \pm 10$ and $x - y = \pm 10$.

For the second condition to be true, both $\vert x \vert - 8 = 0$ and $\vert y \vert - 8 = 0$, which implies $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$. This means that the points $(x, y)$ must lie on the lines $x = \pm 8$ and $y = \pm 8$.

The lines $x + y = \pm 10$, $x - y = \pm 10$, $x = \pm 8$, and $y = \pm 8$ enclose a rectangle with side lengths $20$ and $16$. The area of this rectangle is $20 \times 16 = 320$.

Therefore, the area of the convex polygon is $320$. The answer is: $320$

Below is a math problem you are to solve (natural number answer):
"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"
To accomplish this, first list the problem's constraints, conditions and related knowledge, and thens solve the problem step by step. Be clear so even an idiot can follow your instructions. After solving the problem, output the final numerical answer within \boxed{}.

Assistant:

 The problem's constraints, conditions and related knowledge are as follows:

1. The expression $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$

2. The points $(x, y)$ that satisfy this expression are the coordinates of the vertices of the convex polygon.

3. To find the area of the convex polygon, we need to determine the vertices of the polygon and use a standard formula for the area of a polygon.

Now, let's solve the problem step by step:

Step 1: Identify the conditions
The expression is equal to zero if either of the two factors is zero. This gives us two conditions:

a) $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$
b) $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$

From condition (a), we have $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$.
From condition (b), we have $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$.

Step 2: Find the vertices of the polygon
The possible combinations of the above conditions give us the vertices of the polygon:

- For $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x \vert = 8$, the possible combinations are $(8, 2)$ and $(8, -2)$.
- For $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$, the possible combinations are $(2, 8)$ and $(-2, 8)$.
- For $\vert x - y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x \vert = 8$, the possible combinations are $(8, -2)$ and $(8, 2)$.
- For $\vert x - y \vert = 10$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$, the possible combinations are $(-2, 8)$ and $(2, 8)$.

Step 3: Determine the vertices
By analyzing the possible combinations, we can see that the vertices of the polygon are $(8, 2)$, $(8, -2)$, $(2, 8)$, and $(-2, 8)$.

Step 4: Calculate the area of the polygon
The vertices of the polygon form a rectangle with length 8 and width 4. The area of a rectangle is given by length times width, so the area of this polygon is $8 \times 4 = 32$.
The answer is: $\boxed{32}$

Below is a math problem you are to solve (natural number answer):
"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"

Assistant:

 The problem's constraints, conditions and related knowledge are:
1. The equation is given as $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$.
2. The points that satisfy this equation are the vertices of a convex polygon.
3. The area of this convex polygon is what we need to find.

Now, let's solve the problem step by step:

Step 1: The equation is in the form of a product of two terms equals zero, so either the first term equals zero or the second term equals zero.

Step 2: If the first term equals zero, we have $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$. This means both $\vert x + y \vert - 10 = 0$ and $\vert x - y \vert - 10 = 0$, which simplifies to $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. The only way this is possible is if $x = y = 5$ or $x = -y = -5$. So the points are $(5, 5)$ and $(-5, 5)$ and $(5, -5)$ and $(-5, -5)$.

Step 3: If the second term equals zero, we have $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$. This means both $\vert x \vert - 8 = 0$ and $\vert y \vert - 8 = 0$, which simplifies to $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$. The only way this is possible is if $x = 8$ or $x = -8$ and $y = 8$ or $y = -8$. So the points are $(8, 8)$, $(8, -8)$, $(-8, 8)$ and $(-8, -8)$.

Step 4: Combining the points from the first and second conditions, we find that the vertices of the polygon are $(5, 5)$, $(-5, 5)$, $(5, -5)$, $(-5, -5)$, $(8, 8)$, $(8, -8)$, $(-8, 8)$ and $(-8, -8)$.

Step 5: The polygon is a square with side length 10 units. To see this, notice that the points $(5, 5)$, $(-5, 5)$, $(-5, -5)$ and $(5, -5)$ form a square with side length 10 units.

Step 6: The area of a square is given by the formula $side^2$, so the area of this square is $10^2 = 100$ square units.
The answer is: $100$.

"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"

Assistant:

 The problem's constraints, conditions and related knowledge are as follows:

1. The expression $A \cdot B = 0$ means that at least one of $A$ and $B$ is zero.
2. The absolute value function $|x|$ is defined as $x$ if $x \geq 0$ and $-x$ if $x < 0$.
3. The area of a convex polygon can be calculated using the shoelace formula.

Now let's solve the problem step by step:

The given equation is $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$.

According to constraint 1, this equation is satisfied if either of the following conditions is true:

A: $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$
B: $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$

For condition A to be true, both $\vert x + y \vert - 10 = 0$ and $\vert x - y \vert - 10 = 0$. This implies $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. Considering all possible combinations of signs for $x$ and $y$, we find that the only possible solutions are $x = \pm 10$ and $y = \pm 10$.

For condition B to be true, both $\vert x \vert - 8 = 0$ and $\vert y \vert - 8 = 0$. This implies $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$. Considering all possible combinations of signs for $x$ and $y$, we find that the only possible solutions are $x = \pm 8$ and $y = \pm 8$.

So the points satisfying the equation are:
$(10, 10), (-10, -10), (10, -10), (-10, 10), (8, 8), (-8, -8), (8, -8), (-8, 8)$.

These points form a square with side length 20 (for the first four points) and another square with side length 16 (for the last four points). However, the convex polygon formed by the union of these two squares is actually a single square with side length 20, as the points (8, 8), (-8, -8), (8, -8), (-8, 8) are only a subset of the points forming the larger square.

The area of this square is side length squared, which is $20^2 = 400$.

So the area of the convex polygon is 400. The answer is: $400$

Below is a math problem you are to solve (natural number answer):
"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"

 The problem's constraints, conditions, and related knowledge are as follows:

1. The equation is $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$.
2. The points $(x, y)$ that satisfy this equation are the vertices of a convex polygon.
3. We need to find the area of this polygon.

Step 1: Analyze the equation
The equation is a product of two terms equal to zero. This means that either the first term is zero or the second term is zero. So we have two cases to consider:

Case 1: $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$. This can only happen if $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. These conditions are satisfied only when $x = \pm 10$ and $y = \pm 10$. So the vertices of the polygon are at $(10, 10), (10, -10), (-10, 10)$ and $(-10, -10)$.

Case 2: $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$. This can only happen if $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$. These conditions are satisfied only when $x = \pm 8$ and $y = \pm 8$. So there are four more vertices of the polygon: $(8, 8), (8, -8), (-8, 8)$ and $(-8, -8)$.

Step 2: Identify the polygon
The points from Case 1 and Case 2 form a square with side length $20$.

Step 3: Calculate the area
The area of a square with side length $s$ is $s^2$. So the area of this square is $20^2 = 400$.
The answer is: $400$

"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"

Assistant:

 The constraints for the problem are given by the equation:

$$((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0.$$

This equation is satisfied if either of the two factors is zero. The first factor is zero if either $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ or $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. The second factor is zero if either $\vert x \vert = 8$ or $\vert y \vert = 8$. 

These conditions define a set of lines and points in the plane. The lines are the sets of points that satisfy $\vert x + y \vert = 10$, $\vert x - y \vert = 10$, $\vert x \vert = 8$, and $\vert y \vert = 8$. These lines form a square with side length 16, and two smaller squares with side length 10. The vertices of the larger square are the midpoints of the sides of the smaller square.

The enclosed convex polygon is the intersection of these two squares, so it is a smaller square with side length 10. The area of this square is $10^2 = 100$. The answer is: $100$.

"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"

Assistant:

 The given equation is a product of two expressions equal to zero, so either $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$.

From $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$, we have $\vert x + y \vert = 10$, which means $x + y = \pm 10$.
From $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$, we have $\vert x - y \vert = 10$, which means $x - y = \pm 10$.
From $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$, we have $\vert x \vert = 8$, which means $x = \pm 8$.
From $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$, we have $\vert y \vert = 8$, which means $y = \pm 8$.

These conditions give us the vertices of the convex polygon: $(8, 8)$, $(8, -8)$, $(-8, 8)$, and $(-8, -8)$.

The distance between $(8, 8)$ and $(8, -8)$ is $16$. The distance between $(8, 8)$ and $(-8, 8)$ is $16$. The distance between $(8, -8)$ and $(-8, -8)$ is $16$. The distance between $(-8, 8)$ and $(-8, -8)$ is $16$. All the sides of the rectangle are equal and each is $16$ units long.

The area of the rectangle is $16 \times 16 = 256$. Therefore, the area of the convex polygon is $256$ square units. The answer is: $256$

"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"

Assistant:

 The problem's constraints, conditions, and related knowledge are as follows:

1. The equation involves absolute value functions, which means we need to consider different cases based on the signs of the expressions inside the absolute value signs.

2. The equation is a product of two expressions equal to zero, which means either of the expressions must be zero for the product to be zero.

3. The equation involves four absolute value functions, which makes the problem a bit more complicated.

Now, let's solve the problem step by step:

Step 1: Consider the equation $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$. For this equation to be true, both $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2$ and $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2$ must be zero. This means $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$.

Step 2: Considering the different cases for the signs of $(x + y)$ and $(x - y)$, we get the following four equations:

(a) $x + y = 10$ and $x - y = 10 \Rightarrow x = 10, y = 0$
(b) $x + y = 10$ and $-(x - y) = 10 \Rightarrow x = 0, y = 10$
(c) $-(x + y) = 10$ and $x - y = 10 \Rightarrow x = 10, y = -10$
(d) $-(x + y) = 10$ and $-(x - y) = 10 \Rightarrow x = 0, y = -10$

Step 3: Similarly, consider the equation $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$. For this equation to be true, both $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2$ and $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2$ must be zero. This means $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$.

Step 4: Considering the different cases for the signs of $x$ and $y$, we get the following four equations:

(a) $x = 8$ and $y = 8$
(b) $x = 8$ and $y = -8$
(c) $x = -8$ and $y = 8$
(d) $x = -8$ and $y = -8$

Step 5: The solution to the original problem is the intersection of the solutions from steps 2 and 4, which gives us the vertices of the polygon: $(10, 0)$, $(0, 10)$, $(10, -10)$, $(0, -10)$, $(8, 8)$, $(8, -8)$, $(-8, 8)$, and $(-8, -8)$.

Step 6: The polygon formed by these vertices is a square with side length 10. Therefore, the area of the square is $10^2 = 100$.

The answer is: $100$
