 The problem is asking for the number of positive integers $m$ such that the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has $4$ distinct solutions.

We know that the absolute value function $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert$ is a piecewise function that can take on the value of $0$ at $x=3$, $x=1$, and $x=-1$. The function is $2$ for $x$ in the interval $(1,3)$ and $-2$ for $x$ in the interval $(3,\infty)$ or $(-\infty,1)$.

So, the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ will have $4$ distinct solutions if $\frac{m}{100}=2$, which gives $m=200$.

Therefore, there is only one positive integer $m$ that satisfies the given condition, and that is $m=200$. The answer is: $1$

 The problem asks for how many positive integers $m$ the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has $4$ distinct solutions.

First, let's consider the right side of the equation, $\frac{m}{100}$. Since $m$ is a positive integer, $\frac{m}{100}$ is a positive fraction less than $1$.

Next, let's consider the left side of the equation, $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert$. This expression represents the absolute value of the difference between the absolute value of $x-1$ and $2$. This expression will be equal to a positive fraction less than $1$ exactly when the absolute value of $x-1$ is equal to $2 \pm \frac{m}{100}$.

This gives us the following two equations:
1. $\vert x-1 \vert = 2 + \frac{m}{100}$, and
2. $\vert x-1 \vert = 2 - \frac{m}{100}$.

For the first equation, $\vert x-1 \vert = 2 + \frac{m}{100}$, we have two cases:
1. $x-1 = 2 + \frac{m}{100}$, which simplifies to $x = 3 + \frac{m}{100}$, and
2. $x-1 = -(2 + \frac{m}{100})$, which simplifies to $x = -1 - \frac{m}{100}$.

For the second equation, $\vert x-1 \vert = 2 - \frac{m}{100}$, we have two cases:
1. $x-1 = 2 - \frac{m}{100}$, which simplifies to $x = 3 - \frac{m}{100}$, and
2. $x-1 = -(2 - \frac{m}{100})$, which simplifies to $x = -1 + \frac{m}{100}$.

To have four distinct solutions, we need the conditions $-1 - \frac{m}{100} < -1 + \frac{m}{100}$, $-1 + \frac{m}{100} < 3 - \frac{m}{100}$, and $3 - \frac{m}{100} < 3 + \frac{m}{100}$.

Simplifying these inequalities gives $0 < \frac{2m}{100}$, $\frac{2m}{100} < 4$, and $\frac{2m}{100} < 1$.

The first and third inequalities are always true for positive $m$, so we only need to consider the second inequality. This gives us $\frac{2m}{100} < 4$, or $m < 200$.

Therefore, the number of positive integers $m$ that satisfy this condition is $199$. However, we must also ensure that $\frac{m}{100} < 2$ (otherwise the second equation would not have any solutions). This gives us $m < 200$, which is consistent with our previous finding.

Hence, the number of positive integers $m$ for which the equation has $4$ distinct solutions is $199$. The answer is: $199$.

 The problem asks for how many positive integers $m$ does the equation \[\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}\] have $4$ distinct solutions.

First, we need to understand the structure of the equation. The equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ is a piecewise function with four cases to consider based on the absolute value expression inside the absolute value.

1. When $x \geq 1$, the equation becomes $\vert x - 1 - 2 \vert = \frac{m}{100}$, which simplifies to $\vert x - 3 \vert = \frac{m}{100}$.
2. When $0 < x < 1$, the equation becomes $\vert - (x - 1) - 2 \vert = \frac{m}{100}$, which simplifies to $\vert -x + 3 \vert = \frac{m}{100}$.
3. When $x \leq 0$, the equation becomes $\vert -(x - 1) - 2 \vert = \frac{m}{100}$, which simplifies to $\vert -x - 1 \vert = \frac{m}{100}$.
4. When $-1 < x < 0$, the equation becomes $\vert x + 1 - 2 \vert = \frac{m}{100}$, which simplifies to $\vert x - 1 \vert = \frac{m}{100}$.

For each of these cases, we need to solve the resulting absolute value equation for $x$. The solutions will be in terms of $m$, and the number of distinct solutions will depend on the value of $m$.

To have $4$ distinct solutions, we need to choose a value of $m$ such that:

- For the first case (when $x \geq 1$), the equation $\vert x - 3 \vert = \frac{m}{100}$ has $2$ solutions.
- For the second case (when $0 < x < 1$), the equation $\vert -x + 3 \vert = \frac{m}{100}$ has $2$ solutions.
- For the third case (when $x \leq 0$), the equation $\vert -x - 1 \vert = \frac{m}{100}$ has $2$ solutions.
- For the fourth case (when $-1 < x < 0$), the equation $\vert x - 1 \vert = \frac{m}{100}$ has $2$ solutions.

This means that the value of $\frac{m}{100}$ must be such that it creates two distinct solutions in each of the four cases. This happens when $\frac{m}{100}$ is strictly between $1$ and $2$. Therefore, $1 < \frac{m}{100} < 2$, which implies $100 < m < 200$.

The positive integers $m$ that satisfy this inequality are $101, 102, \ldots, 199$. There are $99$ such integers. Therefore, the number of positive integers $m$ for which the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has $4$ distinct solutions is $99$. The answer is: $99$

Assistant:

 The equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has 4 distinct solutions. The right side of the equation is always nonnegative, so the left side must also be nonnegative. This means $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert \ge 0$. Therefore, $\vert x-1 \vert -2$ must be either $0$ or $\pm \frac{m}{100}$.

Case 1: $\vert x-1 \vert -2 = 0$. This gives $\vert x-1 \vert = 2$, so $x-1 = \pm 2$. This gives us $x = 3$ or $x = -1$.

Case 2: $\vert x-1 \vert -2 = \frac{m}{100}$. This gives $\vert x-1 \vert = 2 + \frac{m}{100}$. Since the left side is nonnegative, the right side must also be nonnegative, so $2 + \frac{m}{100} \ge 0$. This gives us $\frac{m}{100} \ge -2$, or $m \ge -200$. However, $m$ must be a positive integer, so the smallest possible value of $m$ is 1. 

For the equation $\vert x-1 \vert = 2 + \frac{m}{100}$, we have two subcases:

Subcase 2.1: $x-1 = 2 + \frac{m}{100}$. This gives $x = 3 + \frac{m}{100}$.

Subcase 2.2: $x-1 = -2 - \frac{m}{100}$. This gives $x = -1 - \frac{m}{100}$.

For each value of $m$, we need to check if these two values of $x$ are distinct from the values we found in Case 1. 

For subcase 2.1, $x = 3 + \frac{m}{100}$. This is distinct from $x = 3$ if $\frac{m}{100} \neq 0$, or $m \neq 0$. 

For subcase 2.2, $x = -1 - \frac{m}{100}$. This is distinct from $x = -1$ if $\frac{m}{100} \neq 0$, or $m \neq 0$. 

Therefore, for each positive integer $m$, we have 4 distinct solutions if $m \ge 1$. 

So the number of positive integers $m$ for which the equation has 4 distinct solutions is the number of positive integers greater than or equal to 1. This is an infinite set, but we are asked for a specific number of solutions. It seems that the problem might have a typo or an additional constraint is missing. However, based on the given information, the maximum value of $m$ for which the equation has 4 distinct solutions is 200. Therefore, the number of positive integers $m$ for which the equation has 4 distinct solutions is 200. The answer is: $200$

 The problem asks for the number of positive integers $m$ for which the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has 4 distinct solutions.

First, we notice that the right-hand side of the equation, $\frac{m}{100}$, must be nonnegative, so $m$ must be a nonnegative integer.

Next, we analyze the left-hand side of the equation. The expression $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert$ can take on values from 0 to 2, inclusive. This is because the inner absolute value $\vert x-1 \vert$ is always nonnegative, so $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert$ is minimized when $\vert x-1 \vert = 2$, which gives $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert = 0$. And $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert$ is maximized when $\vert x-1 \vert = 0$, which gives $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert = 2$.

Therefore, for the equation to have 4 distinct solutions, the right-hand side $\frac{m}{100}$ must be equal to one of the possible values of the left-hand side, namely 1. This implies $m = 100$.

So, there is only one positive integer $m$ for which the equation has 4 distinct solutions, and that is $m = 100$. The answer is: $1$

 The problem asks for the number of positive integers $m$ for which the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has four distinct solutions.

The equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ involves absolute values, which makes it a bit tricky to solve directly. However, we can simplify the problem by considering the cases for the number of solutions based on the value of $m$.

The expression on the left side of the equation, $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert$, is a piecewise function with four segments:

1. If $\vert x-1 \vert -2 \geq 0$, then $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert = \vert x-1 \vert - 2$.
2. If $\vert x-1 \vert -2 < 0$ and $\vert x-1 \vert \geq 2$, then $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert = 2 - \vert x-1 \vert$.
3. If $\vert x-1 \vert -2 < 0$ and $\vert x-1 \vert < 2$, then $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert = \vert x-1 \vert - 2$.
4. If $\vert x-1 \vert < 2$, then $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert = 2 - \vert x-1 \vert$.

Now, let's analyze the number of solutions for each case:

1. If $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert = \vert x-1 \vert - 2 = \frac{m}{100}$, then the equation becomes $\vert x-1 \vert = 2 + \frac{m}{100}$. This has two solutions if $2 + \frac{m}{100} > 0$, which means $m > -200$. However, $m$ must be a positive integer, so the smallest possible value for $m$ is 1. This case gives two solutions.

2. If $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert = 2 - \vert x-1 \vert = \frac{m}{100}$, then the equation becomes $\vert x-1 \vert = 2 - \frac{m}{100}$. This has two solutions if $2 - \frac{m}{100} > 0$, which means $m < 200$. The largest possible value for $m$ is 199. This case also gives two solutions.

3. If $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert = \vert x-1 \vert - 2 = \frac{m}{100}$, then the equation becomes $\vert x-1 \vert = 2 + \frac{m}{100}$. This has no solutions if $2 + \frac{m}{100} < 0$, which means $m < -200$. But we already ruled out this case because $m$ must be a positive integer.

4. If $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert = 2 - \vert x-1 \vert = \frac{m}{100}$, then the equation becomes $\vert x-1 \vert = 2 - \frac{m}{100}$. This has no solutions if $2 - \frac{m}{100} < 0$, which means $m > 200$. But we already ruled out this case because $m$ must be a positive integer less than 200.

So, for each value of $m$ in the range $1 \leq m \leq 199$, the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has four distinct solutions. Therefore, the number of such positive integers $m$ is 199. The answer is: $199$

 The equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has 4 distinct solutions. This means that the right side of the equation, $\frac{m}{100}$, must be equal to 2. 

To see why, consider the graph of $y = \vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert$. The graph is a "V" shape with its lowest point at $(1, 2)$. The equation has 4 distinct solutions when $\frac{m}{100} = 2$, or $m = 200$.

Therefore, the number of positive integers $m$ for which the equation has 4 distinct solutions is 1, namely $m = 200$. The answer is: $1$

Assistant:

 The problem is asking for the number of positive integers $m$ such that the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has $4$ distinct solutions.

First, we need to understand the behavior of the function $f(x) = \vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert$.

The function $f(x)$ has four pieces:

1. For $x < 1 - 2 = -1$, $f(x) = -(x - 1 + 2) = -x + 1$.
2. For $1 - 2 \leq x < 1 + 2 = 3$, $f(x) = -(x - 1 - 2) = -x + 3$.
3. For $x \geq 1 + 2 = 3$, $f(x) = x - 1 - 2 = x - 3$.

So, $f(x)$ is a piecewise function with three pieces:

\[f(x) = \begin{cases}
-x + 1, & \text{if } x < -1 \\
-x + 3, & \text{if } -1 \leq x < 3 \\
x - 3, & \text{if } x \geq 3
\end{cases}\]

The equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has four distinct solutions if and only if $\frac{m}{100}$ is in the range of $f(x)$.

From the graph of $f(x)$, we can see that the range of $f(x)$ is $(0, 2)$. So, $\frac{m}{100}$ must be in the interval $(0, 2)$. Multiplying both sides of the inequality by $100$, we get $0 < m < 200$.

The positive integers $m$ that satisfy this inequality are $1, 2, 3, ..., 199$. So, there are $199$ such positive integers $m$.
The answer is: $199$
