Below is a math problem you are to solve (natural number answer):
"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"
To accomplish this, first list the problem's constraints, conditions and related knowledge, and thens solve the problem step by step. Be clear so even an idiot can follow your instructions. After solving the problem, output the final numerical answer within \boxed{}.

Assistant:

 The problem's constraints, conditions and related knowledge are:

1. The equation $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ implies that $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. This is equivalent to $x + y = \pm 10$ and $x - y = \pm 10$.

2. The equation $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ implies that $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$, which is equivalent to $x = \pm 8$ and $y = \pm 8$.

3. Combining these two conditions, we get four cases to consider:
   - $x + y = 10$ and $x = 8$, which gives $y = 2$.
   - $x + y = 10$ and $x = -8$, which gives $y = 18$.
   - $x - y = 10$ and $x = 8$, which gives $y = -2$.
   - $x - y = 10$ and $x = -8$, which gives $y = -18$.

4. These four points form a rectangle with vertices at $(8, 2)$, $(8, -2)$, $(-8, -2)$, and $(-8, 2)$.

5. To find the area of this rectangle, we simply multiply the lengths of its sides. The length of the side along the x-axis is $16$ (from $-8$ to $8$) and the length of the side along the y-axis is $4$ (from $-2$ to $2$). So, the area of the rectangle is $16 \times 4 = 64$.

The answer is: $64$

Below is a math problem you are to solve (natural number answer!):
"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"

Assistant:

 The equation $AB = 0$ is equivalent to $A = 0$ or $B = 0$. Therefore, the given equation is equivalent to either $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$, $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$, $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$, or $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$.

The solutions to $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ are given by $\vert x + y \vert = 10$, which implies $x + y = \pm 10$. Similarly, the solutions to $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ are given by $\vert x - y \vert = 10$, which implies $x - y = \pm 10$. The solutions to $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ are given by $\vert x \vert = 8$, which implies $x = \pm 8$. And the solutions to $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ are given by $\vert y \vert = 8$, which implies $y = \pm 8$.

Plotting these lines on the coordinate plane, we find that they enclose a square with side length 16. Therefore, the area of the square is $16^2 = 256$. The answer is: $256$

Below is a math problem you are to solve (natural number answer):
"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"

Assistant:

 The problem's constraints, conditions, and related knowledge are:

1. The equation $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ must be satisfied by all points $(x, y)$ in the polygon.
2. The polygon is convex.

To solve the problem, we need to find the set of points $(x, y)$ that satisfy the equation and then determine the area of the polygon formed by these points.

From the equation, we have two cases:

Case 1: $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$. This can only happen if both $\vert x + y \vert - 10 = 0$ and $\vert x - y \vert - 10 = 0$, which implies $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. This gives us four lines: $x + y = \pm 10$ and $x - y = \pm 10$. The intersection points of these lines are $(0, 10)$, $(0, -10)$, $(10, 0)$, and $(-10, 0)$.

Case 2: $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$. This can only happen if both $\vert x \vert - 8 = 0$ and $\vert y \vert - 8 = 0$, which implies $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$. This gives us four lines: $x = \pm 8$ and $y = \pm 8$. The intersection points of these lines are $(8, 8)$, $(8, -8)$, $(-8, 8)$, and $(-8, -8)$.

The polygon formed by the intersection points of these lines is a square with side length $20$. To find the area of this square, we use the formula for the area of a square, which is $side^2$. Therefore, the area of the polygon is $20^2 = 400$.
The answer is: $400$

Assistant:

 The problem's constraints, conditions and related knowledge are:

1. The equation is given as $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$.
2. The equation is equal to zero if either of the two factors is equal to zero.
3. The expression inside the first set of parentheses will be zero if either $\vert x + y \vert - 10 = 0$ or $\vert x - y \vert - 10 = 0$.
4. The expression inside the second set of parentheses will be zero if either $\vert x \vert - 8 = 0$ or $\vert y \vert - 8 = 0$.
5. Solving these equations will give the points that satisfy the equation and thus the vertices of the polygon.
6. To find the area of the polygon, we can use the Shoelace formula.

Now, let's solve the problem step by step:

1. If $\vert x + y \vert - 10 = 0$, then $\vert x + y \vert = 10$, which means $x + y = \pm 10$.
2. If $\vert x - y \vert - 10 = 0$, then $\vert x - y \vert = 10$, which means $x - y = \pm 10$.
3. If $\vert x \vert - 8 = 0$, then $\vert x \vert = 8$, which means $x = \pm 8$.
4. If $\vert y \vert - 8 = 0$, then $\vert y \vert = 8$, which means $y = \pm 8$.
5. Solving these equations gives us the vertices of the polygon: $(8, 8)$, $(8, -8)$, $(-8, 8)$, $(-8, -8)$, $(10, 0)$, $(-10, 0)$, $(0, 10)$, and $(0, -10)$.
6. Now, we can use the Shoelace formula to find the area of the polygon. The Shoelace formula for the area of a polygon with vertices $(x_1, y_1), (x_2, y_2), ..., (x_n, y_n)$ is given by:
\[A = \frac{1}{2} \vert (x_1y_2 + x_2y_3 + ... + x_ny_1) - (y_1x_2 + y_2x_3 + ... + y_nx_1) \vert.\]
7. Applying the Shoelace formula to the vertices $(8, 8)$, $(8, -8)$, $(-8, 8)$, $(-8, -8)$, $(10, 0)$, $(-10, 0)$, $(0, 10)$, and $(0, -10)$, we get:
\[A = \frac{1}{2} \vert (8 \cdot 8 + 8 \cdot (-8) + (-8) \cdot 8 + (-8) \cdot (-8) + 10 \cdot 0 + (-10) \cdot 0 + 0 \cdot 10 + 0 \cdot (-10) - (8 \cdot 8 + 8 \cdot (-8) + (-8) \cdot 8 + (-8) \cdot (-8) + 0 \cdot 10 + 0 \cdot (-10) + 10 \cdot 0 + (-10) \cdot 0)) \vert = 128.\]
8. So, the area of the convex polygon is 128 square units.
The answer is: $128$

 The problem's constraints, conditions, and related knowledge are as follows:

1. The equation $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ must be satisfied for all points $(x, y)$ inside the polygon.
2. The expression is equal to zero if and only if at least one of the factors is zero.
3. Therefore, either $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$.
4. The first factor is zero if and only if $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. This implies that $x = \pm 10$ and $y = \pm 10$.
5. The second factor is zero if and only if $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$. This implies that $x = \pm 8$ and $y = \pm 8$.
6. Therefore, the polygon is a square with side length 16 (since the distance between the points $(8, 0)$ and $(0, 8)$ is 16).

Now, we can calculate the area of the square:

Area = side length^2 = 16^2 = 256.

Therefore, the area of the convex polygon is 256 square units. The answer is: $256$

2. If $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$, then $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$, which implies $x + y = \pm 10$ and $x - y = \pm 10$. Solving these equations gives $x = y = \pm 5$.
3. If $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$, then $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$, which implies $x = \pm 8$ and $y = \pm 8$.
4. Therefore, the points satisfying the equation are $(8, 8)$, $(8, -8)$, $(-8, 8)$, and $(-8, -8)$, which form a square with side length 16.

To find the area of this square, we simply square the length of one of its sides: $16^2 = 256$.

Therefore, the area of the convex polygon is 256. The answer is: $256$

Below is a math problem you are to solve (natural number answer):
"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"

Assistant:

 The problem's constraints, conditions, and related knowledge are:

1. The equation is equal to zero, which means that either of the factors must be zero.
2. The absolute value function $|x|$ is equal to $x$ if $x \geq 0$ and $-x$ if $x < 0$.
3. The area of a rectangle is given by the product of its length and width.

Now, let's solve the problem step by step:

Step 1: Set each factor equal to zero and solve for $(x, y)$.

For the first factor, we have:
$$(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0.$$
This equation is only possible if $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$.
From the first equation, we have $x + y = \pm 10$ and from the second equation, we have $x - y = \pm 10$.
Solving these four equations, we get the vertices of the polygon: $(0, 10)$, $(0, -10)$, $(10, 0)$, and $(-10, 0)$.

For the second factor, we have:
$$(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0.$$
This equation is only possible if $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$.
From this, we have $x = \pm 8$ and $y = \pm 8$.
So, we get the vertices of the polygon: $(8, 8)$, $(8, -8)$, $(-8, 8)$, and $(-8, -8)$.

Step 2: Plot the vertices on a coordinate plane and connect them to form a rectangle.
The rectangle has side lengths of 20 units (from $(0, 10)$ to $(0, -10)$) and 16 units (from $(8, 8)$ to $(-8, 8)$).

Step 3: Calculate the area of the rectangle.
The area of a rectangle is given by the product of its length and width. So, the area of the rectangle is $20 \times 16 = 320$.

Therefore, the area of the convex polygon is 320 square units. The answer is: $320$

Assistant:

 The problem's constraints, conditions and related knowledge are as follows:

1. The equation is $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$.
2. The product of two numbers is zero if and only if at least one of the numbers is zero. So, either $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$.
3. For a square of a real number to be zero, the real number must be zero. So, either $\vert x + y \vert - 10 = 0$ or $\vert x - y \vert - 10 = 0$ or $\vert x \vert - 8 = 0$ or $\vert y \vert - 8 = 0$.
4. Simplifying the above equations, we get either $\vert x + y \vert = 10$, $\vert x - y \vert = 10$, $\vert x \vert = 8$, or $\vert y \vert = 8$.
5. The absolute value equations can be split into two cases each: $x + y = 10$, $x + y = -10$, $x - y = 10$, $x - y = -10$, $x = 8$, $x = -8$, $y = 8$, and $y = -8$.
6. Solving these equations, we get the vertices of the polygon as $(0, 10)$, $(0, -10)$, $(10, 0)$, $(-10, 0)$, $(8, 0)$, $(-8, 0)$, $(0, 8)$, and $(0, -8)$.
7. The polygon is a square with side length 10 units.
8. The area of a square is given by the square of its side length.

Now, let's solve the problem step by step:

1. Identify the vertices of the polygon.
2. Determine the side length of the square.
3. Calculate the area of the square.

Step 1: The vertices of the polygon are $(0, 10)$, $(0, -10)$, $(10, 0)$, $(-10, 0)$, $(8, 0)$, $(-8, 0)$, $(0, 8)$, and $(0, -8)$.

Step 2: The side length of the square is the distance between any two adjacent vertices. We can use the distance formula for this: $\sqrt{(x_2 - x_1)^2 + (y_2 - y_1)^2}$. For example, the distance between $(0, 10)$ and $(0, -10)$ is $\sqrt{(0 - 0)^2 + (-10 - 10)^2} = \sqrt{0 + 400} = 20$. So the side length of the square is 20 units.

Step 3: The area of a square is given by the square of its side length. So the area of the square is $20^2 = 400$ square units.
The answer is: $400$
