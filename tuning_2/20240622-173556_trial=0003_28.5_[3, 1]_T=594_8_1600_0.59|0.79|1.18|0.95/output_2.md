 The problem asks for the number of positive integers $m$ such that the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has four distinct solutions.

First, let's analyze the equation. The expression $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert$ is a piecewise function that takes on the value $3-x$ when $x \leq 1$, $x-3$ when $3 \leq x \leq 5$, and $x-3$ when $x \geq 5$. So the equation is equivalent to three separate equations:

1. For $x \leq 1$, we have $3-x = \frac{m}{100}$.
2. For $3 \leq x \leq 5$, we have $x-3 = \frac{m}{100}$.
3. For $x \geq 5$, we have $x-3 = \frac{m}{100}$.

Now, let's solve each equation for $x$:

1. For $x \leq 1$, we have $x = 3 - \frac{m}{100}$. This solution is valid only if $3 - \frac{m}{100} \leq 1$, or $\frac{m}{100} \geq 2$, or $m \geq 200$.
2. For $3 \leq x \leq 5$, we have $x = 3 + \frac{m}{100}$. This solution is valid only if $3 + \frac{m}{100} \leq 5$, or $\frac{m}{100} \leq 2$, or $m \leq 200$.
3. For $x \geq 5$, we have $x = 3 + \frac{m}{100}$. This solution is valid only if $3 + \frac{m}{100} \geq 5$, or $\frac{m}{100} \geq 2$, or $m \geq 200$.

The equation has four distinct solutions when the three solution intervals ($x \leq 1$, $3 \leq x \leq 5$, and $x \geq 5$) intersect. This occurs when $200 \leq m \leq 200$, or $m = 200$. So there is only one positive integer $m$ that satisfies the condition, and that is $m = 200$. The answer is: $1$

 The problem asks for the number of positive integers $m$ such that the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has four distinct solutions.

The equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ can be rewritten as $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$.

The equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=k$ has four distinct solutions if and only if $0<k<1$.

So we have $\frac{m}{100}=k$, where $0<k<1$.

This gives $0<\frac{m}{100}<1$, which simplifies to $0<m<100$.

The positive integers $m$ that satisfy this inequality are the integers from $1$ to $99$.

Therefore, the number of positive integers $m$ such that the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has four distinct solutions is $99$. The answer is: $99$

 The problem asks for the number of positive integers $m$ such that the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has $4$ distinct solutions.

The equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ is equivalent to a piecewise function with four cases:
1. If $\vert x-1 \vert -2 > 0$, then the equation becomes $\vert x-1 \vert -2 = \frac{m}{100}$.
2. If $\vert x-1 \vert -2 < 0$, then the equation becomes $-( \vert x-1 \vert -2) = \frac{m}{100}$, which simplifies to $\vert x-1 \vert -2 = -\frac{m}{100}$.
3. If $\vert x-1 \vert -2 = 0$, then the equation becomes $\vert x-1 \vert = 2$, which gives us two cases: $x-1 = 2$ or $x-1 = -2$.

From the third case, we find that $x = 3$ or $x = -1$.

For the first and second cases, we have:
1. $\vert x-1 \vert -2 = \frac{m}{100} \implies \vert x-1 \vert = \frac{m}{100} + 2$. This gives us two sub-cases:
   a. $x-1 = \frac{m}{100} + 2 \implies x = \frac{m}{100} + 3$.
   b. $x-1 = -(\frac{m}{100} + 2) \implies x = 1 - \frac{m}{100} - 2 = -1 - \frac{m}{100}$.
2. $\vert x-1 \vert -2 = -\frac{m}{100} \implies \vert x-1 \vert = 2 - \frac{m}{100}$. This gives us two sub-cases:
   a. $x-1 = 2 - \frac{m}{100} \implies x = 3 - \frac{m}{100}$.
   b. $x-1 = - (2 - \frac{m}{100}) \implies x = -1 + \frac{m}{100}$.

For the equation to have $4$ distinct solutions, the ranges of $x$ from the sub-cases must not overlap with the ranges from the third case. This means that the values $3$, $-1$, $\frac{m}{100} + 3$, $-1 - \frac{m}{100}$, $3 - \frac{m}{100}$, and $-1 + \frac{m}{100}$ must all be distinct.

By considering the possible relationships between these values, we find that the only way for them to be distinct is if $\frac{m}{100} = 2$, which gives $m = 200$.

Therefore, there is only one positive integer $m$ for which the equation has $4$ distinct solutions, and that is $m = 200$. The answer is: $1$

 The problem asks for the number of positive integers $m$ such that the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has $4$ distinct solutions.

First, we need to understand the structure of the equation. The expression $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert$ is a "double absolute value" function, which can take on three different forms depending on the value of $x$:

1. If $x < 1$, then $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert = \vert -x+1 -2 \vert = \vert -x-1 \vert = x+1+2 = x+3$.
2. If $1 \leq x \leq 3$, then $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert = \vert x-1 -2 \vert = \vert x-3 \vert = 3-x$.
3. If $x > 3$, then $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert = \vert x-1 -2 \vert = \vert x-3 \vert = x-3-2 = x-5$.

So the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has $4$ distinct solutions if and only if $\frac{m}{100}$ is either $3$ or $5$. This is because the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=a$ has $4$ distinct solutions if and only if $a$ is either $3$ or $5$.

Therefore, the only positive integer $m$ that satisfies the conditions is $m=300$ or $m=500$. So there is only $1$ such positive integer $m$. The answer is: $1$.

"For how many positive integers $m$ does the equation \[\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}\] have $4$ distinct solutions?"
To accomplish this, first list the problem's constraints, conditions and related knowledge, and thens solve the problem step by step. Be clear so even an idiot can follow your instructions. After solving the problem, output the final numerical answer within \boxed{}.

Assistant:

 The equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has 4 distinct solutions.
We know that the absolute value function $\vert x \vert$ splits into two cases: $x$ if $x \geq 0$ and $-x$ if $x < 0$. So we have four cases to consider for the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$:

1. If $\vert x-1 \vert -2 \geq 0$, then $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert = \vert x-1 \vert -2$. So the equation becomes $\vert x-1 \vert -2 = \frac{m}{100}$.

2. If $\vert x-1 \vert -2 < 0$, then $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert = -( \vert x-1 \vert -2) = 2 - \vert x-1 \vert$. So the equation becomes $2 - \vert x-1 \vert = \frac{m}{100}$.

For each of these cases, we need to solve the resulting equations and count the number of distinct solutions.

Case 1: $\vert x-1 \vert -2 = \frac{m}{100}$.
This equation can be rewritten as $\vert x-1 \vert = 2 + \frac{m}{100}$.
Then we have two sub-cases to consider:

1.1 If $x-1 \geq 0$, then $x-1 = 2 + \frac{m}{100}$, which simplifies to $x = 3 + \frac{m}{100}$.

1.2 If $x-1 < 0$, then $-(x-1) = 2 + \frac{m}{100}$, which simplifies to $x = -1 + \frac{m}{100}$.

Now we need to count the number of distinct solutions for each sub-case.

Case 1.1: $x = 3 + \frac{m}{100}$. The number of distinct solutions depends on the value of $\frac{m}{100}$. If $\frac{m}{100} > 2$, then we have one solution. If $\frac{m}{100} = 2$, then we have no solution. If $0 < \frac{m}{100} < 2$, then we have two solutions.

Case 1.2: $x = -1 + \frac{m}{100}$. The number of distinct solutions depends on the value of $\frac{m}{100}$. If $\frac{m}{100} > 2$, then we have one solution. If $\frac{m}{100} = 2$, then we have no solution. If $0 < \frac{m}{100} < 2$, then we have two solutions.

Case 2: $2 - \vert x-1 \vert = \frac{m}{100}$.
This equation can be rewritten as $\vert x-1 \vert = 2 - \frac{m}{100}$.
Then we have two sub-cases to consider:

2.1 If $x-1 \geq 0$, then $x-1 = 2 - \frac{m}{100}$, which simplifies to $x = 3 - \frac{m}{100}$.

2.2 If $x-1 < 0$, then $-(x-1) = 2 - \frac{m}{100}$, which simplifies to $x = -1 - \frac{m}{100}$.

Now we need to count the number of distinct solutions for each sub-case.

Case 2.1: $x = 3 - \frac{m}{100}$. The number of distinct solutions depends on the value of $\frac{m}{100}$. If $0 < \frac{m}{100} < 2$, then we have one solution. If $\frac{m}{100} = 2$, then we have no solution. If $\frac{m}{100} > 2$, then we have two solutions.

Case 2.2: $x = -1 - \frac{m}{100}$. The number of distinct solutions depends on the value of $\frac{m}{100}$. If $0 < \frac{m}{100} < 2$, then we have one solution. If $\frac{m}{100} = 2$, then we have no solution. If $\frac{m}{100} > 2$, then we have two solutions.

By comparing the number of distinct solutions for each case, we find that the only case where the equation has 4 distinct solutions is when $\frac{m}{100} = 2$ for both Case 1.1 and Case 2.1. This gives us $m = 200$.

Therefore, the only positive integer $m$ for which the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has 4 distinct solutions is $m = 200$. The answer is: $1$
