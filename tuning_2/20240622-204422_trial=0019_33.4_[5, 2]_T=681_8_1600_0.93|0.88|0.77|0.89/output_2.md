Assistant:

 The equation $| |x-1|-2|=\frac{m}{100}$ has four distinct solutions.
The number of distinct solutions depends on the value of $\frac{m}{100}$.
Let's consider the function $f(x)=| |x-1|-2|$.
For $f(x)$ to have four distinct solutions, $\frac{m}{100}$ must be the distance between the two horizontal lines in the graph of $f(x)$.
The graph of $f(x)$ consists of three line segments: one from $(1-2, 2)$ to $(1+2, 2)$, another from $(1+2, 2)$ to $(1+2, -2)$, and the last one from $(1+2, -2)$ to $(1-2, -2)$.
The distance between the two horizontal lines is 2.
Therefore, $\frac{m}{100}=2$, which implies $m=200$.
So, there is only one positive integer $m$ for which the equation has four distinct solutions, and that is $m=200$.
The answer is: $1$

 The problem asks for how many positive integers $m$ the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has $4$ distinct solutions.

The equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ can have $4$ distinct solutions only when $\frac{m}{100}=1$. This is because the expression on the left side of the equation, $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert$, can only take on the value of $1$ exactly $4$ times.

Setting $\frac{m}{100}=1$, we can solve for $m$:
\[m = 100.\]

So, there is only one positive integer $m$ for which the equation has $4$ distinct solutions, and that is $100$. The answer is: $1$

 The equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has 4 distinct solutions.
We know that the absolute value function $\vert x \vert$ splits into two cases: $x$ if $x \geq 0$, and $-x$ if $x < 0$. So, we can split the given equation into two cases as well:
Case 1: $\vert x-1 -2 \vert = \frac{m}{100} \implies \vert x-3 \vert = \frac{m}{100}$. This gives us two sub-cases:
Sub-case 1.1: $x-3 = \frac{m}{100} \implies x = 3 + \frac{m}{100}$.
Sub-case 1.2: $-(x-3) = \frac{m}{100} \implies x = 3 - \frac{m}{100}$.
Case 2: $\vert x-1 +2 \vert = \frac{m}{100} \implies \vert x+1 \vert = \frac{m}{100}$. This gives us two sub-cases:
Sub-case 2.1: $x+1 = \frac{m}{100} \implies x = -1 + \frac{m}{100}$.
Sub-case 2.2: $-(x+1) = \frac{m}{100} \implies x = -1 - \frac{m}{100}$.
Now, we need to find the values of $m$ for which these four equations (from sub-cases 1.1, 1.2, 2.1, and 2.2) have 4 distinct solutions.
For sub-case 1.1: $x = 3 + \frac{m}{100}$, it has a solution if $\frac{m}{100} > 0 \implies m > 0$.
For sub-case 1.2: $x = 3 - \frac{m}{100}$, it has a solution if $\frac{m}{100} < 3 \implies m < 300$.
For sub-case 2.1: $x = -1 + \frac{m}{100}$, it has a solution if $\frac{m}{100} > -1 \implies m > -100$.
For sub-case 2.2: $x = -1 - \frac{m}{100}$, it has a solution if $\frac{m}{100} < -1 \implies m < -100$.
Combining all these conditions, we find that $0 < m < 300$.
Now, we need to count the number of positive integers $m$ in this range. The number of positive integers from 1 to 300 is simply 300. So, there are 300 possible values of $m$ for which the given equation has 4 distinct solutions.
The value of $m$ that we are looking for is 300. The answer is: $1$

Assistant:

 The problem is asking for the number of positive integers $m$ for which the equation $| |x - 1| - 2 | = \frac{m}{100}$ has exactly four distinct solutions.

First, let's analyze the equation $| |x - 1| - 2 | = \frac{m}{100}$.
The expression $|x - 1| - 2$ can take on three different forms depending on the value of $x$:
1. If $x < 1$, then $|x - 1| = -(x - 1) = 1 - x$, so $| |x - 1| - 2 | = |1 - x - 2| = | -x - 1 | = x + 1 - 2 = x - 1$.
2. If $1 \leq x \leq 3$, then $|x - 1| = x - 1$, so $| |x - 1| - 2 | = |x - 1 - 2| = |x - 3|$.
3. If $x > 3$, then $|x - 1| = x - 1$, so $| |x - 1| - 2 | = |x - 1 - 2| = |x - 3|$.

So the equation $| |x - 1| - 2 | = \frac{m}{100}$ can be rewritten as:
1. If $x < 1$, then $x - 1 = \frac{m}{100}$, or $x = 1 + \frac{m}{100}$.
2. If $1 \leq x \leq 3$, then $|x - 3| = \frac{m}{100}$, or $x - 3 = \pm \frac{m}{100}$, or $x = 3 \pm \frac{m}{100}$.
3. If $x > 3$, then $x - 3 = \frac{m}{100}$, or $x = 3 + \frac{m}{100}$.

The equation $| |x - 1| - 2 | = \frac{m}{100}$ has four distinct solutions if and only if the equations $x = 1 + \frac{m}{100}$, $x = 3 - \frac{m}{100}$, $x = 3 + \frac{m}{100}$ have exactly one solution in each of the intervals $(-\infty, 1)$, $(1, 3)$, and $(3, +\infty)$.

This happens if and only if $1 + \frac{m}{100} < 1$, $3 - \frac{m}{100} > 1$, and $3 + \frac{m}{100} > 3$.

Solving these inequalities, we get:
1. $1 + \frac{m}{100} < 1$ implies $\frac{m}{100} < 0$, which has no solutions since $m$ is positive.
2. $3 - \frac{m}{100} > 1$ implies $\frac{m}{100} < 2$, or $m < 200$.
3. $3 + \frac{m}{100} > 3$ implies $\frac{m}{100} > 0$, which is always true.

So the only values of $m$ that satisfy all the conditions are those in the interval $0 < m < 200$. The number of positive integers in this interval is $199$.

Therefore, the number of positive integers $m$ for which the equation $| |x - 1| - 2 | = \frac{m}{100}$ has exactly four distinct solutions is $199$. The answer is: $199$

The problem asks for the number of positive integers $m$ such that the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has exactly 4 distinct solutions.

First, let's analyze the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$. The right-hand side $\frac{m}{100}$ must be nonnegative, so $m$ must be a nonnegative integer. However, the number of solutions of the equation depends on the value of $m$.

The equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ can be rewritten as two separate cases:

Case 1: $\vert x-1 \vert -2 = \frac{m}{100}$.
This simplifies to $\vert x-1 \vert = \frac{m}{100} + 2$.
This further simplifies to $x-1 = \frac{m}{100} + 2$ or $x-1 = -(\frac{m}{100} + 2)$.

Case 2: $\vert x-1 \vert -2 = -\frac{m}{100}$.
This simplifies to $\vert x-1 \vert = 2 - \frac{m}{100}$.
This further simplifies to $x-1 = 2 - \frac{m}{100}$ or $x-1 = -(2 - \frac{m}{100})$.

For each of these cases, we need to find the number of solutions.

For Case 1, the equation $x-1 = \frac{m}{100} + 2$ simplifies to $x = \frac{m}{100} + 3$.
The equation $x-1 = -(\frac{m}{100} + 2)$ simplifies to $x = 1 - \frac{m}{100} - 2 = - \frac{m}{100} - 1$.
The number of solutions for Case 1 is the number of positive solutions for the first equation and the number of negative solutions for the second equation.

For Case 2, the equation $x-1 = 2 - \frac{m}{100}$ simplifies to $x = 3 - \frac{m}{100}$.
The equation $x-1 = -(2 - \frac{m}{100})$ simplifies to $x = -1 + \frac{m}{100}$.
The number of solutions for Case 2 is the number of positive solutions for the first equation and the number of negative solutions for the second equation.

The equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has exactly 4 distinct solutions when the number of positive solutions for Case 1 and the number of negative solutions for Case 2 is equal to 2. This occurs when $0 < \frac{m}{100} < 2$, or $0 < m < 200$.

Therefore, the number of positive integers $m$ such that the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has exactly 4 distinct solutions is 199.
The answer is: $199$.

The equation is given as $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ and we need to find the number of positive integers $m$ for which this equation has 4 distinct solutions.

First, let's consider the right side of the equation, $\frac{m}{100}$. Since $m$ is a positive integer, $\frac{m}{100}$ is a positive rational number.

Next, let's analyze the left side of the equation, $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert$. This expression is a composition of two absolute value functions, which makes it non-negative. Therefore, the right side of the equation, $\frac{m}{100}$, must also be non-negative. This implies that $m$ is a positive integer such that $m \geq 0$.

Now, let's consider the number of distinct solutions for the equation. Since the left side of the equation is always non-negative, the right side of the equation, $\frac{m}{100}$, must also be non-negative. This means that $m \geq 0$.

The equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has 4 distinct solutions when $\frac{m}{100}$ lies in the interval $(0, 2]$. This is because the function $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert$ oscillates between 0 and 4 as $x$ varies over the real numbers, and $\frac{m}{100}$ must be able to "capture" this oscillation exactly once.

So, we need to find the number of positive integers $m$ such that $0 < \frac{m}{100} \leq 2$. Multiplying all sides of the inequalities by 100, we get $0 < m \leq 200$. The positive integers $m$ in this range are $1, 2, 3, ..., 200$. Therefore, there are 200 positive integers $m$ for which the equation has 4 distinct solutions.
The answer is: $200$

 The problem states that we need to find the number of positive integers $m$ for which the equation \[\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}\] has 4 distinct solutions.

First, let's analyze the equation. The expression on the left side, $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert$, is a piecewise function with four branches, depending on the value of $x$. The function equals $2-x$ when $x<1$, $x-3$ when $1\leq x<3$, $3-x$ when $x\geq 3$.

The equation is then equivalent to one of the following:

1. $2-x = \frac{m}{100} \implies x = 2 - \frac{m}{100}$.
2. $x-3 = \frac{m}{100} \implies x = 3 + \frac{m}{100}$.
3. $3-x = \frac{m}{100} \implies x = 3 - \frac{m}{100}$.
4. $-2 + x = \frac{m}{100} \implies x = 2 + \frac{m}{100}$.

For each of these equations, we need to find the value of $x$ that makes it true. However, we also need to ensure that the value of $x$ is within the appropriate domain for each equation (i.e., $x<1$, $1\leq x<3$, $x\geq 3$ for the corresponding branches).

Let's analyze each case:

1. For $2 - \frac{m}{100} < 1$, we have $\frac{m}{100} > 1$, so $m > 100$.
2. For $1 \leq 3 + \frac{m}{100} < 3$, we have $0 \leq \frac{m}{100} < 2$, so $0 \leq m < 200$.
3. For $3 - \frac{m}{100} \geq 3$, we have $\frac{m}{100} \leq 0$, so $m \leq 0$. But $m$ must be a positive integer, so this case is not possible.
4. For $2 + \frac{m}{100} \geq 3$, we have $\frac{m}{100} \geq 1$, so $m \geq 100$.

From the above analysis, we see that the only possible values for $m$ are in the range $100 < m < 200$. Therefore, the number of positive integers $m$ in this range is $100$.

So, the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has 4 distinct solutions for exactly 100 different positive integers $m$. The answer is: 100.

The problem asks for the number of positive integers $m$ for which the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has exactly four distinct solutions.

First, we need to understand the behavior of the function $f(x) = \vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert$. This function is defined as follows:

- If $x < -1$, then $f(x) = -(x - 1) - 2 = -x - 1$.
- If $-1 \leq x < 1$, then $f(x) = -(x - 1) - 2 = -x + 1$.
- If $1 \leq x < 3$, then $f(x) = (x - 1) - 2 = x - 3$.
- If $x \geq 3$, then $f(x) = (x - 1) - 2 = x - 3$.

So, the function $f(x)$ is a piecewise function that has three "jumps" at $x = -1$, $x = 1$, and $x = 3$. The function is equal to $-x - 1$ for $x < -1$, to $-x + 1$ for $-1 \leq x < 1$, to $x - 3$ for $1 \leq x < 3$, and to $x - 3$ for $x \geq 3$.

Now, we need to consider the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$. This equation has four distinct solutions if and only if $\frac{m}{100}$ is equal to the "height" of one of the jumps in the function $f(x)$.

The "heights" of the jumps in the function $f(x)$ are $3 - (-1) = 4$, $3 - 1 = 2$, and $3 - (-3) = 6$. Therefore, the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has four distinct solutions if and only if $\frac{m}{100}$ is equal to $2$, $4$, or $6$.

This means that the positive integer $m$ must be equal to $200$, $400$, or $600$. So, there are three such positive integers $m$.
The answer is: $3$
