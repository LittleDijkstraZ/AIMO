 The equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has $4$ distinct solutions.

First, let's consider the absolute value function $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert$.

This function is equal to $0$ when $\vert x-1 \vert = 2$, which means $x = 3$ or $x = -1$.

It is equal to $1$ when $\vert x-1 \vert = 3$, which means $x = 4$ or $x = -2$.

It is equal to $2$ when $\vert x-1 \vert = 4$, which means $x = 5$ or $x = -3$.

It is equal to $3$ when $\vert x-1 \vert = 5$, which means $x = 6$ or $x = -4$.

And so on.

We can see that the absolute value function $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert$ takes on the value of $\frac{m}{100}$ when $x = 3 + \frac{m}{100}$ or $x = -1 - \frac{m}{100}$.

For the equation to have $4$ distinct solutions, we need $\frac{m}{100} = 2$, which gives $m = 200$.

Therefore, the only positive integer $m$ for which the equation has $4$ distinct solutions is $200$. The answer is: $1$

 The problem asks for the number of positive integers $m$ such that the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has four distinct solutions.

First, let's consider the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$.

The expression inside the absolute value, $\vert x-1 \vert -2$, can be either positive or negative. So we have two cases to consider:

1. $\vert x-1 \vert -2 = \frac{m}{100}$: In this case, $\vert x-1 \vert = \frac{m}{100} + 2$. This gives us two sub-cases to consider:
   a. $x-1 = \frac{m}{100} + 2$: Solving for $x$, we get $x = \frac{m}{100} + 3$.
   b. $x-1 = -\left(\frac{m}{100} + 2\right)$: Solving for $x$, we get $x = 1 - \frac{m}{100} - 2 = - \frac{m}{100} - 1$.

2. $\vert x-1 \vert -2 = -\frac{m}{100}$: In this case, $\vert x-1 \vert = 2 - \frac{m}{100}$. This gives us two sub-cases to consider:
   a. $x-1 = 2 - \frac{m}{100}$: Solving for $x$, we get $x = 3 - \frac{m}{100}$.
   b. $x-1 = -\left(2 - \frac{m}{100}\right)$: Solving for $x$, we get $x = -1 + \frac{m}{100}$.

So, the four distinct solutions are: $x = \frac{m}{100} + 3$, $x = - \frac{m}{100} - 1$, $x = 3 - \frac{m}{100}$, and $x = -1 + \frac{m}{100}$.

For these four solutions to be distinct, the four values of $x$ must be different. This implies that the expressions $\frac{m}{100} + 3$, $- \frac{m}{100} - 1$, $3 - \frac{m}{100}$, and $-1 + \frac{m}{100}$ must be different.

This is only possible if $m = 100$. Therefore, there is only one positive integer $m$ such that the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has four distinct solutions, and that is $m = 100$.
The answer is: $1$

 The equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has $4$ distinct solutions.

The number of solutions of the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=k$ is determined by the number of times $k$ changes its sign in the interval $[1-2, 1+2]$, which is $[ -1, 3]$.

For the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ to have $4$ distinct solutions, $\frac{m}{100}$ must change its sign exactly twice in the interval $[ -1, 3]$.

This means $\frac{m}{100}$ must be in the interval $(0, 1)$ or $(1, 2)$.

If $\frac{m}{100}$ is in the interval $(0, 1)$, then $m$ must be in the interval $(0, 100)$.

If $\frac{m}{100}$ is in the interval $(1, 2)$, then $m$ must be in the interval $(100, 200)$.

Therefore, the possible values of $m$ are the integers in the interval $(100, 200)$.

The number of such integers is $100$.
The answer is: $100$

 The problem states that the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has $4$ distinct solutions. The equation involves absolute values, which makes it a bit tricky to solve. However, we can break it down into cases based on the value of $x$.

Case 1: $x \geq 1$
In this case, the equation becomes $\vert x-1-2 \vert = \frac{m}{100}$, or $\vert x-3 \vert = \frac{m}{100}$. This gives us two sub-cases:

Sub-case 1.1: $x-3 \geq 0$, so the equation becomes $x-3 = \frac{m}{100}$, or $x = 3 + \frac{m}{100}$.
Sub-case 1.2: $x-3 < 0$, so the equation becomes $-(x-3) = \frac{m}{100}$, or $x = 3 - \frac{m}{100}$.

Case 2: $x < 1$
In this case, the equation becomes $\vert -(x-1)-2 \vert = \frac{m}{100}$, or $\vert -x-1 \vert = \frac{m}{100}$. This gives us two sub-cases:

Sub-case 2.1: $-x-1 \geq 0$, so the equation becomes $-x-1 = \frac{m}{100}$, or $x = -1 - \frac{m}{100}$.
Sub-case 2.2: $-x-1 < 0$, so the equation becomes $-( -x-1) = \frac{m}{100}$, or $x = -1 + \frac{m}{100}$.

Now, we need to find the values of $m$ for which these four equations (two from each case) have $4$ distinct solutions. We can do this by setting the right-hand sides of the equations equal to each other and solving for $m$.

For Case 1.1 and Case 2.1, we have $3 + \frac{m}{100} = -1 - \frac{m}{100}$. Solving for $m$ gives $m = -75$.

For Case 1.2 and Case 2.2, we have $3 - \frac{m}{100} = -1 + \frac{m}{100}$. Solving for $m$ gives $m = 50$.

So, the values of $m$ that make the equation have $4$ distinct solutions are $m = 50$ and $m = -75$. However, $m$ must be a positive integer, so we discard the negative value. Therefore, the only value of $m$ that works is $m = 50$.
The answer is: $1$

Assistant:

 The equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has $4$ distinct solutions.

We first consider the right side of the equation. Since $\frac{m}{100}$ is positive, $m$ must be a positive integer. Also, for the equation to have $4$ distinct solutions, $\frac{m}{100}$ must be less than $2$ but greater than or equal to $0$. This gives us $0 \leq \frac{m}{100} < 2$, which simplifies to $0 \leq m < 200$.

Next, we consider the left side of the equation. The expression $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert$ can take on the values $0$, $1$, or $2$. This is because the absolute value function makes the expression inside it non-negative, and the inner absolute value makes the expression inside it non-negative again. So we have three cases to consider:

1. $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert = 0$: This gives us $\vert x-1 \vert = 2$, which has two solutions: $x = 3$ and $x = -1$.
2. $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert = 1$: This gives us two cases:
   a. $\vert x-1 \vert = 3$, which has two solutions: $x = 4$ and $x = -2$.
   b. $\vert x-1 \vert = 1$, which has two solutions: $x = 2$ and $x = 0$.
3. $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert = 2$: This gives us $\vert x-1 \vert = 4$, which has two solutions: $x = 5$ and $x = -3$.

So the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has $4$ distinct solutions when $\frac{m}{100}$ is equal to $1$. This means $m = 100$.

Therefore, the only positive integer $m$ for which the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has $4$ distinct solutions is $100$. The answer is: $1$
