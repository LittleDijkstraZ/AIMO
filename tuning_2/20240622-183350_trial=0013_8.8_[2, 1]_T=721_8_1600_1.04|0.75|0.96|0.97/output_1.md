"What is the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ when $x$ and $y$ range over all real numbers such that $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$?"
To accomplish this, first list the problem's constraints, conditions and related knowledge, and thens solve the problem step by step. Be clear so even an idiot can follow your instructions. After solving the problem, output the final numerical answer within \boxed{}.

Assistant:

 The problem's constraints are $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$. We can simplify this to $|x-2y| + |2y-x| = 40$, which is equivalent to $|x-2y| - |x-2y| = 40$. The absolute value of a quantity subtracted by itself is always zero, so we have $0 = 40$, which is a contradiction. This means there must be a mistake in our reasoning.

Let's go back to the original constraint and apply the definition of absolute value:

If $x - 2y \ge 0$ and $y - 2x \ge 0$, then $|x - 2y| + |y - 2x| = (x - 2y) + (y - 2x) = x - 2y + y - 2x = -x - y$.

If $x - 2y < 0$ and $y - 2x \ge 0$, then $|x - 2y| + |y - 2x| = -(x - 2y) + (y - 2x) = -x + 2y + y - 2x = -3x + 3y$.

If $x - 2y \ge 0$ and $y - 2x < 0$, then $|x - 2y| + |y - 2x| = (x - 2y) - (y - 2x) = x - 2y - y + 2x = 3x - 3y$.

If $x - 2y < 0$ and $y - 2x < 0$, then $|x - 2y| + |y - 2x| = -(x - 2y) - (y - 2x) = -x + 2y - y + 2x = y$.

We are given that $|x - 2y| + |y - 2x| = 40$. Considering the cases above, we see that the only possible case is when $x - 2y < 0$ and $y - 2x < 0$, so $y = 40$.

Now we can substitute $y = 40$ into the original expression $5x^2 + 5y^2 - 8xy$:

$$5x^2 + 5(40)^2 - 8x(40) = 5x^2 + 8000 - 320x.$$

To find the minimum value of this expression, we can take the derivative with respect to $x$ and set it equal to zero:

$$\frac{d}{dx}(5x^2 + 8000 - 320x) = 10x - 320 = 0.$$

Solving for $x$, we get $x = \frac{320}{10} = 32$.

Now we can substitute $x = 32$ and $y = 40$ back into the original expression to find the minimum value:

$$5(32)^2 + 5(40)^2 - 8(32)(40) = 5(1024) + 5(1600) - 12800 = 5120 + 8000 - 12800 = -$$.

The minimum value of the expression is $-$. However, this is not possible because the value of a quadratic expression is always non-negative. We must have made a mistake in our calculations.

Let's go back and check our work. We found that $y = 40$ from the constraint $|x - 2y| + |y - 2x| = 40$. We then substituted $y = 40$ into the expression $5x^2 + 5y^2 - 8xy$ to find the minimum value. However, we should have substituted the values of $x$ and $y$ that satisfy the constraint $|x - 2y| + |y - 2x| = 40$ into the expression $5x^2 + 5y^2 - 8xy$ to find the minimum value.

Let's correct this and re-evaluate the expression with the correct values of $x$ and $y$.

From the constraint $y = 40$, we substitute this into the equation $x - 2y < 0$ to get $x - 2(40) < 0$, which simplifies to $x - 80 < 0$. Solving for $x$, we get $x < 80$. Similarly, substituting $y = 40$ into the equation $y - 2x < 0$ gives $40 - 2x < 0$, which simplifies to $2x > 40$, and solving for $x$ gives $x > 20$. Combining the two inequalities, we have $20 < x < 80$.

Now we can substitute $y = 40$ into the expression $5x^2 + 5y^2 - 8xy$:

$$5x^2 + 5(40)^2 - 8x(40) = 5x^2 + 8000 - 320x.$$

To find the minimum value of this expression, we can take the derivative with respect to $x$ and set it equal to zero:

$$\frac{d}{dx}(5x^2 + 8000 - 320x) = 10x - 320 = 0.$$

Solving for $x$, we get $x = \frac{320}{10} = 32$.

However, $x = 32$ is within the range $20 < x < 80$. Now we can substitute $x = 32$ and $y = 40$ back into the original expression to find the minimum value:

$$5(32)^2 + 5(40)^2 - 8(32)(40) = 5(1024) + 5(1600) - 12800 = 5120 + 8000 - 12800 = 0.$$

The minimum value of the expression is $0$.

Therefore, the minimum value of the expression $5x^2 + 5y^2 - 8xy$ when $x$ and $y$ range over all real numbers such that $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$ is $0$. The answer is: $0$

Below is a math problem you are to solve (natural number answer):
"What is the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ when $x$ and $y$ range over all real numbers such that $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$?"
To accomplish this, first list the problem's constraints, conditions and related knowledge, and thens solve the problem step by step. Be clear so even an idiot can follow your instructions. After solving the problem, output the final numerical answer within \boxed{}.

Assistant:

 First, let's list the problem's constraints, conditions and related knowledge:

1. The constraint is $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$.
2. The function to be minimized is $f(x, y) = 5x^2 + 5y^2 - 8xy$.
3. We need to find the minimum value of $f(x, y)$ subject to the constraint.

Now, let's solve the problem step by step:

Step 1: Simplify the constraint
The constraint $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$ can be rewritten as $|x-2y| + |2y-x| = 40$. Since $|a| = |-a|$ for any real number $a$, we can further simplify the constraint to $|x-2y| + |x-2y| = 40$, which simplifies to $2|x-2y| = 40$ or $|x-2y| = 20$.

Step 2: Express $y$ in terms of $x$
From the constraint $|x-2y| = 20$, we can express $y$ in terms of $x$ as follows:
- If $x \geq 2y$, then $x - 2y = 20$, which gives $y = \frac{x - 20}{2}$.
- If $x < 2y$, then $2y - x = 20$, which gives $y = \frac{x + 20}{2}$.

Step 3: Substitute $y$ into the function to be minimized
Now we substitute $y = \frac{x - 20}{2}$ or $y = \frac{x + 20}{2}$ into the function $f(x, y) = 5x^2 + 5y^2 - 8xy$. We get two functions:
- If $y = \frac{x - 20}{2}$, then $f(x, y) = 5x^2 + 5\left(\frac{x - 20}{2}\right)^2 - 8x\left(\frac{x - 20}{2}\right) = \frac{1}{4}(13x^2 - 400x + 8000)$.
- If $y = \frac{x + 20}{2}$, then $f(x, y) = 5x^2 + 5\left(\frac{x + 20}{2}\right)^2 - 8x\left(\frac{x + 20}{2}\right) = \frac{1}{4}(13x^2 + 400x + 8000)$.

Step 4: Find the minimum value of the functions
Now we need to find the minimum value of the two functions $f_1(x) = \frac{1}{4}(13x^2 - 400x + 8000)$ and $f_2(x) = \frac{1}{4}(13x^2 + 400x + 8000)$.

To find the minimum value of a quadratic function $f(x) = ax^2 + bx + c$, we can use the formula $x = -\frac{b}{2a}$.

For $f_1(x)$, we have $x = \frac{400}{26} = \frac{200}{13}$, and substituting this into $f_1(x)$ gives the minimum value $f_1\left(\frac{200}{13}\right) = \frac{1}{4}(13\left(\frac{200}{13}\right)^2 - 400\left(\frac{200}{13}\right) + 8000) = 2000$.

For $f_2(x)$, we have $x = -\frac{400}{26} = -\frac{200}{13}$, and substituting this into $f_2(x)$ gives the minimum value $f_2\left(-\frac{200}{13}\right) = \frac{1}{4}(13\left(-\frac{200}{13}\right)^2 + 400\left(-\frac{200}{13}\right) + 8000) = 2000$.

So the minimum value of $f(x, y)$ is 2000.
The answer is: $2000$

Below is a math problem you are to solve (natural number answer):
"What is the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ when $x$ and $y$ range over all real numbers such that $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$?"

Assistant:

 The problem is to find the minimum value of the expression $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ under the constraint $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$.

First, let's simplify the constraint equation. The absolute value equations can be rewritten as:
\[|x-2y| = (2y-x) \text{ or } (x-2y)\]
\[|y-2x| = (2x-y) \text{ or } (y-2x)\]
So, we have four cases to consider:
1. $(2y-x) + (2x-y) = 40 \implies y = 20$
2. $(2y-x) + (y-2x) = 40 \implies y = 10$
3. $(x-2y) + (2x-y) = 40 \implies x = 20$
4. $(x-2y) + (y-2x) = 40 \implies x = 10$

However, none of these cases satisfy the constraint $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$. Therefore, we must have made a mistake in our simplification. Let's go back and re-examine the absolute value equations.

The equation $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$ is equivalent to the sum of two absolute values equaling a constant. This is the condition for the distance between two points in the plane, where $(x, y)$ and $(2y, 2x)$ are the two points. So, the constraint is actually the equation of a square in the coordinate plane with vertices at $(0, 0)$, $(20, 20)$, $(-20, -20)$, and $(0, 0)$.

Now, let's substitute $x = 2y$ into the expression $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$:
\[5(2y)^2 + 5y^2 - 8(2y)(y) = 20y^2 + 5y^2 - 16y^2 = 9y^2\]

Similarly, substitute $y = 2x$:
\[5x^2 + 5(2x)^2 - 8x(2x) = 5x^2 + 20x^2 - 16x^2 = 19x^2\]

Since the expression $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ is a sum of squares, it is always non-negative. Therefore, the minimum value occurs at the vertex of the square, which is the midpoint of the line segment connecting $(0, 0)$ and $(20, 20)$, or $(10, 10)$.

Substitute $x = 10$ and $y = 10$ into the expression $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$:
\[5(10)^2 + 5(10)^2 - 8(10)(10) = 500 + 500 - 800 = 200\]

Therefore, the minimum value of the expression $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ under the constraint $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$ is 200. The answer is: $200$

"What is the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ when $x$ and $y$ range over all real numbers such that $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$?"
Analyze the problem and think step by step to come to a solution with programs. After solving the problem, output the final numerical answer within \boxed{}.

Assistant:

 This problem involves finding the minimum value of a function under a constraint. We can solve it using the method of Lagrange multipliers.

First, let's rewrite the constraint equation as $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$. We can then express this as a system of equations:

1. $x - 2y + y - 2x = 40$ if $x \geq 2y$ and $y \geq 2x$.
2. $x - 2y - (y - 2x) = 40$ if $x \geq 2y$ and $y < 2x$.
3. $-x + 2y + y - 2x = 40$ if $x < 2y$ and $y \geq 2x$.
4. $-x + 2y - (y - 2x) = 40$ if $x < 2y$ and $y < 2x$.

Solving these equations, we find that the only possible solution that gives real values for $x$ and $y$ is the first equation:

$$x - 2y + y - 2x = 40 \implies -x - y = 40.$$
Solving for $y$, we get $y = -x - 40$.

Now, substitute this into the function we want to minimize:
$$f(x) = 5x^2 + 5(-x - 40)^2 - 8x(-x - 40) = 5x^2 + 5(x^2 + 80x + 1600) - 8x^2 + 320x = 10x^2 - 8x^2 + 320x + 8000 - 400x = 2x^2 - 80x + 8000.$$

To find the minimum value of $f(x)$, we can find its derivative and set it equal to zero:
$$f'(x) = 4x - 80 = 0 \implies x = 20.$$

Substituting this back into the equation for $y$, we get $y = -20 - 40 = -60$.

Now, we can find the minimum value of the function by substituting these values of $x$ and $y$ back into the function:
$$f(20, -60) = 2(20)^2 - 80(20) + 8000 = 800 - 1600 + 8000 = 7200.$$

Therefore, the minimum value of the function $5x^2 + 5y^2 - 8xy$ under the constraint $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$ is 7200.
The answer is: $7200$

Below is a math problem you are to solve (natural number answer):
"What is the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ when $x$ and $y$ range over all real numbers such that $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$?"

Assistant:

 First, let's list the problem's constraints, conditions and related knowledge:

1. The equation $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$ must be satisfied by $x$ and $y$.
2. We need to find the minimum value of the expression $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$.

Now, let's solve the problem step by step:

Step 1: Rewrite the constraint equation.
We can rewrite the constraint equation as $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40 \implies |x-2y| = 40 - |y-2x|$.

Step 2: Consider the cases for the absolute values.
We can consider two cases:
Case 1: $x-2y \geq 0$ and $y-2x \geq 0$. In this case, the equation becomes $x-2y = 40 - (y-2x) \implies 3x-3y = 40 \implies x-y = \frac{40}{3}$.
Case 2: $x-2y < 0$ and $y-2x < 0$. In this case, the equation becomes $-(x-2y) = 40 - -(y-2x) \implies x-2y = 40 + y-2x \implies 3x-3y = -40 \implies x-y = -\frac{40}{3}$.

Step 3: Analyze the cases.
Case 1 gives us $x-y = \frac{40}{3}$, and case 2 gives us $x-y = -\frac{40}{3}$. These two equations are inconsistent, so there must be another case to consider.

Case 3: $x-2y \geq 0$ and $y-2x < 0$. In this case, the equation becomes $x-2y = 40 - -(y-2x) \implies x-2y = 40 + y-2x \implies 3x-3y = 40 \implies x-y = \frac{40}{3}$.
Case 4: $x-2y < 0$ and $y-2x \geq 0$. In this case, the equation becomes $-(x-2y) = 40 - (y-2x) \implies x-2y = 40 - y+2x \implies 3x-3y = -40 \implies x-y = -\frac{40}{3}$.

Step 4: Analyze the cases further.
Case 3 and case 4 both lead to $x-y = \frac{40}{3}$ or $x-y = -\frac{40}{3}$. However, since $x$ and $y$ are real numbers, $x-y$ cannot be both positive and negative at the same time. Therefore, we discard $x-y = -\frac{40}{3}$ and only consider $x-y = \frac{40}{3}$.

Step 5: Substitute $x-y = \frac{40}{3}$ into the expression $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$.
We have $5x^2+5y^2-8xy = 5(x-y)^2 + 3xy = 5\left(\frac{40}{3}\right)^2 + 3xy = \frac{8000}{9} + 3xy$.

Step 6: Find the minimum value of $3xy$.
To find the minimum value of $3xy$, we can use the AM-GM inequality, which states that the arithmetic mean of a set of non-negative numbers is always greater than or equal to the geometric mean of the same set. Applying this inequality to $x$ and $y$, we get $\frac{x+y}{2} \geq \sqrt{xy}$. Squaring both sides, we get $\frac{(x+y)^2}{4} \geq xy \implies xy \leq \frac{(x+y)^2}{4}$.

Step 7: Substitute $x+y = \frac{40}{3}$ into the inequality $xy \leq \frac{(x+y)^2}{4}$.
We have $xy \leq \frac{\left(\frac{40}{3}\right)^2}{4} = \frac{1600}{36 \cdot 4} = \frac{100}{9}$.

Step 8: Substitute $xy \leq \frac{100}{9}$ into the expression $\frac{8000}{9} + 3xy$.
We have $\frac{8000}{9} + 3xy \geq \frac{8000}{9} + 3 \cdot \frac{100}{9} = \frac{8000}{9} + \frac{300}{3} = \frac{8000}{9} + \frac{900}{9} = \frac{8900}{9}$.

Therefore, the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ is $\frac{8900}{9}$. The answer is: $\boxed{\frac{8900}{9}}$

Below is a math problem you are to solve (natural number answer):
"What is the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ when $x$ and $y$ range over all real numbers such that $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$?"

Assistant:

 The problem's constraints are given by the equation $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$.
We can rewrite this equation as $|x-2y| + |2y-x| = 40$.
Using the property $|a| = |-a|$, we can simplify this to $2|x-2y| = 40$.
Dividing both sides by 2 gives $|x-2y| = 20$.
Now, let's consider two cases:

Case 1: $x-2y \geq 0$. In this case, $|x-2y| = x-2y$, so $x-2y = 20$.

Case 2: $x-2y < 0$. In this case, $|x-2y| = -(x-2y)$, so $-(x-2y) = 20$, which simplifies to $2y-x = 20$.

Now, let's substitute these cases into the expression $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$.

Case 1: $x-2y = 20$. Solving for $x$ gives $x = 2y + 20$. Substituting this into the expression gives:
\[5(2y+20)^2+5y^2-8(2y+20)y = 5(4y^2+80y+400)+5y^2-16y^2-160y = 20y^2+400y+2000+5y^2-16y^2-160y = -y^2+240y+2000.\]

Case 2: $2y-x = 20$. Solving for $x$ gives $x = 2y-20$. Substituting this into the expression gives:
\[5(2y-20)^2+5y^2-8(2y-20)y = 5(4y^2-80y+400)+5y^2-16y^2+160y = 20y^2-400y+2000+5y^2-16y^2+160y = -y^2-240y+2000.\]

Comparing the two cases, we see that the minimum value of the expression occurs in Case 1, where $x = 2y + 20$. Let's find the minimum value of the expression in Case 1.

The expression in Case 1 is $-y^2+240y+2000$. To find the minimum value, we can take the derivative with respect to $y$ and set it equal to 0:
\[-2y+240=0 \implies y = 120.\]
Substituting this back into the equation $x = 2y + 20$ gives $x = 2(120) + 20 = 260$.

Now, we can substitute these values of $x$ and $y$ into the expression $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$:
\[5(260)^2+5(120)^2-8(260)(120) = 338000.\]

Therefore, the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ is 338000. The answer is: $338000$.

Below is a math problem you are to solve (natural number answer):
"What is the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ when $x$ and $y$ range over all real numbers such that $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$?"

Assistant:

 The problem's constraints are $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$. We can rewrite this as $|x-2y| + |2y-x| = 40$.
Since $|a| = |-a|$, we can simplify this to $2|x-2y| = 40$.
Dividing both sides by 2 gives $|x-2y| = 20$.

Now, let's consider the expression $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$. We can rewrite this as $\frac{5}{2}((x-2y)^2 + (y-2x)^2)$.

By the triangle inequality, we know that $|a+b| \leq |a| + |b|$. Applying this to $|x-2y| + |2y-x| = 40$, we get $|x-2y + 2y-x| \leq |x-2y| + |2y-x|$, which simplifies to $0 \leq 40$.

So, $|x-2y| = 20$ and $|2y-x| = 0$. This means $2y-x = 0$, or $x = 2y$.

Substituting $x = 2y$ into the equation $|x-2y| = 20$, we get $|2y-2y| = 20$, or $0 = 20$, which is a contradiction.

Therefore, the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ occurs when $x = 2y$.

Substituting $x = 2y$ into the equation $|x-2y| = 20$, we get $|2y-2y| = 20$, or $0 = 20$, which is a contradiction.

This means we made an error in our reasoning. Let's go back and re-examine the problem.

The constraint $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$ can be rewritten as $|x-2y| + |2y-x| = 40$.
By the triangle inequality, we know that $|a+b| \leq |a| + |b|$. Applying this to $|x-2y| + |2y-x| = 40$, we get $|x-2y + 2y-x| \leq |x-2y| + |2y-x|$, which simplifies to $0 \leq 40$.

This means that the sum of the absolute values is actually equal to 40, not less than or equal to 40. So, we must have $|x-2y| = 20$ and $|2y-x| = 20$.

This means $x-2y = \pm 20$ and $2y-x = \pm 20$. Adding these equations, we get $0 = \pm 40$, which is still a contradiction.

However, we made a mistake in our reasoning. The triangle inequality states that $|a+b| \leq |a| + |b|$, but we cannot conclude that $|a+b| = |a| + |b|$ from this inequality.

In fact, the correct conclusion from the triangle inequality is that $|a+b| \leq |a| + |b|$ with equality if and only if $a$ and $b$ have the same sign.

Applying this to $|x-2y| + |2y-x| = 40$, we can conclude that $|x-2y| = 20$ and $|2y-x| = 20$ if and only if the signs of $x-2y$ and $2y-x$ are the same.

This means $x-2y = 20$ and $2y-x = 20$, or $x-2y = -20$ and $2y-x = -20$. Solving these equations, we find that the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ occurs when $x = 30$ and $y = 15$.

Substituting these values into the expression $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$, we get $5(30)^2 + 5(15)^2 - 8(30)(15) = 4500 + 1125 - 3600 = 2025$.

Therefore, the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ is 2025. The answer is: $2025$

7_User:

Below is a math problem you are to solve (natural number answer):
"What is the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ when $x$ and $y$ range over all real numbers such that $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$?"
To accomplish this, first list the problem's constraints, conditions and related knowledge, and thens solve the problem step by step. Be clear so even an idiot can follow your instructions. After solving the problem, output the final numerical answer within \boxed{}.

Assistant:

 The problem's constraints are given by the equation $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$. We know that $|a-b| = |b-a|$, so we can rewrite the equation as $|x-2y| + |2y-x| = 40$.

We can use the property $|a+b| \leq |a| + |b|$ to expand the left side of the equation:
\[|x-2y| + |2y-x| = |x-2y| + |x-2y| = 2|x-2y|.\]
So we have $2|x-2y| = 40$, which simplifies to $|x-2y| = 20$.

This gives us two cases to consider:
1. $x-2y = 20$ or
2. $x-2y = -20$.

For case 1, we can solve for $y$ in terms of $x$:
\[y = \frac{x-20}{2}.\]
Substitute this into the expression $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$:
\[5x^2 + 5\left(\frac{x-20}{2}\right)^2 - 8x\left(\frac{x-20}{2}\right).\]
Simplify:
\[5x^2 + \frac{5(x^2-40x+400)}{4} - 4x^2 + 40x.\]
Combine like terms:
\[\frac{5x^2 + 5x^2 - 200x + 2000 - 16x^2 + 160x}{4}.\]
Simplify further:
\[\frac{-x^2 - 60x + 2000}{4}.\]
Multiply through by 4 to eliminate the fraction:
\[-x^2 - 60x + 2000.\]
This expression is minimized when the derivative with respect to $x$ is zero:
\[-2x - 60 = 0.\]
Solving for $x$, we get $x = -30$. Substituting this into the equation for $y$, we get:
\[y = \frac{-30-20}{2} = -25.\]
So the minimum value for case 1 is:
\[-(-30)^2 - 60(-30) + 2000 = -900 + 1800 + 2000 = 2900.\]

For case 2, we can solve for $y$ in terms of $x$:
\[y = \frac{x+20}{2}.\]
Substitute this into the expression $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$:
\[5x^2 + 5\left(\frac{x+20}{2}\right)^2 - 8x\left(\frac{x+20}{2}\right).\]
Simplify:
\[5x^2 + \frac{5(x^2+40x+400)}{4} - 4x^2 - 40x.\]
Combine like terms:
\[\frac{5x^2 + 5x^2 + 200x + 2000 - 16x^2 - 160x}{4}.\]
Simplify further:
\[\frac{-x^2 + 80x + 2000}{4}.\]
Multiply through by 4 to eliminate the fraction:
\[-x^2 + 80x + 2000.\]
This expression is minimized when the derivative with respect to $x$ is zero:
\[-2x + 80 = 0.\]
Solving for $x$, we get $x = 40$. Substituting this into the equation for $y$, we get:
\[y = \frac{40+20}{2} = 30.\]
So the minimum value for case 2 is:
\[-40^2 + 80(40) + 2000 = -1600 + 3200 + 2000 = 4600.\]

Comparing the minimum values from both cases, we find that the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ is 2900 when $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$.
The answer is: $2900$
