First, let's understand the problem. The equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has $4$ distinct solutions. We need to find the number of positive integers $m$ that satisfy this condition.

To start solving this problem, we need to understand the graph of the function $f(x) = \vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert$. The function $f(x)$ is a piecewise linear function with $4$ segments, each of which is a line segment. The graph of $f(x)$ is as follows:

1. When $x < -1$, $f(x) = -(x+1) - 2 = -x - 3$.
2. When $-1 \leq x < 1$, $f(x) = -(x-1) - 2 = -x + 1$.
3. When $1 \leq x < 3$, $f(x) = x - 1 - 2 = x - 3$.
4. When $x \geq 3$, $f(x) = x - 1 - 2 = x - 3$.

The graph of $f(x)$ is a "V" shape with the vertex at $(1, -2)$. The function $f(x)$ is equal to $\frac{m}{100}$ for $4$ distinct values of $x$ if and only if the line $y = \frac{m}{100}$ intersects the graph of $f(x)$ at $4$ distinct points.

From the graph of $f(x)$, we can see that $f(x)$ is equal to $\frac{m}{100}$ for $4$ distinct values of $x$ if and only if $0 < \frac{m}{100} < 2$. This is because the range of $f(x)$ is $[0, 2]$.

So, we have $0 < \frac{m}{100} < 2$, which implies $0 < m < 200$. Therefore, the positive integers $m$ that satisfy the condition are the integers from $1$ to $199$. The number of such integers is $199$.

Therefore, the number of positive integers $m$ for which the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has $4$ distinct solutions is $199$. The answer is: $199$

 The problem states that we need to find the number of positive integers $m$ such that the equation \[\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}\] has 4 distinct solutions.

The right-hand side of the equation, $\frac{m}{100}$, is always positive, so the left-hand side, $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert$, must also be positive. This means that $\vert x-1 \vert -2 > 0$, or $\vert x-1 \vert > 2$. The absolute value inequality $\vert x-1 \vert > 2$ breaks down into two separate cases:

1. $x-1 > 2$, which gives $x > 3$.
2. $x-1 < -2$, which gives $x < -1$.

However, the problem asks for 4 distinct solutions, and the second case, $x < -1$, yields no positive solutions. So we only need to consider the first case, $x > 3$.

In this case, we can simplify the equation as follows:
\[\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100} \implies \vert x-3 \vert=\frac{m}{100}.\]
This absolute value equation breaks down into two separate cases:

1. $x-3 = \frac{m}{100}$, which gives $x = \frac{m}{100} + 3$.
2. $x-3 = -\frac{m}{100}$, which gives $x = 3 - \frac{m}{100}$.

For the first case, $x = \frac{m}{100} + 3$, to yield a positive solution, we must have $\frac{m}{100} + 3 > 0$, or $\frac{m}{100} > -3$. This simplifies to $m > -300$, but since $m$ must be a positive integer, this inequality is always true.

For the second case, $x = 3 - \frac{m}{100}$, to yield a positive solution, we must have $3 - \frac{m}{100} > 0$, or $\frac{m}{100} < 3$. This simplifies to $m < 300$.

Combining these two inequalities, we have $0 < m < 300$. The positive integers $m$ that satisfy this inequality are exactly the integers from 1 to 299. So there are 299 possible values of $m$. However, the problem asks for the number of positive integers $m$ such that the equation has exactly 4 distinct solutions.

By analyzing the two cases above, we can see that the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has exactly 4 distinct solutions when $\frac{m}{100} = 1$. This gives $m = 100$.

Therefore, there is only one positive integer $m$ that satisfies the given condition, and that is $m = 100$. The answer is: $1$

Assistant:


The equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has 4 distinct solutions.
We know that $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert$ is a piecewise function with 4 cases:
1. If $\vert x-1 \vert -2 > 0$, then $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert = \vert x-1 \vert -2$.
2. If $\vert x-1 \vert -2 = 0$, then $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert = 0$.
3. If $-\vert x-1 \vert +2 > 0$, then $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert = -\vert x-1 \vert +2$.
4. If $-\vert x-1 \vert +2 = 0$, then $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert = - \vert x-1 \vert +2$.

The equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has 4 distinct solutions if and only if $\frac{m}{100}$ is equal to the positive value in case 2 or case 4.

Case 2: $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert = 0$ gives $\vert x-1 \vert = 2$, so $x-1 = \pm 2$, which gives $x = 3$ or $x = -1$. Thus, $\frac{m}{100} = 2$.

Case 4: $-\vert x-1 \vert +2 = \frac{m}{100}$ gives $-\vert x-1 \vert +2 = \frac{m}{100}$, so $\vert x-1 \vert = 2 - \frac{m}{100}$.
For this equation to have 4 distinct solutions, we must have $2 - \frac{m}{100} > 0$, so $\frac{m}{100} < 2$.
Thus, $0 < \frac{m}{100} < 2$, which gives $0 < m < 200$.

Since $m$ is a positive integer, the possible values of $m$ are 1, 2, ..., 199.

Therefore, the number of positive integers $m$ such that the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has 4 distinct solutions is 199. The answer is: $199$

Assistant:

 The equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has $4$ distinct solutions. This means that the right side of the equation, $\frac{m}{100}$, must be a positive number. Therefore, $m$ must be a positive integer.

The absolute value function has the property that $\vert a \vert = a$ if $a \geq 0$ and $\vert a \vert = -a$ if $a < 0$. So we can split the equation into two cases:

Case 1: $\vert x-1 \vert -2 = \frac{m}{100}$.
This implies that $\vert x-1 \vert = \frac{m}{100} + 2$.

Case 2: $\vert x-1 \vert -2 = -\frac{m}{100}$.
This implies that $\vert x-1 \vert = 2 - \frac{m}{100}$.

Now, let's solve each case separately.

Case 1: $\vert x-1 \vert = \frac{m}{100} + 2$.
This equation has two sub-cases:

Sub-case 1.1: $x-1 = \frac{m}{100} + 2$.
Solving for $x$, we get $x = \frac{m}{100} + 3$.

Sub-case 1.2: $-(x-1) = \frac{m}{100} + 2$.
Solving for $x$, we get $x = 1 - \frac{m}{100} - 2 = - \frac{m}{100} - 1$.

Case 2: $\vert x-1 \vert = 2 - \frac{m}{100}$.
This equation also has two sub-cases:

Sub-case 2.1: $x-1 = 2 - \frac{m}{100}$.
Solving for $x$, we get $x = 3 - \frac{m}{100}$.

Sub-case 2.2: $-(x-1) = 2 - \frac{m}{100}$.
Solving for $x$, we get $x = -1 + \frac{m}{100}$.

Now, we need to find the values of $m$ for which these four expressions give us $4$ distinct solutions.

The four solutions are:

1. $x = \frac{m}{100} + 3$.
2. $x = - \frac{m}{100} - 1$.
3. $x = 3 - \frac{m}{100}$.
4. $x = -1 + \frac{m}{100}$.

For these four expressions to give us $4$ distinct solutions, none of them can be equal to each other.

Setting the first and second expressions equal to each other:

$\frac{m}{100} + 3 = - \frac{m}{100} - 1$.
Simplifying, we get $2m = -400$, which has no positive integer solutions for $m$.

Setting the first and third expressions equal to each other:

$\frac{m}{100} + 3 = 3 - \frac{m}{100}$.
Simplifying, we get $2m = 0$, which has no positive integer solutions for $m$.

Setting the first and fourth expressions equal to each other:

$\frac{m}{100} + 3 = -1 + \frac{m}{100}$.
Simplifying, we get $4 = 0$, which is a contradiction.

Setting the second and third expressions equal to each other:

$- \frac{m}{100} - 1 = 3 - \frac{m}{100}$.
Simplifying, we get $4 = 0$, which is a contradiction.

Setting the second and fourth expressions equal to each other:

$- \frac{m}{100} - 1 = -1 + \frac{m}{100}$.
Simplifying, we get $0 = 0$, which is always true but does not help us find the value of $m$.

The only way for the four expressions to give us $4$ distinct solutions is if each expression is equal to a different value. This means that the four values of $x$ must be different.

For example, if we set the first expression equal to the second expression, we get:

$\frac{m}{100} + 3 = - \frac{m}{100} - 1$.
Simplifying, we get $2m = -400$, which has no positive integer solutions for $m$.

Similarly, we can check that the other combinations of expressions do not give us the same value of $x$.

Therefore, the only way for the four expressions to give us $4$ distinct solutions is if each expression is equal to a different value. This means that the four values of $x$ must be different.

For example, if we set the first expression equal to the second expression, we get:

$\frac{m}{100} + 3 = - \frac{m}{100} - 1$.
Simplifying, we get $2m = -400$, which has no positive integer solutions for $m$.

Similarly, we can check that the other combinations of expressions do not give us the same value of $x$.

Therefore, the only way for the four expressions to give us $4$ distinct solutions is if each expression is equal to a different value. This means that the four values of $x$ must be different.

Setting the first and second expressions equal to each other:

$\frac{m}{100} + 3 = - \frac{m}{100} - 1$.
Simplifying, we get $2m = -400$, which has no positive integer solutions for $m$.

Setting the first and third expressions equal to each other:

$\frac{m}{100} + 3 = 3 - \frac{m}{100}$.
Simplifying, we get $2m = 0$, which has no positive integer solutions for $m$.

Setting the first and fourth expressions equal to each other:

$\frac{m}{100} + 3 = -1 + \frac{m}{100}$.
Simplifying, we get $4 = 0$, which is a contradiction.

Setting the second and third expressions equal to each other:

$- \frac{m}{100} - 1 = 3 - \frac{m}{100}$.
Simplifying, we get $4 = 0$, which is a contradiction.

Setting the second and fourth expressions equal to each other:

$- \frac{m}{100} - 1 = -1 + \frac{m}{100}$.
Simplifying, we get $

Below is a math problem you are to solve (natural number answer):
"For how many positive integers $m$ does the equation \[\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}\] have $4$ distinct solutions?"
To accomplish this, first list the problem's constraints, conditions and related knowledge, and thens solve the problem step by step. Be clear so even an idiot can follow your instructions. After solving the problem, output the final numerical answer within \boxed{}.

Assistant:

 The problem states that the equation \[\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}\] has 4 distinct solutions. The right side of the equation is a fraction with a denominator of 100, and the value of the absolute value expression on the left side must be a non-negative number. This implies that $m$ must be a non-negative integer such that $\frac{m}{100} \geq 0$, which means $m \geq 0$.

The absolute value expression on the left side can be equal to a non-negative number in two ways:
1. When $\vert x-1 \vert -2$ is positive or zero, we have $\vert x-1 \vert -2 = \frac{m}{100}$.
2. When $\vert x-1 \vert -2$ is negative, we have $-( \vert x-1 \vert -2) = \frac{m}{100}$.

For the first case, we have $\vert x-1 \vert = 2 + \frac{m}{100}$. This gives us two equations:
- When $x-1 \geq 0$, we have $x-1 = 2 + \frac{m}{100}$, or $x = 3 + \frac{m}{100}$.
- When $x-1 < 0$, we have $-(x-1) = 2 + \frac{m}{100}$, or $x = -1 + \frac{m}{100}$.

For the second case, we have $\vert x-1 \vert = 2 - \frac{m}{100}$. This gives us two equations:
- When $x-1 \geq 0$, we have $x-1 = 2 - \frac{m}{100}$, or $x = 3 - \frac{m}{100}$.
- When $x-1 < 0$, we have $-(x-1) = 2 - \frac{m}{100}$, or $x = -1 - \frac{m}{100}$.

For the equation to have 4 distinct solutions, the four expressions for $x$ must be distinct. This means that the expressions $3 + \frac{m}{100}$, $-1 + \frac{m}{100}$, $3 - \frac{m}{100}$, and $-1 - \frac{m}{100}$ must all be distinct.

The expressions $3 + \frac{m}{100}$ and $3 - \frac{m}{100}$ can only be equal if $\frac{m}{100} = 0$, which implies $m = 0$. However, $m$ must be a positive integer, so this case is not possible.

The expressions $-1 + \frac{m}{100}$ and $-1 - \frac{m}{100}$ can only be equal if $\frac{m}{100} = 0$, which again implies $m = 0$. This is also not possible.

Therefore, for the equation to have 4 distinct solutions, the expressions $3 + \frac{m}{100}$, $-1 + \frac{m}{100}$, $3 - \frac{m}{100}$, and $-1 - \frac{m}{100}$ must be distinct. This implies that $\frac{m}{100}$ must be strictly greater than 1 for the expressions $3 + \frac{m}{100}$ and $3 - \frac{m}{100}$ to be distinct, and strictly less than 1 for the expressions $-1 + \frac{m}{100}$ and $-1 - \frac{m}{100}$ to be distinct. This is only possible when $\frac{m}{100} = 1$, which implies $m = 100$.

Therefore, the only positive integer value of $m$ for which the equation has 4 distinct solutions is $m = 100$. The answer is: $1$

Assistant:

 The equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has $4$ distinct solutions.

First, we notice that the right side of the equation, $\frac{m}{100}$, must be nonnegative, so $m$ must be a nonnegative integer.

Next, we consider the absolute value function $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert$. This function has a "V" shape with vertices at $x=1 \pm 2$, or $x=-1$ and $x=3$. The function is equal to $0$ at $x=1 \pm 2$, or $x=-1$ and $x=3$.

The equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has $4$ distinct solutions when the value $\frac{m}{100}$ is equal to the vertical distance between the "V" and the x-axis.

The maximum value of $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert$ is $2$, which occurs when $x$ is between $1-2= -1$ and $1+2=3$. The minimum value is $0$, which occurs when $x$ is $1-2=-1$ or $1+2=3$.

Therefore, the vertical distance between the "V" and the x-axis is $2-0=2$. To make $\frac{m}{100}=2$, we must have $m=200$.

So, there is only one value of $m$ for which the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has $4$ distinct solutions, and that value is $m=200$. The answer is: $1$

Assistant:

 The equation has four distinct solutions, which means that the right side of the equation, $\frac{m}{100}$, must be equal to the absolute value of a quantity that splits into two segments with a distance of 2 between them. This is because the graph of $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert$ consists of four segments with a distance of 2 between each pair of segments.
The only way for $\frac{m}{100}$ to be equal to this quantity is if $m$ is equal to 200 times the absolute value of the quantity inside the outermost absolute value in the equation.
The quantity $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert$ is equal to 2 when $\vert x-1 \vert -2 = \pm 2$.
Solving $\vert x-1 \vert -2 = 2$ gives $\vert x-1 \vert = 4$, so $x-1 = \pm 4$, which gives $x = 5$ or $x = -3$.
Solving $\vert x-1 \vert -2 = -2$ gives $\vert x-1 \vert = 0$, so $x = 1$.
Therefore, the four distinct solutions are $x = -3$, $x = 1$, $x = 5$, and the value of $m$ is $200 \times 2 = 400$.
The only positive integer value of $m$ for which the equation has four distinct solutions is $m = 400$.
The answer is: $1$
