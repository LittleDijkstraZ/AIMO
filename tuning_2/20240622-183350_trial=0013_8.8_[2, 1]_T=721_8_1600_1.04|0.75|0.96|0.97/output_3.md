Below is a math problem you are to solve (natural number answer):
"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"
To accomplish this, first list the problem's constraints, conditions and related knowledge, and thens solve the problem step by step. Be clear so even an idiot can follow your instructions. After solving the problem, output the final numerical answer within \boxed{}.

Assistant:

 The given equation is a product of two terms equal to zero, so either the first term is zero or the second term is zero. 

The first term is zero when $\vert x + y \vert - 10 = 0$ or $\vert x - y \vert - 10 = 0$. This gives us the equations $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$.

The second term is zero when $\vert x \vert - 8 = 0$ or $\vert y \vert - 8 = 0$, which gives us the equations $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$.

Solving these equations, we get the four lines $x + y = \pm 10$, $x - y = \pm 10$, $x = \pm 8$, and $y = \pm 8$.

The intersections of these lines form a square with side length 16. The area of this square is $16^2 = 256$.

So the area of the convex polygon is 256. The answer is: $256$

"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"

Assistant:

 The problem's constraints, conditions, and related knowledge are:

1. The equation is $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$.
2. The product of two numbers is zero if and only if at least one of the numbers is zero. Therefore, we have two cases:
   a. $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ or
   b. $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$.
3. In the first case, we have $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. This implies that $x + y = \pm 10$ and $x - y = \pm 10$. Solving these equations gives us four lines: $x + y = 10$, $x + y = -10$, $x - y = 10$, and $x - y = -10$. These lines form a square with side length 10.
4. In the second case, we have $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$. This implies that $x = \pm 8$ and $y = \pm 8$. Solving these equations gives us four lines: $x = 8$, $x = -8$, $y = 8$, and $y = -8$. These lines form a square with side length 16.
5. The convex polygon is the intersection of the squares formed by the two cases. The area of the intersection is the area of the smaller square with side length 10.

The area of the square with side length 10 is $10^2 = 100$. Therefore, the area of the convex polygon is 100. The answer is: $100$

Below is a math problem you are to solve (natural number answer):
"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"

Assistant:

 The problem's constraints, conditions, and related knowledge are as follows:

1. The equation $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ is true if and only if either of the two factors is equal to zero.

2. A factor of a product is zero if and only if the factor itself is zero.

3. Therefore, either $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$.

4. For a square to be zero, the expression inside the square must be zero.

5. Therefore, either $\vert x + y \vert - 10 = 0$ and $\vert x - y \vert - 10 = 0$ or $\vert x \vert - 8 = 0$ and $\vert y \vert - 8 = 0$.

6. Solving these equations, we get either $x + y = 10$ and $x - y = 10$ or $x = 8$ and $y = 8$.

7. The first set of equations can be solved to get $x = 10$ and $y = 0$, and the second set of equations gives $x = 8$ and $y = 8$.

8. These are the only possible solutions for the given constraints.

9. Therefore, the points that satisfy the equation are $(10, 0)$, $(0, 10)$, and $(8, 8)$.

10. These points form a triangle with vertices at $(10, 0)$, $(0, 10)$, and $(8, 8)$.

11. To find the area of this triangle, we can use the formula for the area of a triangle given the coordinates of its vertices: $\frac{1}{2} \vert x_1(y_2 - y_3) + x_2(y_3 - y_1) + x_3(y_1 - y_2) \vert$.

12. Substituting the coordinates of the vertices into the formula, we get $\frac{1}{2} \vert 10(10 - 8) + 0(8 - 0) + 8(0 - 10) \vert = \frac{1}{2} \vert 20 - 80 \vert = \frac{1}{2} \cdot 60 = 30$.

Therefore, the area of the convex polygon is 30 square units. The answer is: $30$

Assistant:

 The given equation is $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$. For the product of two numbers to be zero, either one of the numbers must be zero. Thus, we have two cases:

Case 1: $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$. This implies that both $\vert x + y \vert - 10 = 0$ and $\vert x - y \vert - 10 = 0$, so $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. Solving these equations gives us the constraints $x + y = \pm 10$ and $x - y = \pm 10$. These four lines are the sides of the square.

Case 2: $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$. This implies that both $\vert x \vert - 8 = 0$ and $\vert y \vert - 8 = 0$, so $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$. Solving these equations gives us the constraints $x = \pm 8$ and $y = \pm 8$. These four lines are the sides of the square.

The constraints from both cases form a square with side length 10. The area of this square is $10^2 = 100$. The answer is: $100$

"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"

Assistant:

 The problem's constraints are given by the equation
$$((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0.$$
This equation is satisfied if either of the two factors is zero. 

The first factor is zero if either $\vert x + y \vert - 10 = 0$ or $\vert x - y \vert - 10 = 0$. These equations simplify to $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$, respectively. These are the equations of two lines passing through the origin making an angle of 45 degrees with the x and y axes, respectively.

The second factor is zero if either $\vert x \vert - 8 = 0$ or $\vert y \vert - 8 = 0$. These equations simplify to $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$, respectively. These are the equations of two lines parallel to the y and x axes, respectively, at a distance of 8 units from the origin.

The intersection points of these lines are the vertices of the polygon. By drawing these lines, we find that the polygon is a square with side length 16. The area of this square is $16^2 = 256$. The answer is: $256$ square units.
The answer is: $256$

 The given equation is a product of two expressions equal to zero, which means either of the expressions must be zero. Therefore, we have two cases to consider:

Case 1: $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$.
In this case, both $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2$ and $( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2$ must be zero. This means that $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. This implies that $x + y = \pm 10$ and $x - y = \pm 10$. Solving these equations gives us four points: $(8,2)$, $(8,-2)$, $(-8,2)$, and $(-8,-2)$.

Case 2: $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$.
In this case, both $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2$ and $( \vert y \vert - 8)^2$ must be zero. This means that $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$. This implies that $x = \pm 8$ and $y = \pm 8$. Solving these equations gives us four more points: $(8,8)$, $(8,-8)$, $(-8,8)$, and $(-8,-8)$.

Combining the points from both cases, we find that the eight points $(8,2)$, $(8,-2)$, $(-8,2)$, $(-8,-2)$, $(8,8)$, $(8,-8)$, $(-8,8)$, and $(-8,-8)$ satisfy the equation. These points form a square with side length $16$. The area of this square is $16^2 = 256$.
The answer is: $256$

Below is a math problem you are to solve (natural number answer):
"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"

Assistant:

 The given equation is a product of two terms equal to zero, so either the first term is zero or the second term is zero. This gives us two sets of equations to solve:
1. $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ and $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$.
2. $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ and $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$.
For the first set of equations, we have $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x \vert = 8$. The absolute value equations can be split into two cases each:
Case 1.1: $x + y = 10$ and $x = 8$.
Case 1.2: $-(x + y) = 10$ and $x = -8$.
For the second set of equations, we have $\vert x - y \vert = 10$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$. Again, this gives us two cases each:
Case 2.1: $x - y = 10$ and $y = 8$.
Case 2.2: $-(x - y) = 10$ and $y = -8$.
Solving these cases, we get the following points:
For Case 1.1 and Case 2.1: $(8, 2)$.
For Case 1.2 and Case 2.2: $(-8, -2)$.
For Case 1.1 and Case 2.2: $(8, -2)$.
For Case 1.2 and Case 2.1: $(-8, 2)$.
These points form a square with side length 8, so the area of the square is $8^2 = 64$.
The answer is: $64$

 The given equation is a product of two terms equal to zero, which means either of the terms must be zero. So we have two cases:

Case 1: $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$.

For the first two terms, we have $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. This implies that $x + y = \pm 10$ and $x - y = \pm 10$. Solving these equations gives us the vertices of the polygon: $(8,2)$, $(8,-2)$, $(-8,2)$, and $(-8,-2)$.

For the last two terms, we have $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$. This implies that $x = \pm 8$ and $y = \pm 8$. Adding these to our list of vertices, we have $(8,2)$, $(8,-2)$, $(-8,2)$, $(-8,-2)$, $(8,8)$, $(8,-8)$, $(-8,8)$, and $(-8,-8)$.

Case 2: Either $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$.

But this case gives us the same vertices as in Case 1.

So the vertices of the polygon are $(8,2)$, $(8,-2)$, $(-8,2)$, $(-8,-2)$, $(8,8)$, $(8,-8)$, $(-8,8)$, and $(-8,-8)$. These vertices form a square with side length $16$. The area of a square is the side length squared, so the area of the polygon is $16^2 = 256$. The answer is: $256$
