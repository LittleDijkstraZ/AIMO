Below is a math problem you are to solve (natural number answer):
"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"
To accomplish this, first list the problem's constraints, conditions and related knowledge, and thens solve the problem step by step. Be clear so even an idiot can follow your instructions. After solving the problem, output the final numerical answer within \boxed{}.

Assistant:

 The problem's constraints are given by the equation:
$$((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0.$$
For the product of two factors to be zero, either one of the factors must be zero. This gives us two cases to consider:

Case 1: $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$.
This case implies that $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$.
The only way this can happen is if $x = \pm 10$ and $y = \pm 10$. So we have four points: $(10, 10)$, $(10, -10)$, $(-10, 10)$, and $(-10, -10)$.

Case 2: $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$.
This case implies that $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$.
The only way this can happen is if $x = \pm 8$ and $y = \pm 8$. So we have four more points: $(8, 8)$, $(8, -8)$, $(-8, 8)$, and $(-8, -8)$.

The eight points listed above form a square with side length $20$. The area of this square is $20^2 = 400$. Therefore, the area of the convex polygon is $400$. The answer is: $400$

Below is a math problem you are to solve (natural number answer!):
"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"
Analyze the problem and think step by step to come to a solution with programs. After solving the problem, output the final numerical answer within \boxed{}.

Assistant:

 The equation $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + (\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + (\vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ is satisfied if and only if at least one of the factors is zero. This means that either $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + (\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + (\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$.

The first equation is satisfied if and only if $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. This implies that $x + y = \pm 10$ and $x - y = \pm 10$, which gives us the four lines $x + y = 10$, $x + y = -10$, $x - y = 10$, and $x - y = -10$. The points satisfying this system of equations form a square with side length 10 and area $10^2 = 100$.

The second equation is satisfied if and only if $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$. This implies that $x = \pm 8$ and $y = \pm 8$, which gives us the four lines $x = 8$, $x = -8$, $y = 8$, and $y = -8$. The points satisfying this system of equations also form a square with side length 16 and area $16^2 = 256$.

However, the points satisfying both systems of equations are the vertices of the square formed by the lines $x + y = 10$, $x + y = -10$, $x - y = 10$, and $x - y = -10$. Therefore, the area of the convex polygon enclosed by the points satisfying the given equation is the area of this square, which is 100 square units.

Below is a math problem you are to solve (natural number answer):
"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"
To accomplish this, first list the problem's constraints, conditions and related knowledge, and thens solve the problem step by step. Be clear so even an idiot can follow your instructions. After solving the problem, output the final numerical answer within \boxed{}.

Assistant:

 The problem's constraints are given by the equation
\[((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0.\]
This equation is equal to zero if and only if at least one of the factors is equal to zero. Therefore, we have two cases to consider:

Case 1: $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$.
This equation is only possible if $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. This means that $x + y = \pm 10$ and $x - y = \pm 10$. Solving these equations gives us the vertices of the polygon: $(8, 2)$, $(8, -2)$, $(-8, 2)$, and $(-8, -2)$.

Case 2: $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$.
This equation is only possible if $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$. This means that $x = \pm 8$ and $y = \pm 8$. Solving these equations gives us the vertices of the polygon: $(8, 8)$, $(8, -8)$, $(-8, 8)$, and $(-8, -8)$.

The polygon formed by these vertices is a square with side length $16$. The area of a square is given by the square of the length of its side, so the area of this square is $16^2 = 256$.
The answer is: $256$

Assistant:

 The problem's constraints, conditions, and related knowledge are:

1. The equation is satisfied if either of the factors is zero.
2. $|x+y|$ and $|x-y|$ are always nonnegative, so for the first factor to be zero, both $|x+y|-10=0$ and $|x-y|-10=0$ must be true. This gives us $|x+y|=10$ and $|x-y|=10$.
3. Similarly, for the second factor to be zero, both $|x|-8=0$ and $|y|-8=0$ must be true. This gives us $|x|=8$ and $|y|=8$.
4. The solutions to $|x|=8$ are $x=8$ and $x=-8$, and the solutions to $|y|=8$ are $y=8$ and $y=-8$.
5. The system of equations $|x+y|=10$ and $|x-y|=10$ can be solved to give four points: $(8,2)$, $(8,-2)$, $(-8,2)$, and $(-8,-2)$.
6. The points $(8,2)$, $(8,-2)$, $(-8,2)$, and $(-8,-2)$ form a square with side length 10.
7. The area of a square is given by side length squared, so the area of this square is $10^2=100$.

Therefore, the area of the convex polygon formed by the points satisfying the given equation is 100. The answer is: $100$

Below is a math problem you are to solve (natural number answer):
"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"

Assistant:

 The problem's constraints, conditions, and related knowledge are:

1. The equation $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ must be satisfied for all points $(x, y)$ inside the polygon.
2. The area of the polygon is to be found.

Now, let's solve the problem step by step:

The product of two numbers is zero if and only if at least one of the numbers is zero. Therefore, the equation $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ is satisfied if either:

a) $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ or
b) $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$.

For a) to be true, we must have $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. This implies that $x + y = \pm 10$ and $x - y = \pm 10$. Solving these equations gives us the vertices of the square: $(8, 2)$, $(8, -2)$, $(-8, 2)$, and $(-8, -2)$.

For b) to be true, we must have $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$. This implies that $x = \pm 8$ and $y = \pm 8$. Solving these equations gives us the vertices of the square: $(8, 8)$, $(8, -8)$, $(-8, 8)$, and $(-8, -8)$.

Combining the two sets of vertices, we find that the polygon is a 8x8 square. The area of a square is the side length squared, so the area of this square is $8^2 = 64$.
The answer is: $64$

"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"

Assistant:

 The problem's constraints, conditions, and related knowledge are as follows:

1. The expression $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ must hold for all points $(x, y)$ in the polygon.
2. The expression can be equal to zero if either of the two factors is zero.
3. If the first factor is zero, then either $\vert x + y \vert - 10 = 0$ or $\vert x - y \vert - 10 = 0$. This means $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ or $\vert x - y \vert = 10$.
4. If the second factor is zero, then either $\vert x \vert - 8 = 0$ or $\vert y \vert - 8 = 0$, which means $\vert x \vert = 8$ or $\vert y \vert = 8$.
5. Solving the above equations, we find that the points $(x, y)$ must satisfy one of the following conditions:
   a. $x + y = \pm 10$ or $x + y = \mp 10$.
   b. $x - y = \pm 10$ or $x - y = \mp 10$.
   c. $x = \pm 8$ or $x = \mp 8$.
   d. $y = \pm 8$ or $y = \mp 8$.
6. The points satisfying these conditions form a square with side length 16.

Now, let's solve the problem step by step:

1. From the conditions above, we know that the points $(x, y)$ that satisfy the equation form a square with side length 16.
2. The area of a square is given by the square of the length of its side, so the area of this square is $16^2 = 256$.

Therefore, the area of the convex polygon is 256. The answer is: $256$

Below is a math problem you are to solve (natural number answer):
"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"

Assistant:

 The problem's constraints, conditions and related knowledge are:

1. The equation $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ must hold for all points $(x, y)$ inside the polygon.
2. The equation equals zero if and only if either of the two factors equals zero.
3. The factors are products of two quadratic equations. Each quadratic equation equals zero if and only if its argument (the expression inside the absolute value) equals zero or is undefined.
4. The absolute value of a number is undefined if the number is undefined. In this problem, the variables $x$ and $y$ are real numbers, so their absolute values are defined.
5. Therefore, each factor equals zero if and only if the argument of one of the quadratic equations equals zero.
6. For the first factor, $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$. This simplifies to $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ or $\vert x - y \vert = 10$.
7. For the second factor, $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$. This simplifies to $\vert x \vert = 8$ or $\vert y \vert = 8$.
8. The absolute value of a number equals that number or the negation of the number. So the above equations simplify to $x + y = \pm 10$, $x - y = \pm 10$, $x = \pm 8$, and $y = \pm 8$.
9. Solving these equations gives the vertices of the polygon: $(8, 2)$, $(8, -2)$, $(-8, 2)$, $(-8, -2)$, $(2, 8)$, $(-2, 8)$, $(2, -8)$, and $(-2, -8)$.
10. The polygon is a square with side length 16 (the distance between any two adjacent vertices).
11. The area of a square is the side length squared. So the area of this square is $16^2 = 256$.

So the area of the convex polygon is 256 square units. The answer is: $256$

 The problem's constraints, conditions and related knowledge are:

1. The equation $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + (\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + (\vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ is true if and only if both of its factors are equal to zero.
2. A product is zero if and only if at least one of its factors is zero.
3. $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2$ and $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2$ are both squares, so they are both nonnegative. Therefore, they can only be zero if $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$.
4. Similarly, $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2$ and $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2$ are both squares, so they are both nonnegative. Therefore, they can only be zero if $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$.
5. Solving $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$ gives us the lines $x + y = 10$ and $x - y = 10$, and their reflections across the x and y axes.
6. Solving $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$ gives us the lines $x = 8$ and $x = -8$, and their reflections across the x and y axes.
7. The intersection of these lines forms a square with side length 10.
8. The area of this square is $10^2 = 100$.

So, the area of the convex polygon is 100. The answer is: $100$
