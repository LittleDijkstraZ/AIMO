The equation \[\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}\] has 4 distinct solutions.

The expression $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert$ can take on a value of $k/100$ for $k = 0, 1, 2, \dots, 100$.

If $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert = 0/100$, then $\vert x-1 \vert = 2$, which gives $x = 3$ or $x = -1$.

If $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert = 1/100$, then $\vert x-1 \vert = 3$ or $\vert x-1 \vert = 1$. The former gives $x = 4$ or $x = -2$, and the latter gives $x = 2$ or $x = 0$.

If $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert = 2/100$, then $\vert x-1 \vert = 4$ or $\vert x-1 \vert = 0$. The former gives $x = 5$ or $x = -3$, and the latter gives $x = 1$.

If $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert = 3/100$, then there are no solutions.

So, the values of $m$ that give 4 distinct solutions are $1, 2, \dots, 100$. There are 100 such values. The answer is: $100$.

 The problem is asking for how many positive integers $m$ the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has $4$ distinct solutions.

The equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ is a double absolute value equation. The graph of $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert$ is a V-shape with four segments, each of which is a line segment of slope $\pm1$. The equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has $4$ distinct solutions if and only if the value $\frac{m}{100}$ is the vertical distance from the origin to one of the "corners" of the V-shape.

The "corners" of the V-shape occur at $x=1\pm2$, which are $x=-1$ and $x=3$. The vertical distance from the origin to $x=-1$ is $3$, and the vertical distance from the origin to $x=3$ is also $3$. So, the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has $4$ distinct solutions if and only if $\frac{m}{100}=3$, which gives $m=300$.

Therefore, there is only one positive integer $m$ for which the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has $4$ distinct solutions, and that integer is $m=300$. The answer is: $1$

 The equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has $4$ distinct solutions. We need to find the value of $m$ that satisfies this condition.

First, let's consider the right side of the equation, $\frac{m}{100}$. Since $m$ is a positive integer, $\frac{m}{100}$ is a positive fraction.

Now let's consider the left side of the equation, $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert$. This expression represents the absolute value of the difference between the absolute value of $x-1$ and $2$. This expression will be equal to a positive number if and only if the difference between the absolute value of $x-1$ and $2$ is greater than $0$.

The expression $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert$ will be equal to $4$ if and only if the absolute value of $x-1$ is equal to $2+ \frac{m}{100}$ or $2 - \frac{m}{100}$. This gives us two equations to solve:

1. $x-1 = 2 + \frac{m}{100} + k$, where $k$ is an integer that takes on the values of $0$ or $1$ depending on whether the inner absolute value is positive or negative.
2. $x-1 = 2 - \frac{m}{100} + l$, where $l$ is an integer that takes on the values of $0$ or $1$ depending on whether the inner absolute value is positive or negative.

Solving these equations gives us:

1. $x = 3 + \frac{m}{100} + k$
2. $x = 1 - \frac{m}{100} + l$

For these equations to have $4$ distinct solutions, the sum of the slopes of the lines given by these equations must be non-zero. This means that $\frac{m}{100} + k \neq -\frac{m}{100} - l$. Simplifying this gives $2\frac{m}{100} \neq l - k$.

Since $l$ and $k$ can only take on the values of $0$ or $1$, the only way for this equation to be true is if $\frac{m}{100} \neq 0.5$. This means that $\frac{m}{100}$ must be an integer that is less than $0.5$ or greater than $1.5$. The only such integer is $1$. Therefore, $m = 100$.

To check this solution, we can substitute $m = 100$ back into the original equation and see if it has $4$ distinct solutions. Doing this, we find that the equation becomes $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{1}{1}$, which simplifies to $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=1$. This equation has $4$ distinct solutions: $x = 0, 1, 3, 4$. Therefore, the value of $m$ that satisfies the given condition is $m = 100$. The answer is: $100$

Assistant:

 The problem asks for how many positive integers $m$ does the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ have $4$ distinct solutions.

The equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has $4$ distinct solutions if and only if $\frac{m}{100}$ is strictly between $0$ and $2$, because the expression on the left-hand side of the equation can take on any value between $0$ and $2$. This is because the absolute value of a quantity can never be negative, and the absolute value of the absolute value of a quantity is always nonnegative. So, the quantity inside the absolute value, $\vert x-1 \vert -2$, can range from $-2$ to $2$. Thus, $\vert x-1 \vert$ can range from $0$ to $4$, which means $x$ can range from $1$ to $5$. So, $\frac{m}{100}$ must be strictly between $0$ and $2$.

Multiplying all sides of the inequality $0 < \frac{m}{100} < 2$ by $100$, we get $0 < m < 200$. The positive integers $m$ that satisfy this inequality are the integers from $1$ to $199$.

Now, we need to count how many of these integers make the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ have $4$ distinct solutions. Since $\frac{m}{100}$ must be strictly between $0$ and $2$, the number of such integers $m$ is simply the number of integers from $1$ to $199$.

Therefore, the number of positive integers $m$ for which the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has $4$ distinct solutions is $199$. The answer is: $199$

Assistant:

 The equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has $4$ distinct solutions.

First, let's consider the right side of the equation. Since $\frac{m}{100}$ is positive, $m$ must be positive. Also, for the equation to have $4$ distinct solutions, $\frac{m}{100}$ must be less than $2$ but greater than or equal to $0$. This is because the absolute value function $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert$ varies between $0$ and $2$. Therefore, $0 \leq \frac{m}{100} < 2$, which gives $0 \leq m < 200$.

Now, let's consider the left side of the equation. The equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ can be rewritten as four separate equations:
1. $\vert x-1 \vert -2 = \frac{m}{100}$, when $x-1 \geq 2$, or $x \geq 3$.
2. $\vert x-1 \vert -2 = -\frac{m}{100}$, when $x-1 \geq 2$, or $x \geq 3$.
3. $-\vert x-1 \vert +2 = \frac{m}{100}$, when $x-1 < -2$, or $x < -1$.
4. $-\vert x-1 \vert +2 = -\frac{m}{100}$, when $x-1 < -2$, or $x < -1$.

For each of these equations, we can solve for $x$ and find the number of distinct solutions. However, since the main focus is on the value of $m$, we can observe that the number of distinct solutions for each equation depends on the value of $\frac{m}{100}$.

For example, in equation 1, the number of distinct solutions is determined by the number of times the graph of $\vert x-1 \vert -2$ intersects the graph of $\frac{m}{100}$. This happens when $\frac{m}{100}$ is an integer. Therefore, the value of $m$ must be a multiple of $100$.

Similarly, for equation 2, the number of distinct solutions is determined by the number of times the graph of $\vert x-1 \vert -2$ intersects the graph of $-\frac{m}{100}$. This happens when $-\frac{m}{100}$ is an integer, or equivalently, when $\frac{m}{100}$ is an integer. Therefore, the value of $m$ must be a multiple of $100$ again.

For equation 3 and equation 4, the number of distinct solutions is determined by the number of times the graph of $-\vert x-1 \vert +2$ intersects the graph of $\frac{m}{100}$ and $-\frac{m}{100}$, respectively. However, these equations do not give any new restrictions on the value of $m$.

Therefore, the only values of $m$ that give $4$ distinct solutions are the multiples of $100$ in the range $0 \leq m < 200$. The multiples of $100$ in this range are $100$ and $200$. However, $200$ is not in the range $0 \leq m < 200$. Therefore, the only value of $m$ that works is $100$.

So, there is only $1$ positive integer $m$ that makes the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ have $4$ distinct solutions. The answer is: $1$.
The answer is: $1$

Assistant:

 The problem asks for the number of positive integers $m$ such that the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has 4 distinct solutions.

First, we note that the right-hand side of the equation, $\frac{m}{100}$, must be positive, which implies that $m$ must be a positive integer.

Next, we consider the absolute value expression on the left-hand side. The expression inside the absolute value, $\vert x-1 \vert -2$, can be either positive or negative. This gives us two cases to consider:

Case 1: $\vert x-1 \vert -2 \geq 0$. In this case, the equation becomes $\vert x-1 \vert -2 = \frac{m}{100}$. This simplifies to $\vert x-1 \vert = 2 + \frac{m}{100}$. The absolute value equation has two sub-cases:

Sub-case 1.1: $x-1 \geq 0$, which gives $x-1 = 2 + \frac{m}{100}$, or $x = 3 + \frac{m}{100}$.

Sub-case 1.2: $x-1 < 0$, which gives $-(x-1) = 2 + \frac{m}{100}$, or $x = -1 + \frac{m}{100}$.

Case 2: $\vert x-1 \vert -2 < 0$. In this case, the equation becomes $-\vert x-1 \vert +2 = \frac{m}{100}$, or $\vert x-1 \vert = 2 - \frac{m}{100}$. This absolute value equation has two sub-cases:

Sub-case 2.1: $x-1 \geq 0$, which gives $x-1 = 2 - \frac{m}{100}$, or $x = 3 - \frac{m}{100}$.

Sub-case 2.2: $x-1 < 0$, which gives $-(x-1) = 2 - \frac{m}{100}$, or $x = -1 - \frac{m}{100}$.

In total, we have 4 equations for $x$:

1. $x = 3 + \frac{m}{100}$
2. $x = -1 + \frac{m}{100}$
3. $x = 3 - \frac{m}{100}$
4. $x = -1 - \frac{m}{100}$

For these equations to have 4 distinct solutions, the slopes of the lines given by the right-hand sides of the equations must be different. This means that the four fractions $\frac{m}{100}$ must be different. Since $m$ is a positive integer, the four values of $\frac{m}{100}$ must be different positive fractions. The only way this can happen is if $m$ is a multiple of 100. The smallest positive multiple of 100 is 100, and the largest value of $m$ that gives 4 distinct solutions is 9900 (since $\frac{9900}{100} = 99$, which is the largest value for $\frac{m}{100}$ to result in 4 distinct solutions). Therefore, the possible values of $m$ are the multiples of 100 from 100 to 9900, inclusive. The number of such multiples is the number of integers from 1 to 99, inclusive. This is given by the formula for the number of integers in an arithmetic sequence: $\frac{99 - 1 + 1}{1} = 99$.

Therefore, the number of positive integers $m$ such that the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has 4 distinct solutions is 99. The answer is: $99$

Assistant:

 The equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has 4 distinct solutions. This means that the right side of the equation, $\frac{m}{100}$, must be a value that splits the number line into 4 segments, each containing one of the solutions.

The expression $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert$ is a piecewise function that can take on values from 0 to 3. This is because the absolute value function makes the expression nonnegative, and the inner absolute value makes the minimum value of the expression 2 - 1 = 1, and the maximum value is 2 + 1 = 3.

So, for the equation to have 4 distinct solutions, $\frac{m}{100}$ must be in the interval (1, 3). This means that 1 < $\frac{m}{100}$ < 3.

Multiplying all sides of the inequalities by 100, we get 100 < m < 300. The positive integers m that satisfy this inequality are the integers from 101 to 299, inclusive.

To find the number of such integers, we subtract the smallest integer in the range from the largest integer in the range and add 1. So, the number of positive integers m is 299 - 101 + 1 = 199.
The answer is: $199$

Assistant:

 The equation has 4 distinct solutions. The equation is of the form $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$.

We know that the absolute value function $\vert x \vert$ is a piecewise function defined as $x$ if $x \geq 0$ and $-x$ if $x < 0$. Therefore, the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ can be broken down into two cases:

Case 1: $\vert x-1 \vert -2 = \frac{m}{100}$
Case 2: $-\vert x-1 \vert +2 = \frac{m}{100}$

Now we solve each case separately:

Case 1: $\vert x-1 \vert -2 = \frac{m}{100}$
This can be further broken down into two sub-cases:

Sub-case 1.1: $x-1 -2 = \frac{m}{100}$, which simplifies to $x-3 = \frac{m}{100}$, and further simplifies to $x = \frac{m}{100} + 3$.

Sub-case 1.2: $-(x-1) -2 = \frac{m}{100}$, which simplifies to $-x+1 -2 = \frac{m}{100}$, and further simplifies to $-x -1 = \frac{m}{100}$, and then to $x = - \frac{m}{100} - 1$.

Case 2: $-\vert x-1 \vert +2 = \frac{m}{100}$
This can be further broken down into two sub-cases:

Sub-case 2.1: $-(x-1) +2 = \frac{m}{100}$, which simplifies to $-x+1 +2 = \frac{m}{100}$, and further simplifies to $-x +3 = \frac{m}{100}$, and then to $x = 3 - \frac{m}{100}$.

Sub-case 2.2: $-( -(x-1) ) +2 = \frac{m}{100}$, which simplifies to $x-1 +2 = \frac{m}{100}$, and further simplifies to $x +1 = \frac{m}{100}$, and then to $x = \frac{m}{100} - 1$.

So, the four distinct solutions are:
\[x = \frac{m}{100} + 3, \quad x = - \frac{m}{100} - 1, \quad x = 3 - \frac{m}{100}, \quad x = \frac{m}{100} - 1.\]

For these four solutions to be distinct, we must have $\frac{m}{100} + 3 \neq - \frac{m}{100} - 1$, $\frac{m}{100} + 3 \neq 3 - \frac{m}{100}$, $\frac{m}{100} + 3 \neq \frac{m}{100} - 1$, $- \frac{m}{100} - 1 \neq 3 - \frac{m}{100}$, $- \frac{m}{100} - 1 \neq \frac{m}{100} - 1$, $3 - \frac{m}{100} \neq \frac{m}{100} - 1$.

After solving these inequalities, we find that $m$ must be in the range $50 < m < 150$. The positive integer values of $m$ in this range are 51, 52, ..., 149, making 99 possible values for $m$.

However, we also need the four solutions to be distinct real numbers. This happens when the denominators of the fractions in the solutions are non-zero. This is true for all values of $m$ except when $m = 0$. Therefore, $m$ cannot be zero.

So, the values of $m$ for which the equation has 4 distinct solutions are the positive integers from 51 to 149, excluding zero. There are 98 such values. However, since we are asked for the number of positive integers $m$, we must include $m = 1$.

Therefore, the number of positive integers $m$ for which the equation has 4 distinct solutions is 99. The answer is: $99$
