Below is a math problem you are to solve (natural number answer):
"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"
To accomplish this, first list the problem's constraints, conditions and related knowledge, and thens solve the problem step by step. Be clear so even an idiot can follow your instructions. After solving the problem, output the final numerical answer within \boxed{}.

Assistant:

 The problem's constraints, conditions, and related knowledge are:

1. The equation is satisfied if either of the factors is zero.
2. The absolute value function $|x|$ is equal to $x$ if $x \geq 0$ and $-x$ if $x < 0$.
3. The area of a polygon can be found by dividing it into triangles and summing the areas of those triangles.

Now, let's solve the problem step by step:

Step 1: Find the conditions for which each factor is zero.

For the first factor, we have:
$$((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2) = 0.$$
This is only possible if both $(\vert x + y \vert - 10) = 0$ and $(\vert x - y \vert - 10) = 0$. This implies that $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$.

For the second factor, we have:
$$((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0.$$
This is only possible if both $(\vert x \vert - 8) = 0$ and $(\vert y \vert - 8) = 0$. This implies that $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$.

Step 2: Solve the conditions for $x$ and $y$.

For the first factor, we have:
$$\vert x + y \vert = 10 \Rightarrow x + y = \pm 10.$$
$$\vert x - y \vert = 10 \Rightarrow x - y = \pm 10.$$
Solving these equations, we get four possible pairs of $(x, y)$: $(5, 5), (5, -5), (-5, 5), (-5, -5)$.

For the second factor, we have:
$$\vert x \vert = 8 \Rightarrow x = \pm 8.$$
$$\vert y \vert = 8 \Rightarrow y = \pm 8.$$
So, the four possible pairs of $(x, y)$ are $(8, 8), (8, -8), (-8, 8), (-8, -8)$.

Step 3: Identify the vertices of the polygon.

The eight points $(x, y)$ from steps 1 and 2 are the vertices of the polygon: $(5, 5), (5, -5), (-5, 5), (-5, -5), (8, 8), (8, -8), (-8, 8), (-8, -8)$.

Step 4: Calculate the area of the polygon.

The polygon is a square with side length 10 units (the distance between the points $(5, 5)$ and $(5, -5)$ or $(8, 8)$ and $(8, -8)$, for example). The area of a square is the side length squared, so the area of the polygon is $10^2 = 100$ square units.
The answer is: $100$

Below is a math problem you are to solve (natural number answer):
"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"

Assistant:

 The problem's constraints, conditions and related knowledge are:
1. The equation is satisfied if either of the factors is zero.
2. The absolute value function $|x|$ is equal to $x$ if $x \geq 0$, and $-x$ if $x < 0$.

Now, let's solve the problem step by step:

Step 1: Solve the equations

If either of the factors is zero, we can solve for the values of $x$ and $y$ that make each factor zero.

For the first factor, we have:
$$(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0 \Rightarrow \vert x + y \vert = 10.$$
This implies that $x + y = 10$ or $x + y = -10$.

For the second factor, we have:
$$(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0 \Rightarrow \vert x - y \vert = 10.$$
This implies that $x - y = 10$ or $x - y = -10$.

For the third factor, we have:
$$(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0 \Rightarrow \vert x \vert = 8.$$
This implies that $x = 8$ or $x = -8$.

For the fourth factor, we have:
$$(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0 \Rightarrow \vert y \vert = 8.$$
This implies that $y = 8$ or $y = -8$.

Step 2: Analyze the solutions

By analyzing the solutions from step 1, we can see that the points that satisfy the equation are:
- $(8, 2)$, $(8, -2)$, $(-8, 2)$, $(-8, -2)$, $(2, 8)$, $(2, -8)$, $(-2, 8)$, and $(-2, -8)$.

Step 3: Plot the points

Plotting these points on a coordinate plane, we can see that they form a square with side length 16.

Step 4: Calculate the area of the square

The area of a square is given by the formula $s^2$, where $s$ is the side length. In this case, the side length is 16, so the area of the square is $16^2 = 256$.

Therefore, the area of the convex polygon is 256 square units. The answer is: $256$

Below is a math problem you are to solve (natural number answer!):
"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"
Analyze the problem and think step by step to come to a solution with programs. After solving the problem, output the final numerical answer within \boxed{}.

Assistant:

 The given equation is a product of two terms equal to zero, so either the first term is zero or the second term is zero.

The first term is zero when either $|x+y| - 10 = 0$ or $|x-y| - 10 = 0$, which simplifies to $|x+y| = 10$ or $|x-y| = 10$. These are the equations of two lines passing through the origin with slopes $+1$ and $-1$.

The second term is zero when either $|x| - 8 = 0$ or $|y| - 8 = 0$, which simplifies to $|x| = 8$ or $|y| = 8$. These are the equations of two lines parallel to the y-axis at $x = \pm 8$ and two lines parallel to the x-axis at $y = \pm 8$.

The four lines intersect at the points $(8,8)$, $(8,-8)$, $(-8,8)$, and $(-8,-8)$. These points form a rectangle with side lengths $16$ and $16$, so the area of the rectangle is $16 \times 16 = 256$. The answer is: $256$

Below is a math problem you are to solve (natural number answer):
"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"
To accomplish this, first list the problem's constraints, conditions and related knowledge, and thens solve the problem step by step. Be clear so even an idiot can follow your instructions. After solving the problem, output the final numerical answer within \boxed{}.

Assistant:

 The problem's constraints, conditions, and related knowledge are as follows:

1. The expression $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ must hold for points $(x, y)$ inside the polygon.
2. The absolute value function $\vert x \vert$ is defined as $x$ if $x \geq 0$, and $-x$ if $x < 0$.
3. The area of a polygon can be found using the shoelace formula.

Now, let's solve the problem step by step:

The expression $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ is equal to zero if either of the two factors is zero. This gives us two sets of equations to solve:

1. $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0 \implies \vert x + y \vert = 10 \implies x + y = \pm 10$.
2. $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0 \implies \vert x - y \vert = 10 \implies x - y = \pm 10$.
3. $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0 \implies \vert x \vert = 8 \implies x = \pm 8$.
4. $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0 \implies \vert y \vert = 8 \implies y = \pm 8$.

The solutions to these equations are the vertices of the polygon:

1. $(8, 2), (8, -2), (-8, 2), (-8, -2)$.
2. $(2, 8), (2, -8), (-2, 8), (-2, -8)$.

Now, we can apply the shoelace formula to find the area of the polygon. The shoelace formula states that if the vertices of a polygon are $(x_1, y_1), (x_2, y_2), ..., (x_n, y_n)$, then the area of the polygon is given by:

$$\frac{1}{2} \left| \sum_{i=1}^{n} x_i y_{i+1} - x_{i+1} y_i \right|$$

where the indices are taken modulo $n$.

For the given polygon, with vertices $(8, 2), (8, -2), (-8, 2), (-8, -2), (2, 8), (2, -8), (-2, 8), (-2, -8)$, the area is:

$$\frac{1}{2} \left| (8 \cdot 2 + 8 \cdot -2 + -8 \cdot 2 + -8 \cdot -2 + 2 \cdot 8 + 2 \cdot -8 + -2 \cdot 8 + -2 \cdot -8) - (2 \cdot 8 + -2 \cdot 8 + 8 \cdot -2 + -8 \cdot -2 + 8 \cdot 2 + -8 \cdot 2 + 2 \cdot -2 + -2 \cdot 2) \right|$$

Simplifying the expression, we get:

$$\frac{1}{2} \left| (16 - 16 - 16 + 16 + 16 - 16 - 16 + 16) - (16 - 16 - 16 + 16 + 16 - 16 - 16 + 16) \right| = 0$$

However, this result is incorrect. The shoelace formula gives the area of a polygon with the given vertices, but the vertices do not form a polygon with zero area.

To find the correct area, we can observe that the polygon is a square with side length 16. The area of the square is $16^2 = 256$.

Therefore, the area of the convex polygon is 256. The answer is: $256$

Below is a math problem you are to solve (natural number answer):
"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"

Assistant:

 The given equation is $ ((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$.

For the product of two numbers to be zero, either one of the numbers must be zero. So, we have two cases to consider:

1. $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$.
2. $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$.

From case 1, we have $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. This gives us four equations: $x + y = 10$, $x + y = -10$, $x - y = 10$, and $x - y = -10$. Solving these equations gives us the vertices of the square: $(8, 2)$, $(8, -18)$, $(-18, -18)$, and $(-18, 2)$.

From case 2, we have $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$. This gives us four more vertices: $(8, 8)$, $(8, -8)$, $(-8, -8)$, and $(-8, 8)$.

Plotting these points on a coordinate plane, we can see that they form a square with side length $20$. The area of this square is $20^2 = 400$. So, the area of the convex polygon is $400$. The answer is: $400$

Below is a math problem you are to solve (natural number answer):
"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"

Assistant:

 The problem's constraints are as follows:

1. The equation is satisfied if either of the factors is equal to zero.
2. The absolute value function $|x|$ is equal to $x$ if $x \geq 0$ and $-x$ if $x < 0$.

Now, let's solve the problem step by step:

Step 1: Set each factor equal to zero and solve for the possible values of $x$ and $y$.

For the first factor, we have:

$$((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2) = 0.$$

This equation is satisfied if both $(\vert x + y \vert - 10) = 0$ and $(\vert x - y \vert - 10) = 0$. Solving these equations, we get:

$$\vert x + y \vert = 10 \quad \text{and} \quad \vert x - y \vert = 10.$$

This implies that $x + y = \pm 10$ and $x - y = \pm 10$. Solving these systems of equations, we find the possible pairs $(x, y)$ to be:

$$(5, 5), (-5, -5), (5, -5), (-5, 5).$$

For the second factor, we have:

$$((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0.$$

This equation is satisfied if both $(\vert x \vert - 8) = 0$ and $(\vert y \vert - 8) = 0$. Solving these equations, we get:

$$\vert x \vert = 8 \quad \text{and} \quad \vert y \vert = 8.$$

This implies that $x = \pm 8$ and $y = \pm 8$. So the possible pairs $(x, y)$ are:

$$(8, 8), (-8, -8), (8, -8), (-8, 8).$$

Step 2: Identify the points that satisfy both factors.

Comparing the possible pairs from both factors, we see that the only points that satisfy both factors are:

$$(8, 8), (-8, -8), (8, -8), (-8, 8).$$

These points form a square with side length $16$.

Step 3: Calculate the area of the square.

The area of a square is given by the formula $s^2$, where $s$ is the side length. So the area of this square is $16^2 = 256$.

Therefore, the area of the convex polygon is $256$. The answer is: $256$
