Below is a math problem you are to solve (natural number answer):
"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"

Assistant:

 The given equation is $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$. The product of two numbers is zero if and only if at least one of the numbers is zero. This gives us two cases to consider:

1. $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$.
2. $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$.

For the first case, $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$, we have $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. This means that the points $(x, y)$ must lie on the lines $x + y = 10$ and $x - y = 10$. These lines intersect at $(5, 5)$, forming a square with side length $10$.

For the second case, $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$, we have $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$, which means $x = \pm 8$ and $y = \pm 8$. This forms a square with side length $16$.

The area of the convex polygon formed by the intersection of the two squares is the area of the smaller square, which has side length $10$. Therefore, the area of the convex polygon is $10^2 = 100$. The answer is: $100$

Below is a math problem you are to solve (natural number answer!):
"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"
Analyze the problem and think step by step to come to a solution with programs. After solving the problem, output the final numerical answer within \boxed{}.

Assistant:

 The problem is asking for the area of the convex polygon that is enclosed by the points that satisfy the equation.
The equation is: $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$.
For the product of two factors to be zero, either one of the factors must be zero.
This means that either $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$.
The first factor being zero implies that $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$, which is only possible when $x = 0$ and $y = 0$.
The second factor being zero implies that $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$, which means $x = 8$ or $x = -8$ and $y = 8$ or $y = -8$.
This results in a square with side length of 16 units.
The area of the square is $16^2 = 256$ square units.
So, the area of the convex polygon is 256 square units. The answer is: $256$

Below is a math problem you are to solve (natural number answer):
"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"

Assistant:

 The problem's constraints, conditions and related knowledge are as follows:

The equation $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ implies that either $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$.

If $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$, then $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$, which implies that $x + y = \pm 10$ and $x - y = \pm 10$. Solving these equations, we get the four lines $x + y = 10$, $x + y = -10$, $x - y = 10$, and $x - y = -10$.

If $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$, then $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$, which implies that $x = \pm 8$ and $y = \pm 8$. This gives us the four lines $x = 8$, $x = -8$, $y = 8$, and $y = -8$.

The intersection of these lines forms a square with side length 16. The area of this square is $16^2 = 256$. The answer is: $256$.

Below is a math problem you are to solve (natural number answer):
"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"
To accomplish this, first list the problem's constraints, conditions and related knowledge, and thens solve the problem step by step. Be clear so even an idiot can follow your instructions. After solving the problem, output the final numerical answer within \boxed{}.

Assistant:

 The problem's constraints, conditions and related knowledge are:

1. The equation $AB = 0$ is equivalent to $A = 0$ or $B = 0$.
2. $\vert x \vert$ denotes the absolute value of $x$.
3. The area of a square with side length $s$ is $s^2$.

Now, let's solve the problem step by step.

Given the equation
\[((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0,\]
from the first constraint, this is equivalent to
\[((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2) = 0 \quad \text{or} \quad ((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0.\]

From the second constraint, we know that $\vert x + y \vert \geq 0$, $\vert x - y \vert \geq 0$, $\vert x \vert \geq 0$, and $\vert y \vert \geq 0$. Therefore, the only way for the product of two nonnegative numbers to be zero is if one of them is zero.

So, we have two cases to consider:

Case 1: $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$. This implies that $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. This means that the points $(x, y)$ are located on a square with side length 20.

Case 2: $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$. This implies that $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$. This means that the points $(x, y)$ are located on a square with side length 16.

The intersection of these two cases is the set of points $(x, y)$ that satisfy both conditions. This is the convex polygon enclosed by the points.

The area of the square from Case 1 is $20^2 = 400$, and the area of the square from Case 2 is $16^2 = 256$.

The convex polygon is the intersection of these two squares, so its area is the smaller of the two areas, which is $256$. The answer is: $256$

Below is a math problem you are to solve (natural number answer):
"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"
To accomplish this, first list the problem's constraints, conditions and related knowledge, and thens solve the problem step by step. Be clear so even an idiot can follow your instructions. After solving the problem, output the final numerical answer within \boxed{}.

Assistant:

 The problem's constraints, conditions and related knowledge are:
1. The equation is equal to zero if and only if both factors are equal to zero.
2. $|x+y|$ and $|x-y|$ are always greater than or equal to zero.
3. $|x|$ and $|y|$ are also always greater than or equal to zero.

Now, let's solve the problem step by step:

Step 1: Set each factor equal to zero and solve for the corresponding variables.

For the first factor:
$$((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2) = 0.$$
This implies that $\vert x + y \vert - 10 = 0$ and $\vert x - y \vert - 10 = 0$. So, $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$.

For the second factor:
$$((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0.$$
This implies that $\vert x \vert - 8 = 0$ and $\vert y \vert - 8 = 0$. So, $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$.

Step 2: Solve the equations from step 1.

For $\vert x + y \vert = 10$, the possible solutions are:
$$x + y = 10, \quad x + y = -10.$$

For $\vert x - y \vert = 10$, the possible solutions are:
$$x - y = 10, \quad x - y = -10.$$

For $\vert x \vert = 8$, the possible solutions are:
$$x = 8, \quad x = -8.$$

For $\vert y \vert = 8$, the possible solutions are:
$$y = 8, \quad y = -8.$$

Step 3: List all the possible combinations of the solutions from step 2 and find the vertices of the polygon.

The possible combinations are:
$$(x, y) = (8, 2), (8, -2), (2, 8), (-2, 8), (8, -8), (-8, 2), (-8, -2), (2, -8), (-2, -8).$$
These points are the vertices of the polygon.

Step 4: Calculate the area of the polygon.

The polygon is a square with side length 16 (from the points $(8, 2)$ to $(8, -2)$ or from $(2, 8)$ to $(-2, 8)$). The area of a square is side length squared, so the area of this square is $16^2 = 256$.

Therefore, the area of the convex polygon is 256 square units. The answer is: $256$
