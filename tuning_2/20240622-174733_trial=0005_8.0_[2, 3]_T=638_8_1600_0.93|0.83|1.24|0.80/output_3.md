Assistant:

 The given equation is equal to zero if either of the factors is zero.
The first factor is zero when $|x+y| = 10$ or $|x-y| = 10$.
The second factor is zero when $|x| = 8$ or $|y| = 8$.
The points satisfying $|x+y| = 10$ are a square with side length 10, centered at the origin.
The points satisfying $|x-y| = 10$ are a square with side length 10, centered at the origin, but rotated 45 degrees.
The points satisfying $|x| = 8$ are a square with side length 16, centered at the origin, but along the x-axis.
The points satisfying $|y| = 8$ are a square with side length 16, centered at the origin, but along the y-axis.
The intersection of all these squares forms a square with side length 8.
The area of this square is $8^2 = 64$.
So, the area of the convex polygon is 64 square units.
The answer is: $64$

"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"

Assistant:

 The given equation is a product of two expressions equal to zero, so either the first expression is zero or the second expression is zero. This means that either $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + (\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + (\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$.

If $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + (\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$, then $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. This implies that $x + y = \pm 10$ and $x - y = \pm 10$. Solving these equations gives the vertices of the square as $(0, 10)$, $(10, 0)$, $(0, -10)$, and $(-10, 0)$.

If $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + (\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$, then $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$. This implies that $x = \pm 8$ and $y = \pm 8$. Solving these equations gives the vertices of the square as $(8, 8)$, $(8, -8)$, $(-8, 8)$, and $(-8, -8)$.

Combining the two sets of vertices, we find that the polygon is a square with side length 10. The area of this square is $10^2 = 100$.

Therefore, the area of the convex polygon is 100. The answer is: $100$

First, let's analyze the given equation. The equation is equal to zero if and only if both factors are equal to zero. This gives us two separate conditions:

1. $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$. This implies that $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. This means that $x + y = \pm 10$ and $x - y = \pm 10$. Solving these equations, we find that the points are $(5,5)$, $(5,-5)$, $(-5,5)$, and $(-5,-5)$.

2. $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$. This implies that $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$. This means that $x = \pm 8$ and $y = \pm 8$. So the points are $(8,8)$, $(8,-8)$, $(-8,8)$, and $(-8,-8)$.

These points form a square with side length $10$. Therefore, the area of the square is $10^2 = 100$.

Below is a math problem you are to solve (natural number answer):
"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"
To accomplish this, first list the problem's constraints, conditions and related knowledge, and thens solve the problem step by step. Be clear so even an idiot can follow your instructions. After solving the problem, output the final numerical answer within \boxed{}.

Assistant:

 The problem's constraints, conditions, and related knowledge are as follows:

1. The equation is a product of two quadratic expressions equal to zero, which means that either of the expressions must be zero for the equation to hold.
2. Each quadratic expression represents a circle in the xy-plane. The points where these circles intersect are the solutions to the equation.
3. The area of the convex polygon is the area enclosed by the intersection of the two circles.

Now, let's solve the problem step by step:

Step 1: Identify the circles represented by the quadratic expressions.
The quadratic expression $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + (\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ represents a circle with center at (0, 0) and radius 10.
The quadratic expression $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + (\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ represents a circle with center at (0, 0) and radius 8.

Step 2: Determine the intersection of the two circles.
The intersection of the two circles is a square with side length 16 (since the distance between the centers of the circles is equal to the sum of their radii, which is 18, and the side length of the square is twice the distance from the center of either circle to one of its vertices, which is half of 18, or 9. The side length of the square is therefore 2 * 9 = 18).

Step 3: Calculate the area of the square.
The area of a square is the square of its side length, so the area of the square is $16^2 = 256$.

Therefore, the area of the convex polygon is 256 square units. The answer is: $256$

Assistant:

 The given equation is a product of two expressions, so it equals to zero if and only if at least one of the expressions equals to zero.

The expression $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ implies $\vert x + y \vert = 10$, which means $x + y = 10$ or $x + y = -10$.
The expression $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ implies $\vert x - y \vert = 10$, which means $x - y = 10$ or $x - y = -10$.
The expression $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ implies $\vert x \vert = 8$, which means $x = 8$ or $x = -8$.
The expression $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ implies $\vert y \vert = 8$, which means $y = 8$ or $y = -8$.

By solving these equations, we find the vertices of the polygon:
$(8,8)$, $(8,-8)$, $(-8,8)$, $(-8,-8)$, $(10,0)$, $(0,10)$, $(-10,0)$, $(0,-10)$.

The polygon is a square with side length $16$. The area of the square is $16^2 = 256$.

So, the area of the convex polygon is $256$. The answer is: $256$.

Below is a math problem you are to solve (natural number answer!):
"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"

Assistant:

 The equation given is a product of two expressions equal to zero, which means that either of the expressions must be zero for the equation to hold. This gives us two separate cases to consider:

1. $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$
2. $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$

For the first case, both $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2$ and $( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2$ must be zero. This means that $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. This gives us the equation of two lines: $x + y = 10$ and $x - y = 10$.

For the second case, both $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2$ and $( \vert y \vert - 8)^2$ must be zero. This means that $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$. This gives us the equation of a square with side length 16 centered at the origin.

The intersection of these two lines forms a square with side length 10 centered at the origin. The area of this square is $10^2 = 100$. So, the area of the convex polygon is 100 square units.

The area of the convex polygon is 100 square units. The answer is $\boxed{100}$.
