 The problem asks for the number of positive integers $m$ such that the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has $4$ distinct solutions.

First, let's consider the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$.

The expression $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert$ represents the distance between $x$ and $3$ or $-1$ in the number line. So, the equation is asking for the values of $x$ that are a distance of $\frac{m}{100}$ from $3$ or $-1$.

This equation will have four distinct solutions if and only if $\frac{m}{100}$ is less than $2$ but greater than or equal to $1$. This is because the distance between $3$ and $-1$ is $4$, and we want the distance from $3$ or $-1$ to $x$ to be less than $4$ but greater than or equal to $1$.

So, we have $1 \leq \frac{m}{100} < 2$. Multiplying all sides of the inequalities by $100$, we get $100 \leq m < 200$.

The positive integers $m$ that satisfy these inequalities are the integers from $100$ to $199$, inclusive. To find the number of these integers, we subtract the smallest integer from the largest and then add $1$. So, the number of positive integers $m$ is $200 - 100 + 1 = 101$.

Therefore, there are $101$ positive integers $m$ such that the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has $4$ distinct solutions. The answer is: $101$.

 The equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has 4 distinct solutions. This means that the right side of the equation, $\frac{m}{100}$, must be equal to 2. This is because the absolute value function $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert$ takes on the value of 2 only four times.

Setting $\frac{m}{100}=2$, we can solve for $m$ to get $m=200$. Therefore, there is only one positive integer $m$ for which the equation has 4 distinct solutions, and that is $m=200$. The answer is: $1$

Assistant:

 The problem states that the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has $4$ distinct solutions. The right side of the equation is a positive value, so $m$ must be a positive integer. The left side of the equation is the absolute value of an absolute value expression, which means it is always nonnegative. Thus, the right side must also be nonnegative, so $m$ must be a positive integer.

The equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ can have $4$ distinct solutions if and only if $\frac{m}{100}$ is strictly between $0$ and $2$. This is because the graph of $y = \vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert$ is a "V" shape with the "bottom" of the "V" at $y = 0$ and $y = 2$. Thus, the value of $\frac{m}{100}$ must be in the interval $(0, 2)$ for the equation to have $4$ distinct solutions.

Multiplying both sides of the inequality $0 < \frac{m}{100} < 2$ by $100$ gives $0 < m < 200$. Since $m$ is a positive integer, the possible values of $m$ are the integers from $1$ to $199$. 

However, we need to find the number of these values of $m$ for which the equation has $4$ distinct solutions. From the analysis above, we know that this happens if and only if $\frac{m}{100}$ is strictly between $0$ and $2$. In other words, $0 < \frac{m}{100} < 2$. Multiplying all sides of the inequalities by $100$ gives $0 < m < 200$. The number of positive integers $m$ that satisfy this inequality is $199$.

Therefore, the number of positive integers $m$ for which the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has $4$ distinct solutions is $199$. The answer is: $199$.

Assistant:

 The problem is asking for the number of positive integers $m$ such that the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has exactly four distinct solutions.

We know that the absolute value function $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert$ has a graph that is a V-shape with the vertex at $(1,2)$. The equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ will have four distinct solutions if and only if the "height" of the V is $\frac{m}{100}$ is between $0$ and $2$. In other words, $0 < \frac{m}{100} < 2$, which simplifies to $0 < m < 200$.

The positive integers $m$ that satisfy this inequality are $1, 2, 3, ..., 199$. So the number of such positive integers $m$ is $199$.
The answer is: $199$

Assistant:

 The equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has 4 distinct solutions.

The number of solutions of this equation is determined by the value of $\frac{m}{100}$.

The expression inside the absolute value, $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert$, can be equal to $\frac{m}{100}$ or $-\frac{m}{100}$.

This gives us two equations:
1. $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert = \frac{m}{100}$
2. $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert = -\frac{m}{100}$

For the first equation, $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert = \frac{m}{100}$, the expression inside the absolute value can be split into two cases:
Case 1: $\vert x-1 \vert -2 = \frac{m}{100}$
Case 2: $\vert x-1 \vert -2 = -\frac{m}{100}$

For the second equation, $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert = -\frac{m}{100}$, this equation has no solution because the absolute value of a number cannot be negative.

So we only need to consider the first equation.

Case 1: $\vert x-1 \vert -2 = \frac{m}{100}$
This gives us two sub-cases:
Sub-case 1.1: $x-1 -2 = \frac{m}{100}$, which simplifies to $x-3 = \frac{m}{100}$, or $x = \frac{m}{100} + 3$.
Sub-case 1.2: $-(x-1) -2 = \frac{m}{100}$, which simplifies to $-x+1 -2 = \frac{m}{100}$, or $-x-1 = \frac{m}{100}$, or $x = - \frac{m}{100} - 1$.

Case 2: $\vert x-1 \vert -2 = -\frac{m}{100}$
This gives us two sub-cases:
Sub-case 2.1: $x-1 -2 = -\frac{m}{100}$, which simplifies to $x-3 = -\frac{m}{100}$, or $x = -\frac{m}{100} + 3$.
Sub-case 2.2: $-(x-1) -2 = -\frac{m}{100}$, which simplifies to $-x+1 -2 = -\frac{m}{100}$, or $-x-1 = -\frac{m}{100}$, or $x = \frac{m}{100} + 1$.

For the equation to have 4 distinct solutions, we need to find the values of $\frac{m}{100}$ such that the four expressions for $x$ are all distinct.

By comparing the four expressions for $x$, we can see that the expressions $x = \frac{m}{100} + 3$ and $x = -\frac{m}{100} - 1$ are the same, and the expressions $x = -\frac{m}{100} + 3$ and $x = \frac{m}{100} + 1$ are the same.

So we only need to consider the two expressions $x = \frac{m}{100} + 3$ and $x = -\frac{m}{100} + 1$.

For these two expressions to be distinct, we must have $\frac{m}{100} + 3 \neq -\frac{m}{100} + 1$.

Simplifying this inequality gives $2 \cdot \frac{m}{100} \neq -2$, or $\frac{m}{100} \neq -1$.

Since $m$ is a positive integer, this inequality is always true.

Therefore, for the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ to have 4 distinct solutions, $\frac{m}{100}$ must be any positive integer except 1.

So the number of such positive integers $m$ is the number of positive integers from 1 to 100, excluding 1.

This is equal to $100 - 1 = 99$.
The answer is: $99$

 The equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has $4$ distinct solutions.

First, we need to consider the possible values of $m$. Since $\frac{m}{100}$ is a positive number, $m$ must be a positive integer. Also, the absolute value of the right side of the equation is at most $2$, so $\frac{m}{100} \leq 2$, which implies $m \leq 200$.

Next, we analyze the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$. The equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=c$ ($c$ is a positive constant) has $4$ distinct solutions when $1<c<2$. Therefore, we need to find the values of $m$ such that $1<\frac{m}{100}<2$, which implies $100<m<200$.

The positive integers $m$ that satisfy this inequality are $101, 102, ..., 199$, so there are $199-101+1=99$ such integers.
The answer is: $99$

 The problem asks for how many positive integers $m$ the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has 4 distinct solutions.

First, let's consider the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$. The right side of the equation is always non-negative, so the left side must also be non-negative. This means that $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert \geq 0$. The absolute value function is always non-negative, so $\vert x-1 \vert -2 \geq 0$, and then $\vert x-1 \vert \geq 2$. This gives us two cases:

Case 1: $x-1 \geq 2$, so $x \geq 3$.
Case 2: $x-1 \leq -2$, so $x \leq -1$.

However, the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has 4 distinct solutions, which means that the absolute value expression $\vert x-1 \vert -2$ must change its sign twice in the interval of solutions. This happens when the expression inside the absolute value, $x-1$, equals to $2$ or $-2$. Therefore, we have three sub-cases:

Sub-case 1.1: $x-1 = 2$, so $x = 3$. This gives us the equation $\vert 3-1 -2 \vert = \vert 0 \vert = 0 = \frac{m}{100}$, so $m = 0$. However, $m$ must be a positive integer, so this case is not valid.

Sub-case 1.2: $x-1 > 2$, so $x > 3$. This gives us the equation $\vert x-1 -2 \vert = \vert x-3 \vert = \frac{m}{100}$.

Sub-case 2.1: $x-1 = -2$, so $x = -1$. This gives us the equation $\vert -1-1 -2 \vert = \vert -4 \vert = 4 = \frac{m}{100}$, so $m = 400$.

Sub-case 2.2: $x-1 < -2$, so $x < -1$. This gives us the equation $\vert 1-x -2 \vert = \vert -x-1 \vert = \frac{m}{100}$.

From sub-cases 1.2 and 2.2, we have the equation $\vert x-3 \vert = \frac{m}{100}$ and $\vert -x-1 \vert = \frac{m}{100}$, respectively. These two equations are equivalent, so we only need to consider one of them.

The equation $\vert x-3 \vert = \frac{m}{100}$ has two solutions: $x = 3 + \frac{m}{100}$ and $x = 3 - \frac{m}{100}$. For these solutions to be distinct and satisfy the conditions from sub-cases 1.2 and 2.2, we must have $3 + \frac{m}{100} > 3$ and $3 - \frac{m}{100} < 3$, which gives us $\frac{m}{100} > 0$ and $-\frac{m}{100} < 0$, respectively. These conditions are always true, so we only need to ensure that the two solutions are distinct. This happens when $\frac{m}{100} \neq -\frac{m}{100}$, which is true for all positive $m$.

Therefore, the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has 4 distinct solutions for any positive integer $m$. However, we are asked for the number of such $m$ that are less than or equal to 1000. Since $m$ can be any positive integer, there are 1000 positive integers less than or equal to 1000. However, $m$ cannot be 0 (from sub-case 1.1), so we have 999 possible values for $m$. But we also found that $m = 400$ from sub-case 2.1. So, there are two values of $m$ that make the equation have 4 distinct solutions and are less than or equal to 1000: $m = 400$ and $m = 1, 2, ..., 999$. Therefore, the number of positive integers $m$ that satisfy the condition is 2. The answer is: 2

 The equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has 4 distinct solutions.
We know that $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert$ is an integer for all real $x$. Therefore, $\frac{m}{100}$ must be an integer. So, $m$ must be a multiple of 100. Let $m = 100n$ where $n$ is a positive integer.
Now, we need to find the number of values of $n$ for which the equation has 4 distinct solutions.
We can start by considering the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=n$.
This equation has 4 distinct solutions if and only if $n=1$.
Therefore, the only value of $n$ that satisfies the given conditions is 1.
Thus, there is only one positive integer $m$ for which the equation has 4 distinct solutions, and that is $m=100$. The answer is: $1$
