Below is a math problem you are to solve (natural number answer):
"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"
To accomplish this, first list the problem's constraints, conditions and related knowledge, and thens solve the problem step by step. Be clear so even an idiot can follow your instructions. After solving the problem, output the final numerical answer within \boxed{}.

Assistant:

 The problem's constraints are as follows:

1. The equation is equal to zero.
2. The absolute value function $|x|$ is always nonnegative.
3. The square of a real number is always nonnegative.

From constraint 1, either the first term or the second term must be zero. That is, either $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$, or $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$.

From constraint 2, the absolute value function $|x|$ is always nonnegative, so $\vert x \vert - 8 = 0$ implies $\vert x \vert = 8$, which further implies $x = 8$ or $x = -8$. Similarly, $\vert y \vert - 8 = 0$ implies $y = 8$ or $y = -8$.

From constraint 3, the square of a real number is always nonnegative, so $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ implies $\vert x + y \vert = 10$, and $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ implies $\vert x - y \vert = 10$.

Now we consider all possible combinations of $x$ and $y$:

1. If $x = 8$ and $y = 8$, then $\vert x + y \vert = 16$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 0$, which does not satisfy the conditions.
2. If $x = 8$ and $y = -8$, then $\vert x + y \vert = 0$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 16$, which does not satisfy the conditions.
3. If $x = -8$ and $y = 8$, then $\vert x + y \vert = 0$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 16$, which does not satisfy the conditions.
4. If $x = -8$ and $y = -8$, then $\vert x + y \vert = -16$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 0$, which does not satisfy the conditions.

Therefore, the only possible combination is $x = 8$ and $y = -8$, or $x = -8$ and $y = 8$. This forms a square with side length $16$. The area of the square is $16^2 = 256$. So, the area of the convex polygon is 256 square units. The answer is: $256$

Below is a math problem you are to solve (natural number answer!):
"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"
Analyze the problem and think step by step to come to a solution with programs. After solving the problem, output the final numerical answer within \boxed{}.

Assistant:

 The given equation is a product of two terms equal to zero. This means that either the first term is zero or the second term is zero. 

The first term is zero when $|x+y| - 10 = 0$ or $|x-y| - 10 = 0$. These equations simplify to $|x+y| = 10$ and $|x-y| = 10$. The solutions to these equations are the lines $x+y = 10$, $x+y = -10$, $x-y = 10$, and $x-y = -10$. These lines form a rectangle with vertices at $(10,0)$, $(-10,0)$, $(0,10)$, and $(0,-10)$.

The second term is zero when $|x| - 8 = 0$ or $|y| - 8 = 0$. These equations simplify to $|x| = 8$ and $|y| = 8$. The solutions to these equations are the lines $x = 8$, $x = -8$, $y = 8$, and $y = -8$. These lines form a square with vertices at $(8,8)$, $(-8,8)$, $(-8,-8)$, and $(8,-8)$.

The intersection of the two sets of lines is the convex polygon formed by the rectangle and the square. This polygon is a square with side length 10. The area of a square is the square of its side length, so the area of this square is $10^2 = 100$.

So the area of the convex polygon is 100. The answer is: $100$

Below is a math problem you are to solve (natural number answer):
"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"

Assistant:

 The problem's constraints, conditions and related knowledge are as follows:

1. The equation is given as $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$.
2. The equation is equal to zero if either of the two factors is zero.
3. A product of factors is zero if at least one of the factors is zero.
4. Therefore, we have two cases to consider: $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ and $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$.
5. In the first case, we have $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. This implies that $x + y = \pm 10$ and $x - y = \pm 10$. Solving these equations gives us the vertices of the polygon.
6. In the second case, we have $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$. This implies that $x = \pm 8$ and $y = \pm 8$. Solving these equations gives us the vertices of the polygon.
7. The vertices of the polygon are the points where these constraints intersect.
8. The area of the polygon can be found by calculating the area of the rectangle formed by the vertices and subtracting the areas of the four right triangles formed by the vertices.

Now, let's solve the problem step by step:

1. For the first case, we have $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. This implies that $x + y = \pm 10$ and $x - y = \pm 10$. Solving these equations gives us the vertices $(5,5)$, $(5,-5)$, $(-5,5)$, and $(-5,-5)$.
2. For the second case, we have $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$. This implies that $x = \pm 8$ and $y = \pm 8$. Solving these equations gives us the vertices $(8,8)$, $(8,-8)$, $(-8,8)$, and $(-8,-8)$.
3. The vertices of the polygon are the points where these constraints intersect, which are $(8,8)$, $(8,-8)$, $(-8,8)$, $(5,5)$, $(-5,5)$, $(-8,-8)$, $(5,-5)$, and $(-5,-5)$.
4. The area of the rectangle formed by the vertices is $(16 \times 16) = 256$.
5. The areas of the four right triangles formed by the vertices are $(\frac{1}{2} \times 11 \times 11) = 60.5$ each.
6. The total area of the four triangles is $4 \times 60.5 = 242$.
7. The area of the polygon is the area of the rectangle minus the area of the triangles, which is $256 - 242 = 14$.

Therefore, the area of the convex polygon is 14 square units. The answer is: $14$

Below is a math problem you are to solve (natural number answer):
"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"

Assistant:

 The problem's constraints, conditions, and related knowledge are as follows:

1. The equation is $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$.
2. The points $\left(x, y\right)$ that satisfy this equation are the vertices of the polygon.
3. The area of the polygon can be found by counting the number of lattice points (points with integer coordinates) inside the polygon and using Pick's theorem.

Pick's theorem states that the area of a polygon with vertices at lattice points is given by $A = i + \frac{b}{2} - 1$, where $i$ is the number of lattice points inside the polygon and $b$ is the number of lattice points on the boundary of the polygon.

To solve the problem, we first need to find the vertices of the polygon by solving the equation $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$.

From the equation, we can see that either $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$.

If $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$, then $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$, which implies $x + y = \pm 10$ and $x - y = \pm 10$. Solving these equations gives us the vertices of the polygon: $(0, 10), (0, -10), (10, 0), (-10, 0)$.

If $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$, then $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$, which implies $x = \pm 8$ and $y = \pm 8$. Solving these equations gives us the vertices of the polygon: $(8, 8), (8, -8), (-8, 8), (-8, -8)$.

Now we can count the lattice points inside the polygon and on the boundary. The polygon is a square with side length 10, so it has 4 corners, 4 sides, and 1 interior point. Thus, $i = 1$ and $b = 4$.

Using Pick's theorem, the area of the polygon is $A = i + \frac{b}{2} - 1 = 1 + \frac{4}{2} - 1 = 2$.

Therefore, the area of the convex polygon is 2 square units. The answer is: $2$

2. The equation equals zero if either of the two factors equals zero.
3. For the first factor to be zero, either $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$. This implies $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ or $\vert x - y \vert = 10$.
4. For the second factor to be zero, either $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$. This implies $\vert x \vert = 8$ or $\vert y \vert = 8$.
5. The absolute value equations can be rewritten as linear equations: $x + y = 10$, $x + y = -10$, $x - y = 10$, $x - y = -10$, $x = 8$, $x = -8$, $y = 8$, $y = -8$.
6. The eight lines divide the plane into a number of regions. The area of the convex polygon formed by the intersection of these lines is the area of the region enclosed by the lines $x + y = 10$, $x + y = -10$, $x - y = 10$, $x - y = -10$, $x = 8$, $x = -8$, $y = 8$, $y = -8$.
7. The polygon is a square with side length 10, so its area is $10^2 = 100$.

Therefore, the area of the convex polygon is 100 square units. The answer is: $100$

Below is a math problem you are to solve (natural number answer):
"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"

Assistant:

 The problem's constraints, conditions and related knowledge are as follows:

1. The equation $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ is equal to zero if and only if either of the two factors is equal to zero.

2. A factor of a product is zero if and only if the factor itself is zero.

3. The absolute value function $\vert x \vert$ is equal to $x$ if $x \geq 0$ and $-x$ if $x < 0$.

Now, let's solve the problem step by step.

Step 1: Set each factor equal to zero and solve for $x$ and $y$.

For the first factor, we have:

$(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0 \Rightarrow \vert x + y \vert = 10 \Rightarrow x + y = \pm 10$.

And $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0 \Rightarrow \vert x - y \vert = 10 \Rightarrow x - y = \pm 10$.

For the second factor, we have:

$(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0 \Rightarrow \vert x \vert = 8 \Rightarrow x = \pm 8$.

And $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0 \Rightarrow \vert y \vert = 8 \Rightarrow y = \pm 8$.

Step 2: Solve the system of equations formed by the above equalities.

From $x + y = \pm 10$ and $x - y = \pm 10$, we can add these equations to get $2x = \pm 20$, so $x = \pm 10$. And from $x + y = \pm 10$ and $x - y = \mp 10$, we can subtract these equations to get $2y = 0$, so $y = 0$. Therefore, the points are $(10, 0)$, $(-10, 0)$, $(0, 10)$, and $(0, -10)$.

From $x = \pm 8$ and $y = \pm 8$, we can get the points $(8, 8)$, $(8, -8)$, $(-8, 8)$, and $(-8, -8)$.

Step 3: Plot the points and determine the shape of the polygon.

The points form a square with side length 20.

Step 4: Calculate the area of the square.

The area of a square is given by the formula $side^2$. In this case, the side length is 20, so the area is $20^2 = 400$.

Therefore, the area of the convex polygon is 400. The answer is: $400$

 The problem's constraints, conditions, and related knowledge are as follows:

1. The equation is given as $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$.
2. The equation equals zero if and only if either the first term equals zero or the second term equals zero.
3. The first term equals zero when $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$.
4. The second term equals zero when $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$.
5. The absolute value function $|\cdot|$ splits into two cases: $x \ge 0$ and $x < 0$.

Now, let's solve the problem step by step:

Step 1: Solve the first term equals zero.

For $\vert x + y \vert = 10$, we have two cases:
- If $x + y \ge 0$, then $x + y = 10$.
- If $x + y < 0$, then $-(x + y) = 10$, which simplifies to $x + y = -10$.

Similarly, for $\vert x - y \vert = 10$, we have two cases:
- If $x - y \ge 0$, then $x - y = 10$.
- If $x - y < 0$, then $-(x - y) = 10$, which simplifies to $x - y = -10$.

Step 2: Solve the second term equals zero.

For $\vert x \vert = 8$, we have two cases:
- If $x \ge 0$, then $x = 8$.
- If $x < 0$, then $-(x) = 8$, which simplifies to $x = -8$.

Similarly, for $\vert y \vert = 8$, we have two cases:
- If $y \ge 0$, then $y = 8$.
- If $y < 0$, then $-(y) = 8$, which simplifies to $y = -8$.

Step 3: Combine the solutions from steps 1 and 2.

The solutions to the equation are the intersections of the solutions from steps 1 and 2. This gives us the following vertices of the polygon:
- $(8, 8)$, $(8, -8)$, $(-8, 8)$, and $(-8, -8)$.
- $(10, 0)$, $(0, 10)$, $(-10, 0)$, and $(0, -10)$.

Step 4: Calculate the area of the polygon.

The polygon is a square with side length 16 (the distance between $(8, 8)$ and $(8, -8)$ or $(8, 8)$ and $(-8, 8)$, for example). The area of a square is given by side length squared, so the area of the polygon is $16^2 = 256$.
The answer is: $256$

Assistant:

 The given equation is
\[((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0.\]
This equation is equal to zero if either of the two factors is zero. Therefore, we have two cases to consider:

Case 1: $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$.
This equation is only possible if $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. This implies that $x + y = \pm 10$ and $x - y = \pm 10$. Solving these equations gives us the vertices of the polygon: $(8, 2)$, $(8, -2)$, $(-8, 2)$, and $(-8, -2)$.

Case 2: $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$.
This equation is only possible if $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$. This implies that $x = \pm 8$ and $y = \pm 8$. Solving these equations gives us the vertices of the polygon: $(8, 8)$, $(8, -8)$, $(-8, 8)$, and $(-8, -8)$.

Now we have all the vertices of the polygon: $(8, 2)$, $(8, -2)$, $(-8, 2)$, $(-8, -2)$, $(8, 8)$, $(8, -8)$, $(-8, 8)$, and $(-8, -8)$. Plotting these points on a coordinate plane, we can see that the polygon is a square with side length 16. The area of a square is given by the square of the length of its side, so the area of this square is $16^2 = 256$. Therefore, the area of the convex polygon is 256 square units. The answer is: $256$
