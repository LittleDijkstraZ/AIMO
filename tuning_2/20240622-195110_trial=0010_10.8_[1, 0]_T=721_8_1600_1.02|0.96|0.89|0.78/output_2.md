Below is a math problem you are to solve (natural number answer):
"For how many positive integers $m$ does the equation \[\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}\] have $4$ distinct solutions?"

Assistant:


First, we need to understand that the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has 4 distinct solutions. This means that the right-hand side $\frac{m}{100}$ must be a number that splits the graph of $y = \vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert$ into 4 parts.

Now, let's analyze the graph of $y = \vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert$. The graph has a V-shape that opens upwards. The bottom of the "V" is at $y=0$, and it occurs at $x=1$ and $x=3$ (the points where the expression inside the absolute value changes from decreasing to increasing). The "V" is 2 units high, so the maximum value of $y = \vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert$ is 2.

For the equation to have 4 distinct solutions, the right-hand side $\frac{m}{100}$ must be strictly less than 2 and strictly greater than 0. Therefore, $0 < \frac{m}{100} < 2$. Multiplying all sides by 100, we get $0 < m < 200$.

So the only positive integers $m$ that satisfy the equation are the integers from 1 to 199. 

However, we want to find how many of these integers make the equation have exactly 4 distinct solutions. 

To do this, we need to understand that the number of solutions depends on the value of $\frac{m}{100}$. Specifically, the equation has 4 distinct solutions when $\frac{m}{100}$ is the height of a plateau in the graph of $y = \vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert$. The height of the plateaus is 1, so we are looking for the number of multiples of 100 between 1 and 199.

There are exactly 199 such multiples of 100. 

Therefore, there are 199 positive integers $m$ that make the equation have 4 distinct solutions. The answer is: $\boxed{199}$.

 The problem is asking for the number of positive integers $m$ such that the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has exactly four distinct solutions.

First, we can notice that $\frac{m}{100}$ must be positive, which means $m$ must be positive. Also, $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert$ is always non-negative, so $\frac{m}{100}$ must be non-negative, which means $m$ must be non-negative. Therefore, $m$ must be a positive integer.

Secondly, we know that $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert$ can be either 0, 1, 2, or 3 (since it is equal to $\frac{m}{100}$, and $\frac{m}{100}$ can be any value between 0 and 3). Now let's examine each case:

1. If $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert = 0$, then $\vert x-1 \vert = 2$, so $x = 3$ or $x = -1$.
2. If $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert = 1$, then $\vert x-1 \vert = 3$ or $\vert x-1 \vert = 1$. This gives $x = 4$ or $x = -2$ or $x = 2$.
3. If $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert = 2$, then $\vert x-1 \vert = 4$ or $\vert x-1 \vert = 0$. This gives $x = 5$ or $x = -3$ or $x = 1$.
4. If $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert = 3$, then $\vert x-1 \vert = 5$ or $\vert x-1 \vert = 3$. This gives $x = 6$ or $x = -4$ or $x = 4$.

Comparing the solutions for $x$ and $m$, we find that $m = 100 \times 1 = 100$ for the case $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert = 1$, and $m = 100 \times 2 = 200$ for the case $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert = 2$. So there are 2 values of $m$ that satisfy the given conditions. The answer is: $2$

 The equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has 4 distinct solutions.

Let's first analyze the equation. The expression $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert$ is equal to either $\vert x-1 \vert -2$ or $2-\vert x-1 \vert$, depending on whether $\vert x-1 \vert$ is less than or greater than 2. 

This equation will have 4 distinct solutions if and only if $\frac{m}{100}$ is equal to either 2 or 1. If $\frac{m}{100}=2$, then $m=200$. If $\frac{m}{100}=1$, then $m=100$. 

Therefore, there are only two possible values of $m$ that would give 4 distinct solutions. However, we are asked to find how many positive integers $m$ would satisfy this condition. Since $m$ can only be either 100 or 200, there is only 1 positive integer $m$ that satisfies the given conditions. The answer is: $\boxed{1}$

Assistant:

 The equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has 4 distinct solutions.
We know that the absolute value function splits into two cases: if $a \ge 0$, then $|a|=a$; if $a<0$, then $|a|=-a$.
So we have two cases to consider for the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$:
1. When $\vert x-1 \vert -2 \ge 0$, the equation becomes $\vert x-1 \vert -2=\frac{m}{100}$.
2. When $\vert x-1 \vert -2 < 0$, the equation becomes $-( \vert x-1 \vert -2)=\frac{m}{100}$, which simplifies to $\vert x-1 \vert -2=-\frac{m}{100}$.

Now let's consider each case:

Case 1: $\vert x-1 \vert -2=\frac{m}{100}$.
Adding 2 to both sides gives $\vert x-1 \vert =\frac{m}{100}+2$.
This equation has 2 cases again:
1.1 When $x-1 \ge 0$, the equation becomes $x-1=\frac{m}{100}+2$.
1.2 When $x-1 < 0$, the equation becomes $-(x-1)=\frac{m}{100}+2$, which simplifies to $x-1=-\frac{m}{100}-2$.

For case 1.1, $x-1=\frac{m}{100}+2$ gives $x=\frac{m}{100}+3$.
For case 1.2, $x-1=-\frac{m}{100}-2$ gives $x=-\frac{m}{100}-1$.

Case 2: $\vert x-1 \vert -2=-\frac{m}{100}$.
Adding 2 to both sides gives $\vert x-1 \vert =2-\frac{m}{100}$.
This equation also has 2 cases:
2.1 When $x-1 \ge 0$, the equation becomes $x-1=2-\frac{m}{100}$.
2.2 When $x-1 < 0$, the equation becomes $-(x-1)=2-\frac{m}{100}$, which simplifies to $x-1=\frac{m}{100}-2$.

For case 2.1, $x-1=2-\frac{m}{100}$ gives $x=3-\frac{m}{100}$.
For case 2.2, $x-1=\frac{m}{100}-2$ gives $x=-\frac{m}{100}+1$.

Now we have four equations for $x$ in terms of $m$:
1. $x=\frac{m}{100}+3$
2. $x=-\frac{m}{100}-1$
3. $x=3-\frac{m}{100}$
4. $x=-\frac{m}{100}+1$

To find the values of $m$ for which these equations give 4 distinct solutions, we can set each pair of equations equal to each other and solve for $m$.

Setting equations 1 and 3 equal to each other gives:
$$\frac{m}{100}+3=3-\frac{m}{100} \implies \frac{m}{100}=\frac{m}{100} \implies m=0.$$
However, $m=0$ does not give 4 distinct solutions, so this case is not possible.

Setting equations 1 and 4 equal to each other gives:
$$\frac{m}{100}+3=-\frac{m}{100}+1 \implies \frac{2m}{100}=-2 \implies m=100.$$
This value of $m$ does give 4 distinct solutions.

Setting equations 2 and 3 equal to each other gives:
$$-\frac{m}{100}-1=3-\frac{m}{100} \implies -1=3,$$
which is not possible, so this case is not possible.

Setting equations 2 and 4 equal to each other gives:
$$-\frac{m}{100}-1=-\frac{m}{100}+1 \implies -1=1,$$
which is also not possible, so this case is not possible.

Therefore, the only value of $m$ that works is $m=100$. The value of $m$ for which the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has 4 distinct solutions is 100. The answer is: $1$

The absolute value equation $|\vert x-1 \vert -2|=\frac{m}{100}$ has 4 distinct solutions.
First, we need to consider the inner absolute value $\vert x-1 \vert -2$.
This expression is equal to a constant value $\frac{m}{100}$.
To find the number of solutions, we need to consider the possible cases for the value of $m$.

Case 1: $\frac{m}{100} > 2$
In this case, the equation becomes $\vert x-1 \vert -2 = \frac{m}{100}$.
This simplifies to $\vert x-1 \vert = \frac{m}{100} + 2$.
Since the absolute value is equal to a positive number, the equation has 2 solutions.

Case 2: $0 < \frac{m}{100} \le 2$
In this case, the equation becomes $\vert x-1 \vert -2 = \frac{m}{100}$.
This simplifies to $\vert x-1 \vert = \frac{m}{100} + 2$.
Since the absolute value is equal to a positive number, the equation has 2 solutions.

Case 3: $-2 < \frac{m}{100} < 0$
In this case, the equation becomes $\vert x-1 \vert -2 = -\frac{m}{100}$.
This simplifies to $\vert x-1 \vert = 2 - \frac{m}{100}$.
Since the absolute value is equal to a positive number, the equation has 2 solutions.

Case 4: $\frac{m}{100} \le -2$
In this case, the equation becomes $\vert x-1 \vert -2 = -\frac{m}{100}$.
This simplifies to $\vert x-1 \vert = 2 - \frac{m}{100}$.
Since the right side of the equation is negative, the equation has no solutions.

For the equation to have 4 distinct solutions, we need the inner absolute value to take on two positive values and two negative values. This occurs when $0 < \frac{m}{100} \le 2$. Therefore, $0 < m \le 200$ are the possible values of $m$.
The number of positive integers $m$ in this range is 200.
So, the number of positive integers $m$ such that the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has 4 distinct solutions is 200. The answer is: $200$

The problem asks for the number of positive integers $m$ such that the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has four distinct solutions.

First, we need to understand the graph of the function $y=\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert$. This function consists of four line segments with slope $\pm1$. The graph has a "V" shape with its vertices at $(1-2,0)=( -1,0)$ and $(1+2,0)=(3,0)$. The "V" shape is between the lines $y=|x-1|-2$ and $y=-|x-1|+2$.

Now, we know that the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has four distinct solutions if and only if $\frac{m}{100}$ is the vertical distance between the lines $y=|x-1|-2$ and $y=-|x-1|+2$. This vertical distance is 4 units, so we must have $\frac{m}{100}=4$, which implies $m=400$.

Therefore, there is only one positive integer $m$ such that the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has four distinct solutions, and that integer is $m=400$. The answer is: 1
The answer is: 1

 The equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has $4$ distinct solutions.
We know that $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert$ can be equal to a positive number $k$ if and only if $k < 2$. Therefore, $\frac{m}{100} < 2$, which implies $m < 200$.
Also, the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=k$ has $4$ distinct solutions for $k = 1$ and $k = 2 - \epsilon$ where $\epsilon$ is a small positive number.
Therefore, we need to find the number of positive integers $m$ such that $0 < m < 200$ and $\frac{m}{100} = 1$ or $\frac{m}{100} = 2 - \epsilon$.
For $\frac{m}{100} = 1$, we have $m = 100$.
For $\frac{m}{100} = 2 - \epsilon$, we have $m = 200 - 100\epsilon$. Since $0 < \epsilon < 1$, we have $100 < m < 200$.
Therefore, the only value of $m$ that satisfies the conditions is $m = 100$.
The number of positive integers $m$ that satisfy the conditions is $1$.
The answer is: 1
