Below is a math problem you are to solve (natural number answer):
"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"
To accomplish this, first list the problem's constraints, conditions and related knowledge, and thens solve the problem step by step. Be clear so even an idiot can follow your instructions. After solving the problem, output the final numerical answer within \boxed{}.

Assistant:

 The problem's constraints, conditions and related knowledge are:

1. The equation is a product of two terms equal to zero, which means either the first term equals zero or the second term equals zero.
2. The absolute value function $|x|$ can be rewritten as a piecewise function: $|x| = x$ if $x \geq 0$, and $|x| = -x$ if $x < 0$.

Now, let's solve the problem step by step:

1. If the first term $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$, then $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. This implies that $x + y = \pm 10$ and $x - y = \pm 10$. Solving these equations, we get the four lines $x + y = 10$, $x + y = -10$, $x - y = 10$, and $x - y = -10$. These lines form a rectangle.

2. If the second term $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$, then $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$. This implies that $x = \pm 8$ and $y = \pm 8$. Solving these equations, we get the four lines $x = 8$, $x = -8$, $y = 8$, and $y = -8$. These lines form a square.

3. The intersection of the rectangle and the square is the convex polygon we are looking for. The vertices of the polygon are the points where the lines intersect. By solving the system of equations, we find that the vertices are $(8, 8)$, $(8, -8)$, $(-8, 8)$, and $(-8, -8)$.

4. To find the area of the convex polygon, we simply calculate the area of the square. The side length of the square is 16 (twice the distance from the origin to any vertex), so the area is $16^2 = 256$.

Therefore, the area of the convex polygon is 256. The answer is: $256$

Below is a math problem you are to solve (natural number answer):
"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"
To accomplish this, first list the problem's constraints, conditions and related knowledge, and thens solve the problem step by step. Be clear so even an idiot can follow your instructions. After solving the problem, output the final numerical answer within \boxed{}.

Assistant:

 The problem's constraints are given by the equation:
$$((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0.$$

This equation is equal to zero if either of the two factors is zero. So we have two cases to consider:

1. $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$.
2. $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$.

For the first case, either $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ or $( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$. This implies that $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. The solutions to these equations are all the points on the lines $x + y = 10$, $x + y = -10$, $x - y = 10$, and $x - y = -10$. These lines form a rectangle with vertices at $(10, 0)$, $(0, 10)$, $(-10, 0)$, and $(0, -10)$.

For the second case, either $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ or $( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$. This implies that $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$. The solutions to these equations are all the points on the lines $x = 8$, $x = -8$, $y = 8$, and $y = -8$. These lines form a square with vertices at $(8, 8)$, $(8, -8)$, $(-8, 8)$, and $(-8, -8)$.

The intersection of the two sets of lines is the set of points that satisfy both constraints. This intersection is the rectangle formed by the lines $x + y = 10$, $x + y = -10$, $x - y = 10$, and $x - y = -10$, but with the square formed by the lines $x = 8$, $x = -8$, $y = 8$, and $y = -8$ removed.

The area of the rectangle is $20 \times 20 = 400$, and the area of the square is $16 \times 16 = 256$. So the area of the convex polygon is $400 - 256 = 144$. The answer is: $144$

Below is a math problem you are to solve (natural number answer!):
"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"
Analyze the problem and think step by step to come to a solution with programs. After solving the problem, output the final numerical answer within \boxed{}.

Assistant:

 The given equation is $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$. This equation is satisfied only when either $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$.

This means that the points that satisfy the equation are those where $|x+y|=10$, $|x-y|=10$, $|x|=8$, or $|y|=8$. These conditions represent four lines in the coordinate plane. The lines $|x+y|=10$ and $|x-y|=10$ form a square with side length 10, and the lines $|x|=8$ and $|y|=8$ form two squares with side length 8.

Therefore, the points that satisfy the equation enclose a convex polygon which is the union of two squares. The area of the square with side length 10 is $10^2 = 100$, and the area of each of the squares with side length 8 is $8^2 = 64$. So the total area of the convex polygon is $100 + 2*64 = 228$. The answer is: $228$

Below is a math problem you are to solve (natural number answer):
"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"
To accomplish this, first list the problem's constraints, conditions and related knowledge, and thens solve the problem step by step. Be clear so even an idiot can follow your instructions. After solving the problem, output the final numerical answer within \boxed{}.

Assistant:

 The problem's constraints, conditions, and related knowledge are as follows:

1. The equation is satisfied if and only if at least one of the factors is zero.
2. Each factor is a product of two quadratic expressions.
3. The absolute value function $|x|$ is equal to $x$ if $x \geq 0$, and $-x$ if $x < 0$.

Now, let's solve the problem step by step:

Step 1: For the first factor to be zero, we must have either $(\vert x + y \vert - 10) = 0$ or $(\vert x - y \vert - 10) = 0$. This implies that $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ or $\vert x - y \vert = 10$.

Step 2: For the second factor to be zero, we must have either $(\vert x \vert - 8) = 0$ or $(\vert y \vert - 8) = 0$. This implies that $\vert x \vert = 8$ or $\vert y \vert = 8$.

Step 3: From $\vert x + y \vert = 10$, we have $x + y = 10$ or $x + y = -10$. Similarly, from $\vert x - y \vert = 10$, we have $x - y = 10$ or $x - y = -10$. And from $\vert x \vert = 8$, we have $x = 8$ or $x = -8$, and from $\vert y \vert = 8$, we have $y = 8$ or $y = -8$.

Step 4: By analyzing all possible combinations of these equations, we find that the points that satisfy the equation are $(8, 2), (8, -2), (-8, 2), (-8, -2), (2, 8), (2, -8), (-2, 8), (-2, -8)$. These points form a square with side length $8\sqrt{2}$.

Step 5: The area of this square is the square of the side length, which is $(8\sqrt{2})^2 = 128$.

So, the area of the convex polygon is $128$. The answer is: $128$

Below is a math problem you are to solve (natural number answer):
"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"

Assistant:

 The problem's constraints are given by the equation:
$$((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0.$$
For the product of two numbers to be zero, either one of the numbers must be zero. So we have two cases:
Case 1: $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$. This implies that both $\vert x + y \vert - 10 = 0$ and $\vert x - y \vert - 10 = 0$, which gives $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. This means $x + y = \pm 10$ and $x - y = \pm 10$. Solving these equations gives us the vertices of the polygon as $(0, 10)$, $(0, -10)$, $(10, 0)$, and $(-10, 0)$.
Case 2: $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$. This implies that both $\vert x \vert - 8 = 0$ and $\vert y \vert - 8 = 0$, which gives $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$. This means $x = \pm 8$ and $y = \pm 8$. Solving these equations gives us the vertices of the polygon as $(8, 8)$, $(8, -8)$, $(-8, 8)$, and $(-8, -8)$.

The polygon formed by these vertices is a square with side length 10 (since the distance between $(0, 10)$ and $(0, -10)$ is 20, and dividing by 2 gives the side length of 10). The area of a square is given by the square of its side length, so the area of this square is $10^2 = 100$.
The answer is: $100$

Below is a math problem you are to solve (natural number answer):
"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"

Assistant:

 The problem's constraints are:

1. $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$
2. The points $(x, y)$ that satisfy the constraint form a convex polygon.

From the constraint 1, we know that either $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2) = 0$ or $((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$.

If $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2) = 0$, then $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$, which means $x + y = \pm 10$ and $x - y = \pm 10$. Solving these equations, we get the four lines $x + y = 10$, $x + y = -10$, $x - y = 10$, and $x - y = -10$. These lines form a square with side length 10 and area $10^2 = 100$.

If $((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$, then $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$, which means $x = \pm 8$ and $y = \pm 8$. These lines form a square with side length 16 and area $16^2 = 256$.

However, since the problem asks for the area of the convex polygon formed by the intersection of these two squares, we only consider the intersection of the two squares. The intersection of the two squares is another square with side length 10 and area $10^2 = 100$.

Therefore, the area of the convex polygon is 100. The answer is: $100$

Assistant:

 The problem's constraints, conditions and related knowledge are:

1. The equation $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + (\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ implies that $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. This is only possible when $x = \pm 10$ and $y = \pm 10$.
2. The equation $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + (\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ implies that $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$. This is only possible when $x = \pm 8$ and $y = \pm 8$.
3. Therefore, the points that satisfy the original equation are $(\pm 10, \pm 10)$ and $(\pm 8, \pm 8)$.
4. These points form a square with side length 20.

To find the area of this square, we simply square the length of one of its sides: $20^2 = 400$.

So the area of the convex polygon is 400 square units. The answer is: $400$

 The problem's constraints, conditions, and related knowledge are as follows:

1. The equation $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ must be satisfied for all points $(x, y)$ inside the polygon.
2. The expression is equal to zero if and only if either of the two factors is zero.
3. A product of two factors is zero if and only if at least one of the factors is zero.
4. Therefore, either $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$.
5. The first factor is zero if and only if $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$.
6. The second factor is zero if and only if $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$.
7. These conditions describe a square with side length 16.

Now, we solve the problem step by step:

The first factor is zero if and only if $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. This implies that $x + y = \pm 10$ and $x - y = \pm 10$. Solving these equations gives us the vertices of the square $(5, 5)$, $(5, -5)$, $(-5, -5)$, and $(-5, 5)$.

The second factor is zero if and only if $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$. This implies that $x = \pm 8$ and $y = \pm 8$. Solving these equations gives us the vertices of the square $(8, 8)$, $(8, -8)$, $(-8, -8)$, and $(-8, 8)$.

The square formed by the vertices $(5, 5)$, $(5, -5)$, $(-5, -5)$, and $(-5, 5)$ has side length 10. The square formed by the vertices $(8, 8)$, $(8, -8)$, $(-8, -8)$, and $(-8, 8)$ has side length 16.

Since the side length of the square formed by the vertices $(5, 5)$, $(5, -5)$, $(-5, -5)$, and $(-5, 5)$ is 10, and the side length of the square formed by the vertices $(8, 8)$, $(8, -8)$, $(-8, -8)$, and $(-8, 8)$ is 16, the polygon enclosed by the points satisfying the given equation is a square with side length 16.

The area of a square is the square of its side length. Therefore, the area of the polygon is $16^2 = 256$.
The answer is: $256$
