Below is a math problem you are to solve (positive numerical answer!):
"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"
Analyze this problem and think step by step to come to a solution with programs. After solving the problem, output the final numerical answer within \boxed{}.

Assistant:

 To find the area of the convex polygon enclosed by the points, we need to determine the extent of the region described by the inequalities derived from the given equation.

First, let's consider the product of two expressions: if $(a)(b) = 0$, then either $a=0$ or $b=0$. This means that at least one of the expressions must be zero for the product to be zero.

Given $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$, we know that either:
- $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$, or
- $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$.

In the first case, we have $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. This means that the absolute values of the sum and the difference of $x$ and $y$ are both 10. The set of points satisfying this is a square with side length of 10.

In the second case, we have $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$. This means that the absolute values of $x$ and $y$ are both 8. The set of points satisfying this is a square with side length of 8.

Combining these two cases, the region enclosed by the convex polygon is the intersection of these two squares, which is itself a square with side length of 8.

The area of a square with side length of $s$ is $s^2$, so the area of this square is $8^2 = 64$.

Therefore, the area of the convex polygon is 64 square units.

The answer is: 64

"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"

Assistant:

 The expression $AB = 0$ is equivalent to either $A = 0$ or $B = 0$. Therefore, the given equation is satisfied if either of the following two conditions holds:
1. $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2) = 0$.
2. $((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$.

Condition 1. simplifies to $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$, which represent two lines at a distance of 10 units from the origin along the $x + y$ and $x - y$ axes.
Condition 2. simplifies to $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$, which represent two lines at a distance of 8 units from the origin along the $x$ and $y$ axes.

These lines form a square with side length 16 (the diagonal of a 8 by 8 square). To find the area of this square, we calculate $16^2 = 256$. Therefore, the area of the polygon is 256 square units. 

The python code to compute the area would be:
```python


INTERMEDIATE OUT :

def square_area():
    """A square with side length 16 (the diagonal of a 8 by 8 square)."""
    side_length = 16
    area = side_length ** 2
    return area

area = square_area()
print(area)
```

256

CODE RESULTS 256

INTERMEDIATE OUT :
```output

```

The area of the polygon is 256 square units. Hence, the answer is: $\boxed{256}$.

To accomplish this, first determine a sympy-based approach for solving the problem by listing each step to take and what functions need to be called in each step. Be clear so even an idiot can follow your instructions, and remember, your final answer should be positive integer, not an algebraic expression!
Write the entire script covering all the steps (use comments and document it well) and print the result. After solving the problem, output the final numerical answer within \boxed{}.

Interesting, let's analyze step by step:



The first factor equals zero when $|\pm x \pm y| - 10 = 0$.  This means $|x+y| = 10$ and $|x-y| = 10$.  These imply that one of the following sets of four equations is true: $x+y = \pm 10, x-y = \pm 10$.  Solving the four possible pairs gives four solutions: $(5,-5), (-5,5), (5,5),$ and $(-5,-5)$.
The second factor equals zero when $|x|-8 = 0$ and $|y|-8 = 0$, which implies that $x = \pm 8$ and $y = \pm 8$.  The eight potential solutions in this case are $(8,8), (8,-8), (-8,8),$ and $(-8,-8)$.

The intersections of these two solution sets are limited to the four points $(\pm 5, \pm 5)$: two positive and two negative cases.

Plot these points into the Cartesian plane and draw a convex bounding box (easy to do - simply make a grid from $(8,8)$ to $(-8,-8)$): the bounds of this box define a square with side length of 16 units. Then, remember to divide by 2 because the box was a "double box" — including duplicates — due to absolute value restrictions.

Therefore, the area of the convex polygon is $(16)^2/2 = \boxed{128}$.

 The given equation is a product of two expressions equal to zero, which means either the first expression equals zero or the second expression equals zero.
The first expression is $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + (\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2$.
Setting this equal to zero, we have $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$.
These two equations give us the equations of two squares with sides of length 20 units and with vertices at $(0, 0)$, $(0, 20)$, $(20, 0)$, and $(20, 20)$.

The second expression is $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + (\vert y \vert - 8)^2$.
Setting this equal to zero, we have $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$.
These two equations give us the equations of two squares with sides of length 16 units and with vertices at $(0, -8)$, $(0, 8)$, $(-8, 0)$, and $(8, 0)$.

The intersection of these two squares forms a square with side length 16 units.
Therefore, the area of this convex polygon is $16^2 = 256$ square units. The answer is $\boxed{256}$.

Interesting, let's analyze step by step:


The equation $AB=0$ means that $A$ or $B$ must equal to $0$, and it cannot be both equals to $0$ at the same time. Given the equation at the problem: \[((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0.\]
This equation equals to zero only when either of the two parts $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2) = 0$ or $((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ is zero.
Let's analyze each case:
For the first case, $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2) = 0$, it means that both $|x+y| = 10$ and $|x-y| = 10$ must hold. This implies that either $x + y = \pm10$ and $x - y = \pm10$. Through solving these four equations, we can get the four vertices of the polygon are $(0, 10), (0, -10), (10, 0)$ and $(-10, 0)$.
For the second case, $((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$, it means that $|x| = |y| = 8$. This gives us the four vertices of the polygon $(8, 8), (8, -8), (-8, 8)$ and $(-8, -8)$.
Hence, these eight points form a square with side length $10$. The area of the square is $10^2 = 100$. To obtain the answer, pass the number of the square side $10$ to the power of $2$. The area of the square is $\boxed{100}$.

Interesting, let's analyze step by step:


First, note that the expression will be zero only if at least one of the two parentheses is zero. Hence the solution set of the equation will be the union of two sets: the set of points that satisfy $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ and the set of points that satisfy $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$. From the first equation we get $\vert x + y \vert = 10$, and from the second equation, $\vert x - y \vert = 10$, which means that for a point $(x, y)$ to be in the solution set, either $x + y = \pm 10$ or $x - y = \pm 10$. These are lines in the plane and thus the solution set is a square with side length of 20. From here we could calculate the area as $20 \times 20$, however there's a much easier way. 

On the plane of real numbers the given conditions are either $x + y = 10$ or $x + y = -10$, or $x - y = 10$ or $x - y = -10$. The square that is the solution set can be easily drawn:

<Figure1>.png

Clearly we have $AB = 20$, and hence the square has side length $20$. So its area is $20^2 = 400$. The answer is: $400$.
As an integer, the numeric value for the area is then just 400.So in conclusion,the area of this convex polygon is 400 square units.

 Since the product of two numbers is zero if and only if at least one of the numbers is zero,
either $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$.
The only way these conditions can be simultaneously satisfied is when $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$,
so $x = \pm 8$ and $y = \pm 8$.
This results in a square with side length $16$, so its area is $16^2 = 256$. The answer is:
$\boxed{256}$
