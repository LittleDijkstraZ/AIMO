 To solve this problem, we need to analyze the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ and determine for how many positive integers $m$ it has 4 distinct solutions.

First, we note that the right-hand side of the equation, $\frac{m}{100}$, is always positive. This implies that the left-hand side, $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert$, must also be positive. Therefore, we must have $\vert x-1 \vert -2 > 0$, which implies $\vert x-1 \vert > 2$. This gives us two cases:

1. If $x-1 > 2$, then $x > 3$.
2. If $x-1 < -2$, then $x < -1$.

However, we are looking for 4 distinct solutions, which means we must have two cases for the absolute value inside, i.e., $\vert x-1 \vert = a$ and $\vert x-1 \vert = b$, where $a$ and $b$ are positive numbers.

Let's consider the case $x > 3$. Then, the equation becomes $\vert x-1 \vert -2 = \frac{m}{100}$. This implies $\vert x-1 \vert = \frac{m}{100} + 2$. Since $x > 3$, we have $x-1 > 2$, so $\vert x-1 \vert = x-1$. Thus, we have $x-1 = \frac{m}{100} + 2$, or $x = \frac{m}{100} + 3$. For this equation to have two distinct solutions, we must have $\frac{m}{100} + 3 > 3$, which implies $\frac{m}{100} > 0$, or $m > 0$. Similarly, for the other absolute value, we have $x-1 = -( \frac{m}{100} + 2)$, or $x = 1 - \frac{m}{100} - 2 = - \frac{m}{100} - 1$. For this equation to have two distinct solutions, we must have $- \frac{m}{100} - 1 < -1$, which implies $- \frac{m}{100} < 0$, or $m > 0$. So, for $x > 3$, we must have $m > 0$.

Now let's consider the case $x < -1$. Then, the equation becomes $-(\vert x-1 \vert -2) = \frac{m}{100}$, or $\vert x-1 \vert -2 = - \frac{m}{100}$. This implies $\vert x-1 \vert = 2 - \frac{m}{100}$. Since $x < -1$, we have $x-1 < -2$, so $\vert x-1 \vert = -(x-1)$. Thus, we have $-(x-1) = 2 - \frac{m}{100}$, or $x = 1 - 2 + \frac{m}{100} = \frac{m}{100} - 1$. For this equation to have two distinct solutions, we must have $\frac{m}{100} - 1 < -1$, which implies $\frac{m}{100} < 0$, or $m < 0$. Similarly, for the other absolute value, we have $-(x-1) = -(-(\frac{m}{100} + 2))$, or $x = 1 + \frac{m}{100} + 2 = \frac{m}{100} + 3$. For this equation to have two distinct solutions, we must have $\frac{m}{100} + 3 < -1$, which implies $\frac{m}{100} < -4$, or $m < -400$. So, for $x < -1$, we must have $m < -400$.

Combining the two cases, we must have $0 < m < 400$ for the equation to have 4 distinct solutions. However, we are asked for the number of positive integers $m$ that satisfy this condition. The positive integers in the range $(0, 400)$ are exactly the integers from 1 to 399. Therefore, the number of positive integers $m$ for which the equation has 4 distinct solutions is 399.
The answer is: $399$

Assistant:

 The number of distinct solutions of the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ is equal to $4$ if and only if $\frac{m}{100}$ is equal to $2$. This is because the function $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert$ has a graph that is a "V" shape with the "valleys" (where the function equals $0$) being at $x=1 \pm 2$, and the "hills" (where the function equals $2$) being at $x=1 \pm 1$. Therefore, for the equation to have $4$ distinct solutions, the right side of the equation, $\frac{m}{100}$, must equal $2$.

To find the value of $m$ that satisfies this condition, we can multiply both sides of the equation $ \frac{m}{100} = 2$ by $100$ to get $m = 200$.

So the only positive integer $m$ for which the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has $4$ distinct solutions is $m = 200$. The answer is: $200$

Assistant: 

Interesting, let's analyze step by step:



The equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has $4$ distinct solutions. This means that the right side of the equation $\frac{m}{100}$ must be a value such that the absolute value equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=k$ (where $k=\frac{m}{100}$) has $4$ distinct solutions.

The equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=k$ can have $4$ distinct solutions when $k=1$. So, we must have $\frac{m}{100}=1$, which implies $m=100$.

Therefore, there is only one positive integer $m$ for which the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has $4$ distinct solutions, and that integer is $100$.

The answer is: $100$

Assistant: 

Interesting, let's analyze step by step:



1. The equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has four distinct solutions, which means that $\frac{m}{100}$ is the distance between two "layers" of the absolute value function.

2. To have four distinct solutions, we must have $0 < \frac{m}{100} < 2$. This is because the absolute value function reaches its maximum value of 2 at $x = 3$ and minimum value of 0 at $x = -1$.

3. From the inequality $0 < \frac{m}{100} < 2$, we get $0 < m < 200$.

4. Now we need to find how many positive integers $m$ satisfy this inequality. The integers from 1 to 199 are the possible values of $m$.

5. To find the number of these integers, we can simply subtract the smallest possible value of $m$ from the largest possible value of $m$ and then add 1. So the number of possible values of $m$ is $199 - 1 + 1 = 199$.

Therefore, the number of positive integers $m$ for which the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has four distinct solutions is 199.

The answer is: $199$

Assistant: 

Interesting, let's analyze step by step:



1. First, we notice that the number of distinct solutions of the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ is $4$, which is a constant.
2. We know that the expression inside the absolute value, i.e., $\vert x-1 \vert -2$, can take $3$ different values ($-2-\frac{m}{100}$, $-2+\frac{m}{100}$, and $2+\frac{m}{100}$).
3. Each of these $3$ values will give us a distinct equation.
4. We can solve these $3$ equations separately and count the number of distinct solutions for each.
5. If the number of distinct solutions for each equation is $2$, then the total number of distinct solutions of the original equation is $6$. But we know that the total number of distinct solutions is $4$.
6. Therefore, the number of distinct solutions for each of the equations $\vert x-1 \vert -2=-2-\frac{m}{100}$, $\vert x-1 \vert -2=-2+\frac{m}{100}$, and $\vert x-1 \vert -2=2+\frac{m}{100}$ should be $1$.
7. For the equation $\vert x-1 \vert -2=-2-\frac{m}{100}$, it simplifies to $\vert x-1 \vert =-\frac{m}{100}$, and this equation has no solution because the absolute value of a number cannot be negative.
8. For the equation $\vert x-1 \vert -2=-2+\frac{m}{100}$, it simplifies to $\vert x-1 \vert =\frac{m}{100}$, and this equation has $2$ distinct solutions if $\frac{m}{100}>0$, i.e., $m>0$.
9. For the equation $\vert x-1 \vert -2=2+\frac{m}{100}$, it simplifies to $\vert x-1 \vert =2+\frac{m}{100}$, and this equation has $2$ distinct solutions if $2+\frac{m}{100}>0$, i.e., $m>-200$.
10. Therefore, the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has $4$ distinct solutions if $0<m\leq200$.
11. The value of $m$ that makes the equation have $4$ distinct solutions is the integer part of $200$, which is $200$.

The value of $m$ that makes the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ have $4$ distinct solutions is $200$.

```python


INTERMEDIATE OUT :

Interesting, let's analyze step by step:



1. We are looking for the number of positive integers $m$ such that the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has exactly four distinct solutions.
2. The function $|x - 1| - 2$ will be zero when $|x - 1| = 2$, which means $x - 1 = 2$ or $x - 1 = -2$. This gives us $x = 3$ or $x = -1$.
3. The equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ will have exactly four distinct solutions when $\frac{m}{100}$ is equal to the distance between $3$ and $-1$, which is $4$.
4. Therefore, we have $\frac{m}{100} = 4$, which gives $m = 400$.

So the only positive integer $m$ that makes the equation have four distinct solutions is $400$. The answer is: $400$

Interesting, let's analyze step by step:



First, let's consider the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$. This equation has 4 distinct solutions when $\frac{m}{100}$ is equal to 2. This is because the expression inside the absolute value, $\vert x-1 \vert -2$, can be either 2 or -2.

For $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert = 2$, we have two sub-cases:

1. $\vert x-1 \vert -2 = 2$. This simplifies to $\vert x-1 \vert = 4$. This gives us two more sub-cases:

   a. $x-1 = 4$ which simplifies to $x = 5$.
   
   b. $x-1 = -4$ which simplifies to $x = -3$.

2. $\vert x-1 \vert -2 = -2$. This simplifies to $\vert x-1 \vert = 0$, which gives us only one solution: $x = 1$.

So, the four distinct solutions are $x = -3, 1, 5$. Now, we need to find the value of $m$ such that $\frac{m}{100} = 2$. This gives us $m = 200$.

Therefore, the only positive integer $m$ for which the equation has 4 distinct solutions is 200.

Now, let's write the entire script using Python:

```python

result = find_m()
