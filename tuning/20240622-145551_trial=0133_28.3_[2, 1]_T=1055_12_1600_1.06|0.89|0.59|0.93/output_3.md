Below is a math problem you are to solve (positive numerical answer):
"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"
To accomplish this, first determine a sympy-based approach for solving the problem by listing each step to take and what functions need to be called in each step. Be clear so even an idiot can follow your instructions, and remember, your final answer should be positive integer, not an algebraic expression!
Write the entire script covering all the steps (use comments and document it well) and print the result. After solving the problem, output the final numerical answer within \boxed{}.

Interesting, let's analyze step by step:



The condition for the points $\left(x, y\right)$ to satisfy the equation $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ is that either $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$.

The first equation is satisfied if $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$, which means $x + y = \pm 10$ and $x - y = \pm 10$. These four lines intersect to form a square with side length 20.

The second equation is satisfied if $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$, which means $x = \pm 8$ and $y = \pm 8$. These four lines also form a square with side length 16.

So, the points that satisfy the equation are those that lie inside the square formed by the lines $x + y = \pm 10$, $x - y = \pm 10$, $x = \pm 8$, and $y = \pm 8$. The area of this square is $(20)(20) = 400$ for the larger square and $(16)(16) = 256$ for the smaller square.

The area of the convex polygon enclosed by the points that satisfy the equation is the difference between these two areas, which is $400 - 256 = 144$.

However, this is not the final answer. The problem asks for the area of the convex polygon, which is actually the smaller square with side length 16. So, the area of the convex polygon is $(16)(16) = 256$.

The answer is $\boxed{256}$.

Below is a math problem you are to solve (positive numerical answer!):
"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"

 The given equation is equivalent to the product of two terms being zero, i.e., $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$. This implies that either $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$. 

The equation $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ implies that $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$, which means $x + y = \pm 10$ and $x - y = \pm 10$. These four equations give us the vertices of a square with side length 10. 

The equation $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ implies that $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$, which means $x = \pm 8$ and $y = \pm 8$. These four points are the vertices of another square with side length 8.

The union of these two squares forms the convex polygon. The area of a square with side length $a$ is $a^2$. Therefore, the area of the convex polygon is the sum of the areas of the two squares, which is $10^2 + 8^2 = 100 + 64 = 164$. The answer is: 164.

"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"

 This problem is a bit tricky, but if we break it down, we can see that the expression $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ will be true only if $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. Similarly, the expression $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ will be true only if $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$.

The first set of equations, $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$, represent a square with side length 10. The second set of equations, $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$, represent a square with side length 16.

The convex polygon that is formed by the intersection of these two squares is actually a smaller square, which is the intersection of the two squares. The side length of this smaller square can be found by using the Pythagorean theorem on right triangles formed by the diagonals of the larger squares. The length of the diagonal of a square with side length $a$ is $\sqrt{2}a$, so the length of the diagonal of the larger squares is $10\sqrt{2}$ and $16\sqrt{2}$ respectively. The side length of the smaller square is the difference of these two lengths divided by $\sqrt{2}$, which simplifies to $\frac{6\sqrt{2}}{\sqrt{2}} = 6$.

The area of a square with side length $s$ is $s^2$, so the area of the convex polygon is $6^2 = 36$. Therefore, the area of the convex polygon is $36$. The answer is: $36$

The equation $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ implies that each of the terms must be equal to zero for the equation to hold. This means that $\vert x + y \vert = 10$, $\vert x - y \vert = 10$, $\vert x \vert = 8$, and $\vert y \vert = 8$. These conditions describe a square with side length 16, and its area is $16^2 = 256$. Therefore, the area of the convex polygon is 256 square units.

Here's a Python function that calculates the area:
```python


INTERMEDIATE OUT :

def area_of_polygon():
    """The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"""
    side_length = 16
    area = side_length**2
    return area

result = area_of_polygon()
print(result)
```

Interesting, let's analyze step by step:



This problem is asking us to find the area of the region enclosed by the points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying the equation $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$. The equation is a product of two expressions, so it equals to zero when either of the expressions equals to zero.

Let's consider each expression separately:

1. $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$: This implies that $\vert x + y \vert = 10$, which means $x + y = \pm 10$.

2. $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$: This implies that $\vert x - y \vert = 10$, which means $x - y = \pm 10$.

3. $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$: This implies that $\vert x \vert = 8$, which means $x = \pm 8$.

4. $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$: This implies that $\vert y \vert = 8$, which means $y = \pm 8$.

From these conditions, we can draw the following conclusions:

- $x + y = \pm 10$ defines two parallel lines with slope $-1$.
- $x - y = \pm 10$ defines two parallel lines with slope $1$.
- $x = \pm 8$ defines two vertical lines.
- $y = \pm 8$ defines two horizontal lines.

The intersection of these lines form a square with side length $20$. To find the area of this square, we simply square the length of its side, which is $20$. So the area of the square is $20^2 = 400$. Therefore, the area of the region enclosed by the points is $400$ square units.

To calculate this in Python, we can simply write:

```python


INTERMEDIATE OUT :

def area_of_polygon():
    side_length = 20
    area = side_length ** 2
    return area

result = area_of_polygon()
print(result)
```

400

```output

```
The area of the convex polygon is $400$ square units. The answer is: $400$

Interesting, let's analyze step by step:



1. First, observe the given equation: $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$.

2. This equation is equal to zero if either the first term is zero or the second term is zero. 

3. The first term being zero means $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. 

4. The second term being zero means $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$.

5. Now, let's analyze these equations. The equations $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$ describe a square with side length $10$ centered at the origin. 

6. The equations $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$ describe a square with side length $16$ centered at the origin.

7. Therefore, the area of the convex polygon is the area of the square with side length $10$, which is $10^2 = 100$.

So the area of the convex polygon is $100$. The answer is: $100$

 The given equation is $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$.
For the product of two factors to be zero, either one of the factors must be zero. This means that either $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$.
If the first factor is zero, then both $\vert x + y \vert - 10 = 0$ and $\vert x - y \vert - 10 = 0$, which means $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. This implies that the points lie on a square with side length 20.
If the second factor is zero, then both $\vert x \vert - 8 = 0$ and $\vert y \vert - 8 = 0$, which means $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$. This implies that the points lie on a square with side length 16.
Taking the intersection of these two conditions, we see that the points lie on a square with side length 16 (since the smaller square is completely contained within the larger square). Therefore, the area of the convex polygon is the area of this square, which is $16^2 = 256$.
The answer is: $256$.
