Below is a math problem you are to solve (positive numerical answer!):
"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"
Analyze this problem and think step by step to come to a solution with programs. After solving the problem, output the final numerical answer within \boxed{}.

 The given equation is $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$. In order for the product of two numbers to be zero, either one of them must be zero. Therefore, either $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$.
If $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$, then $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$, which means $x + y = \pm 10$ and $x - y = \pm 10$. Solving these equations gives us the lines $x + y = 10$, $x + y = -10$, $x - y = 10$, and $x - y = -10$.
If $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$, then $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$, which means $x = \pm 8$ and $y = \pm 8$. This gives us the lines $x = 8$, $x = -8$, $y = 8$, and $y = -8$.
The intersection of these lines forms a square with side length 16. The area of this square is $16^2 = 256$. Therefore, the area of the convex polygon is 256 square units. The answer is: 256

Below is a math problem you are to solve (positive numerical answer):
"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"
To accomplish this, first determine a sympy-based approach for solving the problem by listing each step to take and what functions need to be called in each step. Be clear so even an idiot can follow your instructions, and remember, your final answer should be positive integer, not an algebraic expression!
Write the entire script covering all the steps (use comments and document it well) and print the result. After solving the problem, output the final numerical answer within \boxed{}.

Interesting, let's analyze step by step:



The expression equals to zero when either $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$.

This gives us 4 conditions:

1. $|x + y| = 10$, which means $x + y = 10$ or $x + y = -10$.
2. $|x - y| = 10$, which means $x - y = 10$ or $x - y = -10$.
3. $|x| = 8$, which means $x = 8$ or $x = -8$.
4. $|y| = 8$, which means $y = 8$ or $y = -8$.

These conditions form a square with vertices at $(8, 8), (8, -8), (-8, 8), (-8, -8)$. The side length of the square is $16$, so the area is $16^2 = 256$.

Therefore, the area of the convex polygon is $256$.

```python


INTERMEDIATE OUT :

from sympy import *

# Define the area of the square
area = 16**2
print(area)
```

256

```
The area of the convex polygon is $256$. The answer is: $256$

Interesting, let's analyze step by step:



1. We know that the product of two numbers is zero if and only if at least one of the numbers is zero. So, we can break the equation into two separate cases:

   Case 1: $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ and $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$
   Case 2: $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ and $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$

2. In Case 1, $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ implies $\vert x + y \vert = 10$, which gives us $x + y = 10$ or $x + y = -10$. Similarly, $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ implies $\vert x - y \vert = 10$, which gives us $x - y = 10$ or $x - y = -10$.

3. In Case 2, $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ implies $\vert x \vert = 8$, which gives us $x = 8$ or $x = -8$. Similarly, $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ implies $\vert y \vert = 8$, which gives us $y = 8$ or $y = -8$.

4. Solving these four equations, we get the vertices of the polygon: $(8, 8), (8, -8), (-8, 8),$ and $(-8, -8)$.

5. Now, we can plot these points on a coordinate plane and find the area of the rectangle formed by these points. The length of the rectangle is $16$ and the width is $16$, so the area of the rectangle is $16 \times 16 = 256$.

The area of the convex polygon is 256. The answer is: $256$
