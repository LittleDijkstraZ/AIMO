Below is a math problem you are to solve (positive numerical answer!):
"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"
Analyze this problem and think step by step to come to a solution with programs. After solving the problem, output the final numerical answer within \boxed{}.

Assistant:

 The given equation is equal to 0 if and only if both $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ and $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ or both $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ and $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$.
This means that $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x \vert = 8$ or $\vert x - y \vert = 10$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$.
The absolute value equations can be broken down into four cases:
1. $x + y = 10$ and $x = 8$: $y = 2$
2. $x + y = 10$ and $x = -8$: $y = 18$
3. $x - y = 10$ and $y = 8$: $x = 18$
4. $x - y = 10$ and $y = -8$: $x = 2$
These four points form a rectangle with vertices at $(8, 2)$, $(8, 18)$, $(18, 18)$, and $(18, 2)$.
To find the area of this rectangle, we can use the formula for the area of a rectangle: $length \times width$. The length is the difference in the x-coordinates, which is $18 - 8 = 10$, and the width is the difference in the y-coordinates, which is $18 - 2 = 16$. So the area is $10 \times 16 = 160$. The answer is: $160$

Assistant:

 The equation is satisfied only when both $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ and $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$, which implies $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. These two equations represent two squares with side length 10, centered at the origin. Their intersection is a square with side length 10 and area 100. Therefore, the area of the convex polygon is 100. The answer is: $100$

Assistant:

 The expression $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2)$ is equal to zero if and only if either $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$.
This means that either $\vert x + y \vert = 10$, $\vert x - y \vert = 10$, $\vert x \vert = 8$, or $\vert y \vert = 8$.
These four conditions describe the sides of a square with side length 16. Therefore, the area of the convex polygon is $16^2 = 256$. The answer is: $256$

To accomplish this, first determine a sympy-based approach for solving the problem by listing each step to take and what functions need to be called in each step. Be clear so even an idiot can follow your instructions, and remember, your final answer should be positive integer, not an algebraic expression!
Write the entire script covering all the steps (use comments and document it well) and print the result. After solving the problem, output the final numerical answer within \boxed{}.

Assistant: 

Interesting, let's analyze step by step:



1. The equation $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ is true only when $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. This means $x + y = \pm10$ and $x - y = \pm10$.

2. Solving these four equations, we get the vertices of the polygon: $(8, 2)$, $(8, -2)$, $(-8, 2)$, and $(-8, -2)$.

3. The polygon is a square with side length 16. So, the area is $16^2 = 256$.

So the area of the convex polygon is 256. The sympy-based approach would involve defining the equations, solving them to find the vertices of the polygon, and then calculating the area of the square.

    solutions2 = solve([abs(x + y) + 10, abs(x - y) + 10], (x, y))
    solutions3 = solve([abs(x + y) - 10, abs(x - y) + 10], (x, y))
    solutions4 = solve([abs(x + y) + 10, abs(x - y) - 10], (x, y))

    # Get the vertices of the polygon
    vertices = solutions1 + solutions2 + solutions3 + solutions4

    # The side length of the square

This doesn't seem to be correct. Let's reevaluate the problem:

Assistant: 

Interesting, let's analyze step by step:



The equation $A \cdot B = 0$ implies that either $A = 0$ or $B = 0$. Therefore, we need to solve the following two systems of equations:

1. $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + (\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$
2. $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + (\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$

From the first equation, we have $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. This implies that $x + y = \pm 10$ and $x - y = \pm 10$. Solving these four systems of equations, we get the vertices of the polygon as $(0, 10)$, $(0, -10)$, $(10, 0)$, and $(-10, 0)$.

From the second equation, we have $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$. This implies that $x = \pm 8$ and $y = \pm 8$. Solving these four systems of equations, we get the vertices of the polygon as $(8, 8)$, $(8, -8)$, $(-8, 8)$, and $(-8, -8)$.

The polygon is a square with side length 10 (the maximum of the absolute values of x and y from the first equation). To find the area of the square, we simply square the side length, so the area is $10^2 = 100$.

So, the area of the convex polygon is 100. The answer is: $100$

Assistant:

 The given equation is a product of two expressions equal to zero. Therefore, either the first expression is zero or the second expression is zero. 

The first expression is zero when either $|x + y| - 10 = 0$ or $|x - y| - 10 = 0$. These simplify to $|x + y| = 10$ and $|x - y| = 10$. The solutions to these equations are the lines $x + y = 10$, $x + y = -10$, $x - y = 10$, and $x - y = -10$.

The second expression is zero when either $|x| - 8 = 0$ or $|y| - 8 = 0$. These simplify to $|x| = 8$ and $|y| = 8$. The solutions to these equations are the lines $x = 8$, $x = -8$, $y = 8$, and $y = -8$.

These lines form a rectangle with sides of length 16 and 20. The area of this rectangle is $16 \times 20 = 320$. 

So, the area of the convex polygon is 320. The answer is: $320$

Interesting, let's analyze step by step:



The expression is $0$ if and only if at least one of the factors is $0$. Therefore, we have four cases to consider:

1. $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$.
2. $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$.
3. $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$.
4. $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$.

For each case, we find the solutions and plot them on the coordinate plane.

1. For the first case, $\vert x + y \vert = 10$, which implies $x + y = 10$ or $x + y = -10$.
2. For the second case, $\vert x - y \vert = 10$, which implies $x - y = 10$ or $x - y = -10$.
3. For the third case, $\vert x \vert = 8$, which implies $x = 8$ or $x = -8$.
4. For the fourth case, $\vert y \vert = 8$, which implies $y = 8$ or $y = -8$.

Plotting these lines on the coordinate plane, we find that they enclose a rectangle with side lengths $16$ and $20$. The area of this rectangle is $16 \times 20 = 320$.

So the area of the convex polygon is $320$. The answer is: $320$

Assistant: 

Interesting, let's analyze step by step:



We start with a problem where we need to find the area of the polygon formed by the set of points $(x, y)$ that satisfy the equation $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$. 

The first thing to note is that the product of two numbers is zero if and only if at least one of the numbers is zero. This gives us two cases to consider:

1. Either $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2) = 0$ or $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$.
2. Both $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2) = 0$ and $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$.

For the first case, we have two equations: $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ and $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$. This implies that $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. The solutions to these equations form a square with side length 20.

For the second case, we have $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ and $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$. This implies that $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$. The solutions to these equations form a square with side length 16.

The union of the solutions to these two cases forms the convex polygon we are looking for. To find its area, we simply add the areas of the two squares:

Area = $(20)^2 + (16)^2 = 400 + 256 = 656$.

So the area of the convex polygon is 656 square units. The answer is: $656$

Interesting, let's analyze step by step:



The expression $A = ((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2)$ is equal to zero if and only if at least one of the factors is zero. This gives us four cases to consider:

3. $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$, which implies $\vert x \vert = 8$.
4. $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$, which implies $\vert y \vert = 8$.

Let's analyze each case:

1. $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ implies $x + y = \pm 10$ or $x + y = 0$. This gives us two lines: $x + y = 10$ and $x + y = -10$.
2. $\vert x - y \vert = 10$ implies $x - y = \pm 10$ or $x - y = 0$. This gives us two more lines: $x - y = 10$ and $x - y = -10$.
3. $\vert x \vert = 8$ implies $x = 8$ or $x = -8$. This gives us two lines: $x = 8$ and $x = -8$.
4. $\vert y \vert = 8$ implies $y = 8$ or $y = -8$. This gives us two more lines: $y = 8$ and $y = -8$.

The intersection of these lines forms a square with side length 10. The area of this square is $10^2 = 100$. So, the area of the convex polygon is 100.
The answer is: $100$
