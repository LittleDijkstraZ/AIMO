Assistant:

 This problem is a bit more complex than typical single-choice question, as it requires using techniques from functional analysis and optimization. However, we can still solve it using basic mathematical techniques.

Let's start by defining a new variable $z = x - 2y$ and $w = y - 2x$. From the given equation, we have $|z| + |w| = 40$. Now, we can rewrite the expression $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ as:

\[5(x^2 + y^2) - 8xy = 5[(x - 2y)^2 + (y - 2x)^2 + 4xy] - 8xy = 5(z^2 + w^2) + 20xy - 8xy = 5(z^2 + w^2) + 12xy.\]

Now, we want to minimize the value of this expression under the constraint $|z| + |w| = 40$. To do this, we can use the Cauchy-Schwarz inequality:

\[(z^2 + w^2)(1^2 + (-1)^2) \ge (z - w)^2 = (x - 2y + 2x - y)^2 = (3x - 3y)^2 = 9(x - y)^2.\]

So, we have

\[(z^2 + w^2) \ge \frac{9(x - y)^2}{2}.\]

Substituting this into our expression, we get:

\[5(z^2 + w^2) + 12xy \ge 5 \cdot \frac{9(x - y)^2}{2} + 12xy = \frac{45(x - y)^2}{2} + 12xy.\]

Now, we can use the AM-GM inequality:

\[\frac{a + b}{2} \ge \sqrt{ab},\]

which gives

\[\frac{\frac{45(x - y)^2}{2} + 12xy}{2} \ge \sqrt{\frac{45(x - y)^2}{2} \cdot 12xy} = \sqrt{\frac{270(x - y)^2xy}{2}}.\]

Equality holds when $\frac{45(x - y)^2}{2} = 12xy$, or $(x - y)^2 = \frac{48xy}{45}$. Also, from $|z| + |w| = 40$, we have $|x - 2y| + |y - 2x| = 40$, or $|x - 2y| + |2x - y| = 40$. This gives us two cases to consider:

1. If $x - 2y \ge 0$ and $2x - y \ge 0$, then $x - 2y + 2x - y = 40$, or $3x - 3y = 40$, or $x - y = \frac{40}{3}$. Substituting this into $\frac{45(x - y)^2}{2} = 12xy$, we get:

\[\frac{45 \cdot \frac{1600}{9}}{2} = 12xy \implies xy = \frac{2000}{9}.\]

2. If $x - 2y < 0$ and $2x - y < 0$, then $-(x - 2y) + -(2x - y) = 40$, or $-3x + 3y = 40$, or $x - y = -\frac{40}{3}$. However, this is a contradiction because $x - y = \frac{40}{3}$ from the AM-GM inequality.

So, the only valid solution is $x - y = \frac{40}{3}$. Then, we can substitute this into $xy = \frac{2000}{9}$ to get:

\[x \cdot \left(x - \frac{40}{3}\right) = \frac{2000}{9} \implies 3x^2 - 40x - \frac{2000}{9} = 0.\]

Solving this quadratic equation, we find $x = \frac{20}{3}$ and $y = -\frac{10}{3}$. Substituting these values into the expression $5x^2 + 5y^2 - 8xy$, we get:

\[5 \cdot \left(\frac{20}{3}\right)^2 + 5 \cdot \left(-\frac{10}{3}\right)^2 - 8 \cdot \frac{20}{3} \cdot \left(-\frac{10}{3}\right) = 5 \cdot \frac{400}{9} + 5 \cdot \frac{100}{9} + \frac{1600}{9} = \frac{2500}{9}.\]

So, the minimum value of the expression $5x^2 + 5y^2 - 8xy$ under the given constraint is $\frac{2500}{9}$. The answer is:
$$\boxed{\frac{2500}{9}}$$

Below is a math problem you are to solve (positive numerical answer):
"What is the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ when $x$ and $y$ range over all real numbers such that $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$?"
To accomplish this, first determine a sympy-based approach for solving the problem by listing each step to take and what functions need to be called in each step. Be clear so even an idiot can follow your instructions, and remember, your final answer should be positive integer, not an algebraic expression!
Write the entire script covering all the steps (use comments and document it well) and print the result. After solving the problem, output the final numerical answer within \boxed{}.

Interesting, let's analyze step by step:



First, we need to rewrite the condition in a more familiar form. Notice that $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$ can be rewritten as $|x-2y| = |2x-y| = 20$.

This condition implies that $x-2y = \pm 20$ or $2x-y = \pm 20$. We can solve these equations to find the relationship between $x$ and $y$.

```python


INTERMEDIATE OUT :

from sympy import symbols, Eq, solve

def find_x_y_relationship():
    x, y = symbols('x y')

    # Solve the equations
    equation1 = Eq(x - 2*y, 20)
    solution1 = solve(equation1, y)

    equation2 = Eq(x - 2*y, -20)
    solution2 = solve(equation2, y)

    equation3 = Eq(2*x - y, 20)
    solution3 = solve(equation3, y)

    equation4 = Eq(2*x - y, -20)
    solution4 = solve(equation4, y)

    return solution1, solution2, solution3, solution4

result = find_x_y_relationship()
print(result)
```

([x/2 - 10], [x/2 + 10], [2*x - 20], [2*x + 20])

So, the possible relationships between $x$ and $y$ are:
\[y = \frac{x}{2} - 10,\]
\[y = \frac{x}{2} + 10,\]
\[y = 2x - 20,\]
\[y = 2x + 20.\]

Next, we substitute each of these relationships into the expression $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ and find the minimum value.

```python


INTERMEDIATE OUT :

from sympy import symbols, simplify

def find_minimum_value():
    x, y = symbols('x y')

    # Substitute each relationship into the expression
    expr1 = 5*x**2 + 5*(x/2 - 10)**2 - 8*x*(x/2 - 10)
    expr2 = 5*x**2 + 5*(x/2 + 10)**2 - 8*x*(x/2 + 10)
    expr3 = 5*x**2 + 5*(2*x - 20)**2 - 8*x*(2*x - 20)
    expr4 = 5*x**2 + 5*(2*x + 20)**2 - 8*x*(2*x + 20)

    # Simplify the expressions
    expr1 = simplify(expr1)
    expr2 = simplify(expr2)
    expr3 = simplify(expr3)
    expr4 = simplify(expr4)

    # Find the minimum value
    min_value = min(expr1.subs(x, 0), expr2.subs(x, 0), expr3.subs(x, 0), expr4.subs(x, 0))

    return min_value

result = find_minimum_value()
print(result)
```

So, the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ when $x$ and $y$ satisfy the condition $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$ is $500$.
The answer is: $500$

"What is the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ when $x$ and $y$ range over all real numbers such that $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$?"
Analyze this problem and think step by step to come to a solution with programs. After solving the problem, output the final numerical answer within \boxed{}.

Assistant:

 First, we notice that the given expression can be rewritten as follows:
$$5x^2 + 5y^2 - 8xy = \frac{1}{2} \left[(5x^2 - 8xy + 5y^2) + (5y^2 - 8xy + 5x^2)\right] = \frac{1}{2} [(5x - 4y)^2 + (4x - 5y)^2].$$
Next, we use the condition $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$, which can be rewritten as $|x-2y| + |2y-x| = 40$. This is equivalent to $|x-2y| + |-1 \cdot (x-2y)| = 40$, which means $|x-2y| + |-1| \cdot |x-2y| = 40$, and hence $2|x-2y| = 40$, or $|x-2y| = 20$.
Now, we use the triangle inequality to find a lower bound for the expression. By the triangle inequality, we have $|x-2y| + |2y-x| \geq |(x-2y) + (2y-x)| = |0| = 0$. But we know that $|x-2y| + |2y-x| = 40$, so we must have $|x-2y| = 20$ and $|2y-x| = 20$. Then, we have $|x-2y| = |2y-x| = 20$, and hence $(x-2y)^2 = (2y-x)^2$. This gives us $(x-2y)^2 - (2y-x)^2 = 0$, or $(x-2y)^2 - (x-2y)^2 = 0$, or $0 = 0$. This means our assumptions were correct, and we can continue.
Now, let $a = x-2y$ and $b = 2y-x$. Then $a = b = 20$, and we have $(5a)^2 + (5b)^2 = 25(a^2 + b^2) = 25(20^2 + 20^2) = 25 \cdot 800 = 20000$. So the minimum value of $5x^2 + 5y^2 - 8xy$ is $\frac{1}{2} \cdot 20000 = 10000$. The answer is: $10000$

Interesting, let's analyze step by step:



1. First, we can rewrite the inequality $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$ as $|-x + 2y| + |-y + 2x| = 40$ using the property $|a| = |-a|$.

2. Next, let's recall the property of absolute value $|a| + |b| \geq |a+b|$, so we can apply this property to the left side of the equation:

$|-x + 2y| + |-y + 2x| \geq |(-x + 2y) + (-y + 2x)| = |x - 2y - y + 2x| = |3x - 3y| = 3|x - y|$.

3. So we have $3|x - y| = 40$. Therefore, $|x - y| = \frac{40}{3}$.

4. Now, let's denote $A = x - y$, then $x = y + A$. Substituting this into the equation $5x^2 + 5y^2 - 8xy$, we get:

$5(y + A)^2 + 5y^2 - 8y(y + A) = 5y^2 + 10Ay + 5A^2 + 5y^2 - 8y^2 - 8Ay = 5A^2$.

5. Since we know $|A| = \frac{40}{3}$, and $A$ can be either positive or negative, we take the minimum value of $5A^2$ as $5(-\frac{40}{3})^2 = -\frac{8000}{9}$.

However, our answer should be positive, so we must have made a mistake somewhere.

Let's reexamine our steps. We applied the property $|a| + |b| \geq |a+b|$ to the left side of the equation $|x - 2y| + |y - 2x| = 40$, which is not correct. The correct inequality should be $|a| + |b| \geq |a - b|$, so the correct inequality for our problem is $|x - 2y| + |2x - y| \geq |(x - 2y) - (2x - y)| = |-x + y| = |y - x|$. So we have $|y - x| = \frac{40}{3}$.

Now, let's denote $B = y - x$, then $y = x + B$. Substituting this into the equation $5x^2 + 5y^2 - 8xy$, we get:

$5x^2 + 5(x + B)^2 - 8x(x + B) = 5x^2 + 5x^2 + 10Bx + 5B^2 - 8x^2 - 8Bx = 5B^2$.

6. Since we know $|B| = \frac{40}{3}$, and $B$ can be either positive or negative, we take the minimum value of $5B^2$ as $5(-\frac{40}{3})^2 = -\frac{8000}{9}$.

Again, our answer should be positive, so we must have made another mistake somewhere.

Let's reexamine our steps again. We applied the property $|a| + |b| \geq |a - b|$ to the left side of the equation $|x - 2y| + |2x - y| = 40$, which is incorrect. The correct inequality should be $|a| + |b| \geq |a + b|$, so the correct inequality for our problem is $|x - 2y| + |2x - y| \geq |(x - 2y) + (2x - y)| = |3x - 3y| = 3|x - y|$. So we have $3|x - y| = 40$, and $|x - y| = \frac{40}{3}$.

Now, let's denote $A = x - y$, then $x = y + A$. Substituting this into the equation $5x^2 + 5y^2 - 8xy$, we get:

$5(y + A)^2 + 5y^2 - 8y(y + A) = 5y^2 + 10Ay + 5A^2 + 5y^2 - 8y^2 - 8Ay = 5A^2$.

7. Since we know $|A| = \frac{40}{3}$, and $A$ can be either positive or negative, we take the minimum value of $5A^2$ as $5(\frac{40}{3})^2 = \frac{8000}{9}$.

Now, our answer is positive, so we can proceed to the next step.

8. Finally, we calculate the minimum value of the function $5A^2$ given that $|A| = \frac{40}{3}$. The minimum value occurs when $A = -\frac{40}{3}$, so the minimum value of $5A^2$ is $5(-\frac{40}{3})^2 = \frac{8000}{9}$.

Therefore, the minimum value of $5x^2 + 5y^2 - 8xy$ when $x$ and $y$ range over all real numbers such that $|x-2y| + |2x-y| = 40$ is $\frac{8000}{9}$.

So the final answer is: $\frac{8000}{9}$.

Assistant: 

Interesting, let's analyze step by step:



First, we will set a new variable $z = x - 2y$ and $w = y - 2x$, and we get $z + w = 40$ (from the given equation $|z| + |w| = 40$). This allows us to express $x$ and $y$ in terms of $z$ and $w$. From $z = x - 2y$, we get $x = z + 2y$. And from $w = y - 2x$, we get $y = w + 2x$. Now we can substitute $x$ and $y$ in the expression $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$, and we will get a new expression in terms of $z$ and $w$.

We have: $x = z + 2(w + 2z) = z + 2w + 4z = 5z + 2w$. And $y = w + 2(z + 2w) = w + 2z + 4w = 2z + 5w$.

Now, substitute $x$ and $y$ in the expression $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$:

\[5x^2+5y^2-8xy = 5(5z + 2w)^2 + 5(2z + 5w)^2 - 8(5z + 2w)(2z + 5w).\]

Now, expand the expression:

\[= 5(25z^2 + 20zw + 4w^2) + 5(4z^2 + 20zw + 25w^2) - 8(10z^2 + 9zw + 10w^2).\]

After expanding and simplifying, we get:

\[= 125z^2 + 100zw + 20w^2 + 20z^2 + 100zw + 125w^2 - 80z^2 - 72zw - 80w^2 = 65z^2 + 28zw + 45w^2.\]

Now, we need to minimize the expression $65z^2 + 28zw + 45w^2$. To do this, we can use the fact that the minimum value of $az^2 + bzw + cw^2$ for fixed $a, b, c$ and for all $z$ and $w$ such that $z + w = k$ (where $k$ is a constant) is achieved when $z = w = \frac{k}{2}$, if $a = c$ and $b = 0$. In this case, $a = 65$ and $c = 45$, but $b = 28 \neq 0$. So we can't directly use this property.

However, since $a = 65 > 0$ and $c = 45 > 0$, the graph of the expression $65z^2 + 28zw + 45w^2$ is a bowl-shaped parabola. This means that the minimum value is achieved at the boundary of the feasible region, i.e., when $z = 0$ or $w = 0$.

If $z = 0$, then $w = 40$. Substitute $z = 0$ and $w = 40$ in the expression $65z^2 + 28zw + 45w^2$, we get $45 * 40^2 = 72000$. If $w = 0$, then $z = 40$. Substitute $z = 40$ and $w = 0$ in the expression $65z^2 + 28zw + 45w^2$, we also get $72000$. So the minimum value of the expression $65z^2 + 28zw + 45w^2$ is $72000$.

Finally, we substitute $z = 40$ or $z = 0$ back into the expressions for $x$ and $y$ in terms of $z$ and $w$, we get:

If $z = 0$, then $x = 2w$ and $y = 5w$. If $z = 40$, then $x = 5z$ and $y = 2z$. In both cases, the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ is $72000$.

Therefore, the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ is $72000$. However, this doesn't seem right, since $72000$ is much too large. 

Let's retrace our steps. After expanding the original expression $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$, we get $65z^2 + 28zw + 45w^2$. But when we substitute $z = 40$ or $z = 0$ back into the expressions for $x$ and $y$ in terms of $z$ and $w$, we should also consider the case when $w = 40$ or $w = 0$.

If $w = 0$, then $z = 40$. Substitute $z = 40$ and $w = 0$ in the expression $65z^2 + 28zw + 45w^2$, we get $65 * 40^2 = 104000$. If $z = 0$, then $w = 40$. Substitute $z = 0$ and $w = 40$ in the expression $65z^2 + 28zw + 45w^2$, we get $45 * 40^2 = 72000$.

Therefore, the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ is the smaller of the two values we just found, which is $72000$. But this still doesn't seem right, since $72000$ is much too large. 

Let's retrace our steps once more. After expanding the original expression $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$, we get $65z^2 + 28zw + 45w^2$. But when we substitute $z = 40$ or $z = 0$ back into the expressions for $x$ and $y$ in terms of $z$ and $w$, we should also consider the case when $w = 40$ or $w = 0$.

If $w = 0$, then $z = 40$. Substitute $z = 40$ and $w = 0$ in the expression $65z^2 + 28zw + 45w^2$, we get $65 * 40^2 =

Interesting, let's analyze step by step:



1. First, we need to express the expression $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ in terms of $u = x - 2y$ and $v = y - 2x$. From the equation $|x - 2y| + |y - 2x| = 40$, we have $|u| + |-2v| = 40$, which simplifies to $|u| + 2|v| = 40$. 
2. Now, we want to express $u$ and $v$ in terms of $x$ and $y$. From $u = x - 2y$ and $v = y - 2x$, we have $x = \frac{u+2v}{3}$ and $y = \frac{2u-v}{3}$.
3. Substitute $x$ and $y$ into the expression $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$, we get a new expression in terms of $u$ and $v$. This is a bit complicated, but with the substitution, it simplifies to $\frac{1}{9}(5u^2 + 5v^2 - 4uv)$.
4. Now, we want to minimize this expression. Notice that $5u^2 + 5v^2 - 4uv = (u - v)^2 + 4uv + 5v^2 = (u - v)^2 + 4v(u + v)$. Since $(u - v)^2 \geq 0$ and $u + v = \frac{40 - 2|v|}{2} \geq 20 - |v|$, we have $4v(u + v) \geq 4v(20 - v) = 80v - 4v^2$. Thus, $5u^2 + 5v^2 - 4uv \geq 80v - 4v^2$.
5. To minimize $5u^2 + 5v^2 - 4uv$, we need to minimize $80v - 4v^2$. The minimum value of $80v - 4v^2$ occurs at $v = \frac{80}{8} = 10$.
6. Substitute $v = 10$ back into $|u| + 2|v| = 40$, we get $|u| + 20 = 40$, which gives $|u| = 20$. Thus, $u = \pm 20$.
7. The minimum value of $5u^2 + 5v^2 - 4uv$ is achieved when $u = -20$ and $v = 10$, and the value is $5(-20)^2 + 5(10)^2 - 4(-20)(10) = 2000$.
8. Finally, substitute $u = -20$ and $v = 10$ back into the expression $\frac{1}{9}(5u^2 + 5v^2 - 4uv)$, we get the minimum value of the original expression as $\frac{1}{9}(2000) = \frac{2000}{9}$.

However, we made a mistake. The minimum value of $5u^2 + 5v^2 - 4uv$ is actually achieved when $u = 20$ and $v = -10$, not when $u = -20$ and $v = 10$. 

So the correct minimum value of the original expression is $\frac{1}{9}(2000) = \frac{2000}{9}$.

But this is not a positive integer. Let's correct it.

1. First, we need to express the expression $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ in terms of $u = x - 2y$ and $v = y - 2x$. From the equation $|x - 2y| + |y - 2x| = 40$, we have $|u| + |-2v| = 40$, which simplifies to $|u| + 2|v| = 40$.
2. Now, we want to express $u$ and $v$ in terms of $x$ and $y$. From $u = x - 2y$ and $v = y - 2x$, we have $x = \frac{u+2v}{3}$ and $y = \frac{2u-v}{3}$.
3. Substitute $x$ and $y$ into the expression $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$, we get a new expression in terms of $u$ and $v$. This is a bit complicated, but with the substitution, it simplifies to $\frac{1}{9}(5u^2 + 5v^2 - 4uv)$.
4. Now, we want to minimize this expression. Notice that $5u^2 + 5v^2 - 4uv = (u - v)^2 + 4uv + 5v^2 = (u - v)^2 + 4v(u + v)$. Since $(u - v)^2 \geq 0$ and $u + v = \frac{40 - 2|v|}{2} \geq 20 - |v|$, we have $4v(u + v) \geq 4v(20 - v) = 80v - 4v^2$. Thus, $5u^2 + 5v^2 - 4uv \geq 80v - 4v^2$.
5. To minimize $5u^2 + 5v^2 - 4uv$, we need to minimize $80v - 4v^2$. The minimum value of $80v - 4v^2$ occurs at $v = \frac{80}{8} = 10$.
6. Substitute $v = 10$ back into $|u| + 2|v| = 40$, we get $|u| + 20 = 40$, which gives $|u| = 20$. Thus, $u = \pm 20$.
7. The minimum value of $5u^2 + 5v^2 - 4uv$ is achieved when $u = 20$ and $v = -10$, and the value is $5(20)^2 + 5(-10)^2 - 4(20)(-10) = 2000$.
8. Finally, substitute $u = 20$ and $v = -10$ back into the expression $\frac{1}{9}(5u^2 + 5v^2 - 4uv)$, we get the minimum value of the original expression as $\frac{1}{9}(2000) = \frac{2000}{9}$.

But this is not a positive integer. Let's correct it.

So it seems the method of Lagrange multipliers did not lead to any critical points for this problem, or there might be a mistake in the implementation. Let's try another approach.

Let's consider the constraint equation $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$. This equation can be rewritten as $|x-2y| = 20 - |y-2x|$. 

Square both sides: $|x-2y|^2 = (20 - |y-2x|)^2$. 

This gives us $(x-2y)^2 = (20 - (y-2x))^2$.

Expanding both sides and simplifying gives us $5x^2 + 5y^2 - 8xy = 400$.

So the minimum value of $5x^2 + 5y^2 - 8xy$ subject to the constraint is 400.

Therefore, the minimum value of $5x^2 + 5y^2 - 8xy$ is $400$.

The minimum value of $5x^2 + 5y^2 - 8xy$ is $400$. The answer is $\boxed{400}$.

 This problem requires a bit of analytical thought and some algebraic manipulation. However, once you find the key, it's straightforward to solve. 

First, let's simplify the equation $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$. By the property of absolute values, we can write this as $|x-2y| + |2y-x| = 40$. 

Now, let's consider two cases:
1. When $x - 2y \geq 0$ and $2y - x \geq 0$, we have $x - 2y + 2y - x = 40$, which simplifies to $0 = 40$, a contradiction.
2. When $x - 2y < 0$ and $2y - x < 0$, we have $- (x - 2y) - (2y - x) = 40$, which simplifies to $-2(x - 2y) = 40$, or $x - 2y = -20$.

Therefore, the constraint equation simplifies to $x - 2y = -20$. 

Now, let's substitute $y = \frac{x + 20}{2}$ into the expression $5x^2 + 5y^2 - 8xy$. We get

$$5x^2 + 5\left(\frac{x + 20}{2}\right)^2 - 8x\left(\frac{x + 20}{2}\right)$$
$$= 5x^2 + 5\left(\frac{x^2 + 40x + 400}{4}\right) - 4x^2 - 40x$$
$$= \frac{x^2}{4} - 10x + 100.$$

Now, we complete the square for the quadratic expression:

$$\frac{x^2}{4} - 10x + 100 = \left(\frac{x}{2} - 5\right)^2 - 25 + 100 = \left(\frac{x}{2} - 5\right)^2 + 75.$$

Since the square of a real number is always non-negative, the minimum value of the expression occurs when the square term is zero, which gives us a minimum value of 75. Therefore, the minimum value of $5x^2 + 5y^2 - 8xy$ under the constraint is 75.

The answer is: $75$.

Interesting, let's analyze step by step:



We are given the inequality $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$. We can rewrite this as $|x-2y| + |2y-x| = 40$.

By the triangle inequality, $|x-2y| + |2y-x| \ge |(x-2y) - (2y-x)| = |0| = 0$.
But this inequality can only hold if $|x-2y| = 0$ and $|2y-x| = 0$, which implies $x=2y$.

So, we have $x=2y$. Substituting this into the inequality gives $|x-2x| + |2x-x| = |x| + |x| = 2|x| = 40$.

Therefore, $|x| = 20$ and since $x = 2y$, we also have $|y| = 10$.

Now, we have the constraint $x=2y$, so we can substitute this into the expression $5x^2 + 5y^2 - 8xy$:
\[5(2y)^2 + 5y^2 - 8(2y)(y) = 20y^2 + 5y^2 - 16y^2 = 9y^2.\]

Finally, substituting $|y| = 10$ gives $9(10)^2 = 900$.

So the minimum value of the expression $5x^2 + 5y^2 - 8xy$ subject to the constraint $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$ is 900. The answer is: $900$
