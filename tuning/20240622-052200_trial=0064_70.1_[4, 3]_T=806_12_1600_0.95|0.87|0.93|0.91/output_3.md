Below is a math problem you are to solve (positive numerical answer):
"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"
To accomplish this, first determine a sympy-based approach for solving the problem by listing each step to take and what functions need to be called in each step. Be clear so even an idiot can follow your instructions, and remember, your final answer should be positive integer, not an algebraic expression!
Write the entire script covering all the steps (use comments and document it well) and print the result. After solving the problem, output the final numerical answer within \boxed{}.

Interesting, let's analyze step by step:



First, we need to solve the equation $ ((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$. This equation is equal to zero if either of the two factors is equal to zero. This gives us two systems of equations to solve:

1. $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ and $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$.
2. $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ and $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$.

For the first system, we have $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x \vert = 8$. This gives us the four lines $x + y = 10$, $x + y = -10$, $x = 8$, and $x = -8$.

For the second system, we have $\vert x - y \vert = 10$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$. This gives us the four lines $x - y = 10$, $x - y = -10$, $y = 8$, and $y = -8$.

These lines enclose a square with side length 16. The area of this square is $16^2 = 256$. So the area of the convex polygon is 256. The answer is: $256$

Interesting, let's analyze step by step:



1. First, let's consider the function $f(x, y) = ((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2)$. The function $f(x, y) = 0$ if and only if at least one of the factors is zero. 

2. Each factor is a product of two squares, so it's zero if and only if each square is zero. This gives us four systems of equations to solve:

   a. $\vert x + y \vert - 10 = 0$ and $\vert x - y \vert - 10 = 0$
   b. $\vert x + y \vert - 10 = 0$ and $\vert x \vert - 8 = 0$
   c. $\vert x - y \vert - 10 = 0$ and $\vert x \vert - 8 = 0$
   d. $\vert x \vert - 8 = 0$ and $\vert y \vert - 8 = 0$

3. Each of these systems of equations can be solved using the properties of absolute value. For example, the system in a gives $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$, which implies $x + y = \pm 10$ and $x - y = \pm 10$. Solving these gives the vertices of the polygon.

4. Once we have the vertices of the polygon, we can calculate the area using the shoelace formula or by finding the lengths of the sides and using the formula for the area of a polygon.

Let's now write a Python script to calculate the area:

```python


INTERMEDIATE OUT :

from sympy import symbols, Abs, solveset, S

def polygon_area():
    x, y = symbols('x y')

    # Solve each system of equations
    solutions_a = solveset((Abs(x + y) - 10, Abs(x - y) - 10), (x, y), domain=S.Reals)
    solutions_b = solveset((Abs(x + y) - 10, Abs(x) - 8), (x, y), domain=S.Reals)
    solutions_c = solveset((Abs(x - y) - 10, Abs(x) - 8), (x, y), domain=S.Reals)
    solutions_d = solveset((Abs(x) - 8, Abs(y) - 8), (x, y), domain=S.Reals)

    # Extract the vertices of the polygon
    vertices = list(solutions_a) + list(solutions_b) + list(solutions_c) + list(solutions_d)

    # Calculate the area using the shoelace formula
    area = 0
    for i in range(len(vertices)):
        area += vertices[i-1][0]*vertices[i][1] - vertices[i-1][1]*vertices[i][0]
    area = abs(area / 2)

    return area

result = polygon_area()
print(result)
```

Traceback (most recent call last):

```
It seems there was an error in the script. Let's re-evaluate the problem.

The error is in the `solveset` function, which is not able to solve the absolute value equations directly. Instead, we can solve them by considering the four cases separately:

1. For $\vert x + y \vert - 10 = 0$ and $\vert x - y \vert - 10 = 0$, we have $x + y = \pm 10$ and $x - y = \pm 10$. Solving these gives the vertices $(5, 5)$, $(5, -5)$, $(-5, 5)$, and $(-5, -5)$.

2. For $\vert x + y \vert - 10 = 0$ and $\vert x \vert - 8 = 0$, we have $x + y = \pm 10$ and $x = \pm 8$. Solving these gives the vertices $(8, 2)$, $(8, -18)$, $(-8, 18)$, and $(-8, -2)$.

3. For $\vert x - y \vert - 10 = 0$ and $\vert x \vert - 8 = 0$, we have $x - y = \pm 10$ and $x = \pm 8$. Solving these gives the same vertices as in case 2, but with the order of the coordinates reversed.

4. For $\vert x \vert - 8 = 0$ and $\vert y \vert - 8 = 0$, we have $x = \pm 8$ and $y = \pm 8$. This gives the vertices $(8, 8)$, $(8, -8)$, $(-8, 8)$, and $(-8, -8)$.

Now we can calculate the area using the shoelace formula or by finding the lengths of the sides and using the formula for the area of a polygon. The shoelace formula gives:

$Area = \frac{1}{2} \cdot \sum_{i=0}^{n-1} (x_i y_{i+1} - x_{i+1} y_i)$

where $(x_i, y_i)$ are the vertices of the polygon, and the indices are taken modulo $n$. For this polygon, the vertices are $(5, 5)$, $(5, -5)$, $(8, 2)$, $(8, -18)$, $(-5, 5)$, $(-5, -5)$, $(-8, 18)$, $(-8, -2)$, $(8, 8)$, $(8, -8)$, $(-8, 8)$, and $(-8, -8)$. Let's calculate the area:

```python


INTERMEDIATE OUT :

def shoelace_formula(vertices):
    n = len(vertices)
    area = 0
    for i in range(n):
        area += vertices[i][0]*vertices[(i+1)%n][1] - vertices[i][1]*vertices[(i+1)%n][0]
    return abs(area / 2)

vertices = [(5, 5), (5, -5), (8, 2), (8, -18), (-5, 5), (-5, -5), (-8, 18), (-8, -2), (8, 8), (8, -8), (-8, 8), (-8, -8)]
area = shoelace_formula(vertices)
print(area

Below is a math problem you are to solve (positive numerical answer!):
"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"
Analyze this problem and think step by step to come to a solution with programs. After solving the problem, output the final numerical answer within \boxed{}.

Assistant:

 The given equation is a product of two terms, and it equals to zero if and only if at least one of the terms equals to zero. Therefore, we have two cases:

1. $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$. This implies that $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ or $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. The solutions to these equations are all points on a square with side length 20.
2. $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$. This implies that $\vert x \vert = 8$ or $\vert y \vert = 8$. The solutions to these equations are all points on a square with side length 16.

The intersection of these two squares is the convex polygon we are looking for. The area of this convex polygon is the area of the larger square minus the area of the smaller square.

The area of a square with side length $a$ is $a^2$. Therefore, the area of the larger square is $20^2 = 400$, and the area of the smaller square is $16^2 = 256$. 

So, the area of the convex polygon is $400 - 256 = 144$. The answer is: $\boxed{144}$

Interesting, let's analyze step by step:



1. The product of two numbers is zero if and only if at least one of the numbers is zero. Thus, the equation is equivalent to the system of equations:
\[((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2) = 0\]
\[((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0\]

2. Each of the above equations implies that $\vert x + y \vert = 10$, $\vert x - y \vert = 10$, $\vert x \vert = 8$, and $\vert y \vert = 8$.

3. Solving these equations separately, we find that the first two equations are satisfied by all points $(x, y)$ such that $\max\{|x|, |y|\} = 8$, and the second two equations are satisfied by all points $(x, y)$ such that $|x + y| = 10$ and $|x - y| = 10$.

4. The points $(x, y)$ that satisfy both conditions form a square with side length $10\sqrt{2}$. Thus, the area of the square is $(10\sqrt{2})^2 = 200$.

So the area of the convex polygon is 200.

The answer is: $200$

Interesting, let's analyze step by step:



1. The equation $A \cdot B = 0$ is equivalent to $A = 0$ or $B = 0$. Thus, we have two cases to consider: 
   a) $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$
   b) $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$

2. In the first case, we have $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ and $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$. This implies $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. The solutions to these equations are given by the lines $x + y = 10$, $x + y = -10$, $x - y = 10$, and $x - y = -10$. These lines form a rectangle.

3. In the second case, we have $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ and $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$. This implies $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$. The solutions to these equations are given by the lines $x = 8$, $x = -8$, $y = 8$, and $y = -8$. These lines form a square.

4. The intersection of the rectangle and the square is the convex polygon we are looking for. The vertices of the polygon are the points where the lines intersect. By solving the system of equations, we find that the vertices are $(8,8)$, $(8,-8)$, $(-8,8)$, and $(-8,-8)$.

5. To find the area of the polygon, we simply calculate the area of the square with side length 16: $16^2 = 256$. 

Therefore, the area of the convex polygon is 256.

The python code to solve this problem would look something like this:

```python


INTERMEDIATE OUT :

def polygon_area():
    # The side length of the square is 16
    side_length = 16
    # The area of the square is side_length^2
    area = side_length**2
    return area

result = polygon_area()
print(result)
```

256

CODE RESULTS 256

INTERMEDIATE OUT :
```output
256
```
The area of the convex polygon is 256. The answer is: $256$

Interesting, let's analyze step by step:



The expression $A = ((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2)$ is equal to zero if and only if at least one of the factors is equal to zero. This gives us four conditions:

1. $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$.
2. $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$.

Each of these conditions implies that the absolute values equal to certain values:

1. $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ or $\vert x \vert = 8$.
2. $\vert x - y \vert = 10$ or $\vert y \vert = 8$.

These conditions describe a square with side length 16. The vertices of the square are $(\pm8, 0)$, $(0, \pm8)$, and $(\pm8, \pm8)$. The area of this square is $16^2 = 256$.

So the area of the convex polygon is $256$. The answer is: $256$
