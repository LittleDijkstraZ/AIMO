Below is a math problem you are to solve (positive numerical answer):
"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"
To accomplish this, first determine a sympy-based approach for solving the problem by listing each step to take and what functions need to be called in each step. Be clear so even an idiot can follow your instructions, and remember, your final answer should be positive integer, not an algebraic expression!
Write the entire script covering all the steps (use comments and document it well) and print the result. After solving the problem, output the final numerical answer within \boxed{}.

Interesting, let's analyze step by step:



The product of two numbers is zero if and only if at least one of them is zero. So, the given equation is equivalent to

$$((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2) = 0$$
or
$$((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0.$$
The second equation is satisfied only if $x = y = 8$ or $x = y = -8$. The first equation is satisfied if and only if $|x+y| = 10$ and $|x-y| = 10$. This is only possible if $x = 8$ and $y = 8$ or $x = -8$ and $y = -8$. So, the polygon consists of four points: $(8,8)$, $(8,-8)$, $(-8,8)$, and $(-8,-8)$. These points form a square with side length 16. The area of this square is $16^2 = 256$.

So the area of the polygon is $256$. The answer is: $256$

 The equation $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + (\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ implies that $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$.
This means that $x + y = \pm 10$ and $x - y = \pm 10$, which gives us four lines: $x + y = 10$, $x + y = -10$, $x - y = 10$, and $x - y = -10$.
Similarly, the equation $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + (\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ implies that $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$, which gives us four lines: $x = 8$, $x = -8$, $y = 8$, and $y = -8$.
The intersection of these lines forms a square with side length 16. Therefore, the area of the convex polygon is $16^2 = 256$.
The answer is: $256$.

 This problem might seem complex at first, but it can be simplified with the following rules:

- For a product to be 0, one or both factors must be 0.
- $|x|$ is the absolute value of $x$, which is always nonnegative.

Now let's analyze the factors:

1. $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2) = 0$

This factor equals 0 when both $\vert x + y \vert - 10 = 0$ and $\vert x - y \vert - 10 = 0$, which means $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. 

These equations represent a square with side length 10 units centered at the origin.

2. $((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$

This factor equals 0 when both $\vert x \vert - 8 = 0$ and $\vert y \vert - 8 = 0$, which means $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$. 

These equations represent a square with side length 16 units centered at the origin.

The intersection of these two squares is the convex polygon we are looking for. This polygon is a square with side length 10 units (the smaller square), because the larger square includes the smaller square.

The area of a square is given by the formula $side^2$, so the area of the convex polygon is $10^2 = 100$ square units.

So, the area of the convex polygon is $\boxed{100}$.

This problem is a bit tricky because it involves absolute values and complex equations. However, by applying the rules of algebra and geometry, we were able to simplify the problem and find the solution. The key was to recognize that the product of two factors equals zero when at least one of the factors is zero. And by analyzing the factors separately, we found that the points that satisfy both conditions form a square with side length 10 units. So the area of this square is $10^2 = 100$ square units. The answer is: $100$

1. The equation provides the condition that the product of two quadratics equals zero. This means that each quadratic must equal zero, i.e., $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$.

2. Solving these equations, we find that the possible values for $(x, y)$ are $(8, 8)$, $(-8, 8)$, $(8, -8)$, and $(-8, -8)$.

3. These four points form a square with side length 16, so the area of the square is $16^2 = 256$.
