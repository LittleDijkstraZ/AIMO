Below is a math problem you are to solve (positive numerical answer):
"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"
To accomplish this, first determine a sympy-based approach for solving the problem by listing each step to take and what functions need to be called in each step. Be clear so even an idiot can follow your instructions, and remember, your final answer should be positive integer, not an algebraic expression!
Write the entire script covering all the steps (use comments and document it well) and print the result. After solving the problem, output the final numerical answer within \boxed{}.

Assistant: 

Interesting, let's analyze step by step:



The equation given in the problem is a product of two terms equal to zero. This means that either the first term is zero or the second term is zero. 

Let's consider the first term: $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2) = 0$. This term equals zero when both $\vert x + y \vert - 10 = 0$ and $\vert x - y \vert - 10 = 0$. Solving these two equations, we get that the only solution is when $x = y = 10$.

Similarly, for the second term: $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$. This term equals zero when both $\vert x \vert - 8 = 0$ and $\vert y \vert - 8 = 0$. Solving these two equations, we get that the only solution is when $x = y = 8$.

Therefore, the points satisfying the equation are $(10, 10)$ and $(8, 8)$. These two points form a line segment, which is a polygon with area zero.

So the area of the convex polygon is 0. The answer is: $0$

"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"

 The given equation is a product of two terms equal to zero. Therefore, either the first term is zero or the second term is zero.

If the first term is zero, we have:
$$(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + (\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0.$$
Since the square of a real number is always non-negative, the only way this equation can be true is if both $\vert x + y \vert - 10 = 0$ and $\vert x - y \vert - 10 = 0$. This means $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$.

If the second term is zero, we have:
$$(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + (\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0.$$
Again, the only way this equation can be true is if both $\vert x \vert - 8 = 0$ and $\vert y \vert - 8 = 0$. This means $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$.

From the first set of equations, we have $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. This means that the points $(x, y)$ lie on a square with side length $10$.

From the second set of equations, we have $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$. This means that the points $(x, y)$ lie on a square with side length $16$.

The intersection of these two sets of points is the set of points that satisfy both conditions, which is the square with side length $10$.

To find the area of this square, we use the formula for the area of a square, which is side length squared. So the area of the square is $10^2 = 100$.

Therefore, the area of the convex polygon formed by the points $(x, y)$ that satisfy the given equation is $100$. The answer is: $100$

Interesting, let's analyze step by step:



The equation given is a product of two expressions equal to zero. This means that either the first expression is zero or the second expression is zero. Let's denote the two expressions as $A$ and $B$:

$A = ((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)$

$B = ((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2)$

Either $A = 0$ or $B = 0$.

If $A = 0$, then $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ and $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$. This implies that $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. Solving these equations gives us $x = \pm 10$ and $y = \pm 10$.

If $B = 0$, then $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ and $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$. This implies that $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$. Solving these equations gives us $x = \pm 8$ and $y = \pm 8$.

So the points satisfying the equation are the vertices of a square with side length $20$ (from $(-10, -10)$ to $(10, 10)$) and another square with side length $16$ (from $(-8, -8)$ to $(8, 8)$).

The area of a square is given by the square of its side length. Therefore, the area of the larger square is $20^2 = 400$, and the area of the smaller square is $16^2 = 256$.

The area of the convex polygon formed by the union of these two squares is the sum of their areas: $400 + 256 = 656$.

So the area of the convex polygon is $656$.

The answer is: $656$

Interesting, let's analyze step by step:



The equation $A \cdot B = 0$ is true if and only if either $A = 0$ or $B = 0$. Thus, the given equation is equivalent to the union of the following two sets of points:

1. The points $(x, y)$ that satisfy $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$.
2. The points $(x, y)$ that satisfy $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$.

For the first set of points, we have $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ and $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$. This implies that $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. The solutions to these equations are the points that form a square with side length 20.

For the second set of points, we have $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ and $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$. This implies that $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$. The solutions to these equations are the points that form a square with side length 16.

The union of these two sets of points is a rectangle with side lengths 20 and 16. The area of this rectangle is $20 \times 16 = 320$.

So the area of the convex polygon is 320.
The answer is: $320$

Interesting, let's analyze step by step:



1. The product of two numbers is zero if and only if at least one of the numbers is zero. Thus, the equation $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$.

2. The equation $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ implies $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$, which means $x + y = \pm 10$ and $x - y = \pm 10$. Solving these four equations, we get the vertices of the polygon as $(0, 10)$, $(0, -10)$, $(10, 0)$, and $(-10, 0)$.

3. The equation $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ implies $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$, which means $x = \pm 8$ and $y = \pm 8$. Solving these four equations, we get the vertices of the polygon as $(8, 0)$, $(-8, 0)$, $(0, 8)$, and $(0, -8)$.

4. Combining both sets of vertices, we get the vertices of the polygon as $(0, 10)$, $(0, -10)$, $(10, 0)$, $(-10, 0)$, $(8, 0)$, $(-8, 0)$, $(0, 8)$, and $(0, -8)$.

5. Plotting these vertices on a graph, we can see that they form a square with side length 10.

6. The area of a square is given by the square of the length of its side. Therefore, the area of the square is $10^2 = 100$.

So, the area of the convex polygon is 100.

The answer is: $100$

Interesting, let's analyze step by step:



The given equation is a product of two terms equal to zero. Hence, either the first term is zero or the second term is zero. Let's analyze these two cases separately.

Case 1: $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$. This implies that $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. The solutions to these equations are all the points $(x, y)$ that are at a distance of 10 from the origin in the x-y plane. This forms a square with side length 20.

Case 2: $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$. This implies that $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$. The solutions to these equations are all the points $(x, y)$ that are at a distance of 8 from the origin in the x-y plane in both x and y directions. This forms a square with side length 16.

Now, the intersection of these two cases is the convex polygon we are looking for. The intersection of the two squares is another square with side length 8.

The area of a square is given by side length squared. So, the area of the convex polygon is $8^2 = 64$.

Therefore, the area of the convex polygon is 64.

The answer is: $64$

 The equation given in the problem, $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$, is satisfied only when either of the two factors is zero. 

The first factor is zero when either $\vert x + y \vert - 10 = 0$ or $\vert x - y \vert - 10 = 0$, which simplifies to $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ or $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. These are the equations of two lines passing through the origin making an angle of $45^\circ$ with the x and y axes respectively.

The second factor is zero when either $\vert x \vert - 8 = 0$ or $\vert y \vert - 8 = 0$, which simplifies to $\vert x \vert = 8$ or $\vert y \vert = 8$. These are the equations of two lines parallel to the y and x axes respectively, at a distance of 8 units from the origin.

The intersection points of these lines form a square with side length 16 units. Therefore, the area of the convex polygon is $16^2 = 256$ square units. The answer is: $256$

The equation $AB=0$ implies that either $A=0$ or $B=0$. So we have two cases to consider:

Case 1: $ ((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2) = 0$.
This happens when $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. The solution set to these equations are the lines $x + y = 10$ and $x - y = 10$.

Case 2: $ ((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$.
This happens when $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$. The solution set to these equations are the lines $x = 8$ and $y = 8$.

Assistant: 

Interesting, let's analyze step by step:



The given equation is a product of two terms equal to zero. Therefore, either the first term is zero or the second term is zero. This gives us two systems of equations to solve:

1. $\vert x + y \vert - 10 = 0$ and $\vert x - y \vert - 10 = 0$
2. $\vert x \vert - 8 = 0$ and $\vert y \vert - 8 = 0$

For the first system, we have:
$\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$
This implies that $x + y = \pm 10$ and $x - y = \pm 10$. Solving these equations, we get the vertices of the polygon: $(0, 10), (0, -10), (10, 0), (-10, 0)$.

For the second system, we have:
$\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$
This implies that $x = \pm 8$ and $y = \pm 8$. Solving these equations, we get the vertices of the polygon: $(8, 8), (8, -8), (-8, 8), (-8, -8)$.

Now, we can plot these points on a coordinate plane to visualize the polygon. It turns out to be a square with side length 10. The area of a square is given by the square of its side length, so the area of this square is $10^2 = 100$.

Therefore, the area of the convex polygon is 100 square units. The answer is: $100$
