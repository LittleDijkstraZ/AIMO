Below is a math problem you are to solve (positive numerical answer):
"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"
To accomplish this, first determine a sympy-based approach for solving the problem by listing each step to take and what functions need to be called in each step. Be clear so even an idiot can follow your instructions, and remember, your final answer should be positive integer, not an algebraic expression!
Write the entire script covering all the steps (use comments and document it well) and print the result. After solving the problem, output the final numerical answer within \boxed{}.

Interesting, let's analyze step by step:



First, we need to find the points that satisfy the equation $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + (\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + (\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$.

Let's start with the first equation:

The equation $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ implies that $\vert x + y \vert = 10$. This equation is satisfied when $x + y = 10$ or $x + y = -10$.

The equation $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ implies that $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. This equation is satisfied when $x - y = 10$ or $x - y = -10$.

So, we have four lines: $x + y = 10$, $x + y = -10$, $x - y = 10$, and $x - y = -10$.

Now, let's analyze the second equation:

The equation $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ implies that $\vert x \vert = 8$. This equation is satisfied when $x = 8$ or $x = -8$.

The equation $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ implies that $\vert y \vert = 8$. This equation is satisfied when $y = 8$ or $y = -8$.

So, we have four lines: $x = 8$, $x = -8$, $y = 8$, and $y = -8$.

The intersection points of these lines form a square with side length 16.

The area of this square is $16^2 = 256$.

So the area of the convex polygon is $256$.

The python code to calculate this would be (note: this code is not needed to solve the problem but to obtain the numerical answer):
```python


INTERMEDIATE OUT :

import math

def polygon_area():
    # side length of the square
    side_length = 16

    # area of the square
    area = side_length**2

    return area

result = polygon_area()
print(result)
```

256

CODE RESULTS 256

INTERMEDIATE OUT :
```output
256
```
The area of the convex polygon is $256$. The answer is: $256$

Interesting, let's analyze step by step:



The condition of the problem can be written in the form of two equations: $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ and $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$, and $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ and $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$.

Each of the equations above implies $\vert x + y \vert = 10$, $\vert x - y \vert = 10$, $\vert x \vert = 8$, and $\vert y \vert = 8$, respectively.

Solving these equations, we have $x + y = \pm 10$, $x - y = \pm 10$, $x = \pm 8$, and $y = \pm 8$. These equations define eight points in the coordinate plane: (8, 2), (8, -2), (-8, 2), (-8, -2), (2, 8), (-2, 8), (2, -8), and (-2, -8).

Connecting these points in order, we get a square with side length 16. Therefore, the area of this convex polygon is $16^2 = 256$. The positive numerical answer is $256$.

Now let's write a python script to calculate the area:

```python


INTERMEDIATE OUT :

def polygon_area():
    side_length = 16
    area = side_length ** 2
    return area

result = polygon_area()
print(result)
```

256

CODE RESULTS 256

INTERMEDIATE OUT :
```output
256
```
The area of the convex polygon is 256 square units. The answer is: $256$
