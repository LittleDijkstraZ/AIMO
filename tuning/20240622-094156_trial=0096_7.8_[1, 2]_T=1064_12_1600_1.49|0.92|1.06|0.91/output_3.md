Below is a math problem you are to solve (positive numerical answer):
"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"
To accomplish this, first determine a sympy-based approach for solving the problem by listing each step to take and what functions need to be called in each step. Be clear so even an idiot can follow your instructions, and remember, your final answer should be positive integer, not an algebraic expression!

Interesting, let's analyze step by step:



First, we should note that the only way for the product of two numbers to be 0 is if at least one of the numbers is 0. So the given equation equals 0 if either of the following holds:
\[((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2) = 0,\]
or 
\[((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0.\]

The solutions for these equations are all integer coordinates within a circle of radius 10 around the origin and all integer coordinates within a circle of radius 8 around the origin, respectively. These points together form the vertices of a convex polygon.

To calculate the area of this polygon, we can calculate the area of the rectangle that contains this polygon, and then subtract the areas of the two circles that are outside the polygon.

The rectangle is centered at the origin with side lengths of $21$ by $17$ (since the maximum and minimum values for $x$ and $y$ are $10+8=18$ and $10-8=2$, respectively, plus their negatives), so its area is $21*17=357$.

The first circle has radius $10$ and encloses an area of $\pi*10^2=100\pi$, and the second circle has radius $8$ and encloses an area of $\pi*8^2=64\pi$, for an overall enclosed area of $164\pi$.

Therefore, the area of our polygon is $357-164\pi$, which doesn't match our desired goal of a numeric integer value. We have clearly made a mistake in our analysis or calculation steps.

Upon revisiting the problem and our solution steps, we realize the following issues:

1. We assumed the vertices of the polygon will form a rectangle, which is incorrect. The points will form a shape of an 'eight', a combination of two overlapping squares.
2. While the first equation indeed forms a circle with radius $10$, the second equation does not form a circle with radius $8$, but two disjoint squares, each of side length $16$.

Now let's solve the problem again with the corrected steps:

1. The points from the first equation form a circle of radius $10$ around the origin. The points from the second equation form two squares of side length $16$, one in the first and third quadrants, and one in the second and fourth quadrants.
2. To find the area of the polygon, we first calculate the area of the square with side length $16$, which equals $16^2=256$. There are two such squares, so their combined area is $2*256=512$.
3. Next, we calculate the area of the circle with radius $10$, which equals $\pi*10^2=100\pi$.
4. Now we subtract the area of the circle from the combined area of the two squares to find the area of the polygon: $512-100\pi$.

However, as $\pi$ is an irrational number, we need to approximate it to obtain a numeric result: $512-100\pi \approx 512 - 314.16 = 197.84$, which still does not match our goal of a numeric integer result.

It seems we have made a mistake somewhere, but we haven't found it yet. Let's check our calculations again.

Upon further examination of the steps, we realize that we have incorrectly subtracted the area of the circle from the combined area of the two squares. The polygon is actually the region enclosed by the two squares and the circle, so we need to subtract the areas of the two squares from the total area of the rectangle.

The rectangle that contains the polygon is still a $21$ by $17$ rectangle, for an area of $357$. The combined area of the two squares is $512$. So the area of the polygon is $357 - 512 = -155$. But the area cannot be negative. Where did we go wrong?

Upon revisiting the problem and our solution steps a third time, we realize that the polygon is actually formed by the intersection of the points from the first and second equations. This means we should have found the points that satisfy both equations.

The first equation actually forms a circle with radius $10$ around the origin, which is contained entirely within the square with side length $16$. Therefore, the intersection of the points from both equations is simply the circle with radius $10$ around the origin, for an area of $100\pi$.

So the corrected solution is:
The area of the convex polygon is the area of the circle with radius $10$ around the origin, which equals $100\pi$.

Since we have reached this conclusion, we should also check our initial solution steps to make sure there were no mistakes in those as well. Upon revisiting the solution steps, we realized we made a mistake in our calculation of the total area of the rectangle that contains the polygon. The rectangle contains the squares of side length $16$, not the circle of radius $10$. The dimensions of this rectangle should be $32$ by $32$ (since the maximum and minimum values for $x$ and $y$ are $16+10=26$ and $16-10=6$, respectively, plus their negatives), so its area is $32*32=1024$.

Now we can correct the solution once more:
The area of the convex polygon is the difference between the area of the square with side length $32$ and the combined area of the two circles. The combined area of the two circles is $100\pi$. So the area of the polygon is $1024 - 100\pi$.
Again, as $\pi$ is an irrational number, we need to approximate it to obtain a numeric result: $1024 - 100\pi \approx 1024 - 314.16 = 709.84$, which still does not match our goal of a numeric integer result.
It seems our approach is not suitable for this problem, and we need to rethink our solution approach.
After some time spent, it turns out we have been using the wrong interpretation of the 'and' operation in the original math problem. In mathematics, 'and' usually means multiplication, not addition. So the original equation should be interpreted as:
\[((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2) \cdot ((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0.\]
This equation is true if either of the following holds:
\[((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2) = 0,\]
or
\[((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y

Interesting, let's analyze step by step:



The equation is a product of two factors. The product is zero only if one (or both) of the factors is zero. Therefore, we have two cases to consider:
1) $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ and $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ and $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ and $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$.
2) Exactly one of the factors is zero.

From 1), we can conclude that $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$. These equations imply that the vertices of the polygon are the points where the absolute values are equal to their respective bounds, i.e., at $(\pm8, 0)$, $(0, \pm8)$, and $(\pm8, \pm8)$.

The polygon is a square with side length 16 (twice the bound of the absolute value), and its area is $16^2 = 256$. 

So the area of the convex polygon is 256. The answer is: $256$

Interesting, let's analyze step by step:



Firstly, it's clear that the equation holds true when at least one of its factors equals zero. 

Considering the first factor, either $\vert x + y \vert - 10 = 0$ or $\vert x - y \vert - 10 = 0$, which means either $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ or $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. This implies all the points that satisfy these conditions lie on the line $x + y = 10$ or $x - y = 10$.

Similarly for the second factor, either $\vert x \vert - 8 = 0$ or $\vert y \vert - 8 = 0$, meaning either $\vert x \vert = 8$ or $\vert y \vert = 8$, which corresponds to the lines $x = 8$ and $y = 8$.

The intersections of these lines forms a square with side length 6 (subtracting the offsets from the absolute value equations), because the square is bounded by $x + y = 10$, $x - y = 10$, $x = 8$, $y = 8$. Each side length can be found by simple arithmetic.

Finally, we compute the area of the square which is $6^2 = 36$.

```python


INTERMEDIATE OUT :

from sympy import *

def calculate_area():
    # Side length of the square
    side_length = 6

    # Area of the square
    area = side_length**2

    return area

result = calculate_area()
print(result)
```

36

The area of the convex polygon is $36$ square units. Since the problem asks for a positive numerical answer, our answer is $36$. Hence the answer is: $36$.

"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"

 The equation $AB = 0$ implies that $A = 0$ or $B = 0$. Therefore, the given equation is equivalent to either $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + (\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + (\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$.
The first equation implies $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$, which results in a square with side length $20$ (due to the parallelogram law for absolute values). The area of this square is $20^2 = 400$.
The second equation implies $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$, which results in a square with side length $16$ (due to the parallelogram law for absolute values). The area of this square is $16^2 = 256$.
The convex polygon is formed by the intersection of these two squares, so its area is the area of the smaller square, which is $256$.
Therefore, the area of the convex polygon is $256$. The answer is: $256$

"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"
Analyze this problem and think step by step to come to a solution with programs. After solving the problem, output the final numerical answer within \boxed{}.

Assistant:

 The equation given is
\[((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0.\]
The product of two quantities is zero if and only if at least one of the quantities is zero. So either 
\[(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0\]
or 
\[(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0.\]
For the first equation to be zero, we must have $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. 
This gives us four lines: $x + y = \pm10$ and $x - y = \pm10$.
The area enclosed by these lines is a square with side length 20, so the area is $20^2 = 400$.
For the second equation to be zero, we must have $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$. 
This gives us four lines: $x = \pm8$ and $y = \pm8$.
The area enclosed by these lines is a square with side length 16, so the area is $16^2 = 256$.
Therefore, the area of the convex polygon is $400 + 256 = 656$.

To compute the numerical answer, we use the following Python code:

```python


INTERMEDIATE OUT :

def area_of_polygon():
    """The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"""
    side_length_square1 = 20
    side_length_square2 = 16
    area_square1 = side_length_square1 ** 2
    area_square2 = side_length_square2 ** 2
    total_area = area_square1 + area_square2
    return total_area

result = area_of_polygon()

 This problem can be solved by analyzing the properties of absolute values and inequalities.
The equation $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ implies that $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$.
This means that $x + y = \pm10$ and $x - y = \pm10$.
Solving these four equations gives us the vertices of the rectangle $[-10, 10] \times [-10, 10]$.
The equation $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ implies that $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$,
so $x = \pm8$ and $y = \pm8$.
The four vertices are $(-8, -8)$, $(-8, 8)$, $(8, -8)$, and $(8, 8)$.
These points form a square with side length $16$. The area of the square is $16^2 = 256$. The solution is $\boxed{256}$.

Here is the Python code that calculates the area of the square:

```python


INTERMEDIATE OUT :

def square_area():
    """The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"""
    side_length = 16
