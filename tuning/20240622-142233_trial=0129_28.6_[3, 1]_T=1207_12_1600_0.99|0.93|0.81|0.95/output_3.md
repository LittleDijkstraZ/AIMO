Below is a math problem you are to solve (positive numerical answer!):
"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"
Analyze this problem and think step by step to come to a solution with programs. After solving the problem, output the final numerical answer within \boxed{}.

Assistant:

 The given equation is of the form $f(x,y) \cdot g(x,y) = 0$, which means that either $f(x,y) = 0$ or $g(x,y) = 0$. So the points $(x,y)$ that satisfy the equation must lie on the boundary of the regions defined by $f(x,y) = 0$ and $g(x,y) = 0$.

The function $f(x,y) = ((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)$ equals zero when $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ or $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. These are the equations of two squares with side length 20.

Similarly, the function $g(x,y) = ((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2)$ equals zero when $\vert x \vert = 8$ or $\vert y \vert = 8$. These are the equations of two squares with side length 16.

So the points $(x,y)$ that satisfy the equation form the union of four squares: two with side length 20 and two with side length 16. The convex polygon formed by these points is the outer boundary of these squares.

To find the area of this polygon, we simply add the areas of the four squares:

$$
\text{Area} = 2 \cdot (20^2) + 2 \cdot (16^2) = 2 \cdot 400 + 2 \cdot 256 = 800 + 512 = 1312.
$$

So the area of the convex polygon is 1312 square units. The answer is: $1312$

To accomplish this, first determine a sympy-based approach for solving the problem by listing each step to take and what functions need to be called in each step. Be clear so even an idiot can follow your instructions, and remember, your final answer should be positive integer, not an algebraic expression!
Write the entire script covering all the steps (use comments and document it well) and print the result. After solving the problem, output the final numerical answer within \boxed{}.

Assistant: 

Interesting, let's analyze step by step:



1. The given equation is a product of two terms equals zero, which means either of the terms should be zero. So, we have two sets of equations to solve: $|x+y| - 10 = 0$, $|x-y| - 10 = 0$, $|x| - 8 = 0$ and $|y| - 8 = 0$.

2. From $|x+y| - 10 = 0$, we have $|x+y| = 10$, which gives us two possibilities: $x+y = 10$ or $x+y = -10$.

3. From $|x-y| - 10 = 0$, we have $|x-y| = 10$, which gives us two possibilities: $x-y = 10$ or $x-y = -10$.

4. From $|x| - 8 = 0$, we have $|x| = 8$, which gives us two possibilities: $x = 8$ or $x = -8$.

5. From $|y| - 8 = 0$, we have $|y| = 8$, which gives us two possibilities: $y = 8$ or $y = -8$.

6. Solving these sets of equations will give us the vertices of the polygon.

7. To find the area of the polygon, we can use a cross product method.

8. The polygon is a square with side length 16.

9. The area of the square is $16^2 = 256$.

Now, let's write the whole script in python:

```python


INTERMEDIATE OUT :

def area_of_polygon():
    # The side length of the square is 16
    side_length = 16

    # The area of the square is side_length^2
    area = side_length**2

    return area

result = area_of_polygon()
print(result)
```

CODE RESULTS 256

INTERMEDIATE OUT :
```output
256
```
The area of the convex polygon is $256$. The answer is: $\boxed{256}$.

"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"

Assistant: 

Interesting, let's analyze step by step:



Step 1: Understand the problem

The given equation is $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + (\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + (\vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$. 

The solutions to this equation are the points that satisfy the equation. The solutions will form a set of points that encloses a convex polygon. The area of this polygon is what we are asked to find.

Step 2: Analyze the equation

The equation is a product of two terms set equal to zero. This means that either the first term equals zero or the second term equals zero. 

The first term is $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + (\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)$, and the second term is $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + (\vert y \vert - 8)^2)$. 

Each of these terms is a square of a quantity, so for each term to be zero, the quantity itself must be zero. 

For the first term to be zero, we have $\vert x + y \vert - 10 = 0$ and $\vert x - y \vert - 10 = 0$, which simplifies to $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$.

For the second term to be zero, we have $\vert x \vert - 8 = 0$ and $\vert y \vert - 8 = 0$, which simplifies to $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$.

Step 3: Solve the equations

The solutions to $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$ form a square with side length 20, centered at the origin. The vertices of this square are $(10,0), (0,10), (-10,0), (0,-10)$.

The solutions to $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$ form a square with side length 16, also centered at the origin. The vertices of this square are $(8,0), (0,8), (-8,0), (0,-8)$.

Step 4: Find the intersection of the two squares

The intersection of the two squares is the square with side length 8 and centered at the origin. The vertices of this square are $(4,0), (0,4), (-4,0), (0,-4)$.

Step 5: Calculate the area of the convex polygon

The area of the square with side length 8 is $8^2 = 64$.

So, the area of the convex polygon is 64.

The final solution is $\boxed{64}$.

Now, let's write the whole script to achieve the same result:

```python


INTERMEDIATE OUT :

from sympy import symbols, solve, Abs

def find_area():
    # Define the variables
    x, y = symbols('x y')

    # Equations
    eq1 = Abs(x + y) - 10
    eq2 = Abs(x - y) - 10
    eq3 = Abs(x) - 8
    eq4 = Abs(y) - 8

    # Solve the equations
    solutions1 = solve((eq1, eq2), (x, y))
    solutions2 = solve((eq3, eq4), (x, y))

    # Find the intersection of the solutions
    solutions = set(solutions1).intersection(set(solutions2))

    # Calculate the area of the convex polygon
    side_length = 8
    area = side_length**2

    return area

result = find_area()
print(result)
```

CODE RESULTS 64

INTERMEDIATE OUT :
```output
64
```
The area of the convex polygon is 64. The answer is: $64$

Interesting, let's analyze step by step:



1. The product of two numbers is zero if and only if at least one of the numbers is zero. Therefore, the given equation is equivalent to the system of equations:
   $$ ((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2) = 0 $$
   $$ ((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0 $$

2. From the first equation, we have $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. This means $x + y = 10$ or $x + y = -10$, and $x - y = 10$ or $x - y = -10$. By solving these four equations, we get the vertices of the polygon as $(0,10)$, $(0,-10)$, $(10,0)$, and $(-10,0)$.

3. From the second equation, we have $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$. This means $x = 8$ or $x = -8$, and $y = 8$ or $y = -8$. So the vertices of the polygon are also $(8,8)$, $(8,-8)$, $(-8,8)$, and $(-8,-8)$.

4. The polygon is a square with side length $10$.

5. To find the area of the square, use the formula $s^2$, where $s$ is the side length. Thus the area of the polygon is $10^2 = 100$.

So the area of the convex polygon is $100$. The answer is: $100$

Interesting, let's analyze step by step:



1. The expression $0$ equals only if at least one of the factors equals $0$. 
2. Therefore, we can set each factor equal to zero and solve the equations:

   - $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$, which implies $\vert x + y \vert = 10$. So $x + y = \pm 10$.
   - $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$, which implies $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. So $x - y = \pm 10$.
   - $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$, which implies $\vert x \vert = 8$. So $x = \pm 8$.
   - $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$, which implies $\vert y \vert = 8$. So $y = \pm 8$.

3. By solving these equations, we can find the vertices of the polygon: $(8,8)$, $(8,-8)$, $(-8,8)$, and $(-8,-8)$.
4. To find the area of the polygon, we can use the formula for the area of a rectangle and subtract the areas of the four right triangles that are formed by the lines connecting the vertices.
5. The rectangle has length $16$ and width $16$, so its area is $256$.
6. Each right triangle has base and height of $8$, so its area is $16$. Since there are four triangles, their total area is $64$.
7. The area of the convex polygon is then $256 - 64 = 192$.

So, the area of the convex polygon is $192$. The answer is: $192$

Assistant: 

Interesting, let's analyze step by step:



The problem asks for the area of the convex polygon enclosed by the points that satisfy the equation $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$.

1. The expression $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ is equal to 0 when either of the two products is equal to 0.

2. The first product is equal to 0 when either $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$. This implies that $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ or $\vert x - y \vert = 10$.

3. The second product is equal to 0 when either $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$. This implies that $\vert x \vert = 8$ or $\vert y \vert = 8$.

4. The absolute value equations can be rewritten as linear equations:
   - For $\vert x + y \vert = 10$, we get $x + y = 10$ or $x + y = -10$.
   - For $\vert x - y \vert = 10$, we get $x - y = 10$ or $x - y = -10$.
   - For $\vert x \vert = 8$, we get $x = 8$ or $x = -8$.
   - For $\vert y \vert = 8$, we get $y = 8$ or $y = -8$.

5. By solving these linear equations, we find the vertices of the polygon:
   - For $x + y = 10$ and $x = 8$, we get $y = 2$.
   - For $x + y = 10$ and $x = -8$, we get $y = 18$.
   - For $x + y = -10$ and $x = 8$, we get $y = -18$.
   - For $x + y = -10$ and $x = -8$, we get $y = -2$.
   - For $x - y = 10$ and $x = 8$, we get $y = -2$.
   - For $x - y = 10$ and $y = 8$, we get $x = 18$.
   - For $x - y = -10$ and $x = 8$, we get $y = 18$.
   - For $x - y = -10$ and $y = 8$, we get $x = -2$.

6. By plotting these vertices, we find that they form a square with side length of 16.

7. The area of a square is given by the side length squared, so the area of this square is $16^2 = 256$.

So the area of the convex polygon is 256.
The answer is: $256$
