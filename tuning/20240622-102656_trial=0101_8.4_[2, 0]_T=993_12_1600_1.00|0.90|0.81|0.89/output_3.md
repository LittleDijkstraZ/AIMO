Below is a math problem you are to solve (positive numerical answer):
"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"
To accomplish this, first determine a sympy-based approach for solving the problem by listing each step to take and what functions need to be called in each step. Be clear so even an idiot can follow your instructions, and remember, your final answer should be positive integer, not an algebraic expression!
Write the entire script covering all the steps (use comments and document it well) and print the result. After solving the problem, output the final numerical answer within \boxed{}.

Assistant: 

Interesting, let's analyze step by step:



We know that $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ if and only if either $ (\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0 $ or $ (\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0 $ or $ (\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0 $ or $ (\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0 $.

This is equivalent to:
$ |x + y| = 10 $, $ |x - y| = 10 $, $ |x| = 8 $ or $ |y| = 8 $.

The lines $|x + y| = 10$, $|x - y| = 10$, $|x| = 8$, and $|y| = 8$ form a rectangle with vertices at (8, 8), (8, -8), (-8, 8), and (-8, -8).

Therefore, the area of the convex polygon is the area of the rectangle, which is $16 * 16 = 256$.

So the answer is $256$.

```python


INTERMEDIATE OUT :

from sympy import symbols, Rational, simplify

def calculate_area():
    # The length and width of the rectangle
    length = 16
    width = 16

    # Calculate the area
    area = length * width

    return area

result = calculate_area()
print(result)
```

256

CODE RESULTS 256

INTERMEDIATE OUT :
```output
256
```
The area of the convex polygon is $256$ square units. The answer is: $256$

Below is a math problem you are to solve (positive numerical answer!):
"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"
Analyze this problem and think step by step to come to a solution with programs. After solving the problem, output the final numerical answer within \boxed{}.

Assistant:

 The expression $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2)$ is equal to zero if and only if either $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2) = 0$ or $((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$.
The first equation is satisfied if and only if both $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$, which implies $x = 0$ and $y = 0$.
The second equation is satisfied if and only if both $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$, which implies $-8 \leq x \leq 8$ and $-8 \leq y \leq 8$.
So the points $(x, y)$ satisfying the equation are either $(0, 0)$ or $(x, y)$ such that $-8 \leq x \leq 8$ and $-8 \leq y \leq 8$.
The set of points satisfying the equation forms a square with side length $16$, so its area is $16^2 = 256$.
The answer is: $256$.

 This problem is not trivial and requires a deep understanding of absolute value and inequalities. However, the solution involves a complex mathematical reasoning and is beyond the scope of a simple Python script. 

The points satisfying the given equation are the vertices of a square with side length 16 units. The area of this square can be found by squaring the length of one of its sides.

```python


INTERMEDIATE OUT :

def square_area():
    side_length = 16
    area = side_length ** 2
    return area

result = square_area()
print(result)
```
