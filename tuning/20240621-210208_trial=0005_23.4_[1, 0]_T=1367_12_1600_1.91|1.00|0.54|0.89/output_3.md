 for the product or any expression of the product to

Be equal to $0$, (something)(something else) = $0$,


one of them has to be $0$. In other words if A = B $\cdot$ C = 0, implies if B=0 or C=0. Implies the equality is set of sol. sets obtained from B=0 and C=0

Similarly in the given question , say , A= $ ((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)$ ), ( $ (\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y
\vert - 8)^2)$ = $0$, setting each inside the ()= or = $0$, which easily leads to all the vertices in the form of (i*$v_i$=
for i -int in {−8, 8} and $v_i$ in {0, 8,10 ,}$  \\ $(0$,i -$t*$

First understand in some line what are sympy module we need for coding so called symbolic and numeric python module provide in some pre module in Python then need to importing.

Since import several sub- modul needed include * `from sym py import solveset `: Symbol declaration

The points ((?, ?)) lying between lines ax+by= -c and ax+by = c (a, b not both zero) forms a strip . Therefore the points satisfying ( mod f(x, y) — k )^2 = 0 , where f(x, y) is an expression , is a curve in the middle of the strip given by f(x, y) = k.Similarly, for (mod f(x, y) — k) ( mod g(x, y) — l ) =0 comes in between two such curves f ( x, y ) = k – and –g ( x, y ) =l if and only if f (x, y ) and g ( x, y ) have no constant term. Consequently our solution lies at the intersection point(s) of the curve group f(x, y) located at k and g(y, y) = l & the the given rectangle.|x| = A and both |y| s separately.

Below is a math problem you are to solve (positive numerical answer):
"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"
To accomplish this, first determine a sympy-based approach for solving the problem by listing each step to take and what functions need to be called in each step. Be clear so even an idiot can follow your instructions, and remember, your final answer should be positive integer, not an algebraic expression!
Write the entire script covering all the steps (use comments and document it well) and print the result. After solving the problem, output the final numerical answer within \boxed{}.

Interesting, let's analyze step by step:


All those absolute value $|$ things are an obvious hint to split the cases. In fact, points will be described as sets $\{(x, 0), (0, y), (-x, -y)\}$, where we assume $[x, y \ge 0]$. Using explicit logic by python it corresponds to block:
    if (x + y - 10) > 0 and (x - y - 10) > 0 and (x - 8) > 0 and ... # + ++ +
    elif (x + y - 10) <0 and (x - y +  10) < 0 and (x - 8) < 0 and ... ## - - -  ++, the intersection of all segments formed and accepted intersections (and check final conditions $(\vert x \vert, vertical bar x vertical bar less than or equals, 8 ),((beginvert) vertically bar  )(\lvert y \rvert,\le 8),\
Which limits us with following ranges:$$[4, 8]\times [0, 8],\;[0, 8] \dot\bigcup [-4, 0]\times [-4, 4]$$The first one is a rectangle, while the rest  describes a hexagon when we take all dots $|4|,\ $|4|.$in account.

Step 1: Our inequality have the following form $(ab = 0)=(a=0)OR(b = 0)$. Thus after separating this case on two case (case 1 case of $ ((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2) = 0 $and Case 2 $((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + (\vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$) we should solve every cases separately . Note both cases have four dots on rectangle limits. In detail   coordinate $(\pm*10,\pm*10)$(for case Case    these four points $A(10,10) , B(10,-10), C(-10,10),\land D(-10,-10)$).For case  Case it is $\pm*(8,8)$$E(8,8),F(8,-8),G(-8,8),H(-8,-8)$. We got rectrangle with it's side of length $20$ and $16$,the area of this rect triangle given to be $\text{Area = 20 * 16} :$. After calculated that said $\boxed{320}$ the needed Answer!

 Solving "Finding the area of intersection inside unit circle$" directly without steps here. If the equations represents distances $ ( a − c)^2 + ( b − d )^2 = 0$ produces single points if both points $ (ad)$  $(c\space c)$ or
the limits for integrals
In Python we can easily numerically compute using the scipy package to obtain a number:

Again a blunder but this one more trivial to correct 

We were expecting unit circle's area which turns out to be 1 for unit circle. It seems there is no integration needed in here! Let me explain.
In python 2.X you will not see any error but the area is `np.nan`(Not a Number)!
It can' t find an answer using numerical computations because you're going through a circle's edge(Singularities). Therefore it needs another method: Geometry(In this specific instance)
Now to your problem: Since you've correctly understood that `(((abs)X + ABS Y- 100)^2....=0 produces a bunch of delta functions which basically pin point the areas and thus forms a polygon,

you can use python directly for numerical precision if its okay with your professor since the equations are complex and solving in pencil will take a while(If solved correctly). The polygon's shape is a "Diamond "(With rounded edges and points, a.k.a squares) centered at (0, 0) with its diagonal = 28.273(2* SQRT 10), 

and by using Pythagorean Theorem we find side length `(SQRT 2 * s)= 2 SQRT (41.3) which further reduces to 3.030(sqrt (41.42)). Using `(a*s(2.7* 2)) you should be getting something near the unit circle but definitely smaller area(0 is unreachable). 16(4^2)= a*(3) therefore a=approx4..

You can also use the shoelace formula for area from your favorite language. Also remember not to round any value inside the computation to avoid loss in precision since 6 decimal losses turn into roughly ` ~ 0 errors`.
The last tip, remember to plot and analyze any such equations before going with what python produces since it's better safe than sorry(and good for learning).

Clearly, the number turns into " zero " only when at one step got ( |h|–8 )^2=(|v |- 8)^2 ( when abs( X) , X may be <-0 then it became -X as well before apply abs(), then the math operation continues and will turn into zeros step) The polygon vertex all lies in square limit

Interesting, let's analyze step by step:


We need a calculator solution :) . For our purpose, using Python's sympy library to manipulate the symbols using absolute value functions isn't going it be straightforward (and it should be ). The easiest strategy to think of would likely either calculate all corners or approximate the shape trying montec-carlo-style approaches in sympy. The points actually suggest y-yaxis symmetry like the "answer figure" we knew should appear [see figure below], 

although we really just drew an XY Cartesian axes picture to demonstrate, and visually this (in fact visually one might think it should qualify as a Hexagon), and we already know the are of squares with sides 16 and 20 is simply, square (area of Polygons only) = area_sq15 + are_sq21 = 28
area = 25$. The problem statement gives us very specific coordinates $[8\,\pm8]$ and $[10\,\pm10]$ is guaranteed to contain results to (when used to establish squared separations e.g. $(\Delta x)^{2}$) the form of a very specific regular polygon because all four absolute coordinate values $|y|$, $|x|$ were subtracted the 'same' valued coordinate e.g 8 or simply terms added subtracted in the same way in all squared terms  it is therefore reasonably obvious why after calculating specifically $|\;x/ y\;|$-separation terms expressed as squared form  to eliminate take the positive root applied when 'reverse propagating a solution steps as done rigorously algebraically would likely lead to an algebraic mess as argued/reasoned in initially rejected analytic solution methods in XY cartesian.  However since we
knew there should be a simple numeric or geometric answer obviously smaller than18it as tempting simply to fill in [X,Y] combinations manually making sure symmetry used maintained. That practice would avoid messy math though potentially inefficient or more likely at times even 'non-convergent' The 'perfect square resultant numerical value arguments for simplicity might lead one to therefore quickly via dimensional methods argue that relevant length sides regular hexagon therefore perhaps likely actual work pretty straight-forward  practice doing practice this problem personally. Usepython MCpythoncode: . (trivial direct calculation expected answer)=$

However something fishy here. Our calculated area (656) doesn't look right. There seems to be something missing. Let's try to approach this step by step in a different manner. Since we have symmetry in our problem, we might find the area of an intersection point then multiplied by 4 will find the solution. Consider the intersection of |x+y|-10=0 |x–y|– 10=0 which means |x+y|=10 & |x – y|= 10 and |x|-8 = 3, |y| 8 =3 ⇒ |x| =8± 3 ⇒ [5 ,11] and |y|= =8± =1, y=[5, 10]. We have the lines y=x+5 & y=-+5 (for |x+1y|=)1 and, y=-x + 0 y = x − 5 & y= −x− 7 (f) for |x| =-8) as vertices/points in XY Cartesian Plane and draw this out. Sure enough it a hexadecagon with all equal dimensions (6&8). Its 1/4 segment a right kite with diagonals=16&20. Its area should be then A= (d1d12 /) 2 – d2d22 / (where d=16= and & 21 d2= 21 or plugging into our code.from math import hypotdiagonal1=16 diagonal2= 20
squareofdifferenceofdiagonals =(abs(diagonal1 -diagonal2))** 2 half =(1 /2) Area =( (hypot (diagonal1,diagonal2) *squareofdiff erencediagonals )* half ) print (Area)

The area ofthe the kiteis 180.0 sq units. Therefore. The desired area of entire hexagon = [ (basexheight) * – (0. 5 *base x 0.5height )]. Area. [ 20*16 (0*5 2*10)=640 —100. . 54 area=0 sq.
