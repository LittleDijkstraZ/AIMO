Below is a math problem you are to solve (positive numerical answer):
"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"
To accomplish this, first determine a sympy-based approach for solving the problem by listing each step to take and what functions need to be called in each step. Be clear so even an idiot can follow your instructions, and remember, your final answer should be positive integer, not an algebraic expression!
Write the entire script covering all the steps (use comments and document it well) and print the result. After solving the problem, output the final numerical answer within \boxed{}.

Interesting, let's analyze step by step:


$ ( (\vert x + y\vert-10)^2+( \vert x - y\vert-10)^2 )( ( \vert x \vert-8)^2+ ( \vert y \vert -8)^2) = 0.$ By the statement $(.)(.) = 0 \Rightarrow (.)=0 \quad$or $\quad (.)=0$, so we get the following four equations ( or two systems of equations in four equations, that you'll soon see ):
$$1): \quad (\vert x + y \vert -10)^2 =0$$ $$2): \quad (\vert x - y \vert -10)^2= 0$$ $$3): \quad (\vert x \vert - 8)^2 =0$$ $$4): \quad (\vert y \vert - 8)^2=0 $$ Using the property that states if $\vert A \vert =0 \Rightarrow A=0$, these four equations simplify to :
$$1'): \quad x + y = 10$$ $$2'): \quad x - y = 10 $$ $$3'): \quad \vert x \vert = 8 \Rightarrow x = \pm8.$$ $$4'): \quad \vert y \vert= 8 \Rightarrow y = \pm8.$$ By the intersection of the solution sets of $(1')-(4')$ you can figure out which points satisfy the aforementioned system of equations thus enclose the polygon. It won't take you longer than a minute or two! The set intersection yields 
$4$ vertexes, for $(8,8),(8,-8),(-8,8)$and $-8,-8)$ thus forming a square. You already found out the shape, how to find its area? Since you have all sides have equal length of 16 (Square!), then $Area:16^2=256, \textbf{output 256 as the positive numerical amount}$. (Square!)

Interesting, let's analyze step by step:

 We are looking at the point where both $x$ and $y$ satisfy one condition and another condition within each abs(), lets say these conditions are met when $func_1(x) = target_1$ and $func_2(x) = target_2$. This clearly is the area where all points satisfy $func_1(x) = target_1$ AND $func_2(x) = target_2$. This area where two different conditions have to be satisfied is like and of probability conditions aka intersection of two. This representation is kinda similar in style to the [area of intersection of circles problem ](https://youtu.be/2Ji9FKvMFqk). I am curious how to find such an area. Unfortunately, Sympy doesn't(currently?)support anything to directly calculate this area except boolean logic (not without careful manipulation).

So lets try to solve without much theory. In first abs statement inside first bracket, can set its value equal to zero. Which means $|\pm something| = 10 \to |{expression_1}| = 10$. We solve both $\pm$. Same applies for second abs bracket's value equated to zero and for the expression for abs inside in second bracket equated to 8. 

There might be some +/- related calculations involved and some trivial boundary conditions on x or y as absolute of anything cannot be negative, thus limiting/calculating search space to positive & negative parts for each variable (i hope you knew this...I do ). After some boundary, calculation point, of course including other axis involving $x = -y, x=y$, we basically calculate the intersection points of the four equations:
1. $\vert x+y \vert - 10 = 0 \& \vert x-y\vert - 10 = 0$
2. $\vert x+y \vert - 10 = 0 \& \vert y \vert - 8=0$
3. $\vert x-y\vert -10=0 \& \vert x \vert - 8=0$
The intersections would bound/ describe a 2D polygon. Now you have these four polygons of intersection of four pairs: In geometry/Cartesian plane this shape has two well-known special symmetries - diagonals, aka symmetries which cut the quadrilateral shape in sync to two-equilateral-triangle shape or a "square". If it doesn't the diagonals are distinct, some unequal. There square part you have to cut leaving those triangles there which give a diamond. Or like say trapezoid, that usually has two intersection heights so I wouldn't, or there is an option there the trapezoid reduced down into two triangles through median/lines. Finally taking an inclusive area we know its either a equalor unequal diognal square/Rectangle is to calculate it takes few mins from one area of either rectangle/ square using formula
Area = length * breadth (or all sides if in squared shape case), knowing that if it 3*10 then its rectangular other side can easily get by diagram if not given, then simply use (diagonal - 2 away side)sqrt {2} $ to calculate far side/breadth/length. Just in doubt know two triangle inside a bigger diamond...Hope was lucid..

area = (2*n0**min(2.0, 5))  +  2 *2 * (sqrt((n0)**min(2.0, 5)/ 2)**min(2.0, 5)) # n0 = 3 to get ans as a numeric value out of function only !

Assistant:

 The equation $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ satisfies the zero product property if and only if $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ or $( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$. Each of these equations implies that $\vert x + y \vert = 10$, $\vert x - y \vert = 10$, $\vert x \vert = 8$, or $\vert y \vert = 8$, respectively. These lines form a square with side length 16 units (since the distances from the origin to the lines $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$ are both 8).  So, the area of the enclosed polygon, which is simply the square, is $16^2 = 256$ square units. The answer is: 256

Interesting, let's analyze step by step:


Area cannot be negative so, (|x + y| − 10)² + (|x − y| − 10)² both will be greater or equals zero at any point. Then area(the desired set = intersection of (|x|−8)2+( |y|−8)2 which equals to zero only over origin (8,8) & any point both in both our cases. 
The desired set thus seems to be the point 'Origin'( 8,8)[the ONLY possible condition for our combined Intersect set equals to zero!) 
If our desired set is a degenerate set (i.e, just a Singury point. then Area ( A) =0. 
Also this fits out expectation because || (2√, 2√), is square, with diagonal of length = 16 root 2 implies side length 16 [by Pythagorean 4√2, with side parallel to either "x-axes" ; since slope is thus (for side parallel to axes is is defined only the respective axes i.e., for side | paallel to x* axes
My answer is as follows. Thank you again ! @garyloveguy !!!
Area= sqrt(((〖16√2)〗^2)/(2))
Area=32 square of unite (√). ∴32 unit sq. as the only option to take as area can't fit in negative √ sq as sq cannot remain radical (cannot remove root value from in radical

Assistant:

 Writing this out, we realize that either of the terms of the product is be equal to zero (as zero times any quantity is zero). That way, either of
$(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$, which means $\vert x + y \vert = 10$, hence $x+y = 10$ or $x + y = -10$. This consists of two lines in the plane: $x + y = 10$ and $x + y = -10$,
we also have
 $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$, hence,  $\vert x \vert = 8$, which means $x = 8$ or $x = -8$ , that cornes to $x = 8$, $x = -8$ . In order to have a polygon, both pairs of lines must be present, thus we end up with a para8lelogrim determined by four points: when x = ± 8 and y solves the corresponding equations for the lines above: thus we find the points:$(8, 2)$, $(−8, −2))$, $(−8, 2))$ and $(8, -2))$. With the altitute being 20 ($|8−(−2)| = 10$), the base being 16 ($|8−(−8)| = 16$), by definition of area, we can figure a rectangle, we multiply these, hence getting $\text{Area} = 20 * 16=320$, The answer is $320$, $\boxed{320}$.
