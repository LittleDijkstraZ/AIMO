Below is a math problem you are to solve (positive numerical answer!):
"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"
Analyze this problem and think step by step to come to a solution with programs. After solving the problem, output the final numerical answer within \boxed{}.

 The given equation is a product of two expressions equal to zero, so it is equal to zero when either of the expressions is zero. This gives us two sets of equations to solve:

1. $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ and $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ and $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ and $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$.
2. One of the expressions $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2$, $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2$, $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2$, or $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2$ is zero.

For the first set of equations, we have:
- $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$.
- This gives us the points $(8, 0)$, $(0, 8)$, $(-8, 0)$, and $(0, -8)$.

For the second set of equations, we have:
- If $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$, then $\vert x + y \vert = 10$. This gives us the line $x + y = 10$ and $x + y = -10$.
- If $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$, then $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. This gives us the line $x - y = 10$ and $x - y = -10$.
- If $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$, then $\vert x \vert = 8$. This gives us the lines $x = 8$ and $x = -8$.
- If $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$, then $\vert y \vert = 8$. This gives us the lines $y = 8$ and $y = -8$.

The eight lines intersect at the points $(8, 0)$, $(0, 8)$, $(-8, 0)$, and $(0, -8)$, forming a square with side length 16. The area of this square is $16^2 = 256$. Therefore, the area of the convex polygon is 256.

```python


INTERMEDIATE OUT :

def polygon_area():
    """The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"""
    # The side length of the square is the diameter of the circles defined by the absolute values.
    # 2*8 = 16 is the side length of the square.
    side_length = 2*8
    area = side_length ** 2
    return area

result = polygon_area()
print(result)
```

256

The area of the convex polygon is $256$. The answer is: $256$

Below is a math problem you are to solve (positive numerical answer):
"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"
To accomplish this, first determine a sympy-based approach for solving the problem by listing each step to take and what functions need to be called in each step. Be clear so even an idiot can follow your instructions, and remember, your final answer should be positive integer, not an algebraic expression!
Write the entire script covering all the steps (use comments and document it well) and print the result. After solving the problem, output the final numerical answer within \boxed{}.

Interesting, let's analyze step by step:



1. The product of two numbers is zero if and only if at least one of the numbers is zero. So, we have two cases to consider:
   a. $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$
   b. $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$

2. For case a, we have $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ or $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. This gives us four lines in the plane: $x + y = 10$, $x + y = -10$, $x - y = 10$, and $x - y = -10$.

3. For case b, we have $\vert x \vert = 8$ or $\vert y \vert = 8$. This gives us four lines in the plane: $x = 8$, $x = -8$, $y = 8$, and $y = -8$.

4. The intersection of these lines forms a square with side length 10.

5. The area of this square is $10^2 = 100$.

So, the area of the convex polygon is 100. The answer is: $100$.

Interesting, let's analyze step by step:



1. The expression equals zero if either of the two factors equals zero.
2. The first factor is zero if $|x+y| = 10$ or $|x-y| = 10$. These are the equations of two circles in the plane.
3. The second factor is zero if $|x| = 8$ or $|y| = 8$, which are also the equations of two circles in the plane.
4. The intersection of these four circles forms a square.
5. The side length of the square is 16 (since the distance from the origin to either of the points (8,0), (0,8), or (-8,0) is 8 sqrt(2) which simplifies to 16).
6. The area of the square is therefore $16^2 = 256$.

Now, let's write the python code to calculate the area of the square:

```python


INTERMEDIATE OUT :

def square_area():
    side_length = 16
    area = side_length ** 2
    return area

result = square_area()
print(result)
```

256

CODE RESULTS 256

INTERMEDIATE OUT :
```output
256
```
The area of the convex polygon is 256 square units. The answer is: $256$
