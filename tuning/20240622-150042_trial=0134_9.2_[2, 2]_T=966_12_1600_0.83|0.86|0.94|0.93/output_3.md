Below is a math problem you are to solve (positive numerical answer!):
"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"
Analyze this problem and think step by step to come to a solution with programs. After solving the problem, output the final numerical answer within \boxed{}.

 The given equation is equal to zero if and only if both of the factors are equal to zero. Therefore, we have the following four conditions:

1. $|x + y| - 10 = 0$, which implies $|x + y| = 10$.
2. $|x - y| - 10 = 0$, which implies $|x - y| = 10$.
3. $|x| - 8 = 0$, which implies $|x| = 8$.
4. $|y| - 8 = 0$, which implies $|y| = 8$.

From conditions 3 and 4, we have $-8 \leq x \leq 8$ and $-8 \leq y \leq 8$.

From condition 1, we have $|x + y| = 10$. This implies that $x + y = 10$ or $x + y = -10$. Similarly, from condition 2, we have $x - y = 10$ or $x - y = -10$.

By solving these equations, we find that the points $(x, y)$ that satisfy the conditions are:

1. $(8, 2)$, $(8, -2)$, $(-8, 2)$, and $(-8, -2)$.
2. $(5, 5)$, $(5, -5)$, $(-5, 5)$, and $(-5, -5)$.

These points form a square with side length 16. The area of this square is $16^2 = 256$. Therefore, the area of the convex polygon is 256 square units.

```python

    side_length = 16
    area = side_length ** 2
    return area

The equation given is a product of two terms equal to zero, which means either the first term is zero or the second term is zero. 

Let's consider the first term:
$$((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2) = 0.$$
This term is zero only when $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. These two equations represent two squares with side length 10 centered at the origin. The intersection of these two squares is a square with side length 10 and area $10^2 = 100$.

Now let's consider the second term:
$$((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0.$$
This term is zero only when $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$. These two equations represent two squares with side length 8 centered at the origin. The intersection of these two squares is a square with side length 8 and area $8^2 = 64$.

The convex polygon is the intersection of the two squares, so its area is the area of the smaller square, which is 64.

Therefore, the area of the convex polygon is 64. The answer is: $64$

"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"
To accomplish this, first determine a sympy-based approach for solving the problem by listing each step to take and what functions need to be called in each step. Be clear so even an idiot can follow your instructions, and remember, your final answer should be positive integer, not an algebraic expression!
Write the entire script covering all the steps (use comments and document it well) and print the result. After solving the problem, output the final numerical answer within \boxed{}.

Interesting, let's analyze step by step:



1. First, we need to understand that the product of two numbers is zero if and only if at least one of the numbers is zero. This means that either $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$.

2. If $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$, then $\vert x + y \vert = 10$, which implies that $x + y = 10$ or $x + y = -10$.

3. If $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$, then $\vert x - y \vert = 10$, which implies that $x - y = 10$ or $x - y = -10$.

4. If $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$, then $\vert x \vert = 8$, which implies that $x = 8$ or $x = -8$.

5. If $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$, then $\vert y \vert = 8$, which implies that $y = 8$ or $y = -8$.

6. The points that satisfy these conditions are the vertices of a square with side length 16.

7. The area of this square is $16^2 = 256$.

So, the area of the convex polygon is 256.

```python


INTERMEDIATE OUT :

from sympy import symbols, Rational, simplify

def area_of_polygon():
    # The side length of the square
    side_length = 16

    # Calculate the area of the square
    area = side_length**2

    return area

result = area_of_polygon()
print(result)
```

INTERMEDIATE OUT :
```output

```
The area of the convex polygon is $256$. The answer is $\boxed{256}$.
