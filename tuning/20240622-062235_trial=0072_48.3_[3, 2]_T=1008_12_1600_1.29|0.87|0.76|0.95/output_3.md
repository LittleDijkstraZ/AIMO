Below is a math problem you are to solve (positive numerical answer):
"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"
To accomplish this, first determine a sympy-based approach for solving the problem by listing each step to take and what functions need to be called in each step. Be clear so even an idiot can follow your instructions, and remember, your final answer should be positive integer, not an algebraic expression!
Write the entire script covering all the steps (use comments and document it well) and print the result. After solving the problem, output the final numerical answer within \boxed{}.

Assistant: 

Interesting, let's analyze step by step:



1. The equation is a product of two expressions equals zero, so either the first expression is zero or the second one is zero.
2. For the first expression $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$, this can only be true if $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. This implies that $x = 0$ and $y = 0$.
3. For the second expression $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$, this can only be true if $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$. This implies that $-8 \le x \le 8$ and $-8 \le y \le 8$.
4. So, the points $\left(x, y\right)$ that satisfy the original equation are all the points inside a square with side length 16 centered at the origin.
5. The area of this square is $16^2 = 256$. So the area of the convex polygon is 256.

Now let's solve this problem with Python and sympy:

```python


INTERMEDIATE OUT :

from sympy import symbols, integrate, simplify

def area_of_polygon():
    # Side length of the square
    side_length = 16
    # Area of the square
    area = side_length**2

    return area

result = area_of_polygon()
print(result)
```

256

CODE RESULTS 256

INTERMEDIATE OUT :
```output
256
```
The area of the convex polygon is $256$. The answer is: $256$

 This problem is asking for the area of the convex polygon formed by the points that satisfy the given equation. The equation involves absolute value functions, which means we need to consider different cases for the signs of the expressions inside the absolute value signs. After analyzing all possible cases, we find that the equation is satisfied only when both $|x+y|=10$ and $|x|=8$, or both $|x-y|=10$ and $|y|=8$. These conditions define two rectangles in the coordinate plane: one with vertices at $(8,0)$, $(8,16)$, $(-8,0)$, and $(-8,16)$, and the other with vertices at $(0,8)$, $(16,8)$, $(0,-8)$, and $(16,-8)$. The intersection of these two rectangles is the convex polygon we are looking for. This intersection is a square with side length 8. The area of this square is $8^2=64$. The answer is: $64$ square units.

Interesting, let's analyze step by step:



Step 1: Understand the problem
The problem asks for the area of the convex polygon formed by the points (x, y) that satisfy the equation: $ ((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$.

Step 2: Analyze the equation
The equation is the product of two expressions. If the product equals zero, either one or both of the expressions must equal zero. So we have two cases to consider:
Case 1: $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$
Case 2: $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$

For Case 1, both $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2$ and $( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2$ must be zero, which implies $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. This forms a square with side length 10.

For Case 2, both $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2$ and $( \vert y \vert - 8)^2$ must be zero, which implies $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$. This forms a square with side length 8.

Step 3: Find the area of the convex polygon
The convex polygon formed by the points (x, y) satisfying the given equation is the union of the squares from Case 1 and Case 2.

The area of a square with side length $a$ is $a^2$. So the area of the square from Case 1 is $10^2 = 100$, and the area of the square from Case 2 is $8^2 = 64$.

Adding these two areas, the total area of the convex polygon is $100 + 64 = 164$.
The answer is $\boxed{164}$.

Interesting, let's analyze step by step:



1. The equation given in the problem, $ ((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ implies that either one of the two factors is zero.

2. The first factor will be zero if either $\vert x + y \vert - 10 = 0$ or $\vert x - y \vert - 10 = 0$. In other words, it means $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ or $\vert x - y \vert = 10$.

3. The second factor will be zero if either $\vert x \vert - 8 = 0$ or $\vert y \vert - 8 = 0$, which implies $\vert x \vert = 8$ or $\vert y \vert = 8$.

4. We can solve these equations to get the points that satisfy the equation. For $\vert x + y \vert = 10$, we have $x + y = \pm 10$ and $x - y = \pm 10$. Solving these equations gives us a total of 8 points. Similarly, for $\vert x \vert = 8$, we have $x = \pm 8$, and for $\vert y \vert = 8$, we have $y = \pm 8$. This gives us 4 points each, but remember that for each point that satisfies $\vert x \vert = 8$, there must be a corresponding point that satisfies $\vert y \vert = 8$. So we only get 4 distinct points from these equations.

5. All together, the 8 points given by the solutions of $x + y = \pm 10$, $x - y = \pm 10$, $x = \pm 8$, and $y = \pm 8$ form a square with side length 10.

6. The area of this square is $10^2 = 100$.

We got an error because we are trying to calculate the max value from an empty list.

Let's retrace our steps and analyze where we went wrong. We are trying to find the points that satisfy the equation, but we are only considering the points that are integer values. However, the points that satisfy the equation might not be integers. Therefore, we need to reconsider the problem and find a more general approach to find the points that satisfy the equation.

After revisiting the problem, we can see that the equation involves absolute values, which means it's symmetric with respect to the x and y axes. This means that we only need to consider the points in the first quadrant (positive x and y) and then apply symmetry to find the points in the other quadrants.

So let's try a more general approach:

1. Let's consider only the positive x and y values (the first quadrant).
2. For the first factor, we have $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ or $\vert x - y \vert = 10$.
3. Solving these equations, we get the points $(5,5)$, $(5,-5)$, $(-5,5)$, and $(-5,-5)$ for the first equation and $(10,0)$, $(0,10)$, $(-10,0)$, and $(0,-10)$ for the second equation.
4. For the second factor, we have $\vert x \vert = 8$ or $\vert y \vert = 8$.
5. Solving these equations, we get the points $(8,0)$, $(0,8)$, $(-8,0)$, and $(0,-8)$.
6. By applying symmetry, we can find the points in the other quadrants.

Now, let's plot these points and see if they form a square:

```python


INTERMEDIATE OUT :

from sympy import symbols, Abs, solveset, S

def calculate_area():
    # Define the variables
    x, y = symbols('x y')

    # The equation given in the problem
    equation = ((Abs(x + y) - 10)**2 + (Abs(x - y) - 10)**2) * ((Abs(x) - 8)**2 + (Abs(y) - 8)**2)

    # Solve the equation for x and y in the first quadrant
    solutions_first_quadrant = solveset(equation, (x, y), domain=S.Reals)

    # Apply symmetry to find the points in the other quadrants
    solutions = {(x, y) for (x, y) in solutions_first_quadrant}
    solutions.update({(-x, y) for (x, y) in solutions_first_quadrant})
    solutions.update({(x, -y) for (x, y) in solutions_first_quadrant})
    solutions.update({(-x, -y) for (x, y) in solutions_first_quadrant})

    # Calculate the length of the side of the square
    side_length = max(max(abs(x - y) for x, y in solutions if x + y == 10

Below is a math problem you are to solve (positive numerical answer!):
"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"

 The problem is asking for the area of a polygon formed by the points that satisfy the given condition.
The condition is $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + (\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + (\vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$.
For the product of two expressions to be zero, either the first expression is zero or the second expression is zero.
If $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + (\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2) = 0$, then $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$, which implies that $x + y = \pm 10$ and $x - y = \pm 10$.
If $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + (\vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$, then $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$, which implies that $x = \pm 8$ and $y = \pm 8$.
These four lines $x + y = \pm 10$, $x - y = \pm 10$, $x = \pm 8$, and $y = \pm 8$ form a rectangle.
The length of the rectangle is $20$ (the maximum possible value of $x + y$) and the width is $16$ (the maximum possible value of $2x$ or $2y$), so the area of the rectangle is $20 \times 16 = 320$.
The answer is: 320

 To solve this problem, we can first recognize that the product of two numbers is zero if and only if at least one of the numbers is zero. Therefore, the equation implies that either $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$, $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$, $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$, or $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$.
Solving these equations, we find that the points that satisfy the equation are of the form $(8, 8)$, $(8, -8)$, $(-8, 8)$, or $(-8, -8)$. These points form a square with side length 16, and the area of this square is $16^2 = 256$. Therefore, the area of the convex polygon is 256.

Here is Python code that calculates the area of the convex polygon:
```python

The area of the convex polygon is $256$. The answer is: $256$.
