"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"

Assistant:

 The equation given is a product of two expressions equal to zero, which means that either the first expression is zero or the second expression is zero.

If the first expression is zero, then we have $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$. This implies that $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$, which means that $x + y = \pm 10$ and $x - y = \pm 10$. Solving these equations gives us the vertices of the polygon: $(0, 10), (0, -10), (10, 0), (-10, 0)$.

If the second expression is zero, then we have $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$. This implies that $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$, which means that $x = \pm 8$ and $y = \pm 8$. Solving these equations gives us the vertices of the polygon: $(8, 0), (-8, 0), (0, 8), (0, -8)$.

The vertices of the polygon are therefore: $(0, 10), (0, -10), (10, 0), (-10, 0), (8, 0), (-8, 0), (0, 8), (0, -8)$.

The polygon is a square with side length 10 (from the points $(0, 10)$ and $(0, -10)$ or $(10, 0)$ and $(-10, 0)$), so its area is $10^2 = 100$.
The answer is: $100$

Below is a math problem you are to solve (positive numerical answer!):
"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"
Analyze this problem and think step by step to come to a solution with programs. After solving the problem, output the final numerical answer within \boxed{}.

 This problem involves understanding the properties of absolute value and the conditions under which a product of two expressions is zero. The given equation is:
\[((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0.\]

For the product of two expressions to be zero, either one of the expressions must be zero. Therefore, we have two cases to consider:

1. $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ and $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 \neq 0$.
2. $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 \neq 0$ and $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$.

For case 1, both $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2$ and $( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2$ must be zero. This implies that $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. This means that $x + y = \pm 10$ and $x - y = \pm 10$. Solving these equations, we find that the points $(x, y)$ that satisfy this case are $(10, 0)$, $(-10, 0)$, $(0, 10)$, and $(0, -10)$.

For case 2, both $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2$ and $( \vert y \vert - 8)^2$ must be zero. This implies that $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$. This means that $x = \pm 8$ and $y = \pm 8$. Solving these equations, we find that the points $(x, y)$ that satisfy this case are $(8, 8)$, $(-8, 8)$, $(8, -8)$, and $(-8, -8)$.

The points that satisfy either case form a square with side length 20. The area of this square is $20^2 = 400$. Therefore, the area of the convex polygon is 400.

The Python code to compute the area of the square is:
```python


INTERMEDIATE OUT :

def square_area():
    side_length = 20
    area = side_length ** 2
    return area

area = square_area()
print(area)
```

CODE RESULTS 400

INTERMEDIATE OUT :
```output
400
```
The area of the convex polygon is $400$. The answer is: $400$

 The equation $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ is true if and only if either $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$. This means that the points satisfying the equation must lie on the lines $\vert x + y \vert = 10$, $\vert x - y \vert = 10$, $\vert x \vert = 8$, or $\vert y \vert = 8$. These lines form a square with side length 16. The area of this square is $16^2 = 256$. So the area of the convex polygon is 256. The answer is: $256$

To accomplish this, first determine a sympy-based approach for solving the problem by listing each step to take and what functions need to be called in each step. Be clear so even an idiot can follow your instructions, and remember, your final answer should be positive integer, not an algebraic expression!
Write the entire script covering all the steps (use comments and document it well) and print the result. After solving the problem, output the final numerical answer within \boxed{}.

Assistant: 

Interesting, let's analyze step by step:



1. We are given an equation that seems to be a product of two expressions equal to zero. This means that either the first expression equals zero or the second expression equals zero.
2. Each of the expressions are squared absolute values, which means they are always non-negative. If their product equals zero, then each of them must equal zero. So we have four equations to solve: $|x + y| - 10 = 0$, $|x - y| - 10 = 0$, $|x| - 8 = 0$, and $|y| - 8 = 0$.
3. Solving these equations, we get $x + y = 10$, $x - y = 10$, $x = 8$, and $y = 8$. These equations represent four lines in the coordinate plane.
4. The intersection points of these lines are the vertices of the polygon. By solving these equations, we can find the vertices: $(8,0)$, $(0,8)$, $(8,-8)$, and $(-8,8)$.
5. The polygon is a square with side length 8*sqrt(2). The area of a square is side length squared, so the area is $(8\sqrt{2})^2 = 128$.

Now let's write the python code to calculate the area of the square:

```python


INTERMEDIATE OUT :

from sympy import sqrt

def square_area():
    side_length = 8 * sqrt(2)
    area = side_length**2
    return area

result = square_area()
print(result)
```

CODE RESULTS 128

INTERMEDIATE OUT :
```output
128
```
The area of the convex polygon is $128$. The answer is: $128$.

The expression $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ is equal to zero if and only if both $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$, $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$, $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$, and $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$.

This implies that $\vert x + y \vert = 10$, $\vert x - y \vert = 10$, $\vert x \vert = 8$, and $\vert y \vert = 8$.

From $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$, we can deduce that $x = \pm 8$ and $y = \pm 8$.

Therefore, the points $(x, y)$ that satisfy the equation are: $(8, 8), (8, -8), (-8, 8), (-8, -8)$.

These points form a square with side length $16$. The area of this square is $16^2 = 256$. So the area of the convex polygon is $256$.

```python


INTERMEDIATE OUT :

from sympy import symbols, Abs, solve, simplify

def calculate_area():
    # Define the variables
    x, y = symbols('x y')

    # The equation
    equation = ((Abs(x + y) - 10)**2 + (Abs(x - y) - 10)**2) * ((Abs(x) - 8)**2 + (Abs(y) - 8)**2)

    # Find the points that satisfy the equation
    solutions = solve([equation, Abs(x) - 8, Abs(y) - 8], (x, y))

    # Calculate the area of the square
    side_length = max(abs(solutions[0][0] - solutions[1][0]), abs(solutions[0][1] - solutions[1][1]))
    area = side_length**2

    return area

result = calculate_area()
print(result)
```

The area of the convex polygon is $256$. The answer is: $256$

 The given equation is a product of two terms equal to zero. Therefore, either the first term is zero or the second term is zero.
The first term is $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)$ and it equals to zero if and only if both $\vert x + y \vert - 10 = 0$ and $\vert x - y \vert - 10 = 0$.
This implies that $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$.
The second term is $((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2)$ and it equals to zero if and only if both $\vert x \vert - 8 = 0$ and $\vert y \vert - 8 = 0$.
This implies that $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$.
So, the points that satisfy the equation are those that satisfy either $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x \vert = 8$, or $\vert x - y \vert = 10$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$.
The first set of conditions $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x \vert = 8$ implies that $x = \pm 8$ and $y = \pm 2$ or $y = \pm 18$.
The second set of conditions $\vert x - y \vert = 10$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$ implies that $y = \pm 8$ and $x = \pm 2$ or $x = \pm 18$.
Plotting these points on a graph, we find that they form a square with side length 16.
Therefore, the area of the convex polygon is $16^2 = 256$. The answer is: $256$
