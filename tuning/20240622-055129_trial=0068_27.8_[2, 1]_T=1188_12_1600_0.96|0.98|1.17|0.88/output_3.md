Below is a math problem you are to solve (positive numerical answer):
"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"
To accomplish this, first determine a sympy-based approach for solving the problem by listing each step to take and what functions need to be called in each step. Be clear so even an idiot can follow your instructions, and remember, your final answer should be positive integer, not an algebraic expression!
Write the entire script covering all the steps (use comments and document it well) and print the result. After solving the problem, output the final numerical answer within \boxed{}.

Interesting, let's analyze step by step:



Step 1: Since the product of two numbers is zero if and only if at least one of the numbers is zero, the given equation is equivalent to the system of equations:

$$(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0,$$
$$(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0,$$
$$(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0,$$
$$(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0.$$

Step 2: Each of these equations implies that the absolute value of certain expression is zero, which means the expression itself must be zero. Therefore, the solutions to the system are:

$$x + y = 10,$$
$$x - y = 10,$$
$$x = 8,$$
$$y = 8.$$

Step 3: The solutions from the first two equations are $x = 5$ and $y = 5$, and from the last two equations are $x = 8$ and $y = 8$. The solutions from the first two equations form a line segment, while those from the last two form a square.

Step 4: The line segment and the square intersect at the point (8, 8), so the convex polygon is a square with side length 10.

Step 5: The area of this square is $10^2 = 100$.

So, the area of the convex polygon is $100$. The answer is: $100$

Interesting, let's analyze step by step:



1. The given equation is $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$. This equation equals 0 if and only if both the terms inside the parenthesis equal 0. So, we have two cases:

Case 1: $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ and $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$.
In this case, we have $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x \vert = 8$, $\vert y \vert = 8$. This forms a square with side length 16, and its area is $16^2 = 256$.

Case 2: $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ and $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$.
In this case, we have $\vert x - y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x \vert = 8$, $\vert y \vert = 8$. This forms a square with side length 16, and its area is also $16^2 = 256$.

So the area of the convex polygon is the sum of the areas of the two squares, which is $256 + 256 = 512$.

Therefore, the area of the convex polygon is 512. The answer is: $512$

Below is a math problem you are to solve (positive numerical answer!):
"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"
Analyze this problem and think step by step to come to a solution with programs. After solving the problem, output the final numerical answer within \boxed{}.

Assistant:

 The given equation is satisfied if either $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$.
Each of these cases corresponds to a rectangle in the $xy$-plane:
- $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ corresponds to the rectangle with vertices at $(8, 2)$, $(8, -18)$, $(-18, -2)$, and $(-18, 18)$.
- $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ corresponds to the rectangle with vertices at $(2, 8)$, $(-18, 8)$, $(-2, -8)$, and $(18, -8)$.
- $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ corresponds to the rectangle with vertices at $(8, 0)$, $(-8, 0)$, $(8, 16)$, and $(-8, -16)$.
- $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ corresponds to the rectangle with vertices at $(0, 8)$, $(0, -8)$, $(16, 8)$, and $(-16, -8)$.
The intersection of these rectangles forms a square with side length 16. Therefore, the area of the convex polygon is $16^2 = \boxed{256}$ square units.

```python

Interesting, let's analyze step by step:



1. First, we note that the product of two numbers is zero if and only if at least one of the numbers is zero. So, the equation is equivalent to $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$.

2. Each of these equations simplifies to $\vert x + y \vert = 10$, $\vert x - y \vert = 10$, $\vert x \vert = 8$, or $\vert y \vert = 8$.

3. Solving these equations, we find the following points: $(8,0)$, $(-8,0)$, $(0,8)$, $(0,-8)$, $(8,8)$, $(8,-8)$, $(-8,8)$, and $(-8,-8)$.

4. These points form a square with side length 16.

5. The area of the square is then $16^2 = 256$.

So, the area of the convex polygon is 256. Now, let's write the Python code to solve this problem.

```python

    # Solve the equation
    solutions = solve((equation, ), (x, y))

    # Find the length of the side of the square
    side_length = max(solutions) - min(solutions)

    # Calculate the area of the square
    area = side_length**2

    return area

result = polygon_area()

The error is likely due to the fact that the equation is more complex than the original problem and is likely beyond the capabilities of Sympy. Let's try a simpler approach.

1. We know that the product of two numbers is zero if and only if at least one of the numbers is zero. So, the equation is equivalent to $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$.

2. Each of these equations simplifies to $\vert x + y \vert = 10$, $\vert x - y \vert = 10$, $\vert x \vert = 8$, or $\vert y \vert = 8$.

3. Solving these equations, we find the following points: $(8,0)$, $(-8,0)$, $(0,8)$, $(0,-8)$, $(8,8)$, $(8,-8)$, $(-8,8)$, and $(-8,-8)$.

4. These points form a square with side length 16.

5. The area of the square is then $16^2 = 256$.
The answer is: $256$

Interesting, let's analyze step by step:



The equation $A \cdot B = 0$ is true if and only if at least one of the factors is zero. Therefore, the given equation is satisfied if either $A = 0$ or $B = 0$. We can break the problem into two cases.

Case 1: $A = (\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$. This case implies that $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. Solving these equations, we find that the points $(x, y)$ lie on the lines $x + y = 10$ and $x - y = 10$. These lines intersect at the points $(5,5)$ and $(10,0)$. Therefore, in this case, the points $(x, y)$ form a rectangle with vertices at $(5,5)$, $(10,0)$, $(0,0)$, and $(0,5)$.

Case 2: $B = (\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$. This case implies that $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$. Solving these equations, we find that the points $(x, y)$ lie on the lines $x = 8$ and $y = 8$. Therefore, in this case, the points $(x, y)$ form a square with vertices at $(8,8)$, $(8,0)$, $(0,0)$, and $(0,8)$.

The intersection of the two cases is the square with vertices at $(8,8)$, $(8,0)$, $(0,0)$, and $(0,8)$, which is entirely contained in the rectangle from Case 1.

The area of the square from Case 2 is $8^2 = 64$. Therefore, the area of the convex polygon formed by the points $(x, y)$ is $64$. The answer is: $64$

Interesting, let's analyze step by step:



1. We have an equation involving absolute values, so we know that we need to consider all possible cases for the absolute values.
2. The equation is equal to zero if and only if each term is equal to zero.
3. Therefore, we need to solve four systems of equations:
   a) $\begin{cases} |x + y| - 10 = 0 \\ |x - y| - 10 = 0 \\ |x| - 8 = 0 \\ |y| - 8 = 0 \end{cases}$
   b) $\begin{cases} |x + y| - 10 = 0 \\ |x - y| - 10 = 0 \\ |x| - 8 = 0 \\ -|y| + 8 = 0 \end{cases}$
   c) $\begin{cases} |x + y| - 10 = 0 \\ -|x - y| + 10 = 0 \\ |x| - 8 = 0 \\ |y| - 8 = 0 \end{cases}$
   d) $\begin{cases} |x + y| - 10 = 0 \\ -|x - y| + 10 = 0 \\ |x| - 8 = 0 \\ -|y| + 8 = 0 \end{cases}$
4. Solve each system and determine the vertices of the polygon.
5. Use the vertices to find the area of the polygon.

Now, let's implement this in Python using sympy:

```python

    ]

    for system in systems:
        solutions = solve((system['eq1'], system['eq2'], system['eq3'], system['eq4']), (x, y))
