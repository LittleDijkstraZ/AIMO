Below is a math problem you are to solve (positive numerical answer):
"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"
To accomplish this, first determine a sympy-based approach for solving the problem by listing each step to take and what functions need to be called in each step. Be clear so even an idiot can follow your instructions, and remember, your final answer should be positive integer, not an algebraic expression!
Write the entire script covering all the steps (use comments and document it well) and print the result. After solving the problem, output the final numerical answer within \boxed{}.

Interesting, let's analyze step by step:



1. The condition $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ implies that both $\vert x + y \vert - 10 = 0$ and $\vert x - y \vert - 10 = 0$, which further implies that $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. The only way this can happen is if $|x| = |y| = 10$. Thus, the points must lie on a square with side length $20$.

2. Similarly, the condition $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ implies that both $\vert x \vert - 8 = 0$ and $\vert y \vert - 8 = 0$, which further implies that $|x| = |y| = 8$. Thus, the points must lie on a square with side length $16$.

3. The intersection of the two conditions is the set of points that satisfy both conditions, which is the set of points lying in the intersection of the two squares. This intersection is a smaller square with side length $20 - 16 = 4$.

4. The area of this smaller square is $4^2 = 16$. 

So, the area of the convex polygon is 16.

The answer is: $16$

"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"

This problem involves understanding the given equation and finding the area of the convex polygon that it encloses. The equation involves absolute value, which makes it a bit challenging to solve directly. However, the equation equals to zero, which means one of the factors must be zero. Therefore, we can set each factor equal to zero and solve for the possible values of $x$ and $y$.

The factors are:
1. $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2) = 0$
2. $((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$

For the first factor to be zero, either $(\vert x + y \vert - 10) = 0$ or $(\vert x - y \vert - 10) = 0$. This implies that $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ or $\vert x - y \vert = 10$.

For the second factor to be zero, either $(\vert x \vert - 8) = 0$ or $(\vert y \vert - 8) = 0$. This implies that $\vert x \vert = 8$ or $\vert y \vert = 8$.

Solving these equations, we find the possible coordinates $(x, y)$ that satisfy the equation:

1. If $\vert x + y \vert = 10$, then $x + y = 10$ or $x + y = -10$.
2. If $\vert x - y \vert = 10$, then $x - y = 10$ or $x - y = -10$.
3. If $\vert x \vert = 8$, then $x = 8$ or $x = -8$.
4. If $\vert y \vert = 8$, then $y = 8$ or $y = -8$.

By solving these equations, we find the vertices of the polygon to be:
$(8, 2)$, $(8, -2)$, $(-8, 2)$, $(-8, -2)$, $(2, 8)$, $(-2, 8)$, $(2, -8)$, and $(-2, -8)$.

The polygon is a square with side length 16. The area of the square is then $16^2 = 256$.

So, the area of the convex polygon is 256. The answer is: $256$.

"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"

Assistant:

 The given equation is a product of two terms equals to zero, so either of the terms must be zero. 
This gives us two separate conditions:
1. $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$
2. $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$

For the first condition to be zero, both $\vert x + y \vert - 10 = 0$ and $\vert x - y \vert - 10 = 0$, which implies $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$.
This means $x + y = \pm 10$ and $x - y = \pm 10$.
Solving these equations gives us the vertices of the square: $(8, 2)$, $(8, -2)$, $(-8, -2)$, $(-8, 2)$.

For the second condition to be zero, both $\vert x \vert - 8 = 0$ and $\vert y \vert - 8 = 0$, which implies $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$.
This means $x = \pm 8$ and $y = \pm 8$.
Solving these equations gives us the vertices of the square: $(8, 8)$, $(8, -8)$, $(-8, -8)$, $(-8, 8)$.

Combining the vertices from both conditions, we have a total of 8 vertices: $(8, 2)$, $(8, -2)$, $(-8, -2)$, $(-8, 2)$, $(8, 8)$, $(8, -8)$, $(-8, -8)$, $(-8, 8)$.
The polygon formed by these vertices is a square with side length 16.

The area of a square is side length squared, so the area of this square is $16^2 = 256$.

The answer is: $\boxed{256}$

 The given equation is a product of two expressions equal to zero. This means that either the first expression is zero or the second expression is zero.

For the first expression to be zero, we need both $|x + y| - 10 = 0$ and $|x - y| - 10 = 0$, which implies $|x + y| = 10$ and $|x - y| = 10$. This gives us four equations: $x + y = 10$, $x + y = -10$, $x - y = 10$, and $x - y = -10$. Solving these equations, we find that the vertices of the polygon are $(5,5)$, $(5,-5)$, $(-5,5)$, and $(-5,-5)$.

For the second expression to be zero, we need both $|x| - 8 = 0$ and $|y| - 8 = 0$, which implies $|x| = 8$ and $|y| = 8$. This gives us four more vertices: $(8,0)$, $(-8,0)$, $(0,8)$, and $(0,-8)$.

So the polygon is a square with side length 10. The area of a square is the square of the length of its side, so the area of the polygon is $10^2 = 100$. The answer is: $100$

Interesting, let's analyze step by step:



Step 1: First, we need to understand the given equation. The equation is a product of two terms, both of which must be zero for the whole equation to be zero. Therefore, each term must be zero separately. This gives us two systems of equations:

1. $\vert x + y \vert - 10 = 0$ and $\vert x - y \vert - 10 = 0$
2. $\vert x \vert - 8 = 0$ and $\vert y \vert - 8 = 0$

Step 2: Solve each system of equations to find the points that satisfy the conditions.

For the first system, we have $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. This implies that $x + y = \pm 10$ and $x - y = \pm 10$. Solving these equations, we get the four points $(5, 5)$, $(5, -5)$, $(-5, 5)$, and $(-5, -5)$.

For the second system, we have $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$. This implies that $x = \pm 8$ and $y = \pm 8$. So we get the four points $(8, 8)$, $(8, -8)$, $(-8, 8)$, and $(-8, -8)$.

Step 3: Plot the points on the coordinate plane and connect them to form a polygon.

Step 4: Calculate the area of the polygon.

The polygon formed is a square with side length 10 (the distance between the points $(5, 5)$ and $(5, -5)$ or $(8, 8)$ and $(8, -8)$), so the area is $10^2 = 100$.

The answer is: $\boxed{100}$

Interesting, let's analyze step by step:



The equation $A*B=0$ is true only if $A=0$ or $B=0$. Therefore, the given equation is satisfied only when either $A = (|x+y| - 10)^2 + (|x-y| - 10)^2 = 0$ or $B = (|x| - 8)^2 + (|y| - 8)^2 = 0$.

For $A = 0$, we have $|x+y| = 10$ and $|x-y| = 10$. The solutions to these equations are $x+y = \pm 10$ and $x-y = \pm 10$. This gives us a square with side length $10\sqrt{2}$, so the area is $(10\sqrt{2})^2 = 200$.

For $B = 0$, we have $|x| = 8$ and $|y| = 8$. This gives us a square with side length $16$, so the area is $256$.

However, the area of the square formed by $A = 0$ is larger than the area of the square formed by $B = 0$. Therefore, the area of the convex polygon is $200$.

So, the area of the convex polygon is $200$. The answer is: $200$

Interesting, let's analyze step by step:



1. The expression $A = ((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2)$ equals zero if and only if at least one of the factors equals zero.

2. The expression $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2$ equals zero if and only if both $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$, which means the point is at the intersection of the lines $x = 8$ and $y = 8$, or $x = -8$ and $y = -8$. This gives us 4 points: $(8, 8)$, $(8, -8)$, $(-8, 8)$, and $(-8, -8)$.

3. Similarly, $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ if and only if both $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. This gives us 4 more points: $(5, 5)$, $(5, -5)$, $(-5, 5)$, and $(-5, -5)$.

4. The 8 points form a square with side length 10, so the area of the square is $10^2 = 100$.

So the area of the convex polygon is 100. The Python code to calculate this is:
