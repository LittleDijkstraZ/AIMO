 The given equation is a product of two terms equal to zero. Therefore, either the first term is zero or the second term is zero.

The first term is zero when $|\text{x} + \text{y}| - 10 = 0$ or $|\text{x} - \text{y}| - 10 = 0$. This implies $|\text{x} + \text{y}| = 10$ or $|\text{x} - \text{y}| = 10$. The solutions to these absolute value equations are all the points in a square with side length 20.

The second term is zero when $|\text{x}| - 8 = 0$ or $|\text{y}| - 8 = 0$. This implies $|\text{x}| = 8$ or $|\text{y}| = 8$. The solutions to these absolute value equations are all the points in a square with side length 16.

The intersection of these two squares is the convex polygon that encloses the points that satisfy the equation. The area of this convex polygon is the area of the smaller square, which is $16^2 = 256$.

So, the area of the convex polygon is 256 square units.

Here is a python code to calculate the area:
```python

def polygon_area():
    """The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"""
    side_length_square1 = 20
    side_length_square2 = 16
    area_square1 = side_length_square1 ** 2
    area_square2 = side_length_square2 ** 2
    area_polygon = area_square2
    return area_polygon

area = polygon_area()
print(area)
```

256

The area of the convex polygon is $256$ square units.
The answer is $\boxed{256}$.

Below is a math problem you are to solve (positive numerical answer!):
"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"

The given equation is a product of two expressions equal to zero, so one of the expressions must be zero for the equation to be true. This gives us two separate cases to consider:

1. $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ and $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$.
2. $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ and $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$.

For the first case, we have $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. This implies that $x + y = \pm 10$ and $x - y = \pm 10$. Solving these equations, we get the vertices of the polygon as $(0, 10)$, $(0, -10)$, $(10, 0)$, $(-10, 0)$, $(8, 2)$, $(8, -2)$, $(-8, 2)$, and $(-8, -2)$.

For the second case, we have $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$. This implies that $x = \pm 8$ and $y = \pm 8$. Adding these points to the list, we get all the vertices of the polygon.

Now we can calculate the area of the polygon. The polygon is a square with side length 20. The area of a square is side length squared, so the area of this square is $20^2 = 400$.

So, the area of the convex polygon is 400. The answer is: 400

"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"

This problem is asking for the area of a convex polygon formed by the points that satisfy a certain condition. The condition given is $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$.

This condition is satisfied only when both $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ and $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ or when both $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ and $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$.

From the first pair of equations, we have $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. These equations represent two squares, so the solutions are all points $(x, y)$ such that either $x + y = 10$ or $x + y = -10$ and either $x - y = 10$ or $x - y = -10$. This results in a square with side length 10.

From the second pair of equations, we have $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$. These equations represent two squares, so the solutions are all points $(x, y)$ such that either $x = 8$ or $x = -8$ and either $y = 8$ or $y = -8$. This results in a square with side length 16.

The convex polygon formed by the intersection of these two squares is another square with side length 8 (the smaller of the two squares).

The area of this square is side length squared, so the area is $8^2 = 64$.
The answer is $\boxed{64}$.

To accomplish this, first determine a sympy-based approach for solving the problem by listing each step to take and what functions need to be called in each step. Be clear so even an idiot can follow your instructions, and remember, your final answer should be positive integer, not an algebraic expression!
Write the entire script covering all the steps (use comments and document it well) and print the result. After solving the problem, output the final numerical answer within \boxed{}.

Assistant: 

Interesting, let's analyze step by step:



1. We first need to recognize that the product of two numbers is zero if and only if at least one of the numbers is zero. Therefore, the equation $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ is equivalent to either $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$.

2. If $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$, then $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. This implies that $x + y = \pm 10$ and $x - y = \pm 10$, which results in four lines: $x + y = 10$, $x + y = -10$, $x - y = 10$, and $x - y = -10$. These four lines form a rectangle.

3. If $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$, then $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$, which implies that $x = \pm 8$ and $y = \pm 8$. This results in four lines: $x = 8$, $x = -8$, $y = 8$, and $y = -8$. These four lines also form a rectangle.

4. The intersection of these two rectangles is a square with side length 10 (the distance between the lines $x + y = 10$ and $x + y = -10$ or $x - y = 10$ and $x - y = -10$), so the area of the convex polygon is $10^2 = 100$.

The answer is: $100$

Interesting, let's analyze step by step:



1. We are given the equation: $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$
2. According to the zero-product rule, either the first part of the equation, $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$, or the second part, $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$, is equal to zero.
3. If the first part of the equation is equal to zero, then $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. This implies that $x + y = \pm 10$ and $x - y = \pm 10$, which gives us four lines in the coordinate plane: $x + y = 10$, $x + y = -10$, $x - y = 10$, and $x - y = -10$. The intersection points of these lines form a square with side length 10.
4. If the second part of the equation is equal to zero, then $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$. This implies that $x = \pm 8$ and $y = \pm 8$, which gives us four lines in the coordinate plane: $x = 8$, $x = -8$, $y = 8$, and $y = -8$. The intersection points of these lines form a square with side length 16.
5. Therefore, the area of the convex polygon is the sum of the areas of the two squares. The area of a square is side length squared, so the area of the first square is $10^2 = 100$ and the area of the second square is $16^2 = 256$. Therefore, the total area of the convex polygon is $100 + 256 = 356$.

The area of the convex polygon is 356 square units. However, the problem asked for a positive numerical answer, so the area is 356.

```python


INTERMEDIATE OUT :

def polygon_area():
    # Calculate the area of the first square
    side1 = 10
    area1 = side1 ** 2

    # Calculate the area of the second square
    side2 = 16
    area2 = side2 ** 2

    # Calculate the total area of the convex polygon
    total_area = area1 + area2

    return total_area

result = polygon_area()
print(result)
```

356

The area of the convex polygon is 356 square units. The answer is $\boxed{356}$.

 The given equation is a product of two terms equal to zero, which means that either the first term is zero or the second term is zero.

If the first term is zero, we have $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$. This is possible only if $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. This gives us a square with side length 10.

If the second term is zero, we have $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$. This is possible only if $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$. This gives us a square with side length 16.

The first square has side length 10, so its area is $10^2 = 100$. The second square has side length 16, so its area is $16^2 = 256$.

The area of the convex polygon is the union of these two squares, so it is $100 + 256 = 356$.

The answer is: $356$

2. The equation $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + (\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ implies that both $\vert x + y \vert - 10 = 0$ and $\vert x - y \vert - 10 = 0$, which means $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. This results in a square with side length 10 units.

3. The equation $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + (\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ implies that both $\vert x \vert - 8 = 0$ and $\vert y \vert - 8 = 0$, which means $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$. This results in a square with side length 16 units.

4. The polygon formed by the intersection of these two squares is another square with side length 10 units.

5. The area of a square with side length $a$ is $a^2$. Therefore, the area of the polygon is $10^2 = 100$.

So, the area of the convex polygon is 100 square units. The answer is: $100$

Interesting, let's analyze step by step:



1. The expression is equal to zero if either of the factors is equal to zero. 
2. The factors are $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)$ and $((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2)$.
3. Each of these factors will be equal to zero if the absolute value expressions inside are equal to zero.
4. The absolute value expressions inside will be equal to zero if the arguments inside the absolute values are zero.
5. For the first factor, we have $|x+y| = 10$ and $|x-y| = 10$. The solutions to these equations are lines in the coordinate plane.
6. For the second factor, we have $|x| = 8$ and $|y| = 8$. The solutions to these equations are two vertical and two horizontal lines at $x = \pm 8$ and $y = \pm 8$.
7. The intersection of these lines forms a square with side length 16 (since the distance between the lines $x = 8$ and $x = -8$ is 16).
8. The area of this square is $16^2 = 256$.

So the area of the convex polygon is 256. The answer is: $256$.

Interesting, let's analyze step by step:



1. First, we need to understand that the product of two numbers is zero if and only if at least one of the numbers is zero. So, the given equation implies that either $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$.

2. Each of these equations implies that $\vert x + y \vert = 10$, $\vert x - y \vert = 10$, $\vert x \vert = 8$, or $\vert y \vert = 8$.

3. Solving these equations gives us the vertices of the polygon:
   - For $\vert x + y \vert = 10$, the vertices are $(8,2)$, $(8,-2)$, $(-8,2)$, and $(-8,-2)$.
   - For $\vert x - y \vert = 10$, the vertices are $(2,8)$, $(2,-8)$, $(-2,8)$, and $(-2,-8)$.
   - For $\vert x \vert = 8$, the vertices are $(8,y)$ for all $y$ in $[-8,8]$.
   - For $\vert y \vert = 8$, the vertices are $(x,8)$ for all $x$ in $[-8,8]$.

4. Plotting these vertices on the coordinate plane, we see that they form a square with side length 16.

5. The area of the square is the square of its side length, so the area is $16^2 = 256$.

So, the area of the convex polygon is 256. The Python script to solve this problem is as follows:

```python


INTERMEDIATE OUT :

def polygon_area():
