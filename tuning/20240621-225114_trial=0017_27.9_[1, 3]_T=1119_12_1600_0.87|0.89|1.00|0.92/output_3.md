 The given equation is a product of two expressions equal to zero. This means that either the first expression is zero or the second expression is zero. 

The first expression is $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)$. This expression is zero if and only if both $\vert x + y \vert - 10 = 0$ and $\vert x - y \vert - 10 = 0$. This implies that $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. The only way this can be true is if $x = \pm 10$ and $y = \pm 10$. 

The second expression is $((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2)$. This expression is zero if and only if both $\vert x \vert - 8 = 0$ and $\vert y \vert - 8 = 0$. This implies that $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$. The only way this can be true is if $x = \pm 8$ and $y = \pm 8$. 

Therefore, the points that satisfy the equation are the points $(10, 10)$, $(-10, -10)$, $(10, -10)$, $(-10, 10)$, $(8, 8)$, $(-8, -8)$, $(8, -8)$, and $(-8, 8)$. These points form a square with side length $20$, so the area of the square is $20^2 = 400$.

Therefore, the area of the convex polygon is $400$. The answer is: $400$.

To accomplish this, first determine a sympy-based approach for solving the problem by listing each step to take and what functions need to be called in each step. Be clear so even an idiot can follow your instructions, and remember, your final answer should be positive integer, not an algebraic expression!
Write the entire script covering all the steps (use comments and document it well) and print the result. After solving the problem, output the final numerical answer within \boxed{}.

Interesting, let's analyze step by step:



1. The given equation is a product of two expressions equal to zero. Therefore, either the first expression is zero or the second one is zero. 

2. Each of the expressions inside the parentheses is a square, which means that they are always non-negative. Therefore, for the product to be zero, each of the expressions inside the parentheses must be zero.

3. This gives us four separate cases to consider:

   a. $\vert x + y \vert - 10 = 0$ and $\vert x \vert - 8 = 0$ and $\vert x - y \vert - 10 = 0$ and $\vert y \vert - 8 = 0$.

4. Solving these equations gives us the vertices of the polygon:

   a. For $\vert x + y \vert - 10 = 0$, we have $x + y = 10$.
   b. For $\vert x - y \vert - 10 = 0$, we have $x - y = 10$.
   c. For $\vert x \vert - 8 = 0$, we have $x = 8$.
   d. For $\vert y \vert - 8 = 0$, we have $y = 8$.

5. Solving these systems of equations, we find the vertices of the polygon:

   a. For $x + y = 10$ and $x = 8$, we have $y = 2$. So one vertex is $(8, 2)$.
   b. For $x - y = 10$ and $x = 8$, we have $y = -2$. So another vertex is $(8, -2)$.
   c. For $x + y = 10$ and $y = 8$, we have $x = 2$. So another vertex is $(2, 8)$.
   d. For $x - y = 10$ and $y = 8$, we have $x = 18$. So the last vertex is $(18, 8)$.

6. The polygon is a rectangle with side lengths of 16 units (from $(8, 2)$ to $(8, -2)$) and 16 units (from $(8, 2)$ to $(2, 8)$).

7. The area of the rectangle is $16 \times 16 = 256$.

Therefore, the area of the convex polygon is 256 square units. The answer is: $256$

Interesting, let's analyze step by step:



The product of two numbers is zero if and only if at least one of them is zero. Thus, the given equation is equivalent to the union of the following two systems of equations:

1. $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ and $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ and $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ and $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$.
2. Either $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ and either $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$.

Solving the first system, we find that the solutions are the points $(8,8)$, $(-8,8)$, $(8,-8)$, and $(-8,-8)$.

The second system gives the lines $x + y = 10$ and $x + y = -10$, as well as the lines $x = 8$ and $x = -8$, and the lines $y = 8$ and $y = -8$.

Plotting these lines on the coordinate plane, we see that they form a square with side length 10. The area of this square is $10^2 = 100$.

Thus, the area of the convex polygon is 100.

```python


INTERMEDIATE OUT :

from sympy import symbols, solve

def calculate_area():
    # The area of the square is 10^2 = 100
    area = 10**2
    return area

result = calculate_area()
print(result)
```

100

CODE RESULTS 100

INTERMEDIATE OUT :
```output
100
```
The area of the convex polygon is $\boxed{100}$.

Interesting, let's analyze step by step:



First, we need to understand the given equation. It is a product of two terms equal to zero, which means either the first term is zero or the second term is zero. 

The first term is $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)$ and the second term is $((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2)$.

If the first term is zero, then $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. This implies that $x + y = \pm 10$ and $x - y = \pm 10$. Solving these equations, we get the vertices of the polygon as $(0, 10), (0, -10), (10, 0), (-10, 0)$.

If the second term is zero, then $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$. This implies that $x = \pm 8$ and $y = \pm 8$. Solving these equations, we get the vertices of the polygon as $(8, 8), (8, -8), (-8, 8), (-8, -8)$.

Now we need to find the area of the polygon. The vertices form a square with side length 16. The area of a square is side length squared, so the area of the polygon is $16^2 = 256$.

So the area of the convex polygon is 256. The answer is: $256$

Interesting, let's analyze step by step:



We are given the equation $f(x, y) = 0$ where $f(x, y) = ((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2)$. We want to find the area of the polygon enclosed by the points $(x, y)$ that satisfy this equation.

First, let's observe the equation. The product of two terms equals zero if and only if one or both terms equal zero. Therefore, either $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$.

The first term equals zero when $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. The second term equals zero when $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$, which means $-8 \leq x, y \leq 8$.

The first condition implies that $x + y = \pm 10$ and $x - y = \pm 10$, which gives us four lines in the plane: $x + y = 10$, $x + y = -10$, $x - y = 10$, and $x - y = -10$. The intersection of these lines form a square with side length 10. The vertices of the square are $(5, 5)$, $(5, -5)$, $(-5, 5)$, and $(-5, -5)$.

The second condition restricts $x$ and $y$ to be within the range of $[-8, 8]$, which means we are only considering a square with side length 16 centered at the origin.

Taking both conditions into account, the polygon we are interested in is the intersection of the two squares. This intersection is also a square with side length 10 (the smaller square).

The area of a square with side length $s$ is $s^2$. Therefore, the area of the polygon is $10^2 = 100$.

So the area of the polygon is 100. The answer is: $100$

 The given equation is equal to zero if and only if both of the factors are equal to zero. This gives us two systems of equations to solve:

1. $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ and $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + (\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$.
2. $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ and $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + (\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$.

For the first system, we have $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$. This implies that the points lie on the lines $x + y = \pm 10$, $x = \pm 8$, and $y = \pm 8$. These lines form a square with side length 10, and the area of this square is $10^2 = 100$.

For the second system, we have $\vert x - y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$. This implies that the points lie on the lines $x - y = \pm 10$, $x = \pm 8$, and $y = \pm 8$. These lines also form a square with side length 10, and the area of this square is also $10^2 = 100$.

Therefore, the convex polygon enclosed by the points is a square with side length 10, and its area is $100$. The answer is: $100$
