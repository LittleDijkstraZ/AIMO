Interesting, let's analyze step by step:



1. The area of a polygon is generally computed by summing the areas of individual triangles that make it up. In this problem, we are dealing with a polygon enclosed by points that satisfy the equation provided.

2. The equation $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ tells us that either one of the two factors equals zero, or both factors equal zero.

3. If either of the factors equals zero, the product equals zero. The other factor doesn't matter in this context.

4. Now let's analyze each factor separately:

   a) For the first factor, either $\vert x + y \vert - 10 = 0$ or $\vert x - y \vert - 10 = 0$. This simplifies to $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ or $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. These are the equations of two families of parallel lines. The polygon is a square with side length 20.

   b) For the second factor, either $\vert x \vert - 8 = 0$ or $\vert y \vert - 8 = 0$. This simplifies to $\vert x \vert = 8$ or $\vert y \vert = 8$. These are the equations of two families of parallel lines. The polygon is a square with side length 16.

5. To find the area of the polygon, we compute the area of the larger square and subtract the area of the smaller square.

6. The side length of the larger square is 20, so its area is $20^2 = 400$. The side length of the smaller square is 16, so its area is $16^2 = 256$.

7. The area of the polygon is $400 - 256 = 144$.

The Python code to calculate the area of the polygon would be:

```python


INTERMEDIATE OUT :

def polygon_area():
    # side length of larger square
    side_large = 20
    # side length of smaller square
    side_small = 16

    # calculate areas
    area_large = side_large ** 2
    area_small = side_small ** 2

    # calculate the area of the polygon
    area_polygon = area_large - area_small

    return area_polygon

result = polygon_area()
print(result)
```

144

CODE RESULTS 144

INTERMEDIATE OUT :
```output
144
```
The area of the convex polygon is 144 square units. The answer is: $144$

Interesting, let's analyze step by step:



1. The expression $A = ((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2)$ equals to zero if and only if at least one of the two factors is zero.

2. The factor $ ((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)$ equals to zero if and only if $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. These are the equations of two lines in the plane: $x + y = 10$ and $x - y = 10$, or $x + y = -10$ and $x - y = -10$.

3. The factor $((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2)$ equals to zero if and only if $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$, which are the equations of two lines in the plane: $x = 8$ and $x = -8$, or $y = 8$ and $y = -8$.

4. The intersection of these lines forms a rectangle with side lengths 20 and 16. So, the area of this rectangle is $20 \times 16 = 320$.

So, the area of the convex polygon is 320.
The answer is: $320$

"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"

 The given equation is a product of two expressions equal to zero, so either the first expression is zero or the second expression is zero. This breaks down the problem into two cases:

Case 1: $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$.
This can only happen when both $\vert x + y \vert - 10 = 0$ and $\vert x - y \vert - 10 = 0$, which implies $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. This means that the points $(x, y)$ lie on the lines $x + y = 10$ and $x - y = 10$.

Case 2: $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$.
This can only happen when both $\vert x \vert - 8 = 0$ and $\vert y \vert - 8 = 0$, which implies $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$. This means that the points $(x, y)$ lie on the lines $x = 8$ and $y = 8$.

The intersection of these lines forms a square with side length 10 (the distance between the lines $x + y = 10$ and $x - y = 10$, or $x = 8$ and $y = 8$). The area of this square is $10^2 = 100$.

So, the area of the convex polygon is 100.

```python


INTERMEDIATE OUT :

def area_of_polygon():
    """The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"""
    side_length = 10  # The side length of the square
    area = side_length ** 2
    return area

result = area_of_polygon()
print(result)
```

100

The area of the convex polygon is $100$. The answer is $\boxed{100}$.

Analyze this problem and think step by step to come to a solution with programs. After solving the problem, output the final numerical answer within \boxed{}.

Assistant:

 The given equation is a product of two expressions equal to zero, so either the first expression is zero or the second expression is zero. 

For the first expression to be zero, we must have either $|x + y| - 10 = 0$ or $|x - y| - 10 = 0$. This implies $|x + y| = 10$ or $|x - y| = 10$.
For the second expression to be zero, we must have either $|x| - 8 = 0$ or $|y| - 8 = 0$. This implies $|x| = 8$ or $|y| = 8$.

The solutions to these absolute value equations are as follows:

For $|x + y| = 10$, we have $x + y = 10$ or $x + y = -10$.
For $|x - y| = 10$, we have $x - y = 10$ or $x - y = -10$.
For $|x| = 8$, we have $x = 8$ or $x = -8$.
For $|y| = 8$, we have $y = 8$ or $y = -8$.

These solutions give us the vertices of the polygon formed by the points satisfying the equation. By plotting these points, we find that the polygon is a square with side length 16.

The area of a square is the side length squared, so the area of this square is $16^2 = 256$.

So the area of the convex polygon is $256$. The answer is: $256$

Assistant:

 The equation involves absolute values, which makes it challenging to directly solve for the area of the polygon. However, we can use the property that the product of two numbers is zero if and only if at least one of the numbers is zero. Therefore, we can break down the problem into solving for the area of each individual case where each factor is zero.

Case 1: $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$. This implies that $\vert x + y \vert = 10$, which means $x + y = \pm 10$. These are two lines in the plane.

Case 2: $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$. This implies that $\vert x - y \vert = 10$, which means $x - y = \pm 10$. These are also two lines in the plane.

Case 3: $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$. This implies that $\vert x \vert = 8$, which means $x = \pm 8$. These are two vertical lines in the plane.

Case 4: $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$. This implies that $\vert y \vert = 8$, which means $y = \pm 8$. These are two horizontal lines in the plane.

The intersection of these lines form a rectangle with length 16 and width 20. The area of this rectangle is $16 \times 20 = 320$.
The answer is: $320$

Interesting, let's analyze step by step:


The expression $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ implies that $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. This can only be true when $x = \pm10$ and $y = \pm10$. The four points are $(10, 10)$, $(10, -10)$, $(-10, 10)$, and $(-10, -10)$.
Similarly, $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ implies that $x = \pm8$ and $y = \pm8$. The four points are $(8, 8)$, $(8, -8)$, $(-8, 8)$, and $(-8, -8)$.
Putting all the points together, we have 8 points which form a square with side length $20$. The area of the square is $20^2 = 400$. So the area of the convex polygon is $400$.

The answer is: $400$

Assistant:

 The equation $A \cdot B = 0$ implies that $A = 0$ or $B = 0$. Therefore, the given equation implies that either $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$.

For $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$, we have $\vert x + y \vert = 10$, which gives $x + y = 10$ or $x + y = -10$.

For $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$, we have $\vert x - y \vert = 10$, which gives $x - y = 10$ or $x - y = -10$.

For $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$, we have $\vert x \vert = 8$, which gives $x = 8$ or $x = -8$.

For $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$, we have $\vert y \vert = 8$, which gives $y = 8$ or $y = -8$.

The solutions to these equations give the vertices of the polygon: $(8,8)$, $(8,-8)$, $(-8,8)$, $(-8,-8)$, $(10,0)$, $(-10,0)$, $(0,10)$, $(0,-10)$.

The polygon is a square with side length 16, so its area is $16^2 = 256$. The answer is: $256$
