Below is a math problem you are to solve (positive numerical answer!):
"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"
Analyze this problem and think step by step to come to a solution with programs. After solving the problem, output the final numerical answer within \boxed{}.

Assistant:

 This problem is asking for the area of a polygon formed by the points that satisfy a certain equation. The equation is:
\[((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0.\]
The expression is equal to 0 when either of the two factors is 0. Each factor is a sum of squares, which is equal to 0 only if each term is 0. Therefore, we have the following four sets of equations:
\begin{align*}
\vert x + y \vert - 10 &= 0, \\
\vert x - y \vert - 10 &= 0, \\
\vert x \vert - 8 &= 0, \\
\vert y \vert - 8 &= 0.
\end{align*}
Solving these equations gives us the vertices of the polygon:
\begin{align*}
x + y &= \pm 10, \\
x - y &= \pm 10, \\
x &= \pm 8, \\
y &= \pm 8.
\end{align*}
From these equations, we can find the vertices of the polygon:
\begin{align*}
&(8, 2), (8, -2), (-8, 2), (-8, -2), \\
&(2, 8), (-2, 8), (2, -8), (-2, -8).
\end{align*}
The polygon is a square with side length 16. The area of a square is side length squared, so the area of this square is $16^2 = 256$. The answer is: $256$

 This problem requires analytical thinking and understanding of absolute value and how it affects equations.
The equation $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ implies that $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. These equations are only satisfied when both $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. 
The equation $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ implies that $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$, which are only satisfied when both $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$. 
The solutions to the equations $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$ are the lines $x + y = \pm 10$ and $x - y = \pm 10$ in the coordinate plane. The solutions to the equations $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$ are the lines $x = \pm 8$ and $y = \pm 8$. 
The intersection of these lines forms a square with side length 16 (since the maximum value of $x + y$ on the line $x + y = 10$ is 10, and the maximum value of $x - y$ on the line $x - y = 10$ is also 10). Therefore, the area of this square is $16^2 = 256$. The answer is: $256$

 The equation $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ implies that $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$, which means $x + y = \pm 10$ and $x - y = \pm 10$. Solving these four equations gives us the vertices of a square with side length $20$.
The equation $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ implies that $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$, which means $x = \pm 8$ and $y = \pm 8$. Solving these four equations gives us the vertices of a square with side length $16$.
To find the intersection of these two squares, we note that the side length of the smaller square is $16$, so the side length of the larger square is $20$, which is the side length of the first square. Therefore, the two squares intersect to form a smaller square with side length $16$.
The area of a square is given by the square of the side length, so the area of the convex polygon is $16^2 = 256$.
