Below is a math problem you are to solve (positive numerical answer):
"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"
To accomplish this, first determine a sympy-based approach for solving the problem by listing each step to take and what functions need to be called in each step. Be clear so even an idiot can follow your instructions, and remember, your final answer should be positive integer, not an algebraic expression!
Write the entire script covering all the steps (use comments and document it well) and print the result. After solving the problem, output the final numerical answer within \boxed{}.

Interesting, let's analyze step by step:



We have two cases here, because of the product of two terms equal to zero. Each term must be zero for the entire product to be zero:

1) $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0 \Rightarrow \vert x + y \vert = 10$.
2) $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0 \Rightarrow \vert x - y \vert = 10$.
3) $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0 \Rightarrow \vert x \vert = 8$.
4) $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0 \Rightarrow \vert y \vert = 8$.

From 3) and 4) we have that $-8 \le x \le 8$ and $-8 \le y \le 8$.

From 1) and 2) we have that $x + y = \pm 10$ and $x - y = \pm 10$.

By solving these system of equations we find four points: $(8,2)$, $(8,-2)$, $(-8,2)$, $(-8,-2)$.

Now we have to draw the lines connecting these points to form a polygon.

The resulting figure is a square with side length $10$, so its area is $10^2 = 100$.

Therefore, the area of the polygon is $100$.
The answer is: $100$

Interesting, let's analyze step by step:



First, the product of two numbers equals zero if at least one of the numbers is zero. So we have two cases:

1. $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ and $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ and $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ and $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$

2. One of the terms in the product is not zero, which is impossible because all terms are squares and squares of real numbers are always non-negative.

For the first case, we have:

1. $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$

From $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ we have $x + y = 10$ or $x + y = -10$. Similarly, from $\vert x \vert = 8$, $\vert x - y \vert = 10$, and $\vert y \vert = 8$ we get $x = 8$ or $x = -8$, $x - y = 10$ or $x - y = -10$, and $y = 8$ or $y = -8$.

We can solve these equations and get the vertices of the polygon:

(8, 2), (8, -18), (-8, 2), (-8, -18), (2, 8), (-18, 8), (2, -8), and (-18, -8).

Now, we can plot these points and find the shape of the polygon. The polygon is a square with side length 16. So, the area of the square is $16^2 = 256$.

So the area of the polygon is 256.

The solution for the final numerical answer is: $256$

Below is a math problem you are to solve (positive numerical answer!):
"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"
Analyze this problem and think step by step to come to a solution with programs. After solving the problem, output the final numerical answer within \boxed{}.

Assistant:


The equation given is $ ((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$. This equation is equal to zero if either of the two factors is equal to zero. This gives us two sets of equations to solve:

1. $\vert x + y \vert - 10 = 0$, $\vert x - y \vert - 10 = 0$, $\vert x \vert - 8 = 0$, and $\vert y \vert - 8 = 0$.
2. All absolute values in the first set of equations are equal to zero.

From the first set of equations, we have $\vert x + y \vert = 10$, $\vert x - y \vert = 10$, $\vert x \vert = 8$, and $\vert y \vert = 8$. This gives us the following system of equations:

- $x + y = 10$ or $x + y = -10$,
- $x - y = 10$ or $x - y = -10$,
- $x = 8$ or $x = -8$,
- $y = 8$ or $y = -8$.

Solving this system of equations gives us the vertices of the polygon: $(8, 2)$, $(8, -2)$, $(-8, 2)$, and $(-8, -2)$.

The polygon is a square with side length 16 (since the distance between each pair of adjacent vertices is $\sqrt{(8-(-8))^2 + (2-(-2))^2} = \sqrt{16^2 + 4^2} = \sqrt{256 + 16} = \sqrt{272} = 16\sqrt{2}$, but since it's a square, we can just take 16).

The area of a square is side length squared, so the area of this square is $16^2 = 256$.
The answer is: $256$

"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"
Analyze this problem and think step by step to come to a solution with programs. After solving the problem, output the final numerical answer within \boxed{}.

Assistant:



The expression $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ is equal to zero if and only if either $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$.

Each of these equations is equivalent to $\vert x + y \vert = 10$, $\vert x - y \vert = 10$, $\vert x \vert = 8$, or $\vert y \vert = 8$.

The lines $\vert x + y \vert = 10$, $\vert x - y \vert = 10$, $\vert x \vert = 8$, and $\vert y \vert = 8$ form a square with side length 16.

The area of this square is $16^2 = 256$. So the area of the convex polygon is 256 square units.
The answer is: $256$

Assistant:

 The equation is satisfied only when both $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ and $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$, which implies that $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. This is only possible when $|x| = 10$ and $|y| = 10$, which forms a square with side length 20.
The area of this square is $20 \times 20 = 400$.

Interesting, let's analyze step by step:



1. The product of two numbers is zero if and only if at least one of them is zero. Therefore, we have two cases to consider: $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$.

2. Solving these equations will give us the vertices of the polygon. We have the following solutions:
- For $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$, we get $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ which means $x + y = 10$ or $x + y = -10$.
- For $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$, we get $\vert x - y \vert = 10$ which means $x - y = 10$ or $x - y = -10$.
- For $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$, we get $\vert x \vert = 8$ which means $x = 8$ or $x = -8$.
- For $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$, we get $\vert y \vert = 8$ which means $y = 8$ or $y = -8$.

3. By solving the system of equations formed by the combinations of these equations, we can find all the vertices of the polygon. There are 8 vertices in total: $(8, 8)$, $(8, -8)$, $(-8, 8)$, $(-8, -8)$, $(10, 0)$, $(0, 10)$, $(-10, 0)$, $(0, -10)$.

4. To find the area of the polygon, we can use the Shoelace Formula. The Shoelace Formula states that if the vertices of a polygon are $(x_1, y_1), (x_2, y_2), ..., (x_n, y_n)$, then the area of the polygon is given by $\frac{1}{2} |(x_1y_2 + x_2y_3 + ... + x_ny_1) - (y_1x_2 + y_2x_3 + ... + y_nx_1)|$.

5. Applying the Shoelace Formula to the polygon with vertices $(8, 8)$, $(8, -8)$, $(-8, 8)$, $(-8, -8)$, $(10, 0)$, $(0, 10)$, $(-10, 0)$, $(0, -10)$, we can calculate the area.

6. The area of the polygon is 128 square units.

Here is the Python code to calculate the area:

```python


INTERMEDIATE OUT :

from sympy import *

def area_of_polygon():
    # Vertices of the polygon
    vertices = [(8, 8), (8, -8), (-8, 8), (-8, -8), (10, 0), (0, 10), (-10, 0), (0, -10)]

    # Number of vertices
    n = len(vertices)

    # Coordinates of the vertices
    x = [vertex[0] for vertex in vertices]
    y = [vertex[1] for vertex in vertices]

    # Applying the Shoelace Formula
    area = abs(sum(x[i]*y[i+1] for i in range(n)) - sum(y[i]*x[i+1] for i in range(n))) / 2

Below is a math problem you are to solve (positive numerical answer):
"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"

Assistant: 

Interesting, let's analyze step by step:



The expression equals to zero if either of the two factors equals to zero. Thus, we have two systems of equations:

1) $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0 \rightarrow \vert x + y \vert = 10$
2) $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0 \rightarrow \vert x - y \vert = 10$
3) $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0 \rightarrow \vert x \vert = 8$
4) $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0 \rightarrow \vert y \vert = 8$

The solutions for the first two equations are:

For 1): $x + y = 10$ or $x + y = -10$.
For 2): $x - y = 10$ or $x - y = -10$.
The solutions for the last two equations are:

For 3): $x = 8$ or $x = -8$.
For 4): $y = 8$ or $y = -8$.

Now we get the vertices of the polygon: $(8, 8), (8, -8), (-8, 8), (-8, -8)$. These are the vertices of a square with side length $16$.

The area of a square is calculated as side length squared, so the area of this square is $16^2 = 256$. The answer is a positive integer, not an algebraic expression, so the area of the convex polygon is $\boxed{256}$. The python code to calculate this is as follows:

```python


INTERMEDIATE OUT :

def calculate_area():
    side_length = 16
    area = side_length ** 2
    return area

result = calculate_area()
print(result)
```

256

CODE RESULTS 256

INTERMEDIATE OUT :
```output
256
```
So, the area of the convex polygon is $256$.
