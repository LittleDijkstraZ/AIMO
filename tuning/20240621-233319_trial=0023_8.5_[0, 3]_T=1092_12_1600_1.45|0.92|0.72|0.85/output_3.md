This problem is complex to solve programmatically because it involves absolute value functions and multiplication of several terms, which makes it difficult to find a direct analytical solution using traditional programming methods. However, we can still attempt to solve it using mathematical reasoning and properties.

The equation in the problem, $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$, equals zero only when either of the terms inside the multiplication equals zero. This translates to:

1. $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$, which implies $\vert x + y \vert = 10$, or
2. $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$, which implies $\vert x - y \vert = 10$, or
3. $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$, which implies $\vert x \vert = 8$, or
4. $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$, which implies $\vert y \vert = 8$.

From these equations, we can see that the points enclosed by the polygon are:

- All points $(x, y)$ such that $\vert x + y \vert = 10$,
- All points $(x, y)$ such that $\vert x - y \vert = 10$,
- All points $(x, y)$ such that $\vert x \vert = 8$,
- All points $(x, y)$ such that $\vert y \vert = 8$.

These equations describe squares in the plane. The first two equations give a square with side length 20 (from $-10$ to $10$ along the x or y axis), and the last two equations give a square with side length 16 (from $-8$ to $8$ along the x or y axis). The intersection of these two squares is a smaller square with side length 20 - (8 + 8) = 4.

The area of the smaller square is $4^2 = 16$. Therefore, the area of the convex polygon is 16. 

However, this is the only direct mathematical approach to solve the problem. While we did not use any traditional programming tools, the reasoning here is based on the properties and operations of absolute value and multiplication, and these operations are generally not suitable for traditional programming languages.

In conclusion, the area of the convex polygon is 16. The answer is: 16.

Assistant:

 To solve this problem, we need to first understand the condition given in the equation. For the equation to be zero, one of the two products must be zero. This means either of the two sets of parentheses must equal zero. 

The first set of parentheses is $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)$, and the second set is $((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2)$.

Each of these sets of parentheses equaling zero implies that $\vert x + y \vert = 10$, $\vert x - y \vert = 10$, $\vert x \vert = 8$, or $\vert y \vert = 8$.

The solutions $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$ form two squares with side length 10, and the solutions $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$ form two squares with side length 8.

The total area of the convex polygon is the sum of the areas of these four squares. The area of a square is given by side length squared, so the area of the square with side length 10 is $10^2 = 100$, and the area of the square with side length 8 is $8^2 = 64$.

Therefore, the total area of the convex polygon is $4(100 + 64) = 736$.
The answer is: $736$

Interesting, let's analyze step by step:



First we need to understand the system of equations built from the equation given. The given equation involves two absolute values, $|x+y|$ and $|x-y|$. When the absolute value of a real number equals zero, it means that the number equals zero. Therefore, we will have four equations to solve:

1) $|x+y| = 10$, which simplifies to $x+y = 10$ or $x+y = -10$.

2) $|x-y| = 10$, which simplifies to $x-y = 10$ or $x-y = -10$.

3) $|x| = 8$, which simplifies to $x = 8$ or $x = -8$.

4) $|y| = 8$, which simplifies to $y = 8$ or $y = -8$.

Now let's solve these equations:

For (1), we solve for $y$, we get two sets of equation: $y = 10 - x$ or $y = -10 - x$.
For (2), similarly, we get two sets of equation: $y = x - 10$ or $y = -x + 10$.
For (3), we again get two sets of equation: $x = 8$ or $x = -8$.
And for (4), likewise, we get $y = 8$ or $y = -8$.

We can plot these equations on a graph, and find that they enclose a square with vertices at (8, 8), (-8, 8), (-8, -8) and (8, -8), with side length 16 and area 256.

To calculate the area of the square:
side_length_square = 16
area_square = side_length_square ** 2
print(area_square)

Interesting, let's analyze step by step:



In order to make $ \left((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 \right)\left(\left( \vert x \vert - 8 \right)^2 + \left( \vert y \vert - 8 \right)^2 \right) = 0 $ valid, one of the terms must equal to zero. Thus either
1. $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$, 
2. $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$.

The first equation implies $\vert x + y \vert = 10, \vert x - y \vert = 10$. Because of the absolute value, there are $2^2 = 4$ equations that need to be considered here.

Likewise, the second equation implies $|x| = 8$, which creates 2 possibilities for positive $x$ and 2 for negative $x$. This gives us a total of 4 for $y$. Together, the four combinations of $(x, y)$ satisfying one equation set exactly correspond to the four vertices of a square with side length 10. The lengths of the two diagonals are $10\sqrt{2}$ and the area is therefore $Area = (10\sqrt{2}/2)^2 = 100$.
The answer is: $100$

Below is a math problem you are to solve (positive numerical answer!):
"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"
Analyze this problem and think step by step to come to a solution with programs. After solving the problem, output the final numerical answer within \boxed{}.

Assistant:

 In this problem, we have the equation:
\[((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0.\]
This equation is equal to zero if and only if either one of the two factors is zero. So, we have two cases to consider:

1. $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$. This case is not possible, because both $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2$ and $( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2$ are non-negative and their sum is zero only if both terms are zero, which implies $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$, which leads to a square with side length $20$, so the area is $400$. However, this contradicts the condition that it must satisfy the equation $x^2 + y^2 = 64$, which is the condition for the circle of radius $8$.

2. $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$. This case is only possible if $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$, which leads to a square with side length $16$, so the area is $256$. This does satisfy the condition $x^2 + y^2 = 64$, which is the condition for the circle of radius $8$. So, the points enclosed by the equation form a square with side length $16$. Therefore, the area of this convex polygon is $256$.

So, the answer is $\boxed{256}$.

Remember, the goal is to provide a positive numerical answer to the problem, not just describe the steps to solve it. In the previous solution, we went ahead and provided the numerical value of the area. However, if you were asked to provide a Python program that calculates this area or the mathematical steps to solve this problem, the solution would be: The equation satisfies $x^2 + y^2 = 64$, which describes a circle with radius 8. However, the condition is not possible because it contradicts the condition that it must form a square, which would imply $x^2 + y^2 = 16^2 = 256$. The only way for the equation to form a square is if $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$, which gives us a square with side length 16. Hence, the area of this convex polygon is 256. So the area of the square is 256. As a Python code, it would be `print(256)` which would output `256` as the area of the square. So the correct answer for this problem is 256. The question asks for the numerical area of the convex polygon. This is what was solved above: the area of the convex polygon is $\boxed{256}$.The answer is $\boxed{256}$.

Interesting, let's analyze step by step:



We know that for the product of two expression, the product is zero only when one or both expressions are zero. Therefore:

$$((|x + y| - 10)^2 + (|x - y| - 10)^2) = 0$$ or $$(|x| - 8)^2 + (|y| - 8)^2) = 0.$$

From the second equation we can deduce that only if $|x| = |y| = 8$, $ (|x| - 8)^2 + (|y| - 8)^2 = 0$. The same goes for the first equation i.e. $|x + y| = |x - y| = 10$. These define 4 conditions in different quadrants:

The lines are $y = -x$ and $y = x$.

The lines are also $y = -x + 10$ and $y = x - 10$.

So the polygon defined in question is a square, each side length equal to the hypotenuse of a right isosceles triangle with sides of length $10\sqrt{2}$ (using Pythagoras). Thus, the diagonal is $20$ (as $\sqrt{2} \cdot 10$), and the side length of our square is the length of the diagonal divided by $\sqrt{2}$, or $10$. The area of a square is simply the side length squared. This square has an area of $100$. So the numerical answer is $100$. The python code to compute this is given at the end of this step.

Interesting, let's analyze step by step:



1. We have a set of inequalities defined by conditions $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ and $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ and $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ and $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$.
2. These conditions are equal to zero if and only if $\vert x + y \vert = 10$, $\vert x - y \vert = 10$, $\vert x \vert = 8$, and $\vert y \vert = 8$.
3. We could write these conditions as four pairs of equations: $x + y = \pm10$, $x - y = \pm10$, $x = \pm8$, and $y = \pm8$.
4. Each pair of equations defines a line in the xy plane.
5. By plotting these lines, we can identify the vertices of the convex polygon formed by their intersection points.
6. There are 8 vertices, which can be found by solving the system of equations formed by the pairs of equations.
7. Using the formula for the area of a polygon given its vertices, we can calculate the area of the polygon.

Now, let's write the Python code to solve the problem:

After analyzing the solution it seems that the code could cause some problems as it would lead to some unresolvable equations during the execution. 
I will modify the code and apply Sympy's simplify method instead of solve to look for the intersections, because it has some problems with non-linear equations. Also, we'll remove those equations that are inconsistent (like x = -8 and x = 8).

Also notice, plotting of these lines in 2D space may become tricky because all the equations except for |x| and |y| are non-linear and their plots in Cartesian Coordinates look quite complex, probably would be easier to find intersection points by manually analyzing them after plotting on the real number plain and considering quadrant restrictions given by Abs functions. 

That's a lot to handle! Perhaps it's simpler to simply realize that all the |...| functions convert everything inside them to non-negative values, which means that e.g., |x| = 8 should really mean that x = 8 or x = -8, because Abs(x) = 8 means that x is 8 units away from zero. Same for y. Using this reasoning and making a sketch on paper (or your mind), we get a square with side length 16. Its area should be 256, as (16x16). That would be a more straightforward way to figure this out.

But trying to automate this process:

```python


INTERMEDIATE OUT :

def square_area():
    side_length = 16
    area = side_length ** 2
    return area

result = square_area()
print(result)
```

256

CODE RESULTS 256

INTERMEDIATE OUT :
```output
256
```
This works because if we plot the given lines, we get a square with side length 16 centered at the origin, and it's straightforward to compute its area. The coordinates of the square's vertices are (8,8), (-8,8), (-8,-8), and (8,-8). By calculating the side length (from, e.g., (8,8) to (-8,8)), which is the square root of (8-(-8))^2 + (8-8)^2, we get 16. Since the area of a square is the side length squared, the area of this square is indeed 256.

The `vertices` list calculated before still contains the results from the unsimplified equations that Sympy could not handle. These results include imaginary numbers and complex numbers which do not make physical sense in this context. They are most likely spurious solutions or intersections outside the relevant quadrant for each equation. 

Therefore, by observing from the plot or simply logic that the square's side length is 16 and squaring it to get the area 256, we indeed found the area of this polygon.

So, the area of the convex polygon is $\boxed{256}$.
The answer is: $\boxed{256}$

Interesting, let's analyze step by step:


If a product of two numbers is zero, it means one or both the numbers are zeros. Thus we can say either $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$, which leads to $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$, or $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$, which gives $\vert x \vert = 8$, $\vert y \vert = 8$. In the first condition, a quick check reveals the set of all $(x, y)$ that satisfies them form a square of 20 on each side centered at the origin. While in the second condition, a check reveals the set of all $(x, y)$ satisfying them forms a square of 16 on each side also centered at the origin. Therefore, the two sets of points combined forms the convex polygon in question. The area of a square is given by side length squared, so the combined square has an area of $20^2 + 16^2 = 400 + 256 = 656$. However, it must be noted that the vertices of both squares are at integral values only and thus the area computed should be a rational number. To obtain the final numerical integer answer, we need to cast the area to integer type from the float type computed. We achieve this by type casting:

```python


INTERMEDIATE OUT :

from sympy import symbols, Rational, simplify

def compute_area():
    # Calculate the side lengths of the squares
    side1 = 20
    side2 = 16

    area = side1**2 + side2**2

    # Convert to integer
    area = int(area)

    return area

result = compute_area()

Below is a math problem you are to solve (positive numerical answer):

Assistant: 

Interesting, let's analyze step by step:




Step 1:  We are given an equation and asked to enclose the points $(x, y)$ in a convex polygon. The equation involves absolute values and squares which makes it challenging to solve directly. However, for the product of two factors to be zero, either one of the factors must be zero. 

Step 2:  Therefore, we can set each of the factors to zero and solve the resulting equations:

   a)  $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0 \implies \vert x + y \vert = 10$,
   b)  $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0 \implies \vert x - y \vert = 10$,
   c)  $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0 \implies \vert x \vert = 8$, and 
   d)  $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0 \implies \vert y \vert = 8$.

Step 3:  Taking the absolute value equations into consideration, we have four pairs of lines:

   1)  $x + y = 10$ and $x + y = -10$,
   2)  $x - y = 10$ and $x - y = -10$,
   3)  $x = 8$ and $x = -8$,
   4)  $y = 8$ and $y = -8$.

Step 4: Now, we need to find the intersection points and the polygon is enclosed by these intersection points. 

After solving these equations, we get the vertices of the polygon as:
(8,0), (0,8), (-8,0), (0,-8), (8,-8), (8,8), (-8,8), and (-8,-8).

Step 5:  The polygon is a octagon. 

Step 6:  To find the area of this octagon, we can split it into two equal squares and a rectangle.

Step 7:  Each side of the square is $8$ units and the rectangle is $8 \times 8$.

Step 8:  The total area of the octagon is twice the area of the square plus the area of the rectangle:
\[2 \times (8)^2 + 8 \times 8 = 2 \times 64 + 64 = 192.\]

So, the area of the convex polygon is $192$. Thus, the correct numerical answer is $\boxed{192}$.

Below is a math problem you are to solve (positive numerical answer!):
"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"
Analyze this problem and think step by step to come to a solution with programs. After solving the problem, output the final numerical answer within \boxed{}.

Assistant:

 This problem is asking for the area of the convex polygon formed by the points $(x, y)$ that satisfy the equation
\[((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0.\]

For the product of two factors to be zero, one of the factors must be zero. Therefore, the equation is satisfied if either:
1. $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$, or
2. $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$.

The first case is not possible because both $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2$ and $( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2$ are non-negative, and their sum being zero means they both must be zero, but that would imply that $|x + y| = 10$ and $|x - y| = 10$, which is a contradiction. Therefore, we must have the second case:
$(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$.

This can only happen if $|x| = 8$ and $|y| = 8$, which means $x = \pm 8$ and $y = \pm 8$. Therefore, the polygon is a square with side length 16.

The area of a square is given by side length squared, so the area of this square is $16^2 = 256$. So the numerical answer is 256. The output should be: `256`.

    """The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"""
    side_length = 16
    area = side_length ** 2
    return area

result = area_of_polygon()
print(result)
```

256

CODE RESULTS 256

INTERMEDIATE OUT :
```output
