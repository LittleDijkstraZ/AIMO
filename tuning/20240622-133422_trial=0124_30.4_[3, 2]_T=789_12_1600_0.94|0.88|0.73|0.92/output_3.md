Below is a math problem you are to solve (positive numerical answer!):
"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"

 The expression $A \cdot B = 0$ is true if and only if $A = 0$ or $B = 0$. So the given equation is satisfied if and only if either of the following two equations is satisfied:

1. $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$
2. $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$

For the first equation to be satisfied, we must have $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. This means that the points $(x, y)$ lie on the lines $x + y = 10$ and $x - y = 10$. These lines intersect at $(5, 5)$ and $(-5, -5)$.

For the second equation to be satisfied, we must have $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$. This means that the points $(x, y)$ lie on the lines $x = 8$ and $x = -8$, and the lines $y = 8$ and $y = -8$. These lines intersect at $(8, 8)$, $(-8, 8)$, $(-8, -8)$, and $(8, -8)$.

The points $(x, y)$ that satisfy the given equation are therefore the points that lie on the lines $x + y = 10$, $x - y = 10$, $x = 8$, $x = -8$, $y = 8$, and $y = -8$. These lines form a rectangle with side lengths 16 and 20.

The area of this rectangle is $16 \cdot 20 = 320$. Therefore, the area of the convex polygon is 320. The answer is: $320$

To accomplish this, first determine a sympy-based approach for solving the problem by listing each step to take and what functions need to be called in each step. Be clear so even an idiot can follow your instructions, and remember, your final answer should be positive integer, not an algebraic expression!
Write the entire script covering all the steps (use comments and document it well) and print the result. After solving the problem, output the final numerical answer within \boxed{}.

Interesting, let's analyze step by step:



1. The expression equals 0 if any of the terms equals 0. Therefore, we have four cases to consider:
   - $|x + y| - 10 = 0$
   - $|x - y| - 10 = 0$
   - $|x| - 8 = 0$
   - $|y| - 8 = 0$
2. For each case, we solve the absolute value equations:
   - For the first case, $|x + y| - 10 = 0$ gives $|x + y| = 10$, which means $x + y = 10$ or $x + y = -10$.
   - For the second case, $|x - y| - 10 = 0$ gives $|x - y| = 10$, which means $x - y = 10$ or $x - y = -10$.
   - For the third case, $|x| - 8 = 0$ gives $|x| = 8$, which means $x = 8$ or $x = -8$.
   - For the fourth case, $|y| - 8 = 0$ gives $|y| = 8$, which means $y = 8$ or $y = -8$.
3. We solve the system of equations formed by the intersections of the above solutions to find the vertices of the polygon.
4. Finally, we calculate the area of the polygon.

However, in this case, the problem simplifies greatly due to the specific form of the expression. The product of two terms equals zero if either term equals zero. Therefore, we can consider each term separately:

- If $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$, then $\vert x + y \vert = 10$. This gives us the lines $x + y = 10$ and $x + y = -10$.
- If $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$, then $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. This gives us the lines $x - y = 10$ and $x - y = -10$.
- If $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$, then $\vert x \vert = 8$. This gives us the lines $x = 8$ and $x = -8$.
- If $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$, then $\vert y \vert = 8$. This gives us the lines $y = 8$ and $y = -8$.

These lines form a square with side length 16. The area of this square is $16^2 = 256$.

Therefore, the area of the convex polygon is 256 square units. The answer is: $256$

Interesting, let's analyze step by step:



The condition for the product of two numbers being zero is that at least one of them is zero. So we have two cases:

1) $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ and $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ and $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$.

2) $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ and $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ and $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$.

In the first case, we have $\vert x + y \vert = 10$, $\vert x \vert = 8$, and $\vert y \vert = 8$. This gives us the vertices of the square as $(8, 0)$, $(0, 8)$, $(-8, 0)$, and $(0, -8)$.

In the second case, we have $\vert x - y \vert = 10$, $\vert x \vert = 8$, and $\vert y \vert = 8$. This gives us the vertices of the square as $(8, 8)$, $(8, -8)$, $(-8, 8)$, and $(-8, -8)$.

Combining both cases, we see that the points satisfying the equation form a square with side length 16. The area of this square is $16^2 = 256$. So the area of the convex polygon is $256$.

The answer is: $256$

Interesting, let's analyze step by step:



The given equation is $0 = 0$, which means either of the two factors must be zero. This gives us two systems of equations to solve:

1. $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ and $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$.
2. $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ and $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$.

For the first system, we get $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x \vert = 8$. The solutions to these are $x + y = \pm 10$ and $x = \pm 8$.

For the second system, we get $\vert x - y \vert = 10$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$. The solutions to these are $x - y = \pm 10$ and $y = \pm 8$.

Now we need to find the intersection points of these lines. By solving the equations $x + y = \pm 10$ and $x - y = \pm 10$ simultaneously, we find the intersection points to be $(8,2)$, $(8,-2)$, $(-8,2)$, and $(-8,-2)$. Similarly, by solving the equations $x + y = \pm 10$ and $y = \pm 8$ simultaneously, we find the same intersection points.

The four points $(8,2)$, $(8,-2)$, $(-8,2)$, and $(-8,-2)$ form a square with side length 16. The area of this square is $16^2 = 256$.

So the area of the convex polygon is 256.
