Below is a math problem you are to solve (positive numerical answer):
"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"
To accomplish this, first determine a sympy-based approach for solving the problem by listing each step to take and what functions need to be called in each step. Be clear so even an idiot can follow your instructions, and remember, your final answer should be positive integer, not an algebraic expression!
Write the entire script covering all the steps (use comments and document it well) and print the result. After solving the problem, output the final numerical answer within \boxed{}.

Interesting, let's analyze step by step:



The given equation is a product of two terms equal to zero, which means either of the terms should be zero. This gives us two cases:

1. $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$
2. $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$

From the first case, we have $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$.
From the second case, we have $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$.

Now, let's solve these equations:

For $\vert x + y \vert = 10$, the solutions are $x + y = 10$ and $x + y = -10$.
For $\vert x - y \vert = 10$, the solutions are $x - y = 10$ and $x - y = -10$.
For $\vert x \vert = 8$, the solutions are $x = 8$ and $x = -8$.
For $\vert y \vert = 8$, the solutions are $y = 8$ and $y = -8$.

The solutions form a rectangle with vertices at $(8, 8)$, $(8, -8)$, $(-8, 8)$, and $(-8, -8)$. The dimensions of the rectangle are 16 units by 16 units.

The area of the rectangle is $16 \times 16 = 256$.

So, the area of the convex polygon is 256 square units.

```python


INTERMEDIATE OUT :

from sympy import symbols, solve

def area_of_polygon():
    # Define the variables
    x, y = symbols('x y')

    # Analyze the equations
    solutions_1 = solve([abs(x + y) - 10, abs(x - y) - 10])
    solutions_2 = solve([abs(x) - 8, abs(y) - 8])

    # Form the vertices of the rectangle
    vertices = [(-8, 8), (-8, -8), (8, 8), (8, -8)]

    # Calculate the dimensions of the rectangle
    length = max(vertices)[0] - min(vertices)[0]
    width = max(vertices)[1] - min(vertices)[1]

    # Calculate the area of the rectangle
    area = length * width

    return area

result = area_of_polygon()
print(result)
```

256

Below is a math problem you are to solve (positive numerical answer):
"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"

Interesting, let's analyze step by step:



1. The product of two numbers is zero if and only if at least one of the numbers is zero. Therefore, we have two cases to consider:
   a) $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$
   b) $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$

2. For $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$, we have $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ or $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. These equations represent two straight lines.

3. For $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$, we have $\vert x \vert = 8$ or $\vert y \vert = 8$. These equations represent four straight lines.

4. The intersection of these lines forms a square with side length 10 (from $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$) and inscribed in a square with side length 16 (from $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$).

5. The area of the convex polygon (the square) is the difference between the areas of the two squares, which is $16^2 - 10^2 = 256 - 100 = 156$.

So, the area of the convex polygon is 156. The answer is: $156$

Interesting, let's analyze step by step:



1. The product of two numbers is zero if and only if at least one of the numbers is zero. So, the given equation is equivalent to the union of the following two sets of points:

- $ (\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0 $ or $ (\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0 $
- $ (\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0 $ or $ (\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0 $

2. The equations $ (\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0 $ and $ (\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0 $ imply that $ \vert x + y \vert = 10 $ and $ \vert x - y \vert = 10 $. This means that $ x + y = \pm 10 $ and $ x - y = \pm 10 $. Solving these equations gives us the vertices of a square with side length 20.

3. The equations $ (\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0 $ and $ (\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0 $ imply that $ \vert x \vert = 8 $ and $ \vert y \vert = 8 $. This means that $ x = \pm 8 $ and $ y = \pm 8 $. Solving these equations gives us the vertices of a square with side length 16.

4. The intersection of these two squares is another square with side length 8.

5. The area of a square is given by the square of the length of its side. So, the area of the smaller square is $ 8^2 = 64 $.

The answer is: $64$

$$((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$$

From the first equation, we have $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. This implies that $x + y = \pm 10$ and $x - y = \pm 10$. Solving this system of equations, we get the four lines $y = x \pm 10$ and $y = -(x \pm 10)$.

From the second equation, we have $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$. This implies that $x = \pm 8$ and $y = \pm 8$. Solving this system of equations, we get the four lines $x = 8$, $x = -8$, $y = 8$, and $y = -8$.

The intersection points of these lines form a square with side length 16. The area of this square is $16^2 = 256$.

Therefore, the area of the convex polygon is 256.

```

The above code is not working correctly because the `solve` function returns an empty list. Let's try a different approach.

We know that the product of two numbers is zero if and only if at least one of the numbers is zero. Therefore, the given equation is equivalent to the system of equations:

$$((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2) = 0$$
$$((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$$

From the first equation, we have $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. This implies that $x + y = \pm 10$ and $x - y = \pm 10$. Solving this system of equations, we get the four lines $y = x \pm 10$ and $y = -(x \pm 10)$.

From the second equation, we have $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$. This implies that $x = \pm 8$ and $y = \pm 8$. Solving this system of equations, we get the four lines $x = 8$, $x = -8$, $y = 8$, and $y = -8$.

The intersection points of these lines form a square with side length 16. The area of this square is $16^2 = 256$.

So, the area of the convex polygon is 256.
The answer is: $256$

"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"
Analyze this problem and think step by step to come to a solution with programs. After solving the problem, output the final numerical answer within \boxed{}.

Assistant:

 The given equation is a product of two expressions equal to zero, so either the first expression is zero or the second expression is zero.
If the first expression is zero, then we have $\vert x + y \vert - 10 = 0$ and $\vert x - y \vert - 10 = 0$, which implies $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$.
This means that the points $(x, y)$ lie on the lines $x + y = 10$ and $x - y = 10$.
Similarly, if the second expression is zero, then we have $\vert x \vert - 8 = 0$ and $\vert y \vert - 8 = 0$, which implies $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$.
This means that the points $(x, y)$ lie on the lines $x = \pm 8$ and $y = \pm 8$.
The points that satisfy both conditions are the vertices of a square with side length 10.
The area of this square is $10^2 = 100$.
So, the area of the convex polygon is 100. The answer is: $100$

Interesting, let's analyze step by step:



1. The equation is a product of two terms equal to zero, so either the first term is zero or the second term is zero.
2. The first term is zero when either $|x+y| - 10 = 0$ or $|x-y| - 10 = 0$, which simplifies to $|x+y| = 10$ or $|x-y| = 10$. These are the equations of two lines.
3. The second term is zero when either $|x| - 8 = 0$ or $|y| - 8 = 0$, which simplifies to $|x| = 8$ or $|y| = 8$. These are the equations of two lines.
4. The intersection of these lines forms a square with side length 16 (since $|x| = 8$ and $|y| = 8$ gives a square with side length 16 in both the x and y directions).
5. The area of this square is $16^2 = 256$.

Now let's write the python code to calculate the area:

```python


INTERMEDIATE OUT :

def area_of_polygon():
    side_length = 16
    area = side_length ** 2
    return area

result = area_of_polygon()
