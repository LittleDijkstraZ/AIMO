Below is a math problem you are to solve (positive numerical answer):
"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"
To accomplish this, first determine a sympy-based approach for solving the problem by listing each step to take and what functions need to be called in each step. Be clear so even an idiot can follow your instructions, and remember, your final answer should be positive integer, not an algebraic expression!
Write the entire script covering all the steps (use comments and document it well) and print the result. After solving the problem, output the final numerical answer within \boxed{}.

Interesting, let's analyze step by step:



1. First, we need to understand the given equation. The equation is equal to zero if and only if both terms are equal to zero. This gives us two systems of equations:

   a) $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ and $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$.
   
   b) $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ and $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$.

2. For each system, we can set each term inside the absolute value equal to zero and solve for x and y. 

   For system a), we get:
   
   i) $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x \vert = 8$.
   
   ii) Solving these equations gives us the lines $x + y = 10$, $x + y = -10$, $x = 8$, and $x = -8$.
   
   For system b), we get:
   
   i) $\vert x - y \vert = 10$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$.
   
   ii) Solving these equations gives us the lines $x - y = 10$, $x - y = -10$, $y = 8$, and $y = -8$.

3. The intersection points of these lines form a square with side length 8.

4. To find the area of the square, we simply square the length of one side. So the area is $8^2 = 64$.

The answer is: $64$

Interesting, let's analyze step by step:



The expression equals to zero if either of the two factors equals to zero. So we have two cases:

1. $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ and $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ and $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$.
2. $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ and $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ and $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$.

For the first case, we have $\vert x + y \vert = 10$, $\vert x \vert = 8$, and $\vert y \vert = 8$. This gives us the rectangle with vertices at $(8, 8)$, $(-8, 8)$, $(-8, -8)$, and $(8, -8)$.

For the second case, we have $\vert x - y \vert = 10$, $\vert x \vert = 8$, and $\vert y \vert = 8$. This gives us the same rectangle.

So the area of the convex polygon is the area of the rectangle, which is $8 \times 16 = 128$.

The answer is: $128$

 The equation $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ implies that $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$.
This means that $x + y = \pm 10$ and $x - y = \pm 10$.
Solving these equations, we get four lines: $x + y = 10$, $x + y = -10$, $x - y = 10$, and $x - y = -10$.
Similarly, $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ implies that $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$, which gives us four lines: $x = 8$, $x = -8$, $y = 8$, and $y = -8$.
The intersection of these lines form a square with side length 10. The area of this square is $10^2 = 100$.
So, the area of the convex polygon is 100. The answer is: $100$

 The given equation is a product of two expressions equal to zero, so either the first expression is zero or the second expression is zero. This means that the points that satisfy the equation are the union of the points that satisfy each of the two separate equations:

1. $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2) = 0$
2. $((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$

For the first equation to be zero, both $\vert x + y \vert - 10 = 0$ and $\vert x - y \vert - 10 = 0$, which means $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. This forms a square with side length 20.

For the second equation to be zero, both $\vert x \vert - 8 = 0$ and $\vert y \vert - 8 = 0$, which means $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$. This forms a square with side length 16.

The convex polygon is the intersection of these two squares, which is a square with side length 8. The area of this square is $8^2 = 64$.

So, the area of the convex polygon is 64. The answer is: $64$

 The given equation is a product of two terms equal to zero, which means that either the first term is zero or the second term is zero.

The first term is zero when $|x+y| - 10 = 0$ or $|x-y| - 10 = 0$. This implies $|x+y| = 10$ or $|x-y| = 10$. The solutions to these equations are all points on the lines $x+y = 10$, $x+y = -10$, $x-y = 10$, and $x-y = -10$. These lines form a rectangle with vertices at $(10,0)$, $(0,10)$, $(-10,0)$, and $(0,-10)$.

The second term is zero when $|x| - 8 = 0$ or $|y| - 8 = 0$. This implies $|x| = 8$ or $|y| = 8$. The solutions to these equations are all points on the lines $x = 8$, $x = -8$, $y = 8$, and $y = -8$. These lines form a rectangle with vertices at $(8,0)$, $(0,8)$, $(-8,0)$, and $(0,-8)$.

The intersection of the two rectangles is a square with side length 10 (the distance from $(0,0)$ to $(10,0)$ or $(0,10)$), so its area is $10^2 = 100$. Therefore, the area of the convex polygon is 100.

    # The side length of the square is the distance from (0,0) to (10,0) or (0,10)
    side_length = 10

    # The area of the square is the side length squared
    area = side_length ** 2

Interesting, let's analyze step by step:



The product of two numbers is zero if and only if at least one of the numbers is zero. So, we have two cases to consider:

1. $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ and $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ and $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ and $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$.
2. At least one of the terms in the product is zero.

For the first case, we have:

1. $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$.

From $\vert x + y \vert = 10$, we have $x + y = \pm 10$.
From $\vert x \vert = 8$, we have $x = \pm 8$.
From $\vert x - y \vert = 10$, we have $x - y = \pm 10$.
From $\vert y \vert = 8$, we have $y = \pm 8$.

The possible combinations of these equations give us the vertices of the polygon: $(8, 2)$, $(8, -2)$, $(-8, 2)$, $(-8, -2)$, $(2, 8)$, $(-2, 8)$, $(2, -8)$, and $(-2, -8)$.

For the second case, at least one of the terms in the product is zero. This means that the points that satisfy this condition are also vertices of the polygon.

Now, let's plot these points and find the area of the polygon. The polygon is a square with side length 16 (since the distance between any two adjacent vertices is 16). The area of the square is $16^2 = 256$.

So, the area of the convex polygon is 256.

```python


INTERMEDIATE OUT :

from sympy import symbols, simplify

def polygon_area():
    # The side length of the square
    side_length = 16

    # The area of the square
    area = side_length**2

    return area

result = polygon_area()
print(result)
```

256

The area of the convex polygon is $256$. The answer is: $256$

1. First, we need to understand the given equation. It's a product of two terms equals to zero. So, either the first term is zero or the second term is zero or both are zero.

2. Let's analyze the first term: $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2) = 0$. This term equals to zero if and only if $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. This means that the points $(x, y)$ lie on the lines $x + y = 10$ and $x - y = 10$. These lines intersect at the point $(5,5)$.

3. Now, let's analyze the second term: $((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$. This term equals to zero if and only if $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$. This means that the points $(x, y)$ lie on the lines $x = 8$ and $y = 8$. These lines intersect at the point $(8,8)$.

4. The points that satisfy both conditions are the points on the lines $x + y = 10$, $x - y = 10$, $x = 8$, and $y = 8$. These lines enclose a square with side length 10.

5. The area of this square is $10^2 = 100$.

So, the area of the convex polygon is 100.
