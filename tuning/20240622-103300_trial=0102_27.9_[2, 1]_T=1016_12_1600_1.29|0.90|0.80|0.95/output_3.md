Interesting, let's analyze step by step:



We're asked to find the area of the region that satisfies the equation
$ ((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$.

Now let's think about the equation: the product of two things equals zero if and only if one or both of them are zero. Therefore, either one of the expressions inside the parentheses must equal zero for the whole equation to be true.

1. We know that $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 \ge 0$ and $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 \ge 0$. Therefore, for the product to equal zero, $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ and $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$. This implies that $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$, or $-8 \le x \le 8$ and $-8 \le y \le 8$.

2. However, if $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$, we have $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ or $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. This implies that all points $(x, y)$ are within a square with side length $20$.

So we have found that the region of points that satisfy the equation is a square with side length $16$ (since $-8 \le x \le 8$ and $-8 \le y \le 8$), and its area is therefore $16^2 = 256$. The answer is: $256$

Assistant:

 The given equation is $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + (\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + (\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$.

For the product of two factors to be zero, either one of the factors has to be zero. Therefore, we have two cases:

1. $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ and $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ and $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$.
2. $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ and $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ and $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$.

From the first case, we get $\vert x + y \vert = 10$, $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$. The possible solutions are:
- $x + y = 10$, $x = 8$, $y = 2$;
- $x + y = 10$, $x = -8$, $y = 18$;
- $x + y = -10$, $x = 8$, $y = -18$;
- $x + y = -10$, $x = -8$, $y = -2$.

From the second case, we get $\vert x - y \vert = 10$, $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$. The possible solutions are:
- $x - y = 10$, $x = 8$, $y = -2$;
- $x - y = 10$, $x = -8$, $y = -18$;
- $x - y = -10$, $x = 8$, $y = 18$;
- $x - y = -10$, $x = -8$, $y = 2$.

So all the points that satisfy the given equation are: $(8, 2)$, $(8, -18)$, $(-8, 18)$, $(-8, -2)$, $(-8, -18)$, $(-8, 2)$, $(8, 18)$, $(8, -2)$. These points form a square with side length 20. The area of the square is $20 \times 20 = 400$. Therefore, the area of the convex polygon is $400$.

The solution is:
```python

To analyze the given equation and find the area of the enclosed convex polygon, we need to first understand the behavior of each term in the equation.
The first term $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)$ equals zero if and only if both $\vert x + y \vert - 10 = 0$ and $\vert x - y \vert - 10 = 0$, which implies $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. This gives us two lines: $x + y = \pm 10$ and $x - y = \pm 10$.
The second term $((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2)$ equals zero if and only if both $\vert x \vert - 8 = 0$ and $\vert y \vert - 8 = 0$, which implies $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$. This gives us two lines: $x = \pm 8$ and $y = \pm 8$.
The intersection of these four lines forms a square with side length 16. The area of this square is $16^2 = 256$. Therefore, the area of the enclosed convex polygon is 256.
The answer is: $256$

Interesting, let's analyze step by step:



Step 1: Given equations

$(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$

$(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$

The only way the sum of two squares equals zero is if each square is zero. This gives us two pairs of equations to solve:

(1) $\vert x + y \vert - 10 = 0 \Rightarrow \vert x + y \vert = 10$

(2) $\vert x - y \vert - 10 = 0 \Rightarrow \vert x - y \vert = 10$

(3) $\vert x \vert - 8 = 0 \Rightarrow \vert x \vert = 8$

(4) $\vert y \vert - 8 = 0 \Rightarrow \vert y \vert = 8$

Step 2: Solving the equations

From (3) and (4), we have $x = \pm 8$ and $y = \pm 8$.

For (1), $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ gives us four cases:

(i) $x + y = 10$
(ii) $x + y = -10$
(iii) $-x - y = 10$
(iv) $-x - y = -10$

For (2), $\vert x - y \vert = 10$ gives us four cases:

(i) $x - y = 10$
(ii) $x - y = -10$
(iii) $-x + y = 10$
(iv) $-x + y = -10$

Step 3: Solving the systems

Solving each of the 8 systems of equations (combination of (1) and (2) cases), we get the coordinates of the vertices of the polygon.

Step 4: Calculating the area

Now, we can calculate the area of the polygon. Using the Shoelace formula (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shoelace_formula), we can find the area.

The area of the polygon is $256$. The answer is: $256$

Assistant:

 The equation $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ is equal to 0 if and only if both of the factors are equal to 0. This happens if and only if $\vert x + y \vert = 10$, $\vert x - y \vert = 10$, $\vert x \vert = 8$, or $\vert y \vert = 8$.

The lines $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$ form a cross shape, and the lines $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$ form a square. The convex polygon is the intersection of these shapes, which is a square with side length 8.

The area of a square is given by the formula $s^2$, where $s$ is the side length. Therefore, the area of this square is $8^2 = 64$.
The answer is: 64

Interesting, let's analyze step by step:



The problem is asking for the area of a polygon that is defined by the set of points (x, y) that satisfy the equation:

$((|x + y| - 10)^2 + (|x - y| - 10)^2)((|x| - 8)^2 + (|y| - 8)^2) = 0$

This equation is satisfied when either of the two factors is zero.

The first factor is zero when both $|x + y| = 10$ and $|x - y| = 10$. This represents a square with side length 20, centered at the origin, with vertices at (10, 10), (-10, 10), (-10, -10), and (10, -10).

The second factor is zero when both $|x| = 8$ and $|y| = 8$. This represents a square with side length 16, also centered at the origin, with vertices at (8, 8), (-8, 8), (-8, -8), and (8, -8).

By finding the intersection of these two squares, we find that the polygon in question is a smaller square that is contained within the larger square defined by the first factor.

The side length of the smaller square is the length of the shorter diagonal of the larger square, which is equal to $\sqrt{(20)^2 + (20)^2} = 20\sqrt{2}$. Therefore, the area of the smaller square is $(\frac{20\sqrt{2}}{2})^2 = 100$.

Therefore, the area of the polygon is 100 square units. The answer is: $100$

Interesting, let's analyze step by step:


The product of two terms is zero if and only if at least one of the terms is zero. So we have two cases:

1. $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$
2. $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$

From the first case we get $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ or $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. These are the equations of two parallel lines.
From the second case we get $\vert x \vert = 8$ or $\vert y \vert = 8$. These are the equations of two perpendicular lines.

The four lines defined by these equations enclose a square. The length of the side of the square is 16 (since $\vert x \vert = 8$ implies $-8 \leq x \leq 8$, hence $2 \times 8 = 16$). Therefore, the area of the square is $16^2 = 256$. The answer is: $256$.
