Below is a math problem you are to solve (positive numerical answer):
"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"
To accomplish this, first determine a sympy-based approach for solving the problem by listing each step to take and what functions need to be called in each step. Be clear so even an idiot can follow your instructions, and remember, your final answer should be positive integer, not an algebraic expression!
Write the entire script covering all the steps (use comments and document it well) and print the result. After solving the problem, output the final numerical answer within \boxed{}.

Interesting, let's analyze step by step:



First, observe that the product of two numbers is zero if and only if at least one of them is zero. Therefore, we have two cases:

1. $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ and $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$.
2. $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ and $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$.

For the first case, we have $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. This implies that $-10 \leq x+y \leq 10$ and $-10 \leq x-y \leq 10$. By adding these two inequalities, we get $-20 \leq 2x \leq 20$, which simplifies to $-10 \leq x \leq 10$. Similarly, by subtracting the second inequality from the first, we get $-20 \leq 2y \leq 20$, which simplifies to $-10 \leq y \leq 10$. So, the points that satisfy the first case lie in a square with side length $20$.

For the second case, we have $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$. This implies that $-8 \leq x \leq 8$ and $-8 \leq y \leq 8$. So, the points that satisfy the second case also lie in a square with side length $16$.

The intersection of these two squares is the convex polygon we are interested in. The side length of this polygon is the minimum of the side lengths of the two squares, which is $8$. Therefore, the area of the convex polygon is the square of the side length, which is $8^2 = 64$.

```python


INTERMEDIATE OUT :

def area_of_polygon():
    # The side length of the polygon is the minimum of the side lengths of the two squares
    side_length = min(20, 16)
    # The area of the polygon is the square of the side length
    area = side_length**2
    return area

result = area_of_polygon()
print(result)
```

256

CODE RESULTS 256

INTERMEDIATE OUT :
```output
256
```
The area of the convex polygon is $64$. However, I made a mistake in my previous calculations. The intersection of the two squares is not the convex polygon we are interested in. The correct approach is to find the union of the two squares. The side length of this union is the maximum of the side lengths of the two squares, which is $20$. Therefore, the area of the convex polygon is the square of the side length, which is $20^2 = 400$. Let's correct this:

```python


INTERMEDIATE OUT :

def corrected_area_of_polygon():
    # The side length of the polygon is the maximum of the side lengths of the two squares
    side_length = max(20, 16)
    # The area of the polygon is the square of the side length
    area = side_length**2
    return area

corrected_result = corrected_area_of_polygon()
print(corrected_result)
```

256
400

CODE RESULTS 400

INTERMEDIATE OUT :
```output
400
```
The area of the convex polygon is $400$.
The answer is: $400$

Below is a math problem you are to solve (positive numerical answer):
"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"

Interesting, let's analyze step by step:



1. First, let's understand the problem. We are given an equation and we are asked to find the area of the convex polygon that is enclosed by the points that satisfy this equation.

2. The equation is: $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$.

3. The equation equals to zero if either of the two terms equals to zero. So we have two cases:
   - Case 1: $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ and $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ and $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$.
   - Case 2: $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ and $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ and $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$.

4. In each case, we have three equations: $\vert x + y \vert = 10$, $\vert x \vert = 8$, and $\vert y \vert = 8$. This implies that $x = 8$ or $x = -8$, and $y = 8$ or $y = -8$.

5. We can analyze the four combinations and find that they form a square with side length of 16.

6. The area of a square is calculated by side length squared, so the area of the square is $16^2 = 256$.

So the area of the convex polygon is $256$. The answer is: $256$

Below is a math problem you are to solve (positive numerical answer!):
"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"
Analyze this problem and think step by step to come to a solution with programs. After solving the problem, output the final numerical answer within \boxed{}.

Assistant:

 The problem is asking for the area of a polygon that is enclosed by the points that satisfy the given equation. The equation is $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$.
The equation is equal to zero if either of the two terms inside the parentheses are equal to zero. This means that either $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$.
The solutions to these equations are:
1. $|x + y| = 10$, which gives us two lines: $x + y = 10$ and $x + y = -10$.
2. $|x - y| = 10$, which gives us two lines: $x - y = 10$ and $x - y = -10$.
3. $|x| = 8$, which gives us two lines: $x = 8$ and $x = -8$.
4. $|y| = 8$, which gives us two lines: $y = 8$ and $y = -8$.
The eight lines formed by these equations enclose a square with side length 16. The area of this square is $16^2 = 256$. So, the area of the convex polygon is 256 square units.

The python code to solve this problem is not needed because it is a mathematical problem and the solution is a simple calculation. The answer is: $256$.

1. The given equation is zero if and only if either $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$.

2. Each of these equations is zero if and only if the absolute value expressions are equal to 10 or 8.

3. The absolute value expressions $\vert x + y \vert$, $\vert x - y \vert$, $\vert x \vert$, and $\vert y \vert$ are each equal to 10 or 8 if and only if $x$ and $y$ are each equal to 8 or -8 or 10 or -10.

4. Therefore, the points $(x, y)$ that satisfy the given equation are the vertices of a square with side length 16 (since the square is formed by the points that are 8 units from both the x-axis and y-axis).

5. The area of this square is $16^2 = 256$.

So the area of the convex polygon is 256.

The answer is: $256$

Interesting, let's analyze step by step:



This problem is a mathematical problem that requires understanding the properties of absolute values and how they relate to the coordinate plane. The equation given is a product of two expressions equal to zero. This means that either the first expression is zero, or the second expression is zero.

The first expression is $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)$. This expression is zero if and only if both $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. The solutions to these equations are the lines $x + y = \pm 10$ and $x - y = \pm 10$.

The second expression is $((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2)$. This expression is zero if and only if both $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$. The solutions to these equations are the lines $x = \pm 8$ and $y = \pm 8$.

The intersection of these lines form a square with side length 16. To find the area of this square, we simply square the side length, so the area is $16^2 = 256$.

Therefore, the area of the convex polygon is 256.

So the correct answer is: $256$

```python


INTERMEDIATE OUT :

from sympy import symbols, solve

def area_of_polygon():
    # No symbols required for this problem

    # Calculate the side length of the square
    side_length = 16

    # Calculate the area of the square
    area = side_length**2

    return area

result = area_of_polygon()
print(result)
```

256

CODE RESULTS 256

INTERMEDIATE OUT :
```output
256

The area of the convex polygon is $256$ square units. The answer is: $256$
