Below is a math problem you are to solve (positive numerical answer):
"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"
To accomplish this, first determine a sympy-based approach for solving the problem by listing each step to take and what functions need to be called in each step. Be clear so even an idiot can follow your instructions, and remember, your final answer should be positive integer, not an algebraic expression!
Write the entire script covering all the steps (use comments and document it well) and print the result. After solving the problem, output the final numerical answer within \boxed{}.

Interesting, let's analyze step by step:



1. The expression $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ will be true if either $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$.

2. The expression $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ will be true if $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$, which implies $x + y = 10$ and $x - y = 10$ or $x + y = -10$ and $x - y = -10$. The first case gives $x = 10$ and $y = 0$, and the second case gives $x = 0$ and $y = -10$. These are the vertices of a square with side length 10.

3. The expression $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ will be true if $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$, which implies $x = 8$ and $y = 8$ or $x = -8$ and $y = -8$. These are the vertices of a square with side length 8.

4. To get the area of the convex polygon, we need to find the area of the larger square and subtract the area of the smaller square. The area of a square with side length $a$ is $a^2$, so the area of the larger square is $10^2 = 100$, and the area of the smaller square is $8^2 = 64$.

5. Therefore, the area of the convex polygon is $100 - 64 = 36$.

```python


INTERMEDIATE OUT :

def calculate_area():
    # Side lengths of the squares
    side_length_large_square = 10
    side_length_small_square = 8

    # Areas of the squares
    area_large_square = side_length_large_square ** 2
    area_small_square = side_length_small_square ** 2

    # Area of the convex polygon
    area_convex_polygon = area_large_square - area_small_square

    return area_convex_polygon

result = calculate_area()
print(result)
```

36

INTERMEDIATE OUT :

The area of the convex polygon is $36$. The answer is: $\boxed{36}$

Below is a math problem you are to solve (positive numerical answer!):
"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"

The equation is satisfied if either $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$.

If $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$, then $\vert x + y \vert = 10$, which implies $x + y = \pm 10$.
If $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$, then $\vert x - y \vert = 10$, which implies $x - y = \pm 10$.
If $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$, then $\vert x \vert = 8$, which implies $x = \pm 8$.
If $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$, then $\vert y \vert = 8$, which implies $y = \pm 8$.

The solutions are the intersections of the lines $x + y = \pm 10$, $x - y = \pm 10$, $x = \pm 8$, and $y = \pm 8$.
The vertices of the polygon are at the points $(8, 2)$, $(8, -2)$, $(-8, 2)$, $(-8, -2)$, $(2, 8)$, $(-2, 8)$, $(2, -8)$, and $(-2, -8)$.

The polygon is a square with side length 16. The area of the square is $16^2 = 256$.
The answer is $\boxed{256}$.

Interesting, let's analyze step by step:



The given equation is $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$.

This equation is equal to zero if either of the two expressions inside the parentheses is zero. So we have two cases:

1. $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$.
2. $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$.

For the first case, both $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2$ and $( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2$ must be zero, which implies that $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. The solutions to these two equations are all points on the lines $x + y = \pm10$ and $x - y = \pm10$. These lines form a rectangle with vertices at $(10,0), (-10,0), (0,10),$ and $(0,-10)$.

For the second case, both $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2$ and $( \vert y \vert - 8)^2$ must be zero, which implies that $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$. The solutions to these two equations are all points on the lines $x = \pm8$ and $y = \pm8$. These lines form a square with vertices at $(8,8), (-8,8), (-8,-8),$ and $(8,-8)$.

The intersection of the solutions to the two cases is the convex polygon formed by the intersection of the rectangle and the square. This intersection is the square with vertices at $(8,8), (-8,8), (-8,-8),$ and $(8,-8)$.

The area of this square is $8^2 = 64$.

So the area of the convex polygon is 64. The answer is: $64$

Interesting, let's analyze step by step:



This problem requires us to solve an equation involving absolute values. First, we should consider the property of absolute value, $|x| = \sqrt{x^2}$. So we can rewrite the equation as:

$$((\sqrt{(x+y)^2} - 10)^2 + (\sqrt{(x-y)^2} - 10)^2)((\sqrt{x^2} - 8)^2 + (\sqrt{y^2} - 8)^2) = 0$$

For the product of two factors equals to zero, either of the factors must be zero. So we have two cases:

1. $ (\sqrt{(x+y)^2} - 10)^2 + (\sqrt{(x-y)^2} - 10)^2 = 0$
2. $(\sqrt{x^2} - 8)^2 + (\sqrt{y^2} - 8)^2 = 0$

From case 1, we get $\sqrt{(x+y)^2} = 10$ and $\sqrt{(x-y)^2} = 10$, which implies $x+y = \pm10$ and $x-y = \pm10$. Solving these two equations, we find that all points $(x, y)$ must satisfy $x = y = 5$ or $x = y = -5$.

From case 2, we get $\sqrt{x^2} = 8$ and $\sqrt{y^2} = 8$, which implies $x = \pm8$ and $y = \pm8$. Solving these two equations, we find that all points $(x, y)$ must satisfy $x = 8, y = 8$ or $x = -8, y = -8$.

So the set of points $(x, y)$ that satisfy the original equation are $(5, 5)$, $(-5, -5)$, $(8, 8)$, and $(-8, -8)$. These four points form a square with side length $10$. The area of the square is $10^2 = 100$. The answer is: $\boxed{100}$.

This problem is equivalent to finding the area of the unit square with vertices at $(8,8)$, $(-8,8)$, $(-8,-8)$, and $(8,-8)$.

The area of a square is given by the formula $s^2$, where $s$ is the length of one side. In this case, the side length is 16 (the distance between $(8,8)$ and $(-8,8)$ or $(8,-8)$ and $(-8,-8)$), so the area is $16^2 = 256$.

However, as the problem is asking for a positive numerical answer, we should disregard the negative solutions in the absolute values. Therefore, the area of the convex polygon is 256 square units. The answer is: $256$

 The given equation is a product of two terms equal to zero, which means that either the first term is zero, or the second term is zero, or both are zero.
The first term is zero when $|x + y| = 10$ and $|x - y| = 10$.
The second term is zero when $|x| = 8$ and $|y| = 8$.
The solutions to $|x + y| = 10$ are the lines $y = -x + 10$ and $y = -x - 10$.
The solutions to $|x - y| = 10$ are the lines $y = x + 10$ and $y = x - 10$.
The solutions to $|x| = 8$ are the lines $x = 8$ and $x = -8$.
The solutions to $|y| = 8$ are the lines $y = 8$ and $y = -8$.
The intersection points of these lines are the vertices of the polygon: $(8, 8)$, $(8, -8)$, $(-8, 8)$, and $(-8, -8)$.
The polygon is a square with side length $16$.
The area of the square is $16^2 = 256$.
Therefore, the area of the convex polygon is 256 square units.
The answer is: 256

 The expression $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2$ is equal to zero if and only if $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. These are the equations of two squares with side length 10 centered at the origin. The intersection of these two squares is a square with side length 10 centered at the origin.

Similarly, $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ if and only if $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$, which is the equation of a square with side length 16 centered at the origin.

The intersection of the two squares is the convex polygon we are looking for. This intersection is a square with side length 8 (since it is the smaller square inside the larger square). To find the area of this square, we simply square the side length, getting $8^2 = 64$. So the area of the convex polygon is 64. The answer is: $64$

Interesting, let's analyze step by step:



The expression $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ can be true only if both $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ and $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$. The only way both of these can be true is if $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. 

Similarly, $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ can be true only if both $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ and $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$, which implies $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$.

This means that the points must satisfy both $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$, and also $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$. The solutions to these equations are all the points in a square with side length 10 centered at the origin, and also the points in a square with side length 16 centered at the origin. 

The intersection of these two squares is the polygon we are looking for. The side length of the smaller square is 10, so its area is $10^2 = 100$. The side length of the larger square is 16, so its area is $16^2 = 256$. The area of the intersection of the two squares (the polygon we are looking for) is the difference of these two areas: $256 - 100 = 156$. So the area of the polygon is 156. The answer is: $156$

Interesting, let's analyze step by step:



The condition $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ is equivalent to either $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$.

This gives us four lines in the coordinate plane:

1. $x + y = 10$,
2. $x - y = 10$,
3. $x = 8$,
4. $y = 8$.

Plotting these lines, we find a square with side length 16. Thus, the area of the square is $16^2 = 256$.
The answer is: $256$
