Below is a math problem you are to solve (positive numerical answer!):
"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"
Analyze this problem and think step by step to come to a solution with programs. After solving the problem, output the final numerical answer within \boxed{}.

Assistant:

 The given equation is a product of two terms equal to zero. Therefore, either the first term is zero or the second term is zero. 

If either $\vert x + y \vert - 10 = 0$ or $\vert x - y \vert - 10 = 0$, then $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ or $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. These are four lines in the plane.

If either $\vert x \vert - 8 = 0$ or $\vert y \vert - 8 = 0$, then $\vert x \vert = 8$ or $\vert y \vert = 8$. These are four lines in the plane.

The intersection of these lines forms a square with side length 16. The area of the square is $16^2 = 256$.

So, the area of the convex polygon is 256 square units.
The answer is: $256$

Below is a math problem you are to solve (positive numerical answer!):
"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"

Assistant:

 The expression $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ is true if and only if at least one of the factors is equal to zero. This means that either $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$. 

The first factor equals zero if and only if $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. These are the equations of the lines $x + y = \pm 10$ and $x - y = \pm 10$.

The second factor equals zero if and only if $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$, which are the equations of the lines $x = \pm 8$ and $y = \pm 8$.

The points that satisfy both conditions are the vertices of a square with side length 16. Thus, the area of the polygon is $16^2 = 256$. The answer is: $256$

Below is a math problem you are to solve (positive numerical answer):
"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"
To accomplish this, first determine a sympy-based approach for solving the problem by listing each step to take and what functions need to be called in each step. Be clear so even an idiot can follow your instructions, and remember, your final answer should be positive integer, not an algebraic expression!
Write the entire script covering all the steps (use comments and document it well) and print the result. After solving the problem, output the final numerical answer within \boxed{}.

Assistant: 

Interesting, let's analyze step by step:



1. Notice that the product of two factors equals to zero if at least one of the factors equals to zero. Thus, we have four equations from this product: 
a) $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$,
b) $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$,
c) $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$,
d) $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$.

2. Solve these four equations:
    a) For equation a), $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ implies $x + y = 10$ or $x + y = -10$.
    b) For equation b), $\vert x - y \vert = 10$ implies $x - y = 10$ or $x - y = -10$.
    c) For equation c), $\vert x \vert = 8$ implies $x = 8$ or $x = -8$.
    d) For equation d), $\vert y \vert = 8$ implies $y = 8$ or $y = -8$.

3. Plot these 8 points $(8, 8)$, $(8, -8)$, $(-8, 8)$, $(-8, -8)$, $(10, 0)$, $(0, 10)$, $(0, -10)$, $(-10, 0)$ in a coordinate plane.

4. Connect them by line segments.

5. Calculate the area of the resulting convex polygon.

Now, let's do the calculations:

The eight points form a square with side length 16. The area of this square is $16^2 = 256$. Thus, the area of the convex polygon is 256. 

The value of the area is an integer, so we don't need to simplify or convert it into a different format.

So the area of the convex polygon is 256 square units. The answer is: $256$

Below is a math problem you are to solve (positive numerical answer!):
"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"
Analyze this problem and think step by step to come to a solution with programs. After solving the problem, output the final numerical answer within \boxed{}.

Assistant:

 The given equation is a product of two terms equal to zero, so either $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$, $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$, $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$, or $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$.

For each of these equations, if the equation is equal to zero, then the absolute value inside is equal to the number outside the absolute value. 

This means that the points must satisfy one of the following conditions:
1. $|x + y| = 10$,
2. $|x - y| = 10$,
3. $|x| = 8$, or
4. $|y| = 8$.

From conditions 3 and 4, we get that $x = \pm8$ or $y = \pm8$.

From condition 1, we get $x + y = \pm10$ or $x + y = \mp10$, which can be rearranged to $y = \pm10 - x$ or $y = \mp10 - x$.

From condition 2, we get $x - y = \pm10$ or $x - y = \mp10$, which can be rearranged to $y = x \pm10$ or $y = x \mp10$.

These equations define a square with side length 16 (from $|x| = 8$ or $|y| = 8$). The vertices of the square are $(\pm8, \pm8)$.

Therefore, the area of the convex polygon is the area of the square, which is $16^2 = 256$.

So the area of the convex polygon is 256. The answer is: $256$.
