Below is a math problem you are to solve (positive numerical answer):
"For how many positive integers $m$ does the equation \[\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}\] have $4$ distinct solutions?"
To accomplish this, first determine a sympy-based approach for solving the problem by listing each step to take and what functions need to be called in each step. Be clear so even an idiot can follow your instructions, and remember, your final answer should be positive integer, not an algebraic expression!
Write the entire script covering all the steps (use comments and document it well) and print the result. After solving the problem, output the final numerical answer within \boxed{}.

Interesting, let's analyze step by step:


First, we need to solve the equation $| |x - 1| - 2| = \frac{m}{100}$. The number of distinct solutions is 4.
Let's think about the function $| |x - 1| - 2|$. It's a piecewise function that equals to $2 - x + 1 = 3 - x$ if $x > 3$, $2 - (1 - x) = x - 1$ if $1 < x < 3$, $2 - (x - 1) = 3 - x$ if $x < 1$. Thus, the function represents the distance between $x$ and 1, and is translated and shifted 2 units up. It's a V-shaped graph.

Now, we want $| |x - 1| - 2| = \frac{m}{100}$ to have 4 distinct solutions, which means that the line $y = \frac{m}{100}$ should cross the graph in 4 distinct places.

Since the graph of $| |x - 1| - 2|$ is V-shaped, it means $\frac{m}{100}$ should be in the interval $(0, 2)$. This means $0 < \frac{m}{100} < 2$, and we get $0 < m < 200$.

Also, since each solution to the equation contributes to one intersection point, the slope of the line $y = \frac{m}{100}$ (which is $\frac{1}{100}$) should be equal to the slope of the V-shape at each of the four intersection points. The slope of the V-shape is 1 to the right, -1 to the left. Thus, we should set $\frac{1}{100} = 1$ (which simplifies to $m = 100$), $\frac{1}{100} = -1$ (which simplifies to $m = -100$), and also find the number of positive integers $m$ in the interval $(0, 200)$. The positive integers are $1, 2, ..., 199$, for a total of 199 integers.

So there are 199 positive integers $m$ for which the equation $| |x - 1| - 2| = \frac{m}{100}$ has 4 distinct solutions. The answer is: $199$. However, we have an assumption that $m$ is positive integer, thus $0 < m < 200$ should be interpreted as $1 \leq m \leq 199$, and we should find the number of positive integers from the set $\{1, 2, ..., 199\}$, which is 199.

Now, let's calculate the number of positive integers $m$ in this range:

```python


INTERMEDIATE OUT :

def count_positive_integers():
    return len(range(1, 200))

result = count_positive_integers()
print(result)
```

199

CODE RESULTS 199

INTERMEDIATE OUT :
```output
199
```
The number of positive integers $m$ for which the equation $| |x - 1| - 2| = \frac{m}{100}$ has 4 distinct solutions is 199. Thus, the value of unknown variable $m$ is 199. The answer is: $199$.

 To find the number of positive integers $m$ for which the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has 4 distinct solutions, we can analyze the properties of the equation.

The expression $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert$ is a piecewise function that takes on the value of $(3-x)$ when $x \le 1$, $(x-3)$ when $1 < x \le 3$, and $(x-3)$ when $x > 3$. Thus, the equation is equivalent to solving the following three cases separately:

1. For $x \le 1$, the equation becomes $\vert 3-x - \frac{m}{100} \vert = 2$. Solving this equation gives us $3-x - \frac{m}{100} = 2$ or $3-x - \frac{m}{100} = -2$, which simplifies to $x = 1 - \frac{m}{100}$ or $x = 5 + \frac{m}{100}$. Since $x \le 1$, the first solution is valid if $1 - \frac{m}{100} \le 1$, i.e., $\frac{m}{100} \ge 0$, or $m \ge 0$. The second solution is not valid since it does not satisfy the condition $x \le 1$.
2. For $1 < x \le 3$, the equation becomes $\vert x-3 - \frac{m}{100} \vert = 2$. This gives us $x-3 - \frac{m}{100} = 2$ or $x-3 - \frac{m}{100} = -2$, which simplifies to $x = 5 + \frac{m}{100}$ or $x = 1 + \frac{m}{100}$. The second solution is valid if $1 + \frac{m}{100} \le 3$, i.e., $\frac{m}{100} \le 2$, or $m \le 200$. The first solution is not valid since it does not satisfy the condition $1 < x \le 3$.
3. For $x > 3$, the equation becomes $\vert x-1 - 2 - \frac{m}{100} \vert = \vert x-3 - \frac{m}{100} \vert = 2$. This is the same as case 2, so the solution is again $x = 5 + \frac{m}{100}$ or $x = 1 + \frac{m}{100}$. The solution $x = 1 + \frac{m}{100}$ is not valid since it does not satisfy the condition $x > 3$.

The only valid solutions are $x = 1 - \frac{m}{100}$ from case 1, and $x = 5 + \frac{m}{100}$ from case 2. For these solutions to be distinct, we require $1 - \frac{m}{100} \neq 5 + \frac{m}{100}$, which simplifies to $\frac{2m}{100} \neq 4$, or $m \neq 200$. Thus, we need to find the number of positive integers $m$ such that $0 \le m \le 200$ and $m \neq 200$. This is the set of positive integers from 1 to 199, inclusive, so there are 199 such integers.

Therefore, the number of positive integers $m$ for which the equation has 4 distinct solutions is 199.

In python, you can solve this problem as follows:
```python


INTERMEDIATE OUT :

def count_m():
    count = 0
    for m in range(1, 200):
        if m != 200:
            count += 1
    return count

result = count_m()
print(result)
```

199

CODE RESULTS 199

INTERMEDIATE OUT :
```output
199
```
So, there are 199 positive integers $m$ for which the equation has 4 distinct solutions. The answer is: 199
