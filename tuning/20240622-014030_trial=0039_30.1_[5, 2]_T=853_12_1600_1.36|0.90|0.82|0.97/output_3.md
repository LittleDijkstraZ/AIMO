Below is a math problem you are to solve (positive numerical answer):
"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"
To accomplish this, first determine a sympy-based approach for solving the problem by listing each step to take and what functions need to be called in each step. Be clear so even an idiot can follow your instructions, and remember, your final answer should be positive integer, not an algebraic expression!
Write the entire script covering all the steps (use comments and document it well) and print the result. After solving the problem, output the final numerical answer within \boxed{}.

Assistant: 

Interesting, let's analyze step by step:


The expression inside the brackets, i.e., $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$, could be true only when at least one of the following is true:
1. $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$.
2. $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$.
From this we get our 4 lines(segments) of our polygon:
1. For case 1, we get $|x+y| = 10$ and $|x-y| = 10$. That leads us to $x+y = \pm10$ and $x-y = \pm10$, or, $x+y = 10$, $x-y = 10$, $x+y = 10$, $x-y = -10$, $x+y = -10$, $x-y = 10$ and $x+y = -10$, $x-y = -10$. Solving these we get 4 lines: $y=-x+10$, $y=x+10$, $y=x-10$, and $y=-x-10$.
2. For case 2, we get $|x| = 8$ and $|y| = 8$. That leads us to $x = \pm8$ and $y = \pm8$, or $x = 8$, $y = 8$, $x = 8$, $y = -8$, $x = -8$, $y = 8$, and $x = -8$, $y = -8$. We get 4 lines: $y=x$, $y=-x$, $y=8$, and $y=-8$.
These lines make a square of side length 10 units. The area of the square formed will be the answer. But first, we need to know the length of the side of the square. 

The side of the square is the distance between the points $(-8,8)$ and $(8,-8)$, which is $\sqrt{(8-(-8))^2 + ((-8)-8)^2} = \sqrt{(16)^2 + (-16)^2} = \sqrt{256 + 256} = \sqrt{512} = 16\sqrt{2}$.

Now we know that the area of the square is side times side, or $(16\sqrt{2})^2 = 256*2 = 512$ square units. But it's not possible because it isn't given in the problem. The statement should be corrected because $(-8,8)$ and $(8,-8)$ lie on the lines $y=x$ and $y=-x$ respectively and hence, we have to consider these lines only for determining the polygon to get a correct value of the area. So, the polygon is a square where opposite vertices are at $(8,8)$, $(-8,8)$, $(-8,-8)$, and $(8,-8)$. The length of its side is the distance between any pair of adjacent points, say $(8,8)$ and $(-8,8)$, which is $\sqrt{(8-(-8))^2} = \sqrt{16^2} = 16$. So, the area of the polygon, which is a square now, is 16*16 = 256 square units.

So, our goal was finding the area of the convex polygon formed by the intersection of the given conditions. The final answer after calculating is: $256$.
```python


INTERMEDIATE OUT :

from sympy import *

def polygon_area():
    # The side length of the square
    side_length = sqrt((8 - (-8))**2 + ((-8) - 8)**2)

    # The area of the square
    area = side_length**2

    return area

result = polygon_area()
print(result)

Assistant:

 This problem is asking for the area of a polygon that satisfies a given condition. However, the provided condition leads to a polygon with infinite sides. The polygon formed by the intersection of the infinite number of equations represented by the condition is actually a square.
The coordinates that satisfy the condition are $(8, 8)$, $(-8, 8)$, $(-8, -8)$, and $(8, -8)$. These are the vertices of the square.
The side length of the square is 16 units (each side is of length $8 - (-8) = 16$). To find the area of the square, we simply square the side length: $16^2 = 256$.
So the area of the convex polygon is 256 square units. The answer is: $256$

Below is a math problem you are to solve (positive numerical answer!):
"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"
Analyze this problem and think step by step to come to a solution with programs. After solving the problem, output the final numerical answer within \boxed{}.

Assistant:

 The given equation is a product of two terms equal to zero, so one of the terms must be zero for the product to be zero. That is, either $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$. 

The first term can only be zero if $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$, which implies that $x = 0$ and $y = 0$. The second term can only be zero if $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$, which implies that $-8 \leq x \leq 8$ and $-8 \leq y \leq 8$. 

Therefore, the points that satisfy the equation lie on a square with side length 16 (from $-8$ to $8$ in both the x and y directions). To find the area of this square, we simply square the length of one side: $16^2 = 256$. So the area of the convex polygon is 256 square units.

    side_length = 16
    area = side_length ** 2
    return area

result = area_of_polygon()
