Below is a math problem you are to solve (positive numerical answer!):
"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"
Analyze this problem and think step by step to come to a solution with programs. After solving the problem, output the final numerical answer within \boxed{}.

Assistant:

 The equation $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ implies that either of the following two conditions must hold:

1. $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$, which means $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$.
2. $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$, which means $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$.

From condition 1, we know that $x + y = \pm 10$ and $x - y = \pm 10$. Adding these two equations gives $2x = \pm 20$, so $x = \pm 10$. Subtracting the second from the first gives $2y = \pm 20$, so $y = \pm 10$. Thus, the points satisfying condition 1 are: $(10, 0)$, $(0, 10)$, $(-10, 0)$, and $(0, -10)$.

From condition 2, we know that $x = \pm 8$ and $y = \pm 8$. Thus, the points satisfying condition 2 are: $(8, 0)$, $(0, 8)$, $(-8, 0)$, and $(0, -8)$.

The convex polygon formed by these points is a square with side length 20. The area of this square is $20^2 = 400$.

So, the area of the convex polygon is 400. The answer is $\boxed{400}$.

Assistant:

 The given equation is equal to zero if and only if both terms inside the product are equal to zero.
Therefore, we have four cases:
1) $(\vert x + y \vert - 10) = 0$ and $(\vert x \vert - 8) = 0$.
2) $(\vert x + y \vert - 10) = 0$ and $(\vert y \vert - 8) = 0$.
3) $(\vert x - y \vert - 10) = 0$ and $(\vert x \vert - 8) = 0$.
4) $(\vert x - y \vert - 10) = 0$ and $(\vert y \vert - 8) = 0$.

The solutions for each case are:
1) $\vert x + y \vert = 10$, $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$. Solving this system, we get four lines: $x+y=10$, $x+y=-10$, $x-y=10$, $x-y=-10$.
2) $\vert x + y \vert = 10$, $\vert y \vert = 8$ and $\vert x \vert = 8$. This leads to the same four lines as in case 1.
3) $\vert x - y \vert = 10$, $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$. This gives four lines: $x-y=10$, $x-y=-10$, $x+y=10$, $x+y=-10$.
4) $\vert x - y \vert = 10$, $\vert y \vert = 8$ and $\vert x \vert = 8$. This also leads to the same four lines as in cases 1 and 3.

These four lines enclose a square with side length $16$, so the area of this square is $16^2 = 256$. Therefore, the area of the convex polygon is $256$. The answer is: $256$

 The equation $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + (\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ implies that $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. The solutions to these equations are all points on the lines $x + y = \pm 10$ and $x - y = \pm 10$. Similarly, the equation $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + (\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ implies that $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$, so the solutions are all points on the lines $x = \pm 8$ and $y = \pm 8$.

The solutions to both equations are the vertices of a square with side length 16. The area of this square is $16^2 = 256$.
So, the area of the convex polygon enclosed by the points is 256. Therefore, the numerical answer is $256$. The answer is: $256$

To accomplish this, first determine a sympy-based approach for solving the problem by listing each step to take and what functions need to be called in each step. Be clear so even an idiot can follow your instructions, and remember, your final answer should be positive integer, not an algebraic expression!
Write the entire script covering all the steps (use comments and document it well) and print the result. After solving the problem, output the final numerical answer within \boxed{}.

Assistant: 

Interesting, let's analyze step by step:



1. We are asked to find the area of a geometric shape defined by the points that satisfy the given condition. First, we need to understand the condition itself.

2. The condition is $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$. The product of two terms equals zero if and only if at least one of the terms is zero. 

3. Hence, the given condition is equivalent to either $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$.

4. The equation $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ implies that $|x + y| = 10$ and $|x - y| = 10$. This defines a square with side length 10.

5. The equation $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ implies that $|x| = 8$ and $|y| = 8$. This defines a square with side length 16.

6. So the given condition defines the union of two squares: a smaller one with side length 10 and a larger one with side length 16.

7. To find the area of this convex polygon, we calculate the area of each square and add them together.

8. The area of a square with side length $s$ is $s^2$. Hence, the area of the smaller square is $10^2 = 100$ and the area of the larger square is $16^2 = 256$.

9. Therefore, the area of the convex polygon is $100 + 256 = 356$.

The script to calculate the area follows directly from the above steps.

```python


INTERMEDIATE OUT :

def area_of_polygon():
    # Calculate the area of the smaller square
    smaller_square_area = 10**2

    # Calculate the area of the larger square
    larger_square_area = 16**2

    # Calculate the total area
    total_area = smaller_square_area + larger_square_area

    return total_area

result = area_of_polygon()
print(result)
```

356

CODE RESULTS 356

INTERMEDIATE OUT :
```output
356
```
So, the area of the convex polygon is $\boxed{356}$. However, since it doesn't seem to be reasonable, let's reconsider the problem. I guess we might have mistaken the condition. The condition given is actually a combination of two L1 (Manhattan) distances (||x + y|| - 10)^2 + (||x - y|| - 10)^2 equals to zero which means x + y = 10 or x - y = 10 (which describes a square of side length 10 with diagonal of the form x = y + 10), and ||x|| - 8)^2 + (||y|| - 8)^2 equals to zero which means x = 8 or y = 8 (which describes a square of side length 16).
The correct area is indeed the sum of the areas of these two squares which gives $10^2 + 16^2 = 100 + 256 = 356$.
In summary, the area of the convex polygon defined by the given points is 356. 

The numerical area of the convex polygon is 356.
The answer is: $356$

Interesting, let's analyze step by step:


First of all, any (x, y) that is the solution for the first multiplier to be zero ( $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ ) must be such that $\vert x + y \vert = 10 \land \vert x - y \vert = 10$. For this to happen $x+y=\pm10 \land x-y=\pm10$, and resolving the system we get that $x=y=\pm5$. So, the line of "possible" solutions are the four vertices of a square with side length of 10, being its center at the origin and having the vertices at (5, 5), (5, -5), (-5, 5) and (-5, -5).
The same reasoning works for the second part of the product $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$, with $(\vert x \vert = 8 \land \vert y \vert = 8)$. Thus $x=\pm8 \land y=\pm8$, and this results in another square which has its center in the origin and vertices at (8, 0), (-8, 0), (0, 8) and (0, -8). The intersection of those two squares is our convex polygon, hence, a square with side length of 10. 

Area of a square = side ^ 2. The area of this square is $10^2 = 100$. As the task asked for the positive numerical answer, the final solution is $\boxed{100}$.
```python


INTERMEDIATE OUT :

from sympy import symbols, solve

def calculate_area():
    # The side length of the square
    side_length = 10

    # Calculate the area
    area = side_length**2

    return area

result = calculate_area()
print(result)
```

100

CODE RESULTS 100

INTERMEDIATE OUT :
```output

The area of the convex polygon is $100$.

Assistant:

 The equation $AB = 0$ is satisfied if and only if $A = 0$ or $B = 0$. So in this problem, the condition is either $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$.
For the first equation to be zero, it means $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. These conditions represent a square with side length $10\sqrt{2}$, centered at the origin, with vertices at $(\pm 10, 0)$, $(0, \pm 10)$.
For the second equation to be zero, it means $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$. This represents a square with side length $16$, centered at the origin, with vertices at $(\pm 8, 0)$, $(0, \pm 8)$.

To find the area of the convex polygon formed by the intersection of these squares, we find the intersection of the two squares. From the side lengths, it is clear that the squares intersect in another square with side length $10$, centered at the origin, with vertices at $(\pm 5, 0)$, $(0, \pm 5)$. So the area of this convex polygon is the area of this smaller square, $10^2 = 100$.
The answer is: $\boxed{100}$

Interesting, let's analyze step by step:



- The equation $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + (\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + (\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ is in the form of product of two separate equations being equals to zero. Therefore either of these two equations must be zero.
- Both $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2$ and $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2$ being zero result in $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$.
- Similarly, both $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2$ and $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2$ being zero result in $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$.
- In order to satisfy all conditions above, $x$ and $y$ must be within the range of $[-8, 8]$. This represents a square with side length of 16 units.

With this analysis, it's obvious that the required shape is a square with side length 16 units. To calculate the area, square the length of one side.

The numerical answer is $\boxed{256}$. Therefore the area of the convex polygon is 256 square units.

Here's the python code for the calculation of the area:

```python


INTERMEDIATE OUT :

def square_area():
    side_length = 16
    area = side_length ** 2
    return area

result = square_area()
print(result)
```

256

CODE RESULTS 256

INTERMEDIATE OUT :
```output

```
The area of the convex polygon is $\boxed{256}$ square units.The final numerical answer is : $\boxed{256}$.
