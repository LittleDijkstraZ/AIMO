Below is a math problem you are to solve (positive numerical answer):
"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"
To accomplish this, first determine a sympy-based approach for solving the problem by listing each step to take and what functions need to be called in each step. Be clear so even an idiot can follow your instructions, and remember, your final answer should be positive integer, not an algebraic expression!
Write the entire script covering all the steps (use comments and document it well) and print the result. After solving the problem, output the final numerical answer within \boxed{}.

Assistant: 

Interesting, let's analyze step by step:



1. The expression $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2$ will be zero only if $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. This implies that $x + y = \pm 10$ and $x - y = \pm 10$. Solving these equations gives $x = \pm 10$ and $y = 0$ or $x = 0$ and $y = \pm 10$. These four points are the vertices of a square with side length 10.

2. The expression $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ will be zero only if $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$. This implies that $x = \pm 8$ and $y = \pm 8$. These four points are the vertices of a square with side length 16.

3. The intersection of the two regions defined by these equations is the square with side length 10.

4. The area of this square is $10^2 = 100$.

So the area of the convex polygon is 100.

Here is the python code to solve the problem:

```python


INTERMEDIATE OUT :

def calculate_area():
    # The side length of the square is 10
    side_length = 10

    # Calculate the area of the square
    area = side_length**2

    return area

result = calculate_area()
print(result)
```

100

CODE RESULTS 100

INTERMEDIATE OUT :
```output
100
```
The area of the convex polygon is $100$. The answer is: $100$

Interesting, let's analyze step by step:



1. The expression is equal to zero if either of the two factors is zero.
2. For the first factor, $|x+y| - 10 = 0$ and $|x-y| - 10 = 0$. This gives us $|x+y| = 10$ and $|x-y| = 10$.
3. For the second factor, $|x| - 8 = 0$ and $|y| - 8 = 0$. This gives us $|x| = 8$ and $|y| = 8$.
4. The solutions to $|x+y| = 10$ are the lines $y = -x + 10$ and $y = -x - 10$.
5. The solutions to $|x-y| = 10$ are the lines $y = x + 10$ and $y = x - 10$.
6. The solutions to $|x| = 8$ are the lines $x = 8$ and $x = -8$.
7. The solutions to $|y| = 8$ are the lines $y = 8$ and $y = -8$.
8. These lines form a square with side length 16.
9. The area of the square is $16^2 = 256$.

So the area of the convex polygon is 256.

Here is the Python code to calculate the area:

```python


INTERMEDIATE OUT :

def polygon_area():
    side_length = 16
    area = side_length ** 2
    return area

result = polygon_area()
print(result)
```

256

The area of the convex polygon is $256$. The answer is: $256$

Below is a math problem you are to solve (positive numerical answer!):
"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"
Analyze this problem and think step by step to come to a solution with programs. After solving the problem, output the final numerical answer within \boxed{}.

The given equation is a product of two terms equal to zero, which means that either the first term is zero or the second term is zero.

The first term is $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)$ and it equals to zero if and only if $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. This gives us a square with side length 20.

The second term is $((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2)$ and it equals to zero if and only if $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$. This gives us a square with side length 16.

The intersection of these two squares is the convex polygon we are looking for. This intersection is a square with side length 8 (since the side length of the smaller square is the difference of the side lengths of the larger and smaller squares).

The area of a square with side length $s$ is $s^2$. So the area of the convex polygon is $8^2 = 64$.

So the area of the convex polygon is 64. The answer is: $64$

 The given equation is a product of two expressions equal to zero, so either the first expression is zero or the second expression is zero. This means that the points that satisfy the equation are the union of the points that satisfy each expression separately.

The expression $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ implies $\vert x + y \vert = 10$, which means $x + y = 10$ or $x + y = -10$.
The expression $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ implies $\vert x - y \vert = 10$, which means $x - y = 10$ or $x - y = -10$.
The expression $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ implies $\vert x \vert = 8$, which means $x = 8$ or $x = -8$.
The expression $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ implies $\vert y \vert = 8$, which means $y = 8$ or $y = -8$.

The solutions to these equations are the vertices of a square with side length 10. The area of this square is $10^2 = 100$.

So the area of the convex polygon is 100.

```python


INTERMEDIATE OUT :

def area_of_polygon():
    """The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"""
    side_length = 10
    area = side_length ** 2
    return area

result = area_of_polygon()
