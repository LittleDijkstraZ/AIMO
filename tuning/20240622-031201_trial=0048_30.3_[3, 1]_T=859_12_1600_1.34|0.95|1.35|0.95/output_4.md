Below is a math problem you are to solve (positive numerical answer):
"A function $f: \mathbb N \to \mathbb N$ satisfies the following two conditions for all positive integers $n$:$f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$ and $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$. Calculate $f(100)$."
To accomplish this, first determine a sympy-based approach for solving the problem by listing each step to take and what functions need to be called in each step. Be clear so even an idiot can follow your instructions, and remember, your final answer should be positive integer, not an algebraic expression!
Write the entire script covering all the steps (use comments and document it well) and print the result. After solving the problem, output the final numerical answer within \boxed{}.

Interesting, let's analyze step by step:



- First, if we plug in n=1 in the second equation, we get $f(2)=2f(1)+1$.
- We can't go further until we have the value of $f(1)$, but the question never gives us any indication of how to find it. So, let's go for another step.
- If we plug n=2 into the second equation, we get $f(4)=2f(2)+1$.
- Again, without the value of $f(2)$, we can't go further. So, let's use the first equation with n=1 to try to find something.
- From the first equation, we have $f(f(f(1)))=8*1-7$, which simplifies to $f(f(f(1)))=1$. 
- Since the function $f$ returns a natural number for any natural number input, we can say that $f(f(f(1)))=1$ implies that $f(1)=1$. Because the only natural number that the function would map to 1 is 1 itself.
- Now that we know $f(1)$, we can use the second equation to find $f(2)$: $f(2)=2f(1)+1=2*1+1=3$.
- Now we know $f(1)$ and $f(2)$, we can use the second equation to find $f(4)$: $f(4)=2f(2)+1=2*3+1=7$.
- Now, we can use the first equation with n=2 to find $f(f(f(2)))$:
    $f(f(f(2)))=8*2-7=9$. Since we know $f(2)=3$, we can find $f(3)$: $f(3)=9/3=3$ because $f(f(3))=9$. But if we plug this into the second equation, we get $f(6)=2*3+1=7$. And if we plug n=6 into the first equation, we get: $f(f(f(6)))=8*6-7=43$, but $f(f(f(6)))=f(7)$ and we know $f(3)=3$, so $f(7)=43/3$, but the function should return a natural number, contradiction.
    Therefore, our assumption of $f(3)=3$ must have been incorrect. Let's try $f(3)=9/3=3$. We have now the values of $f(2)$, $f(3)$, and $f(4)$, and we can use these to work out $f(5)$, $f(6)$, $f(7)$, etc. until we find $f(100)$.
    The tricky part in this problem is dealing with the third iterate of function $f$.
    However, based on the properties we found, we can conclude that:
- $f(5)=2f(4)+1=15$
- $f(6)=2f(3)+1=7$
- $f(7)=2f(5)+1=31$
- and so on. 

Using a loop or recursion, we can continue to find the values of $f(n)$ until we find $f(100)$. Here's the Python code to do that:

```python


INTERMEDIATE OUT :

def f(n):
    if n == 1:
        return 1
    elif n == 2:
        return 3
    elif n == 3:
        return 9/3
    elif n == 4:
        return 7
    else:
        if n % 2 == 0:
            return 2 * f(n//2) + 1
        else:
            return 2 * f(int(n/2)+1) - 1

result = f(100)
print(result)
```

199

After running the code, we find that $f(100) = 199$. Thus the final numerical answer is $199$.
The answer is $\boxed{199}$.

 To solve this problem, we can first use the second given equation to calculate $f(100)$, because we know the value of $f(2n)$ in terms of $f(n)$.
First, let's substitute $n = 50$ into the equation $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$. We get:
$$f(100) = 2f(50) + 1.$$
Now we need to find the value of $f(50)$. To do this, we can substitute $n = 25$ into the equation $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$. We get:
$$f(50) = 2f(25) + 1.$$
To find the value of $f(25)$, we can substitute $n = 12.5$ (which is not an integer, so we need to use the first given equation), we get:
$$f(f(f(12.5))) = 8(12.5) - 7 = 97,$$
but $f(f(f(12.5)))$ is equal to $f(f(25))$ which is equal to $f(50)$, so we have $f(50) = 97$.
Now we can substitute $f(50) = 97$ into the equation $f(100) = 2f(50) + 1$, we get:
$$f(100) = 2(97) + 1 = 195.$$
Therefore, the value of $f(100)$ is 195.
The answer is: $195$

Interesting, let's analyze step by step:



First, we define the function $f(n)$ as a symbols function (sympy calls them 'sL' functions which represent Python functions). We also define 'n' as our variable.
Next, we set up the two equations using the same variable 'n': 1) $f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$ and 2) $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$.
Then, we use the first equation to deduce that $f(0) = 1$, $f(1) = 0$, $f(2) = 3$, $f(3) = 1$, $f(4) = 5$, $f(5) = 3$, $f(6) = 7$, $f(7) = 5$ etc.
Next, by using the pattern in the above numbers, we observe that $f(n)=2n-1$ for all $n$. It can be easily verified that this function indeed satisfies both equations we set up initially. Therefore, we can now find $f(100)$ by just plugging $100$ into our function definition $f(n)=2n-1$.

Let's do this in python:

```python


INTERMEDIATE OUT :

def f(n):
    return 2*n - 1

f_100 = f(100)
print(f_100)
```
