Below is a math problem you are to solve (positive numerical answer!):
"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"
Analyze this problem and think step by step to come to a solution with programs. After solving the problem, output the final numerical answer within \boxed{}.

Assistant:

 The given equation is satisfied if and only if at least one of the factors is zero.
The factors are:
$$((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)$$
and
$$((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2)$$

The first factor is zero if and only if $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. These are the conditions for a square with side length 10 and vertices at $(0, 10), (10, 0), (0, -10), (-10, 0)$.

The second factor is zero if and only if $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$. These are the conditions for a square with side length 16 and vertices at $(8, 8), (8, -8), (-8, 8), (-8, -8)$.

The intersection of the two squares is a square with side length 8 and vertices at $(0, 8), (8, 0), (0, -8), (-8, 0)$.

The area of this square is $8 \times 8 = 64$.

Therefore, the area of the convex polygon is 64 square units.

The answer is: $64$

 The given equation is $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + (\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ and $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + (\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$.

The only way for a sum of squares to be zero is if each square is zero. So we have:

$\vert x + y \vert - 10 = 0 \implies \vert x + y \vert = 10 \implies x + y = \pm 10$,

$\vert x - y \vert - 10 = 0 \implies \vert x - y \vert = 10 \implies x - y = \pm 10$,

$\vert x \vert - 8 = 0 \implies \vert x \vert = 8 \implies x = \pm 8$,

$\vert y \vert - 8 = 0 \implies \vert y \vert = 8 \implies y = \pm 8$.

The solutions of the first two equations give us the lines $y = x \pm 10$ and $y = -x \pm 10$, and the solutions of the last two equations give us the lines $x = 8$ and $x = -8$.

The intersection points of these lines are: $(8, 2)$, $(8, -2)$, $(-8, 2)$, and $(-8, -2)$. These points form a square with side length 16. The area of this square is $16^2 = 256$. Therefore, the area of the convex polygon is $256$. The answer is: $256$

To accomplish this, first determine a sympy-based approach for solving the problem by listing each step to take and what functions need to be called in each step. Be clear so even an idiot can follow your instructions, and remember, your final answer should be positive integer, not an algebraic expression!

Interesting, let's analyze step by step:



The expression $ ((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0 $

holds if either of the two following conditions is satisfied:

1. $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2) = 0$
2. $((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$

For the first condition to be satisfied, both $\vert x + y \vert - 10 = 0$ and $\vert x - y \vert - 10 = 0$, which simplifies to $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. These are the equations of two lines passing through the origin making an angle of 45 degrees with the x and y axes respectively.

For the second condition to be satisfied, both $\vert x \vert - 8 = 0$ and $\vert y \vert - 8 = 0$, which simplifies to $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$. These are two lines parallel to the x and y axes at a distance of 8 units from the origin.

The intersection of these lines forms a square with side length 16 units. The area of this square is $16^2 = 256$.
The answer is: $256$

Interesting, let's analyze step by step:



First, let's take a look at the equation we have:

$$((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$$

For the product of two factors to be zero, either one or both must be zero. This gives us two cases:

Case 1: $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$. 
This implies that $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ or $\vert x - y \vert = 10$.

Case 2: $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$.
This implies that $\vert x \vert = 8$ or $\vert y \vert = 8$.

Now, let's analyze each case:

For case 1, $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$ represent two squares each with side length 10. These two squares form a square of side length 10. The area of this square is $10^2 = 100$.

For case 2, $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$ represent two squares each with side length 8. These two squares form a square of side length 8. The area of this square is $8^2 = 64$.

The convex polygon is the intersection of the squares from case 1 and case 2. This intersection is a square of side length 8 (since it's the smaller square). Thus, the area of the convex polygon is $8^2 = 64$.

The answer is: $64$

 The given equation is $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$.
In order for the product of two numbers to be zero, one of the numbers must be zero. Therefore, either $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$.
The first equation implies that $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$, which are the equations of two lines passing through the origin with slope $1$ and $-1$.
The second equation implies that $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$, which are the equations of two lines passing through the origin with slope $0$.
The intersection of these lines forms a square with side length $16$. So the area of the square is $16^2 = 256$. 
Therefore, the area of the convex polygon is $256$.
The answer is: $256$

Interesting, let's analyze step by step:



The problem involves absolute values and a condition where a product equals zero. This suggests that we can break down the problem into two cases: 

Case 1: $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$
Case 2: $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$

For Case 1, if the sum of squares of absolute values equals zero, it implies that each absolute value equals zero, which further implies $x+y = 10$ and $x-y = 10$ (because absolute values cannot be negative). Solving these equations gives $x=y=5$. Similarly, for Case 2, we get $x=\pm8$ and $y=\pm8$.

So the points that satisfy the original equation are $(8, 8), (8, -8), (-8, 8),$ and $(-8, -8)$. These four points form a square with side length 16, hence its area is $16^2 = 256$.

Therefore, the area of the convex polygon is $256$.

Here's the python code to confirm this:
```python


INTERMEDIATE OUT :

from sympy import symbols

def area_of_polygon():
    # Coordinates of the vertices of the square
    vertices = [(8, 8), (8, -8), (-8, 8), (-8, -8)]

    # Calculate the distance between two points
    def distance(p1, p2):
        return ((p1[0] - p2[0])**2 + (p1[1] - p2[1])**2)**0.5

    # Calculate the side length of the square
    side_length = distance(vertices[0], vertices[1])

    # Calculate the area of the square
    area = side_length**2

    return area

result = area_of_polygon()
print(result)
```

256.0

CODE RESULTS 256.0

INTERMEDIATE OUT :
```output
256.0
```
The area of the convex polygon is $\boxed{256}$.
The answer is: $256$.
