 The given equation is a product of two quadratic equations. The product is zero if and only if at least one of the factors is zero. Therefore, either $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$.

The first equation $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ implies $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. This means $x + y = \pm 10$ and $x - y = \pm 10$. Solving these four equations, we get the vertices of the polygon as $(0,10)$, $(0,-10)$, $(10,0)$, and $(-10,0)$.

The second equation $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ implies $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$. This means $x = \pm 8$ and $y = \pm 8$. Solving these four equations, we get the vertices of the polygon as $(8,8)$, $(8,-8)$, $(-8,8)$, and $(-8,-8)$.

To get all the vertices of the polygon, we combine these solutions and get: $(0,10)$, $(0,-10)$, $(10,0)$, $(-10,0)$, $(8,8)$, $(8,-8)$, $(-8,8)$, and $(-8,-8)$.

Now, we can plot these points on a coordinate plane and connect them to form a square with side length $10$. The area of this square is $10^2 = 100$. So, the area of the convex polygon is 100 square units.

Here's a Python code to compute the area of the convex polygon:

```python


INTERMEDIATE OUT :

def polygon_area():
    """The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"""
    side_length = 10  # As the polygon is a square with side length 10.
    area = side_length ** 2  # The area of the square
    return area

polygon_area = polygon_area()
print(polygon_area)
```

100

CODE RESULTS 100

INTERMEDIATE OUT :
```output

```
The area of the convex polygon is $100$ square units. The answer is: $100$

 To solve the problem, we first need to understand that the expression $ab = 0$ if and only if $a = 0$ or $b = 0$. So the points that satisfy the equation are where either $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$, $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$, $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$, or $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$. This gives us four lines: $x + y = \pm 10$, $x - y = \pm 10$, $x = \pm 8$, and $y = \pm 8$. These lines enclose a square with side length 16. To find the area of the square, we square its side length: $16^2 = 256$. So the area of the square is $256$.
The answer is: $256$

To accomplish this, first determine a sympy-based approach for solving the problem by listing each step to take and what functions need to be called in each step. Be clear so even an idiot can follow your instructions, and remember, your final answer should be positive integer, not an algebraic expression!
Write the entire script covering all the steps (use comments and document it well) and print the result. After solving the problem, output the final numerical answer within \boxed{}.

Interesting, let's analyze step by step:



It's given that $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$

In order for the product of two numbers to be zero, one of them has to be zero.

There are two cases to consider:

1. $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ or
2. $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$

For the first case, we have:

$(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$

This equation can only hold true when both $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2$ and $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2$ are equal to zero, which means $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$.

The second case would lead to $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$, hence $x = 8$ or $x = -8$ and $y = 8$ or $y = -8$.

The solutions to the first equation are all points $(x, y)$ where the sum of the absolute values of $x$ and $y$ equals 10, and the solutions to the second equation are all points $(x, y)$ where both $x$ and $y$ are in the range of -8 to 8.

These solutions form a square with side length of 16 units. The area of this square is therefore $16^2 = 256$.

So the area of the convex polygon formed by the solutions is 256. The answer is: $256$.

Interesting, let's analyze step by step:



The problem tells us that the points $(x, y)$ satisfying the equation $f(x,y) = 0$ encloses a convex polygon. We are asked to find the area of this polygon.

This is a classic problem of utilizing geometrical interpretation of the absolute values in the equation to sketch the figure on the plane, and then compute the area. The equation $f(x,y) = 0$ is a product of two quadratic forms, hence it's equal to zero if either of them is zero. This means we have two groups of conditions on $x$ and $y$:

1. $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ and $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ and $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$

From the third group, we directly get $|y| = 8$, which means $y = 8$ or $y = -8$.

The first group gives $|x + y| = 10$, so for $y = 8$: $|x + 8| = 10$, hence $x = 2$ or $x = -18$. Similarly for $y = -8$: $|x - 8| = 10$, hence $x = 18$ or $x = -2$. So we have four points: $(2, 8)$, $(-18, 8)$, $(18, -8)$, $(-2, -8)$. These are vertices of the rectangle.

2. $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$

This gives $|x - y| = 10$. There are four combinations of $x$ and $y$ here, but we can easily see that all of them lie inside the rectangle we've already found.

So our convex polygon is a rectangle with side lengths $20$ and $16$. The area is $20 \times 16 = 320$. So the area of the polygon is $\boxed{320}$.

Here's the Python code to calculate the area:

```python


INTERMEDIATE OUT :

def polygon_area():
    # Rectangle side lengths
    length = 20
    width = 16

    # Calculate the area
    area = length * width
    return area

# Call the function and print the result
result = polygon_area()
print(result)
```

320

CODE RESULTS 320

INTERMEDIATE OUT :
```output
320
```
The area of the convex polygon is $320$.
The answer is: $320$

Assistant:

 The expression $A \cdot B = 0$ implies that at least one of the expressions $A$ or $B$ is zero. Hence, either $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + (\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$, or $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + (\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$. In the first case, we have $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$, which can be solved to obtain the lines $x + y = \pm 10$ and $x - y = \pm 10$. In the second case, we have $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$, which can be solved to obtain the lines $x = \pm 8$ and $y = \pm 8$. 

These lines form a square with side length $16$. Therefore, the area of the square is $16^2 = 256$. So the area of the convex polygon is $256$. The answer is: $256$

Assistant: 

Interesting, let's analyze step by step:


The equation equals zero if any of its factors equals zero, which means that we must have the following four conditions all together:

1) $|x+y|=10$ and $|x-y|=10$
2) $|x|=8$ and $|y|=8$

Let's examine each condition:

For the first condition:
Since $|x+y|=10$ and $|x-y|=10$, this implies that x and y are both $\pm8$. So we are looking at all points $(x,y)$ where $x,y \in \{\pm8, \pm10\}$. This forms a square with vertices at $(\pm8,\pm10)$ and side length of 16. So the area of this square is $16^2=256$.

Now for the second condition:
If $|x|=8$, this gives x equals to $8$ or $-8$, same for y equals to $8$ or $-8$. These points all form a bigger square with vertices at $(\pm8,\pm8)$ and side length of 16. So the area of this square is $16^2=256$.

Comparing the two, the first condition gives a square with a smaller area than the second one, which makes the first condition more likely. And indeed, if we plot the regions of the two conditions on the coordinate plane, they perfectly match, forming the same square. Hence the area of the polygon is the area of the square, which is 256 square units. 

Since the problem asks for a numerical answer, the area of the polygon is 256 square units.```python


INTERMEDIATE OUT :

from sympy import symbols, sqrt

def area_of_polygon():
    """
    This problem asks for the area of a polygon that is formed by the intersection of two conditions:
    |x+y| = 10 and |x-y| = 10. This is equivalent to the intersection of |x| = 8 and |y| = 8,
    which also forms a square with vertices at (+-8, +-8). The side length of this square is 16.
    """
    # The side length of the square is 16, so the area is 16^2 = 256
    side_length = 16
    area = side_length**2
    
    return area

result = area_of_polygon()
print(result)
```

256

CODE RESULTS 256

INTERMEDIATE OUT :
```output

```
The area of the polygon is $\boxed{256}$ square units. The answer is $\boxed{256}$.
