Below is a math problem you are to solve (positive numerical answer):
"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"
To accomplish this, first determine a sympy-based approach for solving the problem by listing each step to take and what functions need to be called in each step. Be clear so even an idiot can follow your instructions, and remember, your final answer should be positive integer, not an algebraic expression!

Interesting, let's analyze step by step:



The given equation is a product of two terms equals zero, so either the first term is zero or the second term is zero. This gives us two systems of equations to solve:

1. $|x + y| - 10 = 0$ and $|x - y| - 10 = 0$
2. $|x| - 8 = 0$ and $|y| - 8 = 0$

Let's solve the first system:

1. $|x + y| - 10 = 0 \Rightarrow |x + y| = 10 \Rightarrow x + y = \pm 10$
2. $|x - y| - 10 = 0 \Rightarrow |x - y| = 10 \Rightarrow x - y = \pm 10$

From these equations, we get four lines: $x + y = 10$, $x + y = -10$, $x - y = 10$, and $x - y = -10$. These lines form a rectangle with vertices at $(8, 8)$, $(8, -8)$, $(-8, 8)$, and $(-8, -8)$.

Now let's solve the second system:

1. $|x| - 8 = 0 \Rightarrow |x| = 8 \Rightarrow x = \pm 8$
2. $|y| - 8 = 0 \Rightarrow |y| = 8 \Rightarrow y = \pm 8$

From these equations, we get four lines: $x = 8$, $x = -8$, $y = 8$, and $y = -8$. These lines form a square with vertices at $(8, 8)$, $(-8, 8)$, $(-8, -8)$, and $(8, -8)$.

The solution to the given equation is the intersection of the solutions to the two systems of equations. As we can see, the solutions to both systems of equations are the same, so the convex polygon is a square with side length 16. The area of this square is $16^2 = 256$.

So, the area of the convex polygon is 256.
The answer is: $256$

"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"

 The given equation is a product of two terms equal to zero, which means that either of the terms must be zero. Therefore, we have two systems of equations to solve:

1. $|x + y| - 10 = 0$ and $|x - y| - 10 = 0$.
2. $|x| - 8 = 0$ and $|y| - 8 = 0$.

Let's solve the first system of equations:

1. $|x + y| - 10 = 0$ implies $|x + y| = 10$, so $x + y = \pm 10$.
2. $|x - y| - 10 = 0$ implies $|x - y| = 10$, so $x - y = \pm 10$.

The solutions to this system of equations are the points on the lines $x + y = 10$, $x + y = -10$, $x - y = 10$, and $x - y = -10$. These lines form a square with side length 10.

Now, let's solve the second system of equations:

1. $|x| - 8 = 0$ implies $|x| = 8$, so $x = \pm 8$.
2. $|y| - 8 = 0$ implies $|y| = 8$, so $y = \pm 8$.

The solutions to this system of equations are the points on the lines $x = 8$, $x = -8$, $y = 8$, and $y = -8$. These lines also form a square with side length 16.

The area of the convex polygon formed by the union of these two squares is the sum of their areas. The area of a square is given by the square of its side length, so the area of the first square is $10^2 = 100$ and the area of the second square is $16^2 = 256$. Therefore, the total area of the convex polygon is $100 + 256 = 356$.

So, the area of the convex polygon is 356 square units. The answer is: $356$

Interesting, let's analyze step by step:



The equation given is a product of two terms equals zero, which implies that either of the terms must be zero. So, we have two sets of equations to solve:

1) $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ and $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ and $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ and $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$

2) $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ and $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ and $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ and $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$

For each equation in set 1, we have:
- $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0 \Rightarrow \vert x + y \vert = 10$
- $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0 \Rightarrow \vert x \vert = 8$
- $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0 \Rightarrow \vert x - y \vert = 10$
- $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0 \Rightarrow \vert y \vert = 8$

For each equation in set 2, we have:
- $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0 \Rightarrow \vert x + y \vert = 10$
- $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0 \Rightarrow \vert x \vert = 8$
- $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0 \Rightarrow \vert x - y \vert = 10$
- $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0 \Rightarrow \vert y \vert = 8$

The solutions to these equations are the vertices of a square with side length 16 (since $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$). To find the area of this square, we simply square the length of one of its sides: $16^2 = 256$. So, the area of the convex polygon is 256.

The answer is: $256$

Interesting, let's analyze step by step:



1. The expression $A = ((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2)$ is equal to zero if and only if at least one of the factors is zero.

2. The factor $((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2)$ is zero if and only if $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$, which means $x = 8$ or $x = -8$ and $y = 8$ or $y = -8$. This gives us a square with side length $16$.

3. The factor $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)$ is zero if and only if $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. This gives us two cases:
   - If $x + y = 10$ and $x - y = 10$, we get $x = 10$ and $y = 0$.
   - If $x + y = 10$ and $x - y = -10$, we get $x = 0$ and $y = 10$.
   - If $x + y = -10$ and $x - y = 10$, we get $x = -10$ and $y = 0$.
   - If $x + y = -10$ and $x - y = -10$, we get $x = 0$ and $y = -10$.
   These points also form a square with side length $10$.

4. The intersection of these two squares is another square with side length $10$, but only a part of the first square.

5. The area of the first square is $16^2 = 256$ square units, and the area of the second square is $10^2 = 100$ square units.

6. The area of the convex polygon enclosed by the points is the difference of the areas of the two squares, which is $256 - 100 = 156$ square units.

So, the area of the convex polygon is $156$ square units. The answer is: $156$

 The equation $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ implies that $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$.
The equation $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ implies that $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$.
The solutions to these equations are the points $(x, y)$ that lie on the squares with side length 20 centered at the origin, and the points $(x, y)$ that lie on the squares with side length 16 centered at the origin.
The intersection of these two squares is a square with side length 16, so the area of the convex polygon is $16^2 = 256$.
The answer is: $256$

Analyze this problem and think step by step to come to a solution with programs. After solving the problem, output the final numerical answer within \boxed{}.

Assistant:

 The equation given in the problem is a product of two terms equal to zero. This means that either the first term is zero, or the second term is zero, or both are zero.

The first term is $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)$, and it equals to zero if and only if $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. These two equations represent a square with side length 20.

The second term is $((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2)$, and it equals to zero if and only if $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$, which represents a square with side length 16.

Therefore, the solution set of the given equation is the union of these two squares. The area of the convex polygon is the sum of the areas of these two squares.

The area of a square with side length $a$ is $a^2$. So the area of the square with side length 20 is $20^2 = 400$, and the area of the square with side length 16 is $16^2 = 256$.

Adding these two areas together, we get the total area of the convex polygon: $400 + 256 = 656$.

So the area of the convex polygon is 656. The answer is: $656$

The given equation is a product of two terms equal to zero, which means that either one of the terms is zero or both are zero. This gives us four cases to consider:
1. $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ and $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ and $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$.
2. $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ and $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$.
3. $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ and $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$.
4. $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ and $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ and $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ and $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$.

For case 1, we have $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$. This gives us a square with side length 16.
For case 2, we have $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. This gives us a square with side length 20.
For case 3, we have $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$. This gives us a square with side length 16.
For case 4, all the conditions of cases 1, 2, and 3 are satisfied.

The area of the square formed by case 1 is $16^2 = 256$. The area of the square formed by case 2 is $20^2 = 400$. The area of the square formed by case 3 is also $16^2 = 256$.

Therefore, the area of the convex polygon formed by the intersection of these squares is the sum of their areas, which is $256 + 400 + 256 = 912$. However, this is not the final answer.

The area of the intersection of the two squares (case 2 and case 3) is a smaller square with side length 8 (since the intersection of the two squares with side lengths 20 and 16 is a square with side length 8). The area of this smaller square is $8^2 = 64$.

Subtracting the area of this smaller square from the sum of the areas of the larger squares gives the final area of the convex polygon: $912 - 64 = 848$.

Therefore, the area of the convex polygon is 848. The answer is: $848$

Each of these systems of equations can be simplified to:

1. $\vert x + y \vert = 10$, $\vert x \vert = 8$, $\vert x - y \vert = 10$, and $\vert y \vert = 8$.

2. $\vert x + y \vert = 10$, $\vert x \vert = 8$, $\vert x - y \vert = 10$, and $\vert y \vert = 8$.

Solving these systems, we get the following points:

1. $(8, 8)$, $(8, -8)$, $(-8, 8)$, and $(-8, -8)$.

2. $(8, 8)$, $(8, -8)$, $(-8, 8)$, and $(-8, -8)$.

These points are the vertices of a square with side length $16$. To find the area of this square, we simply square the length of one of its sides. The area of the square is $16^2 = 256$.

The answer is: $256$.
