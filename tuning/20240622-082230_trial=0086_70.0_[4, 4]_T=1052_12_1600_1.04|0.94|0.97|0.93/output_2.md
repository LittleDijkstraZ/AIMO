Interesting, let's analyze step by step:



1. We are given an absolute value equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ and asked to find the number of positive integers m such that the equation has 4 distinct solutions.

2. Since the absolute value function makes the given equation complicated to solve directly, we need to consider all possible cases for the number of solutions. The function $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert$ can take a value in the range $[0, 2]$.

3. For the equation to have 4 distinct solutions, $\frac{m}{100}$ must lie in the interval $(0, 2)$. Therefore, $0 < \frac{m}{100} < 2$, which simplifies to $0 < m < 200$.

4. Now, we need to count the number of positive integers $m$ in this range. The positive integers $m$ that satisfy $0 < m < 200$ are exactly the integers from 1 to 199.

5. To find the total number of these integers, we simply subtract the smallest possible value from the largest possible value and add 1. This gives us $199 - 1 + 1 = 199$.

So, there are 199 positive integers $m$ for which the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has 4 distinct solutions. The answer is: $199$

 To solve this problem, we need to understand the properties of the absolute value function and the number of solutions of the equation.

The equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has 4 distinct solutions if and only if the right side $\frac{m}{100}$ is in the interval $(0,2)$. This is because the absolute value function creates a "V" shape graph with vertex at $x=1$, and the double absolute value function creates two "V" shapes separated by a distance of 2. The equation has 4 distinct solutions if and only if the right side of the equation is strictly between the two "V" shapes.

Since $\frac{m}{100}$ is in the interval $(0,2)$, we have $0 < \frac{m}{100} < 2$. Multiplying all sides by 100, we get $0 < m < 200$. The positive integers $m$ that satisfy this inequality are $1, 2, ..., 199$.

However, we need to find the number of positive integers $m$ for which the equation has exactly 4 distinct solutions. It turns out that the value of $m$ that gives exactly 4 distinct solutions is 100. This is because $\frac{m}{100} = 1$ gives exactly 4 distinct solutions. All other values of $m$ in the interval $(0,200)$ result in either 2 or 6 distinct solutions. Therefore, there is only one value of $m$, namely 100, for which the equation has 4 distinct solutions.

So the number of positive integers $m$ for which the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has 4 distinct solutions is 1. The answer is: 1

Interesting, let's analyze step by step:



We know that the equation $| |x - 1| - 2| = \frac{m}{100}$ has 4 distinct solutions. The expression $|x - 1| - 2$ can be either negative, zero, or positive. So there are 3 cases to consider:

1. If $|x - 1| - 2$ is negative, i.e., $|x - 1| - 2 < 0$, then $|x - 1| < 2$, which implies $-2 < x - 1 < 2$, or $-1 < x < 3$.
2. If $|x - 1| - 2$ is zero, i.e., $|x - 1| - 2 = 0$, then $|x - 1| = 2$, which implies $x - 1 = \pm 2$, or $x = 3, -1$.
3. If $|x - 1| - 2$ is positive, i.e., $|x - 1| - 2 > 0$, then $|x - 1| > 2$, which implies $x - 1 < -2$ or $x - 1 > 2$, or $x < -1$ or $x > 3$.

So the solutions for $x$ are $-1 < x < 3$.

Now we know that the equation $| |x - 1| - 2| = \frac{m}{100}$ has 4 distinct solutions in the interval $(-1, 3)$. Therefore, we need to find the number of values of $\frac{m}{100}$ in the interval $(0, 2)$, such that the equation $|y - 2| = \frac{m}{100}$ has 2 distinct solutions in the interval $(0, 2)$.

This happens when $0 < \frac{m}{100} < 2$, or $0 < m < 200$. So the number of positive integer values of $m$ is $199$. But we should also consider the case where $y = 2$, which is the solution when $|x - 1| - 2 = 0$. This gives us the equation $|y| = \frac{m}{100}$, where $y = 0$ or $y = \frac{m}{100}$. 

The equation $|y| = \frac{m}{100}$ has 2 distinct solutions for $y$ if $\frac{m}{100} > 0$, or $m > 0$. So we need to consider the values of $m$ in the interval $(0, 200]$.

Therefore, there are 199 values of $m$ in the interval $(0, 200]$ for which the equation $| |x - 1| - 2| = \frac{m}{100}$ has 4 distinct solutions. Hence the number of positive integers $m$ for which the equation has 4 distinct solutions is 199.

However, we have overcounted the value $m = 200$, because when $m = 200$, the equation becomes $| |x - 1| - 2| = 2$, which has only 3 distinct solutions (not 4). So we need to subtract 1 from the total count.

So the number of positive integers $m$ for which the equation has 4 distinct solutions is $199 - 1 = 198$.

So the number of positive integers $m$ for which the equation has 4 distinct solutions is $198$.

The value of $m$ which we're looking for is 198.

So the answer is: 198

However, we have a mistake in our calculations. The number of positive integers $m$ for which the equation has 4 distinct solutions should be less than or equal to 200, not greater than or equal to 200. 

Let's re-examine the problem:

We know that the equation $| |x - 1| - 2| = \frac{m}{100}$ has 4 distinct solutions. The expression $|x - 1| - 2$ can be either negative, zero, or positive. So there are 3 cases to consider:

1. If $|x - 1| - 2$ is negative, i.e., $|x - 1| - 2 < 0$, then $|x - 1| < 2$, which implies $-2 < x - 1 < 2$, or $-1 < x < 3$.
2. If $|x - 1| - 2$ is zero, i.e., $|x - 1| - 2 = 0$, then $|x - 1| = 2$, which implies $x - 1 = \pm 2$, or $x = 3, -1$.
3. If $|x - 1| - 2$ is positive, i.e., $|x - 1| - 2 > 0$, then $|x - 1| > 2$, which implies $x - 1 < -2$ or $x - 1 > 2$, or $x < -1$ or $x > 3$.

So the solutions for $x$ are $-1 < x < 3$.

Now we know that the equation $| |x - 1| - 2| = \frac{m}{100}$ has 4 distinct solutions in the interval $(-1, 3)$. Therefore, we need to find the number of values of $\frac{m}{100}$ in the interval $(0, 2)$, such that the equation $|y - 2| = \frac{m}{100}$ has 2 distinct solutions in the interval $(0, 2)$.

This happens when $0 < \frac{m}{100} < 2$, or $0 < m < 200$. So the number of positive integer values of $m$ is $199$. But we should also consider the case where $y = 2$, which is the solution when $|x - 1| - 2 = 0$. This gives us the equation $|y| = \frac{m}{100}$, where $y = 0$ or $y = \frac{m}{100}$. 

The equation $|y| = \frac{m}{100}$ has 2 distinct solutions for $y$ if $\frac{m}{100} > 0$, or $m > 0$. So we need to consider the values of $m$ in the interval $(0, 200]$.

Therefore, there are 199 values of $m$ in the interval $(0, 200]$ for which the equation $| |x - 1| - 2| = \frac{m}{100}$ has 4 distinct solutions. Hence the number of positive integers $m$ for which the equation has 4 distinct solutions is 199.

However, we have missed a case: the value $m = 200$ itself. When $

Assistant: 

Interesting, let's analyze step by step:



1. We need to find the value of $m$ such that the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has four distinct solutions.

2. First, we consider the right hand side of the equation, $\frac{m}{100}$. Since the value inside the absolute value on the left hand side must be between 0 and 2 (i.e., $| \cdot | \le 2$), the right hand side $\frac{m}{100}$ should also be in this range, so $0 \le \frac{m}{100} \le 2$. This gives us $0 \le m \le 200$.

3. Next, we need to find the number of integer values of $m$ in this range for which the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has exactly four distinct solutions.

4. To do this, we can consider the graph of $y = \vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert$ and $y = \frac{m}{100}$. The graph of $y = \vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert$ is a V-shape with the vertices at $x = 1 \pm 2$, i.e., at $x = -1$, $x = 3$. The graph of $y = \frac{m}{100}$ is a horizontal line.

5. We want the line to intersect the V-shape at exactly four points. This happens when the line is between the first and second 'vertex' of the V-shape, i.e., when $0 < \frac{m}{100} < 2$. This gives us $0 < m < 200$.

6. The only integer value of $m$ in this range that satisfies the condition is $m = 100$.

So, the number of positive integers $m$ for which the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has four distinct solutions is 1. The answer is: $\boxed{1}$.

Interesting, let's analyze step by step:



1. We first observe that the given equation has 4 distinct solutions, and we need to find the number of possible integer values for m.

2. The equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ is equivalent to $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert = 0.01m$.

3. Let's denote $y = \vert x - 1 \vert - 2$. The equation becomes $\vert y \vert = 0.01m$. This equation has 4 solutions for $y$ given by $y = 0.01m$, $y = -0.01m$, $y = 1 - 0.01m$ and $y = 1 + 0.01m$.

4. For each of these equations, we can solve for $x$. For example, for $y = 0.01m$, we have $\vert x - 1 \vert - 2 = 0.01m$, which gives us $\vert x - 1 \vert = 2 + 0.01m$. This results in two solutions: $x = 1 + 2 + 0.01m$ and $x = 1 - (2 + 0.01m)$. 

5. Similarly, we can solve for $x$ for the other three equations. 

6. After solving all four equations, we find that the solutions are all distinct if and only if $0.01m < 2$. This is because if $0.01m \geq 2$, then some of the solutions will coincide.

7. So we need to find the number of positive integers $m$ such that $0.01m < 2$, which is equivalent to $m < 200$.

8. Therefore, the number of possible integer values for $m$ is the number of positive integers less than 200. 

```python

Assistant: 

Interesting, let's analyze step by step:


1. First, we need to understand the absolute value function and its properties.
2. Then, we need to understand how to solve the equation | |x-1| - 2| = m/100.
3. After that, we need to determine for how many positive integers m the equation has 4 distinct solutions.

Let's start with the first step:
The absolute value function, |x|, makes any negative number positive. So if |x-1| - 2 is negative, it will become positive. This means that we need to consider two cases:
- Case 1: |x-1| - 2 >= 0. In this case, |x-1| >= 2. This implies that x-1 >= 2 or x-1 <= -2, which simplifies to x >= 3 or x <= -1.
- Case 2: |x-1| - 2 < 0. In this case, |x-1| < 2. This implies that -2 < x-1 < 2, which simplifies to -1 < x < 3.

Now let's move on to the second step:
The equation | |x-1| - 2| = m/100 is a bit tricky. We need to consider the two cases as mentioned earlier and solve the equation for each case.

For Case 1 (x >= 3 or x <= -1), the equation becomes: |x-1 - 2| = m/100. Simplifying, we get |x - 3| = m/100. This equation has 2 solutions, one for x >= 3 and one for x <= -1.

For Case 2 (-1 < x < 3), the equation becomes: |1 - x - 2| = m/100. Simplifying, we get |-x - 1| = m/100, or |x + 1| = m/100. This equation also has 2 solutions, one for -1 < x < 0 and one for 0 < x < 3.

Now let's move on to the third step:
We want to find the number of positive integers m for which the equation has 4 distinct solutions. From the analysis above, we see that for each integer value of m, there are 4 solutions. So, we simply need to count the number of positive integers m for which the equation has a solution.

Since m can be any positive integer from 1 to 100 (inclusive), there are 100 possible values of m. For each of these values, the equation has 4 distinct solutions. Therefore, the number of positive integers m for which the equation has 4 distinct solutions is 100.

However, we are asked for the value of m. The problem does not specify a particular value of m. If we are asked for a numerical answer, then we need to consider the properties of absolute value functions and solve the equations accordingly. But in this case, we are asked for the number of positive integers m, not a specific value of m. So, the answer is 100.

So, the answer is $\boxed{100}$.

Interesting, let's analyze step by step:



First, let's simplify the equation a bit, $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$

We can see that the left side of the equation is always between 0 and 2, because of the property of absolute value. So, $\frac{m}{100}$ must also be between 0 and 2. 

This gives us $0 \leq \frac{m}{100} \leq 2$, and multiplying all sides by 100, we get $0 \leq m \leq 200$. 

So, $m$ is an integer between 0 and 200. 

Now, we want to find out how many values of $m$ will make the original equation have exactly 4 distinct solutions.

This is equivalent to finding how many values of $m$ will make the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ have exactly 4 solutions.

This equation will have 4 solutions if and only if $\frac{m}{100} = 1$. The reason is that the left side of the equation will be 1 at exactly 4 points (two for each of the two "islands" inside the absolute value brackets).

So, we want to find the value of $m$ that makes $\frac{m}{100} = 1$, which gives us $m = 100$.

Therefore, the only value of $m$ that makes the equation have 4 distinct solutions is 100. So the number of such values is 1.

The number of positive integers $m$ that satisfy the given conditions is 1. However, this doesn't feel right as it's asking for the number of values of $m$ that make the equation have exactly 4 solutions. Let's revisit the problem.

The equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ will have 4 solutions if and only if $\frac{m}{100} = 1$. 

However, this is not true. The equation will have 4 solutions if and only if the value inside the absolute value brackets, $\vert x-1 \vert -2$, is equal to $\pm 1$ at exactly 4 points. This happens when $m=100$.

So, the value of $m$ that satisfies the condition is $m=100$. There is only one such value, so the number of positive integers $m$ that satisfy the given conditions is 1.

The final answer is $\boxed{1}$.

Let's reconsider the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$. We know that this equation will have 4 solutions if and only if the value inside the absolute value brackets, $\vert x-1 \vert -2$, is equal to $\pm 1$ at exactly 4 points. This happens when $m=100$. 

But, if we set $m=200$, we'll find that the equation will also have 4 solutions, just with different values of $x$. So, there are actually two positive integers $m$ that make the equation have exactly 4 solutions: $m=100$ and $m=200$.

So the number of positive integers $m$ that satisfy the given conditions is 2. Let's print this result:

The number of positive integers $m$ that satisfy the given conditions is 2. However, this still doesn't feel right, as we are looking for the number of values of $m$ that make the equation have exactly 4 solutions. The values of $m=100$ and $m=200$ indeed make the equation have 4 solutions, but they are not the only such values.

Let's reconsider the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$. We know that this equation will have 4 solutions if and only if the value inside the absolute value brackets, $\vert x-1 \vert -2$, is equal to $\pm 1$ at exactly 4 points. This happens when $m=100$ or $m=200$.

But, if we set $m=300$, we'll find that the equation will also have 4 solutions, just with different values of $x$. So, there are actually three positive integers $m$ that make the equation have exactly 4 solutions: $m=100$, $m=200$, and $m=300$.

And we can continue this process to find that for every $m=100n$ where $n$ is a positive integer, the equation will have 4 solutions. So the number of positive integers $m$ that satisfy the given conditions is infinite.

But wait, there must be a mistake somewhere. Let's go back and re-evaluate the problem.

The equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ will have 4 solutions if and only if the value inside the absolute value brackets, $\vert x-1 \vert -2$, is equal to $\pm 1$ at exactly 4 points. This happens when $0 \leq \frac{m}{100} \leq 2$. 

The value of $m$ that satisfies this condition is not unique, but it's in the range of 0 to 200. So the number of positive integers $m$ that satisfy the given conditions is infinite.

However, this still doesn't feel right, as we are looking for the number of values of $
