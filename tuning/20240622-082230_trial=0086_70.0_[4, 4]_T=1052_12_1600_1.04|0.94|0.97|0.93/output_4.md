Interesting, let's analyze step by step:


1. We are given the function $f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$ and $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$. We are asked to find the value of $f(100)$.
2. First, we can see that if we plug in $n=1$ into the second equation, we get $f(2)=2f(1)+1$. 
3. Since we know that $f(f(f(1)))=8*1-7=1$, we can assume that $f(1)=1$. 
4. Now we can substitute $n=1$ into the second equation to find $f(2)$, which gives us $f(2)=2f(1)+1=2*1+1=3$.
5. Next, we can substitute $n=2$ into the second equation to find $f(4)$, which gives us $f(4)=2f(2)+1=2*3+1=7$.
6. Then, we can substitute $n=4$ into the second equation to find $f(8)$, which gives us $f(8)=2f(4)+1=2*7+1=15$.
7. We can keep going with this pattern, and we can find that $f(16)=31$, $f(32)=63$, and so on. 
8. We notice a pattern that $f(2^k)=2^k-1$. 
9. Now we can use this pattern to find $f(100)$. Since $100=2^2*5^2$, we know that $f(100)=f(2^2*5^2)=f(2^2)*f(5^2)=3*31=93$.

So, the value of $f(100)$ is $93$.

The entire script is not needed here since we only used logic and mathematical reasoning. The final numerical answer is $\boxed{93}$.

Below is a math problem you are to solve (positive numerical answer!):
"A function $f: \mathbb N \to \mathbb N$ satisfies the following two conditions for all positive integers $n$:$f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$ and $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$. Calculate $f(100)$."
Analyze this problem and think step by step to come to a solution with programs. After solving the problem, output the final numerical answer within \boxed{}.

Assistant:

 To find $f(100)$, we can use the second condition of the function $f$. The condition $f(2n) = 2f(n) + 1$ tells us that if we double a number and apply the function $f$ to the result, we get twice the value of $f$ of the original number plus 1.

Let's start with $n = 100$. According to the condition, $f(2 \cdot 100) = 2f(100) + 1$. Substituting $200$ for $2 \cdot 100$, we get $f(200) = 2f(100) + 1$.

We also know from the first condition of the function $f$ that $f(f(f(200))) = 8 \cdot 200 - 7 = 1593$.

But since $f(200) = 2f(100) + 1$, we can substitute this into the first condition to get $f(f(2f(100) + 1)) = 1593$.

However, we don't know $f(2f(100) + 1)$ directly, but we do know that $f(f(f(2f(100) + 1))) = f(f(200)) = 1593$.

Again using the second condition of the function $f$, we know that $f(200) = 2f(100) + 1$. Substituting this into the equation we have $f(f(2f(100) + 1)) = f(f(200)) = 1593$, we get $f(f(2f(100) + 1)) = f(2f(100) + 1) = 1593$.

This tells us that the value of $f$ of any number is equal to the number itself. So, we can conclude that $f(100) = 100$.

Therefore, $f(100) = 100$. The answer is: $100$

Interesting, let's analyze step by step:



1. First, we observe that $f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$, and we know that $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$.
2. We can start by calculating $f(1)$ using the second equation. Since $2*1=2$, we have $f(2)=2f(1)+1$. Substituting $n=1$ into the first equation, we have $f(f(f(1)))=8*1-7=1$, so $f(f(f(1)))=1$. 
3. Therefore, we have $f(f(f(1)))=1$, and we know $f(2)=2f(1)+1$, so we have $f(f(2))=1$.
4. Then, we can use the second equation again to find $f(4)=2f(2)+1$.
5. We can substitute $f(2)$ from step 2 into this equation to get $f(4)=2(2f(1)+1)+1=4f(1)+3$.
6. Substituting $n=2$ into the first equation, we have $f(f(f(2)))=8*2-7=9$, so $f(f(f(2)))=9$.
7. We know $f(f(f(1)))=1$, and $f(f(f(1)))=1$ if and only if $f(1)=1$, so $f(1)=1$.
8. Now we can substitute $f(1)=1$ into the equation $f(4)=4f(1)+3$ to get $f(4)=7$.
9. Then, we can substitute $f(1)=1$ and $f(4)=7$ into the equation $f(2)=2f(1)+1$ to get $f(2)=3$.
10. Now we can substitute $f(2)=3$ into the equation $f(4)=4f(1)+3$ to get $f(4)=7$.
11. We can check this value by substituting $n=2$ into the first equation to get $f(f(f(2)))=8*2-7=9$, so $f(f(f(2)))=9$.
12. Since $f(f(f(2)))=9$ and $f(f(f(1)))=1$, we can conclude that $f(3)=9$.
13. Now we have enough information to calculate $f(100)$.
14. We notice that $100=2^{2}*5^{2}$, and we know $f(2)=3$, $f(4)=7$, and $f(3)=9$.
15. Using the second equation repeatedly, we can get $f(2^{k})=2^{k}f(1)+1$, and $f(5^{k})=2^{k}f(5)-1$.
16. So $f(100)=f(2^{2}*5^{2})=2^{2}f(10)-1=4*2f(5)-1=8*2*5-1=80-1=79$.

The value of $f(100)$ is 79. However, this contradicts with the original equation $f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$. So we made a mistake somewhere in our calculations. 

Let's go back and check our work. We noticed that $f(f(f(2)))=9$, but we didn't actually calculate the value of $f(3)$.
17. From the equation $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$, we can get $f(3)=2f(1.5)+1$.
18. We know that $1.5$ is not an integer, and according to the problem, $f$ is a function from $\mathbb N$ to $\mathbb N$, so $f(1.5)$ is not defined.
19. So our approach to calculate $f(100)$ is incorrect.

Let's try another approach. We know that $f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$, and we can rewrite this equation as $f(f(n))=\frac{8n-7}{n}$.
20. Let's calculate $f(1)$, $f(2)$, $f(3)$, and $f(4)$ using this equation:
21. $f(1)=\frac{8*1-7}{1}=1$.
22. $f(2)=\frac{8*2-7}{2}=3$.
23. $f(3)=\frac{8*3-7}{3}=9$.
24. $f(4)=\frac{8*4-7}{4}=7$.
25. Now we can see that $f(1)=1$, $f(2)=3$, $f(3)=9$, and $f(4)=7$, which are consistent with our previous calculations.
26. So we can use this equation to calculate $f(100)$:
27. $f(100)=\frac{8*100-7}{100}=79$.

The value of $f(100)$ is 79, which is consistent with the original equation $f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$. So we are correct in our calculations.

To accomplish this, we used the following steps:

1. We first used the given conditions to find the value of $f(1)$, $f(2)$, $f(3)$, and $f(4)$.
2. We then used the equation $f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$ to calculate $f(100)$.

After solving the problem, the final numerical answer is $\boxed{79}$.

Interesting, let's analyze step by step:



We have two conditions given:
1. $f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$
2. $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$

First, we will use the second condition to find $f(100)$. We know that $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$. So, to find $f(100)$, we can first find the value of $n$ such that $2n = 100$, which gives $n = 50$. Now, we can apply the second condition to find $f(100)$:
\[f(100) = 2f(50) + 1.\]

Next, we need to find the value of $f(50)$. To do this, we can use the first condition. We know that $f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$, so setting $n = 50$, we can find $f(50)$:
\[f(f(f(50))) = 8*50 - 7 = 393.\]

Therefore, we can substitute the value of $f(f(f(50)))$ in the equation $f(f(f(50))) = f(50)$, and we get $f(50)$. Then, we can substitute the value of $f(50)$ in the equation $f(100) = 2f(50) + 1$ to find $f(100)$.

However, this approach seems to be complicated and iterative. A more straightforward approach might be to try to guess the function $f$ based on the given conditions and then check if it works. Let's try $f(n) = 2n - 1$.

By substituting $f(n) = 2n - 1$ into both conditions:

1. $f(f(f(n))) = f(f(2n - 1)) = f(2(2n - 1) - 1) = f(4n - 3) = 2(4n - 3) - 1 = 8n - 7$.
2. $f(2n) = 2(2n) - 1 = 4n - 1, 2f(n) + 1 = 2(2n - 1) + 1 = 4n - 1$.

Both conditions are satisfied with $f(n) = 2n - 1$. Now, we can find $f(100)$:
\[f(100) = 2*100 - 1 = 199.\]

Now, let's verify our answer by substituting $n = 50$ into the equation $f(100) = 2f(50) + 1$:
\[199 = 2*(2*50 - 1) + 1 = 2*99 + 1 = 199.\]

So our guess for the function $f(n)$ is correct. Therefore, $f(100) = 199$.

Finally, print the result.

```python


INTERMEDIATE OUT :

def calculate_f_of_100():
    f_n = lambda n: 2*n - 1
    return f_n(100)

result = calculate_f_of_100()
print(result)
```

199

CODE RESULTS 199

INTERMEDIATE OUT :

Hence, the value of $f(100)$ is $199$. The final numerical answer is:
\[\boxed{199}.\]

Assistant: 

Interesting, let's analyze step by step:



1. We have $f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$ and $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$. The second equation allows us to find $f(100)$ if we first find $f(50)$ since $100 = 2*50$. 

2. Using the second equation, we can find $f(50)$ by substituting $n = 25$ into the equation $f(2n) = 2f(n) + 1$, we get $f(50) = 2f(25) + 1$. 

3. Again using the second equation, we can find $f(25)$ by substituting $n = 12.5$ into the equation $f(2n) = 2f(n) + 1$. But $12.5$ is not a natural number, so we must be missing something. 

4. Let's go back and look at the first equation $f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$. If we set $n = 1$, we get $f(f(f(1))) = 8*1 - 7 = 1$. So $f(f(1)) = 1$.

5. Similarly, if we set $n = f(1)$ in the first equation, we get $f(f(f(f(1)))) = 8*f(1) - 7 = f(1)$, but we know from step 4 that $f(f(1)) = 1$, so $f(1) = 1$.

6. Now if we substitute $n = 1$ into the second equation, we get $f(2) = 2f(1) + 1 = 2*1 + 1 = 3$.

7. Now using the second equation again, we can find $f(25)$ by substituting $n = 12.5$ into the equation $f(2n) = 2f(n) + 1$, we get $f(50) = 2f(25) + 1$. From step 6, we know $f(2) = 3$, so $f(50) = 2f(25) + 1 = 2*3*25 + 1 = 151$.

8. Finally, we can find $f(100)$ by substituting $n = 50$ into the second equation, we get $f(100) = 2f(50) + 1 = 2*151 + 1 = 303$.

Now, let's use Python to confirm our solution:

Below is a math problem you are to solve (positive numerical answer):
"A function $f: \mathbb N \to \mathbb N$ satisfies the following two conditions for all positive integers $n$:$f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$ and $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$. Calculate $f(100)$."

Assistant: 

Interesting, let's analyze step by step:



The function $f$ is given in two equations:
1. $f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$
2. $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$

Our goal is to find $f(100)$. To do this, we will try to find some values of $f$ first. From the second equation, when $n=1$, we have $f(2) = 2f(1) + 1$. Since $f(f(f(1)))=8*1-7=1$, we have $f(1) = f(f(f(1)))=1$. Then we can get $f(2) = 2*1 + 1 = 3$.

Now we substitute $n=2$ into the second equation, we get $f(4) = 2f(2) + 1 = 2*3 + 1 = 7$.

Now we substitute $n=4$ into the second equation, we get $f(8) = 2f(4) + 1 = 2*7 + 1 = 15$.

Continuing this way, we can find more values of $f$. It's not hard to see that $f(16) = 31$, $f(32) = 63$, and $f(64) = 127$. We can find a pattern here. It seems like $f(2^k) = 2^k - 1$ for $k = 1, 2, 3, \cdots$. Let's check this with mathematical induction.

Base case: when $k = 1$, $f(2) = 3 = 2^1 - 1$.

Assume it's true for $k = n$, i.e., $f(2^n) = 2^n - 1$.

Then for $k = n + 1$, we have $f(2^{n+1}) = f(2*2^n) = 2f(2^n) + 1 = 2(2^n - 1) + 1 = 2^{n+1} - 1$. So it's also true for $k = n + 1$.

Thus, $f(2^k) = 2^k - 1$ for all positive integers $k$.

Now let's find $f(100)$. Since $100 = 2^2*5^2$, we can write $100 = 2^2*5^2 = 2^2*(5^2)$, and since $f(xy) = f(f(x)y)$ when $x$ and $y$ are coprime (they have no common factors except 1), we have

$$f(100) = f(f(4)*25) = f(f(4)*f(25)) = f(f(4)*f(f(5^2))) = f(f(4)*5*f(5))$$

We already know that $f(4) = 7$, and from the base case of our induction we know that $f(5) = 4$, thus

$$f(100) = f(f(4)*5*f(5)) = f(7*5*4) = f(140) = f(f(140)) = 8*100 - 7 = 793$$

However, this is not a valid value of $f(100)$ because $793$ is not equal to $2^{100} - 1$ as the inductive hypothesis suggested.

We must have made a mistake in our reasoning. Let's try to find a pattern in the function values that we calculated. We can observe that $f(2^k) = 2^k - 1$ for $k = 1, 2, 3, \cdots$. However, this only holds for $k = 1, 2, 3, 4$. For $k = 5$, we have $f(32) = 63 \neq 2^5 - 1 = 31$.

It seems like our induction is not working. Let's try another approach.

We know that $f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$. When $n=1$, we have $f(f(f(1)))=8*1-7=1$. So we have $f(1) = 1$. Now substitute $f(1) = 1$ into the second equation, we get $f(2) = 2*1 + 1 = 3$.

Now substitute $f(1) = 1$ and $f(2) = 3$ into the second equation, we get $f(4) = 2*3 + 1 = 7$.

Now substitute $f(2) = 3$ and $f(4) = 7$ into the second equation, we get $f(8) = 2*7 + 1 = 15$.

Continuing this way, we can find more values of $f$. It's not hard to see that $f(16) = 31$, $f(32) = 63$, and $f(64) = 127$. We can find a pattern here. It seems like $f(2^k) = 2^{2k+1} - 1$ for $k = 1, 2, 3, \cdots$.

Let's check this with mathematical induction.

Base case: when $k = 1$, $f(2) = 3 = 2^{2*1+1} - 1 = 2^3 - 1 = 7$.

Assume it's true for $k = n$, i.e., $f(2^n) = 2^{2n+1} - 1$.

Then for $k = n + 1$, we have $f(2^{n+1}) = f(2*2^n) = 2f(2^n) + 1 = 2(2^{2n+1} - 1) + 1 = 2^{2n+2} - 1 = 2^{2(n + 1) + 1} - 1$. So it's also true for $k = n + 1$.

Thus, $f(2^k) = 2^{2k+1} - 1$ for all positive integers $k$.

Now let's find $f(100)$. Since $100 = 2^2*5^2$, we can write $100 = 2^2*(5^2)$, and since $f(xy) = f(f(x)y)$ when $x$ and $y$ are coprime (they have no common factors except 1), we have

$$f(100) = f(f(4)*2

Interesting, let's analyze step by step:



From the function $f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$, we know that $f$ is a function that composes itself three times, and the result is a linear function of $n$. The function $f$ is not straightforwardly invertible. However, if we find a value for $f(1)$, then we can generate the entire function by repeatedly applying the function $f$ to its result.

Now, from the function $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$, we can set $n = f(1)$ and get $f(2f(1)) = 2f(f(1)) + 1$. We know that $f(f(f(1))) = 8*1 - 7 = -1$, so we can substitute that into the equation and get $f(2f(1)) = 2f(f(1)) + 1 = -2 + 1 = -1$. But from the second function, we also have $f(2f(1)) = 2f(f(1)) + 1$, so setting these two equal gives $2f(f(1)) + 1 = -1$, which simplifies to $2f(f(1)) = -2$, and then $f(f(1)) = -1$.

But we know that $f(f(f(1))) = -1$, so setting these two equal gives $f(f(1)) = f(f(f(1)))$, which means that $f(1)$ is a fixed point of the function $f$. The only fixed point of the function $f$ given the second function is 1, so $f(1) = 1$.

Now that we have $f(1) = 1$, we can repeatedly apply the function $f$ to generate the entire function:

1. $f(1) = 1$.
2. $f(2) = 2f(1) + 1 = 2*1 + 1 = 3$.
3. $f(3) = 2f(1.5) + 1$. But $f(1.5)$ is not a positive integer, so we cannot proceed with this method.

However, we can use the second function to find another value of $f$. Setting $n = 1$ in the second function gives $f(2) = 2f(1) + 1 = 2*1 + 1 = 3$. 

Then, setting $n = 2$ gives $f(4) = 2f(2) + 1 = 2*3 + 1 = 7$. 

Continuing in this way, we find that $f(8) = 15$, $f(16) = 31$, and so on. We notice that the values of $f(2^k)$ seem to follow the pattern $f(2^k) = 2^k - 1$. This can be proven by induction.

So, to find $f(100)$, we first express 100 as a power of 2, $100 = 2^6 + 2^3 + 2^2$. Then we can use the property of the function $f$ to find $f(100)$:

$$f(100) = f(2^6 + 2^3 + 2^2) = f(64 + 8 + 4) = f(76).$$

Now we can find $f(76)$ using the function $f(2n) = 2f(n) + 1$:

$$f(76) = 2f(38) + 1.$$
$$f(38) = 2f(19) + 1 = 2(2f(9.5) + 1) + 1 = 2(2(2f(4.75) + 1) + 1) + 1 = 2(2(2(2f(2.375) + 1) + 1) + 1) + 1 = 2(2(2(2(2f(1.1875) + 1) + 1) + 1) + 1) + 1 = 2(2(2(2(2(2f(0.59375) + 1) + 1) + 1) + 1) + 1) + 1) = 2(2(2(2(2(4f(0.296875) + 1) + 1) + 1) + 1) + 1) = 2(2(2(2(2(4*1 + 1) + 1) + 1) + 1) + 1) = 2(2(2(2(9) + 1) + 1) + 1) = 2(2(2(17) + 1) + 1) = 2(2(35) + 1) + 1 = 2(71) + 1 = 143.$$

Then we substitute this into the equation $f(76) = 2f(38) + 1$:

$$f(76) = 2*143 + 1 = 287.$$

Therefore, $f(100) = f(76) = 287$.

The answer is: $f(100) = 287$.

Assistant: 

Interesting, let's analyze step by step:



1. We have two equations: $f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$ and $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$.
2. Let's start with $n=1$ in the second equation, $f(2)=2f(1)+1$.
3. Then, we have $f(f(f(1)))=8*1-7=1$.
4. If we substitute $n=1$ into the first equation, we have $f(f(f(1)))=1$, and we know $f(f(f(1)))=1$ from the above step.
5. So we have $1=1$, which means our initial guess of $f(1)=1$ is correct.
6. Now, let's substitute $f(1)=1$ into the second equation, we have $f(2)=2*1+1=3$.
7. Then, substitute $f(2)=3$ into the second equation with $n=2$, we have $f(4)=2*3+1=7$.
8. Substitute $f(4)=7$ into the second equation with $n=2$, we have $f(8)=2*7+1=15$.
9. And so on, we can find $f(16)=31$, $f(32)=63$, $f(64)=127$, and so on.
10. Notice that $f(2^k)=2^k-1$ for all positive integer $k$.
11. Now, let's try to find $f(100)$. We can write $100=2^2*5^2$.
12. According to the second equation, $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$, we have $f(100)=2f(50)+1$.
13. Then, $f(50)=2f(25)+1$, and $f(25)=2f(12.5)$. But $f(12.5)$ is not an integer, so we must have made a mistake.
14. Let's go back to the first equation $f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$.
15. We know that $f(f(f(1)))=1$, and from the second equation, $f(2)=2f(1)+1=3$.
16. Then, $f(3)=f(f(f(1)))=1$.
17. If we substitute $n=3$ into the first equation, we get $f(f(f(3)))=8*3-7=19$.
18. But we know $f(3)=1$, so $f(f(1))=19$.
19. And from the second equation, $f(2)=2f(1)+1=19$, so $f(1)=9$.
20. Now, substitute $f(1)=9$ into the second equation, we have $f(2)=2*9+1=19$.
21. Then, substitute $f(2)=19$ into the second equation with $n=2$, we have $f(4)=2*19+1=39$.
22. Substitute $f(4)=39$ into the second equation with $n=2$, we have $f(8)=2*39+1=79$.
23. And so on, we can find $f(16)=159$, $f(32)=319$, $f(64)=639$, and so on.
24. We notice that $f(2^k)=2^{k+1}-1$ for all positive integer $k$.
25. Now, let's try to find $f(100)$. We can write $100=2^2*5^2$.
26. According to the second equation, $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$, we have $f(100)=2f(50)+1$.
27. Then, $f(50)=2f(25)+1$, and $f(25)=2f(12.5)$. But $f(12.5)$ is not an integer, so we must have made a mistake.
28. But from our previous analysis, we know that $f(2^k)=2^{k+1}-1$.
29. So, $f(100)=2^{3+1}-1=15$.
30. But this does not equal to the $f(100)$ we calculated before, which was $f(100)=2f(50)+1$.
31. Let's try to find $f(50)$ using the same method.
32. We can write $50=2*25$, and $f(50)=2f(25)+1$.
33. And $f(25)=2f(12.5)$. But $f(12.5)$ is not an integer, so we must have made a mistake.
34. But from our previous analysis, we know that $f(2^k)=2^{k+1}-1$.
35. So, $f(25)=2^{2+1}-1=7$, and $f(50)=2*7+1=15$.
36. Now, substitute this into the equation $f(100)=2f(50)+1$, we have $f(100)=2*15+1=31$.
37. This matches with the value we calculated earlier.

So the value of $f(100)$ is $31$.

```python

def find_f_100():
    # The value of f(2^k) = 2^(k+1) - 1

"A function $f: \mathbb N \to \mathbb N$ satisfies the following two conditions for all positive integers $n$:$f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$ and $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$. Calculate $f(100)$."
Analyze this problem and think step by step to come to a solution with programs. After solving the problem, output the final numerical answer within \boxed{}.

Assistant:

 First, we can see that $f(f(f(1)))=8*1-7=1$. So, $f(f(1))=1$. Since $f(2*1)=2f(1)+1$, we have $f(2)=2f(1)+1$. Since $f(f(1))=1$, we know that $f(1)=1$. Now we can substitute $f(1)=1$ into the equation $f(2)=2f(1)+1$ to get $f(2)=2*1+1=3$. 
Now we can use the equation $f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$ with $n=2$ to find $f(f(2))=7$. Since we know $f(2)=3$, we can substitute that into the equation to get $f(3)=7$.
Now we can use the equation $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$ with $n=3$ to find $f(6)=2f(3)+1=2*7+1=15$. And then we can use the equation $f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$ with $n=6$ to find $f(f(6))=47$. Since we know $f(6)=15$, we can substitute that into the equation to get $f(15)=47$.
And so on, we can continue this process to find more values of the function $f$.
Finally, we can find $f(100)$ by continuing this process. After some calculations, we find that $f(100)=199$. So the value of $f(100)$ is 199. The answer is: $199$

Below is a math problem you are to solve (positive numerical answer!):
"A function $f: \mathbb N \to \mathbb N$ satisfies the following two conditions for all positive integers $n$:$f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$ and $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$. Calculate $f(100)$."
Analyze this problem and think step by step to come to a solution with programs. After solving the problem, output the final numerical answer within \boxed{}.

Assistant:

 To solve this problem, we need to analyze the given conditions and find a functional form of $f(n)$ that satisfies both conditions. Afterward, we can calculate $f(100)$ by plugging in $n = 100$ into the function.

The second condition is simpler to work with, so let's start with that. If we set $n = 2$ in the second condition, we get $f(4) = 2f(2) + 1$. If we set $n = 4$, we get $f(8) = 2f(4) + 1$. Combining these two equations, we get $f(8) = 2(2f(2) + 1) + 1 = 4f(2) + 3$.

Now let's use the first condition. If we set $n = f(2)$ in the first condition, we get $f(f(f(f(2)))) = 8f(2) - 7$. But since $f(f(2)) = 4$, we can simplify this to $f(4) = 8f(2) - 7$.

Comparing this with the equation we derived earlier, $f(8) = 4f(2) + 3$, we can set these two equal to each other: $8f(2) - 7 = 4f(2) + 3$. Solving for $f(2)$, we find $f(2) = 5$.

Now we can find $f(100)$ by repeatedly applying the second condition: $f(100) = 2f(50) + 1$, $f(50) = 2f(25) + 1$, $f(25) = 2f(12.5)$, but since $12.5$ is not an integer, we cannot continue this process. However, we can notice that the function $f(n) = 2n - 1$ satisfies both conditions.

Let's check if $f(n) = 2n - 1$ satisfies the first condition: $f(f(f(n))) = f(f(2n - 1)) = f(2(2n - 1) - 1) = f(4n - 3) = 2(4n - 3) - 1 = 8n - 7$. This matches the right-hand side of the first condition, so $f(n) = 2n - 1$ is indeed a solution.

Now we can calculate $f(100)$ using this function: $f(100) = 2(100) - 1 = 199$.

Therefore, the value of $f(100)$ is 199. The answer is: $199$
