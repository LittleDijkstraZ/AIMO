Below is a math problem you are to solve (positive numerical answer):
"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"
To accomplish this, first determine a sympy-based approach for solving the problem by listing each step to take and what functions need to be called in each step. Be clear so even an idiot can follow your instructions, and remember, your final answer should be positive integer, not an algebraic expression!
Write the entire script covering all the steps (use comments and document it well) and print the result. After solving the problem, output the final numerical answer within \boxed{}.

Interesting, let's analyze step by step:



The equation is a product of two terms equal to zero. Therefore, one of the terms must be zero for the equation to hold. This gives us two systems of equations to solve:

1. $\left( |x + y| - 10 \right)^2 = 0$ and $\left( |x| - 8 \right)^2 = 0$.
2. $\left( |x - y| - 10 \right)^2 = 0$ and $\left( |y| - 8 \right)^2 = 0$.

For the first system, we have $|x + y| = 10$ and $|x| = 8$, which implies $x = \pm 8$ and $y = \pm 10 \pm x$. Similarly, for the second system, we have $|x - y| = 10$ and $|y| = 8$, which implies $y = \pm 8$ and $x = \pm 10 \pm y$.

These four pairs of equations give us the vertices of the polygon: $(8, 10)$, $(8, -10)$, $(-8, 10)$, and $(-8, -10)$.

To find the area of the polygon, we can use the formula for the area of a rectangle and subtract the areas of the four right triangles formed by the sides of the rectangle:

Area = $16 \times 20 - \frac{1}{2} \times 8 \times 10 - \frac{1}{2} \times 8 \times 10 - \frac{1}{2} \times 8 \times 10 - \frac{1}{2} \times 8 \times 10 = 320 - 40 = 280$.

So the area of the polygon is 280 square units.
The answer is: $280$

Assistant:

 The given equation is a product of two terms equal to zero, which means that either of the terms must be zero for the entire equation to be zero. 

The terms $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2$ and $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2$ can only be zero if $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. This gives us the lines $x + y = 10$, $x + y = -10$, $x - y = 10$, and $x - y = -10$.

The terms $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2$ and $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2$ can only be zero if $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$. This gives us the lines $x = 8$, $x = -8$, $y = 8$, and $y = -8$.

The intersection points of these lines are the vertices of the polygon:

- $(8, 2)$, $(8, -2)$, $(-8, 2)$, and $(-8, -2)$ from the lines $x = \pm8$ and $y = \pm2$.
- $(5, 5)$, $(5, -5)$, $(-5, 5)$, and $(-5, -5)$ from the lines $x + y = 10$ and $x - y = 10$.
- $(0, 10)$, $(0, -10)$, $(10, 0)$, and $(-10, 0)$ from the lines $x + y = \pm10$ and $x - y = \pm10$.

The polygon is a square with side length 10, so its area is $10^2 = 100$. The answer is: $100$

Below is a math problem you are to solve (positive numerical answer!):
"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"
Analyze this problem and think step by step to come to a solution with programs. After solving the problem, output the final numerical answer within \boxed{}.

Assistant:

 The equation $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ is true if either of the following two conditions is true:
1. $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ or
2. $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$.
The first condition implies that $|x + y| = 10$ and $|x - y| = 10$, which means that $x$ and $y$ are both $5$ or both $-5$. The second condition implies that $|x| = 8$ and $|y| = 8$, which means that $x$ is in $[-8, 8]$ and $y$ is in $[-8, 8]$. Therefore, the points $(x, y)$ that satisfy the equation are those that are either both $5$ or both $-5$ in both the x and y coordinates, or are within a square with side length $16$.
The points that are both $5$ or both $-5$ in both the x and y coordinates form a square with side length $10$, so its area is $10^2 = 100$. The points within a square with side length $16$ form a square with side length $16$, so its area is $16^2 = 256$.
The area of the convex polygon formed by the points that satisfy the equation is the sum of the areas of these two squares, which is $100 + 256 = 356$.
Therefore, the area of the convex polygon is $356$.
```python

    area_square1 = 10**2
    area_square2 = 16**2
    area_polygon = area_square1 + area_square2

Analyze this problem and think step by step to come to a solution with programs. After solving the problem, output the final numerical answer within \boxed{}.

Assistant:

 The given equation is a product of two terms equal to zero, so either of the terms must be zero. This gives us the following four conditions:
1. $\vert x + y \vert - 10 = 0$
2. $\vert x - y \vert - 10 = 0$
3. $\vert x \vert - 8 = 0$
4. $\vert y \vert - 8 = 0$

From conditions 3 and 4, we have $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$, which implies $x = \pm 8$ and $y = \pm 8$.

From conditions 1 and 2, we have $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. This implies that the absolute values of $x + y$ and $x - y$ must be equal to 10. Considering the four possible combinations of signs for $x$ and $y$, we find that the solutions are $x = \pm 5$ and $y = \pm 5$.

So the vertices of the polygon are $(-8, -8)$, $(-8, 8)$, $(8, -8)$, $(8, 8)$, $(-5, -5)$, $(-5, 5)$, $(5, -5)$, and $(5, 5)$.

The polygon is a square with side length 10, so its area is $10^2 = 100$. The answer is: $100$

Interesting, let's analyze step by step:



The expression $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + (\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ implies $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. This can only be true if $x = y = \pm 10$ or $x = -y = \pm 10$. 

Similarly, the expression $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + (\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ implies $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$, which can only be true if $x = y = \pm 8$.

So the points $(x, y)$ that satisfy the given equation are $(8, 8)$, $(-8, 8)$, $(8, -8)$, $(-8, -8)$, $(10, 10)$, $(-10, 10)$, $(10, -10)$, and $(-10, -10)$.

These points form a square with side length $20$, and thus, the area of the square is $20^2 = 400$.

Therefore, the area of the convex polygon is $400$.

The Python code to compute this is very simple:

```python


INTERMEDIATE OUT :

def polygon_area():
    side_length = 20
    area = side_length ** 2
    return area

result = polygon_area()
print(result)

Interesting, let's analyze step by step:



1. The expression $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2)$ equals to 0 if and only if both of the following conditions hold:

   a) $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ and $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$
   b) $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ and $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$

2. From condition a), we get that $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$.
   From condition b), we get that $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$.

3. Solving these absolute value equations, we get the following four points:
   $(8, 2)$, $(8, -2)$, $(-8, 2)$, and $(-8, -2)$.

4. These four points form a square with side length 4.

5. To find the area of the square, we simply square the length of one side: $4^2 = 16$.

So, the area of the convex polygon is 16. The answer is: $16$

 The given equation is equal to zero if either of the two factors is equal to zero. 

The first factor is equal to zero if either $\vert x + y \vert - 10 = 0$ or $\vert x - y \vert - 10 = 0$. These equations simplify to $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$.

The second factor is equal to zero if either $\vert x \vert - 8 = 0$ or $\vert y \vert - 8 = 0$. These equations simplify to $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$.

The solutions to these equations are the vertices of the polygon. 

The vertices of the polygon are the points where the absolute values are equal to their bounds. This gives us the following vertices:

- $(8,8)$, $(8,-8)$, $(-8,8)$, and $(-8,-8)$ from $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$.
- $(10,0)$, $(0,10)$, $(-10,0)$, and $(0,-10)$ from $\vert x + y \vert = 10$.
- $(0,-10)$, $(-10,0)$, $(10,0)$, and $(0,10)$ from $\vert x - y \vert = 10$.

The polygon is a square with side length $20$. The area of the square is $20^2 = 400$. The answer is: $\boxed{400}$.

Assistant: 

Interesting, let's analyze step by step:



Step 1: We have a product of two expressions equal to zero. This means that either the first expression is zero or the second expression is zero. 

Step 2: For the first expression to be zero, we need both $|x+y| - 10 = 0$ and $|x-y| - 10 = 0$. This implies $|x+y| = 10$ and $|x-y| = 10$. The solutions to these equations are the lines $x+y = 10$, $x+y = -10$, $x-y = 10$, and $x-y = -10$. These lines form a rectangle.

Step 3: For the second expression to be zero, we need both $|x| - 8 = 0$ and $|y| - 8 = 0$. This implies $|x| = 8$ and $|y| = 8$. The solutions to these equations are the lines $x = 8$, $x = -8$, $y = 8$, and $y = -8$. These lines form a square.

Step 4: The intersection of the rectangle and the square is the convex polygon we are looking for. The area of this polygon is the area of the rectangle (which is a square with side length 10) minus the area of the square (which is a square with side length 8).

Step 5: The area of the rectangle (or the square) can be calculated as the product of its side lengths. So the area of the rectangle is $10 * 10 = 100$ and the area of the square is $8 * 8 = 64$.

Step 6: The area of the convex polygon is then $100 - 64 = 36$.

```python


INTERMEDIATE OUT :

from sympy import *

# Calculate the area of the convex polygon
area = 100 - 64

Assistant: 

Interesting, let's analyze step by step:



The product of two numbers is zero if and only if at least one of the numbers is zero. So the given equation is equivalent to:

$$((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2) = 0 \text{ or } ((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$$

The first equation implies that $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$, which means that $x$ and $y$ are both $5$ or both $-5$. The second equation implies that $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$, which means that $x$ is in the range $[-8, 8]$ and $y$ is in the range $[-8, 8]$.

So the points that satisfy the given equation are either of the form $(5, 5)$, $(-5, -5)$, $(5, -5)$, $(-5, 5)$, or are in the square with vertices at $(8, 8)$, $(8, -8)$, $(-8, -8)$, and $(-8, 8)$.

The points form a square with side length $10$, so its area is $10^2 = 100$.

So the area of the convex polygon is $100$.

The Python code to calculate the area is:

```python


INTERMEDIATE OUT :

def polygon_area():
    # The side length of the square is 10
    side_length = 10
    # The area of the square is side_length^2

    return area

result = polygon_area()
print(result)

The area of the convex polygon is $100$.
The answer is: $100$
