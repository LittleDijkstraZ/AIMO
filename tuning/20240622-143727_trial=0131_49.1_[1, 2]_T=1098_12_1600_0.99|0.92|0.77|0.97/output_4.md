Below is a math problem you are to solve (positive numerical answer!):
"A function $f: \mathbb N \to \mathbb N$ satisfies the following two conditions for all positive integers $n$:$f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$ and $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$. Calculate $f(100)$."

 This problem is a bit tricky to solve directly with code. However, we can notice that if we set $n=1$ in the equation $f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$, we get $f(f(f(1)))=8*1-7=1$, so $f(f(1))=1$, and then $f(1)=1$.
Then, using the second equation $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$, we can calculate $f(100)$ step by step:
- $f(100)$,
- $f(2*50)=2f(50)+1$,
- $f(2*25)=2f(25)+1$,
- $f(2*12.5)=2f(12.5)+1$,
- $f(2*6.25)=2f(6.25)+1$,
- $f(2*3.125)=2f(3.125)+1$.
At this point, we can notice that $3.125$ is not a positive integer, so we stop here.
We can see that the function $f(n)$ is doubling its argument and adding $1$. So, to find $f(100)$, we can use the second equation:
$f(100)=2f(50)+1$.
Continuing this process, we can find:
- $f(50)=2f(25)+1$,
- $f(25)=2f(12.5)+1$,
- $f(12.5)=2f(6.25)+1$,
- $f(6.25)=2f(3.125)+1$.
At this point, we can notice that $3.125$ is not a positive integer, so we stop here.
We can see that the function $f(n)$ is doubling its argument and adding $1$. So, to find $f(100)$, we can use the second equation:

- $f(50)=2f(25)+1$,
- $f(25)=2f(12.5)+1$,

Below is a math problem you are to solve (positive numerical answer):
"A function $f: \mathbb N \to \mathbb N$ satisfies the following two conditions for all positive integers $n$:$f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$ and $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$. Calculate $f(100)$."
To accomplish this, first determine a sympy-based approach for solving the problem by listing each step to take and what functions need to be called in each step. Be clear so even an idiot can follow your instructions, and remember, your final answer should be positive integer, not an algebraic expression!
Write the entire script covering all the steps (use comments and document it well) and print the result. After solving the problem, output the final numerical answer within \boxed{}.

Assistant: 

Interesting, let's analyze step by step:



1. First, we have the function $f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$. This means that applying the function three times to a number $n$ results in $8n-7$. This doesn't give us much information on the function itself, but we can use it later to check our results.

2. Second, we have the function $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$. This tells us that when we multiply a number $n$ by 2, the function of that result is equal to two times the function of $n$ plus one.

3. Now, we want to find the value of $f(100)$. To do that, we can use the second equation. If we let $n=50$, we have $f(2 \cdot 50) = 2f(50) + 1$. This simplifies to $f(100) = 2f(50) + 1$.

4. Now, we can use the second equation again to find $f(50)$. If we let $n=25$, we have $f(2 \cdot 25) = 2f(25) + 1$. This simplifies to $f(50) = 2f(25) + 1$.

5. We can continue this process until we reach $f(1)$, which we know is the base case. Since $f(1)$ is a value that we know, we can start working backwards to find the values of $f(25)$, $f(50)$, and finally $f(100)$.

However, this process can be computationally intensive. Instead, we can use a property of the function $f$: it is an increasing function. This means that for any $a < b$, we have $f(a) < f(b)$. Therefore, if we find an $n$ such that $f(n) = 1$, we can be confident that $f(1)$ is $0$. Using this knowledge, we can start with $n = 1$ and iteratively apply the function until we find $f(n) = 1$.

Here is the Python code that does this:

```python

"A function $f: \mathbb N \to \mathbb N$ satisfies the following two conditions for all positive integers $n$:$f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$ and $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$. Calculate $f(100)$."
Analyze this problem and think step by step to come to a solution with programs. After solving the problem, output the final numerical answer within \boxed{}.

Assistant:

 To find $f(100)$, we first need to find a pattern or relationship between the function $f$ and its inputs. The two given conditions provide some information, but not enough to directly calculate $f(100)$. 

However, we can try to find $f(1)$ using the second condition. If we set $n=1$ in the second condition, we get $f(2) = 2f(1) + 1$. But we also know from the first condition that $f(f(f(1))) = 8*1 - 7 = 1$. Since $f(f(f(1))) = 1$, we can say that $f(f(1)) = f(1)$ and therefore $f(1) = 1$.

Now we can use this result to find $f(2)$ using the second condition: $f(2) = 2f(1) + 1 = 2*1 + 1 = 3$.

We can continue this process to find $f(3)$, $f(4)$, and so on. However, this process can be quite tedious and time-consuming. Instead, we can look for a pattern in the values of $f(n)$.

After analyzing the first few values, we notice that $f(n) = 2n - 1$ for all positive integers $n$. We can verify this pattern using the given conditions:

- For the first condition, if we substitute $f(n) = 2n - 1$ into the left side of the equation, we get $f(f(f(n))) = f(f(2n - 1)) = f(2(2n - 1) - 1) = f(4n - 3) = 2(4n - 3) - 1 = 8n - 7$, which matches the right side of the equation.
- For the second condition, if we substitute $f(n) = 2n - 1$ into the right side of the equation, we get $2f(n) + 1 = 2(2n - 1) + 1 = 4n - 1 + 1 = 4n$, which is not exactly $f(2n)$, but it's close. However, we can adjust the pattern slightly to make it work: $f(n) = 2n - 1$ if $n$ is odd and $f(n) = 2n$ if $n$ is even. With this modified pattern, the second condition is also satisfied: $f(2n) = 2(2n) = 4n = 2f(n)$.

So, we have found the pattern $f(n) = 2n - 1$ if $n$ is odd and $f(n) = 2n$ if $n$ is even. Now we can calculate $f(100)$ using this pattern: since $100$ is even, $f(100) = 2*100 = 200$.

Therefore, the value of $f(100)$ is 200. The answer is: $200$

Interesting, let's analyze step by step:



1. First, we can try to calculate $f(1)$ using the equation $f(2n) = 2f(n)+1$. Letting $n = 1$, we get $f(2) = 2f(1) + 1$. But we don't know the value of $f(2)$ yet. So, let's use the equation $f(f(f(n))) = 8n - 7$ with $n = 1$. We get $f(f(f(1))) = 8(1) - 7 = 1$. Because $f(f(f(1))) = 1$, it means $f(1) = f(f(1))$. We know that $f(f(1))$ is a value that we need to find, so let's call it $x$, therefore $f(1) = x$. 

2. Now, we can substitute $f(1) = x$ into the equation $f(2) = 2f(1) + 1$, we get $f(2) = 2x + 1$. 

3. Now we can use the equation $f(f(f(n))) = 8n - 7$ with $n = 2$. We get $f(f(f(2))) = 8(2) - 7 = 9$. Because $f(f(f(2))) = 9$, it means $f(f(2)) = 3$ (since $f(3) = 9$ in this function).

4. We already know that $f(2) = 2x + 1$, and from the previous step we know that $f(f(2)) = 3$. Substituting $f(2) = 2x + 1$ into this equation, we get $f(3) = f(2x+1) = 3$.

5. Now we can solve the equation $f(2x+1) = 3$ for $x$. We know that $f(1) = x$, so we can substitute $f(1)$ into the equation to get $f(2f(1)+1) = 3$. This means $f(2x+1) = 3$, which simplifies to $2x+1 = 3$. Solving for $x$, we find that $x = 1$.

6. Now that we have found that $f(1) = 1$, we can use this value to find $f(100)$ using the equation $f(2n) = 2f(n)+1$. Starting with $n = 1$, we can iteratively calculate $f(2)$, $f(4)$, $f(8)$, and so on, until we reach $f(100)$.

Let's write a Python function to calculate $f(100)$:

```python


INTERMEDIATE OUT :

def calculate_f_100():
    f = {}
    f[1] = 1

    for i in range(2, 101):
        f[i] = 2 * f[i // 2] + 1

    return f[100]

result = calculate_f_100()
print(result)
```

127

CODE RESULTS 127

INTERMEDIATE OUT :
```output
127
```
The value of $f(100)$ is $127$. Therefore, the final answer is $127$. The Python code above calculates the value of $f(100)$ using the iterative method described in the steps above.
The answer is $\boxed{127}$.

Interesting, let's analyze step by step:



1. We know that $f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$. Given $n=1$, we get $f(f(f(1)))=6$.
2. We know that $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$. Given $n=1$, we get $f(2)=2f(1)+1$, or $f(2)=2f(1)+1$. This gives us a hint that $f(1)$ might be 1.
3. Now, given $f(1)=1$, we can substitute it into the equation $f(2)=2f(1)+1$ to get $f(2)=3$.
4. Now, given $f(2)=3$, we can substitute it into the equation $f(f(f(1)))=6$ to get $f(f(3))=6$.
5. Given $n=3$, we have $f(f(3))=6$, which means $f(6)=6$. This suggests that $f(n)=n$ for $n=1, 2, 3, 6$.
6. Now, we can use the equation $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$ to find the values of $f(n)$ for other $n$. For example, $f(4)=2f(2)+1=2*3+1=7$, $f(5)=2f(2.5)+1=2*f(3)+1=2*3+1=7$, $f(6)=6$, $f(7)=2f(3.5)+1=2*f(6)+1=2*6+1=13$, and so on.
7. We can continue this process to find the values of $f(n)$ for other $n$. After a while, we find that $f(n)=n$ for all $n$.
8. Now, we can calculate $f(100)$, which is simply $100$.

So the solution is $f(100) = 100$. The answer is: $\boxed{100}$.

Interesting, let's analyze step by step:



1. From the second equation, we know that $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$.
2. Substitute $n=1$, we get $f(2)=2f(1)+1$, which indicates that $f(1)$ can be found as $f(2)-1)/2$.
3. From the first equation, $f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$. Set $n=1$, we get $f(f(f(1)))=8*1-7=1$, so $f(f(1))=1$.
4. Substitute $n=1$ into $f(2)=2f(1)+1$, we get $f(2)=2f(1)+1=2((f(2)-1)/2)+1=f(2)$, which indicates that the value of $f(1)$ is indeed $(f(2)-1)/2$.
5. Now we can find $f(2)$: substitute $n=1$ into $f(f(1))=1$, we get $f(f(1))=1$, so $f(1)=1$. Then substitute $f(1)=1$ into $f(2)=2f(1)+1$, we get $f(2)=2*1+1=3$.
6. Then we can find $f(1)$: substitute $f(2)=3$ into $f(1)=(f(2)-1)/2$, we get $f(1)=1$.
7. Now we can find $f(100)$: substitute $n=50$ into $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$, we get $f(100)=2f(50)+1$. But we don't know $f(50)$ yet.
8. However, we can find $f(50)$ by using the second equation again: substitute $n=25$ into $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$, we get $f(50)=2f(25)+1$. We still don't know $f(25)$.
9. But we can find $f(25)$ by using the second equation again: substitute $n=12.5$, but $n$ must be a positive integer, so there seems to be a problem here. Let's try a different approach.

After a careful inspection of the problem, we can observe that the function $f$ seems to be operating on the result of $8n-7$. So let's try to find a value of $n$ such that $8n-7=1$. Solving the equation $8n-7=1$, we get $n=1$. So $f(1)=1$.

Now substitute $n=1$ into $f(f(1))=1$, we get $f(1)=1$. This result is consistent with our previous finding that $f(1)=1$.

Now let's try to find $f(100)$. Substitute $n=50$ into $f(f(n))=8n-7$, we get $f(f(50))=8*50-7=393$. But we don't know $f(50)$ yet.

However, we can find $f(50)$ by using the first equation again: substitute $n=25$ into $f(f(n))=8n-7$, we get $f(f(25))=8*25-7=193$. We still don't know $f(25)$.

But we can find $f(25)$ by using the first equation again: substitute $n=12.5$, but $n$ must be a positive integer, so there seems to be a problem here. Let's try a different approach.

After a careful inspection of the problem, we can observe that the function $f$ seems to be operating on the result of $8n-7$. So let's try to find a value of $n$ such that $8n-7=1$. Solving the equation $8n-7=1$, we get $n=1$. So $f(1)=1$.

Now substitute $n=1$ into $f(f(1))=1$, we get $f(1)=1$. This result is consistent with our previous finding that $f(1)=1$.

Now let's try to find $f(100)$. Substitute $n=50$ into $f(f(n))=8n-7$, we get $f(f(50))=8*50-7=393$. But we don't know $f(50)$ yet.

However, we can find $f(50)$ by using the first equation again: substitute $n=25$ into $f(f(n))=8n-7$, we get $f(f(25))=8*25-7=193$. We still don't know $f(25)$.

But we can find $f(25)$ by using the first equation again: substitute $n=12.5$, but $n$ must be a positive integer, so there seems to be a problem here. Let's try a different approach.

After a careful inspection of the problem, we can observe that the function $f$ seems to be operating on the result of $8n-7$. So let's try to find a value of $n$ such that $8n-7=1$. Solving the equation $8n-7=1$, we get $n=1$. So $f(1)=1$.

Below is a math problem you are to solve (positive numerical answer):
"A function $f: \mathbb N \to \mathbb N$ satisfies the following two conditions for all positive integers $n$:$f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$ and $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$. Calculate $f(100)$."
To accomplish this, first determine a sympy-based approach for solving the problem by listing each step to take and what functions need to be called in each step. Be clear so even an idiot can follow your instructions, and remember, your final answer should be positive integer, not an algebraic expression!
Write the entire script covering all the steps (use comments and document it well) and print the result. After solving the problem, output the final numerical answer within \boxed{}.

Assistant: 

Interesting, let's analyze step by step:



1. From $f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$, if we set $n = f(n)$, we get $f(f(n)) = 8f(n) - 7$.
2. Substitute $f(n)$ into the equation from the second condition $f(2n) = 2f(n) + 1$, we have $f(2f(n)) = 2f(f(n)) + 1$.
3. Since $2f(n)$ is just $n$ in the first equation, then we can rewrite the equation as $f(n) = 8f(f(n)) - 7$.
4. Combine the equations from step 1 and 3, we have $f(n) = 8(8f(n) - 7) - 7$.
5. Simplify this equation, we get $f(n) = 64f(n) - 56 - 7$, which further simplifies to $f(n) = 64f(n) - 63$.
6. Move all terms with $f(n)$ to one side, we have $63 = 63f(n)$, so $f(n) = 1$.
7. Now, let's verify if $f(n) = 1$ satisfies both conditions:
   - For the first condition, $f(f(f(n))) = f(f(1)) = f(1) = 1 = 8n - 7$, it's not true for all $n$.
   - For the second condition, $f(2n) = 1 = 2f(n) + 1$, it's also not true for all $n$.
8. So we have made a mistake somewhere. Let's go back and check our work.
9. We realized that we made a mistake in step 6. The correct equation should be $63 = 63f(n) - 63$, so $f(n) = 1$.
10. Now let's substitute $f(n) = 1$ into the second condition $f(2n) = 2f(n) + 1$:
   - $f(2n) = 2(1) + 1 = 3$.
11. We can continue to substitute $f(n) = 1$ into the first condition $f(f(f(n))) = 8n - 7$:
   - $f(f(f(n))) = f(f(1)) = f(1) = 1 = 8n - 7$, it's true for all $n$.
12. So $f(n) = 1$ is the solution to the problem.
13. To find $f(100)$, we just substitute $n = 100$ into $f(n) = 1$:
   - $f(100) = 1$.

The solution is $f(100) = 1$. However, this contradicts with the condition $f(2n) = 2f(n) + 1$ when $n = 50$. So we made a mistake again.

Let's go back and re-examine the problem. We are given two conditions, but they don't seem to be consistent with each other. The first condition is too complex and may not have a simple solution. The second condition seems to be more straightforward, but it leads to contradictions when trying to find a function that satisfies both conditions.

Let's try a different approach. Instead of trying to find a function that satisfies both conditions, let's try to find a function that satisfies one condition and then check if it also satisfies the other condition.

From the second condition $f(2n) = 2f(n) + 1$, we can see that if $f(n) = n$, then $f(2n) = 2n = 2(n) + 1$. This function satisfies the second condition. Now let's check if it also satisfies the first condition $f(f(f(n))) = 8n - 7$.

If $f(n) = n$, then $f(f(f(n))) = f(f(n)) = f(n) = n$. On the other hand, $8n - 7$. Setting these equal to each other, we have $n = 8n - 7$, which implies $7 = 7n$, and $n = 1$. However, this contradicts with the fact that $f(n) = n$ for all $n$. So this function does not satisfy the first condition.

Let's try another function. If $f(n) = n + 1$, then $f(2n) = 2n + 1 = 2(n + 1) = 2f(n) + 1$, which satisfies the second condition. Now let's check if it also satisfies the first condition $f(f(f(n))) = 8n - 7$.

If $f(n) = n + 1$, then $f(f(f(n))) = f(f(n + 1)) = f(n + 2) = n + 3$. On the other hand, $8n - 7$. Setting these equal to each other, we have $n + 3 = 8n - 7$, which simplifies to $10 = 7n$, and $n = \frac{10}{7}$. But $n$ must be a positive integer, so this function also does not satisfy the first condition.

Let's try one more function. If $f(n) = n - 1$, then $f(2n) = 2n - 1 = 2(n - 1) + 1$, which satisfies the second condition. Now let's check if it also satisfies the first condition $f(f(f(n))) = 8n - 7$.

If $f(n) = n - 1$, then $f(f(f(n))) = f(f(n - 1)) = f(n - 2) = n - 3$. On the other hand, $8n - 7$. Setting these equal to each other, we have $n - 3 = 8n - 7$, which simplifies to $-4 = 7n$, and $n = -\frac{4}{7}$. But $n$ must be a positive integer, so this function also does not satisfy the first condition.

It seems that we have made a mistake in our approach. Let's try a different approach. Instead of trying to find a function that satisfies both conditions, let's try to find a function that satisfies one condition and then check if it also satisfies the other condition.

From the second condition $f(2n) = 2f(n) + 1$, we can see that if $f(n) = n$, then $f(2n) = 2n = 2(n) + 1$. This function satisfies the second condition. Now let

Assistant:

 We can't solve this problem directly because it involves recursive functions and it's not straightforward to write a program to compute it. However, we can use the two given equations to find a pattern and guess a possible function that satisfies these equations.

From the equation $f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$, we can guess that $f(n)=2n+1$. Then we can check if this function satisfies the second equation $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$. If we substitute $f(n)=2n+1$ into the equation, we get:
\[f(2n) = 2(2n+1) + 1 = 4n + 3.\]
On the other hand, if we substitute $2n$ into the expression $f(n)=2n+1$, we get:
\[f(2n) = 2(2n) + 1 = 4n + 1.\]
Clearly, $4n + 3 \neq 4n + 1$, so our guessed function does not satisfy the second equation. 

Let's try another guess. If we guess $f(n)=2n-1$, we can check if it satisfies both equations:
1. For $f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$:
If we substitute $f(n)=2n-1$ into the equation, we get:
\[f(f(f(n))) = f(f(2n-1)) = f(2(2n-1)-1) = f(4n-3) = 8n-7.\]
So, the function $f(n)=2n-1$ satisfies the first equation.
2. For $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$:
If we substitute $f(n)=2n-1$ into the equation, we get:
\[f(2n) = 2(2n-1) + 1 = 4n - 2 + 1 = 4n - 1.\]
And if we substitute $2n$ into the expression $f(n)=2n-1$, we get:
\[f(2n) = 2(2n) - 1 = 4n - 1.\]
So, the function $f(n)=2n-1$ satisfies the second equation as well.

Therefore, we can conclude that the function $f(n)=2n-1$ satisfies both given equations. Now we can find $f(100)$:
\[f(100) = 2(100) - 1 = 200 - 1 = 199.\]
So, $f(100) = 199$. The answer is: $199$

 This problem involves a function $f$ that satisfies two conditions and we are asked to find the value of $f(100)$. The problem seems to be challenging to solve analytically, so a numerical approach might be more suitable. 

One way to approach this problem is to use recursion: we can start with $f(100)$ and apply the function $f$ according to its properties until we reach $f(1)$, at which point we know the value is $1$ (since $f(f(f(1))) = 8*1 - 7 = 1$).

Here is a Python function that implements this recursive approach:

```python


INTERMEDIATE OUT :

def calculate_f(n):
    if n == 1:
        return 1
    elif n % 2 == 0:
        return 2 * calculate_f(n // 2) + 1
    else:
        return 8 * (n - 1) // 7

result = calculate_f(100)
print(result)
```

This problem is challenging because it involves analyzing a function that is defined by its properties rather than by an explicit formula. To solve this problem, we will first try to find the value of $f(1)$ using the second given condition.

Since $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$, setting $n=1$ gives $f(2)=2f(1)+1$. However, we know that $f(f(f(1)))=8(1)-7=1$, and $f(f(f(1)))=f(f(1))$ (because $f$ is applied thrice on $1$, and the result is $1$). So we have $f(f(1))=1$.

If we set $f(1)=x$ in the equation $f(f(1))=1$, we get $f(x)=1$. Substituting $f(x)=1$ into the equation $f(2)=2f(1)+1$ gives $f(2)=2(1)+1=3$.

Now, we can use the second given condition to find $f(3)$: $f(2n)=2f(n)+1 \implies f(6)=2f(3)+1$. Since $f(6)=f(f(f(2)))=f(f(3))$, we have $f(f(3))=2f(3)+1$.

If we set $f(3)=y$ in the equation $f(f(3))=2f(3)+1$, we get $f(y)=2y+1$. Substituting $f(y)=2y+1$ into the equation $f(f(3))=2f(3)+1$ gives $2f(3)+1=2y+1 \implies 2y=2f(3) \implies y=f(3)$.

This means $f(3)=y=f(y)=2y+1$. Substituting $y=3$ gives $f(3)=2(3)+1=7$.

Now, we can use the second given condition to find $f(6)$: $f(2n)=2f(n)+1 \implies f(12)=2f(6)+1$. Since $f(12)=f(f(f(4)))=f(f(6))$, we have $f(f(6))=2f(6)+1$.

If we set $f(6)=z$ in the equation $f(f(6))=2f(6)+1$, we get $f(z)=2z+1$. Substituting $f(z)=2z+1$ into the equation $f(f(6))=2f(6)+1$ gives $2f(6)+1=2z+1 \implies 2z=2f(6) \implies z=f(6)$.

This means $f(6)=z=f(z)=2z+1$. Substituting $z=6$ gives $f(6)=2(6)+1=13$.

Now, we can use the first given condition to find $f(100)$: $f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$. Since $f(f(f(100)))=8(100)-7=793$, we have $f(f(100))=793$.

If we set $f(100)=w$ in the equation $f(f(100))=793$, we get $f(w)=793$. But we know that $f(w)=2w+1$. So we have $2w+1=793 \implies 2w=792 \implies w=396$.

Therefore, $f(100)=396$.
The answer is: $396$

 This problem seems to be very complex and would require a deep understanding of the properties of the function $f$ and how it behaves under certain conditions. It is not feasible to solve this problem directly using Python as it requires a deep mathematical analysis and insight. 

However, based on the provided conditions, we can make an educated guess on the form of the function $f$. If we plug in $n=1$ into the second condition, we get $f(2) = 2f(1) + 1$. If we further plug in $n=2$ into the second condition, we get $f(4) = 2f(2) + 1$. If we continue this process, we will notice that $f(n) = 2n - 1$ satisfies both conditions. This is because if we plug in $f(n) = 2n - 1$ into both conditions, they will hold true. 

Therefore, we can conclude that $f(n) = 2n - 1$ is the function that satisfies the given conditions. Now, we can simply plug in $n=100$ into this function to find $f(100)$.

```python

Assistant: 

Interesting, let's analyze step by step:



We are given the function $f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$. Let's denote $g(n) = f(f(n))$. Then we have $g(g(n)) = 8n - 7$. Now, we can find $g(1)$ by setting $n = 1$ in the equation: $g(g(1)) = 8 \cdot 1 - 7 = 1$. Hence, we have $g(1) = 1$ because the function $g$ is injective (one-to-one).

Now, we are given the second equation: $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$. Let's try to find $f(1)$ using this equation. We know that $f(2) = 2f(1) + 1$. Since $f(1)$ is an integer, $f(2)$ is an odd number. But from the first equation, we know that $f(f(f(1))) = f(f(1)) = 8 \cdot 1 - 7 = 1$. Because $f(f(f(1))) = 1$, we have $f(f(1)) = 1$. So $f(1)$ must be even because $f(f(1))$ is even according to the first equation. But we just proved that $f(2)$ is odd. So $f(1)$ must be equal to $2$ because the only even number that can satisfy both conditions is $2$.

Now we can find $f(100)$ using the second equation: $f(2n) = 2f(n) + 1$. By setting $n = 50$, we have $f(100) = 2f(50) + 1$. But we can't directly find $f(50)$ because we don't have a formula for $f(n)$ in terms of $n$. However, we can use the first equation to find $f(50)$. We have $f(f(f(50))) = 8 \cdot 50 - 7 = 393$. But we know that $f(f(f(50))) = f(f(50)) = f(50)$ because $f(50)$ is also an integer. So we have $f(f(50)) = f(50) = 393$.

Now we can find $f(50)$ by setting $n = 393$ in the first equation: $f(f(f(393))) = 8 \cdot 393 - 7 = 3143$. But we know that $f(f(f(393))) = f(f(393)) = f(393)$ because $f(393)$ is also an integer. So we have $f(f(393)) = f(393) = 3143$. But we know that $f(50) = 3143$. So we can substitute this value into the equation $f(100) = 2f(50) + 1$ to find $f(100)$: $f(100) = 2 \cdot 3143 + 1 = 6287$.

So $f(100) = 6287$. The answer is: $6287$
