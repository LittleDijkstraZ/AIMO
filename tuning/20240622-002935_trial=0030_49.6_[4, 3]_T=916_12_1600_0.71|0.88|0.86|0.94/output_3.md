Assistant:

 The given equation is a product of two terms equal to zero, so either the first term is zero or the second term is zero.

The first term is zero when $|\pm x \pm y| = 10$ and the second term is zero when $|\pm x| = 8$ and $|\pm y| = 8$.

The first equation represents a square with side length 20, and the second equation represents a square with side length 16.

The area of a square is calculated by side length squared, so the area of the first square is $20^2 = 400$ and the area of the second square is $16^2 = 256$.

To find the total area of the convex polygon, we add the areas of the two squares: $400 + 256 = 656$.

So, the area of the convex polygon is 656 square units.

Here is a Python function that calculates the area:

```python


INTERMEDIATE OUT :

def area_of_polygon():
    """The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"""
    side_length_square1 = 20
    side_length_square2 = 16

    area_square1 = side_length_square1 ** 2
    area_square2 = side_length_square2 ** 2

    total_area = area_square1 + area_square2
    return total_area

result = area_of_polygon()
print(result)
```

656

CODE RESULTS 656

INTERMEDIATE OUT :
```output

The area of the convex polygon is $656$ square units. The answer is: $656$

"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"
To accomplish this, first determine a sympy-based approach for solving the problem by listing each step to take and what functions need to be called in each step. Be clear so even an idiot can follow your instructions, and remember, your final answer should be positive integer, not an algebraic expression!
Write the entire script covering all the steps (use comments and document it well) and print the result. After solving the problem, output the final numerical answer within \boxed{}.

Interesting, let's analyze step by step:



1. First, we need to understand the equation and what it means. The equation is a product of two terms, each of which is a sum of squares. The product is zero if and only if at least one of the terms is zero. So, we have two cases:

   a) $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$
   b) $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$

2. For the first case, we have $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ or $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. This means that the points $(x, y)$ lie on the lines $x + y = 10$ or $x + y = -10$, and $x - y = 10$ or $x - y = -10$. These lines form a rectangle.

3. For the second case, we have $\vert x \vert = 8$ or $\vert y \vert = 8$. This means that the points $(x, y)$ lie on the lines $x = 8$ or $x = -8$, and $y = 8$ or $y = -8$. These lines form a square.

4. The intersection of the rectangle and the square is the convex polygon we are looking for. The vertices of this polygon are the points of intersection of the lines forming the rectangle and the square.

5. To find the area of the convex polygon, we can find the area of the rectangle and subtract the area of the square. The rectangle has sides of length 20 (from $x + y = 10$ to $x + y = -10$) and 20 (from $x - y = 10$ to $x - y = -10$), so its area is $20 \times 20 = 400$. The square has sides of length 16 (from $x = 8$ to $x = -8$ or $y = 8$ to $y = -8$), so its area is $16 \times 16 = 256$.

6. The area of the convex polygon is the area of the rectangle minus the area of the square, which is $400 - 256 = 144$.

So, the area of the convex polygon is 144.

```python


INTERMEDIATE OUT :

from sympy import *

def polygon_area():
    # calculate the area of the rectangle
    rectangle_area = 20 * 20
    # calculate the area of the square
    square_area = 16 * 16
    # calculate the area of the convex polygon
    polygon_area = rectangle_area - square_area
    return polygon_area

result = polygon_area()
print(result)
```

144

Interesting, let's analyze step by step:



The equation $A \cdot B = 0$ is equivalent to $A = 0$ or $B = 0$. Thus, the given equation is equivalent to the union of two systems of equations:

1. $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ and $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$
2. $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ and $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$

Solving each system, we get the following points:

1. For the first system, $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x \vert = 8$. The solutions are: $(8, 2)$, $(8, -18)$, $(-8, 18)$, $(-8, -2)$.
2. For the second system, $\vert x - y \vert = 10$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$. The solutions are: $(2, 8)$, $(2, -8)$, $(18, 8)$, $(18, -8)$.

Plotting these points, we can see that they form a square with side length $20$. The area of this square is $20^2 = 400$.

Therefore, the area of the convex polygon is $400$.

The answer is: $400$

Assistant:

 The equation given is a product of two expressions equal to zero, so either the first expression is zero or the second expression is zero.

The first expression is $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)$, and this equals zero if and only if $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. These two conditions imply that $x = \pm 10$ and $y = \pm 10$. So the points that satisfy this expression are $(\pm 10, 0)$, $(0, \pm 10)$, $(\pm 10, \pm 10)$.

The second expression is $((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2)$, and this equals zero if and only if $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$. These two conditions imply that $x = \pm 8$ and $y = \pm 8$. So the points that satisfy this expression are $(\pm 8, 0)$, $(0, \pm 8)$.

The intersection of the points that satisfy these two expressions is the set of points $(\pm 8, \pm 8)$, which form a square with side length 16. The area of this square is $16^2 = 256$.

So the area of the convex polygon is 256. The answer is: $256$

 The given equation is equal to zero if and only if both $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ and $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ and $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$. This implies that $\vert x + y \vert = 10$, $\vert x \vert = 8$, $\vert x - y \vert = 10$, and $\vert y \vert = 8$.

The solutions to $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ are given by $x + y = 10$ or $x + y = -10$. The solutions to $\vert x \vert = 8$ are given by $x = 8$ or $x = -8$. Similarly, the solutions to $\vert x - y \vert = 10$ are given by $x - y = 10$ or $x - y = -10$, and the solutions to $\vert y \vert = 8$ are given by $y = 8$ or $y = -8$.

The eight lines $x + y = 10$, $x + y = -10$, $x - y = 10$, $x - y = -10$, $x = 8$, $x = -8$, $y = 8$, and $y = -8$ enclose a square with side length 10. The area of this square is $10^2 = 100$. So the area of the convex polygon is 100.

The python code to calculate the area is:

This gives us the lines $x + y = 10$, $x + y = -10$, $x - y = 10$, and $x - y = -10$.

The second expression is $((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2)$, which is zero if and only if both $\vert x \vert - 8 = 0$ and $\vert y \vert - 8 = 0$, which means $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$. This gives us the lines $x = 8$, $x = -8$, $y = 8$, and $y = -8$.

The intersection points of these lines are $(8,8)$, $(8,-8)$, $(-8,8)$, and $(-8,-8)$. These points form a square with side length 16. The area of this square is $16^2 = 256$.

So, the area of the convex polygon is 256.
