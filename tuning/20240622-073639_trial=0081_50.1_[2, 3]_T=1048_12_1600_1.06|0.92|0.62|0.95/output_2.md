Below is a math problem you are to solve (positive numerical answer!):
"For how many positive integers $m$ does the equation \[\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}\] have $4$ distinct solutions?"

Assistant:


To solve this problem, we need to understand the properties of the absolute value function and how it affects the number of solutions of the equation.
The equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has four distinct solutions if and only if $\frac{m}{100}$ is a value in the interval $(0, 2)$. This is because the expression on the left side of the equation takes on all values in the interval $[0, 2]$ as $x$ varies over the real numbers, and it takes on each value exactly twice. Therefore, for the equation to have four distinct solutions, the right side must be in the interval $(0, 2)$.

So we need to find the number of positive integers $m$ such that $0 < \frac{m}{100} < 2$. Multiplying all parts of the inequality by $100$, we get $0 < m < 200$. The positive integers $m$ satisfying this inequality are the integers from $1$ to $199$. Therefore, the number of such integers is $199$. So there are $199$ positive integers $m$ for which the equation has four distinct solutions.

Interesting, let's analyze step by step:


The equation $| |x-1|-2|=\frac{m}{100}$ has four distinct solutions. 

First, we know that $|x-1|$ must be either $2+\frac{m}{100}$ or $2-\frac{m}{100}$ for the equation to hold. This gives us two equations:

1. $|x-1|=2+\frac{m}{100}$
2. $|x-1|=2-\frac{m}{100}$

For the first equation, $x-1=2+\frac{m}{100}$ or $x-1=-2-\frac{m}{100}$. The solutions for $x$ are $x=3+\frac{m}{100}$ or $x=-1-\frac{m}{100}$.

For the second equation, $x-1=2-\frac{m}{100}$ or $x-1=-2+\frac{m}{100}$. The solutions for $x$ are $x=3-\frac{m}{100}$ or $x=-1+\frac{m}{100}$.

In total, we have four distinct solutions: $x=3+\frac{m}{100}$, $x=-1-\frac{m}{100}$, $x=3-\frac{m}{100}$, and $x=-1+\frac{m}{100}$.

To ensure that these are distinct, we require that $3+\frac{m}{100} \neq -1-\frac{m}{100}$, $3+\frac{m}{100} \neq 3-\frac{m}{100}$, $3+\frac{m}{100} \neq -1+\frac{m}{100}$, $-1-\frac{m}{100} \neq 3-\frac{m}{100}$, $-1-\frac{m}{100} \neq -1+\frac{m}{100}$, and $3-\frac{m}{100} \neq -1+\frac{m}{100}$.

Solving these inequalities, we find that $m=50$. Therefore, the value of $m$ for which the equation has four distinct solutions is $50$. The answer is: $\boxed{50}$

Interesting, let's analyze step by step:



We know that the equation $| |x-1|-2|=\frac{m}{100}$ has 4 distinct solutions. 

Firstly, let's take into account the expression inside the absolute value: $|x-1|-2$. The absolute value function makes this expression nonnegative, so we must consider two cases:

1. $|x-1|-2$ is positive. Then the equation becomes $|x-1|-2=\frac{m}{100}$.
2. $|x-1|-2$ is negative. Then the equation becomes $-(|x-1|-2)=\frac{m}{100}$.

Now, let's solve these two cases:

1. Solving $|x-1|-2=\frac{m}{100}$:

  We can split this into two sub-cases:

  a. $|x-1|-2$ is positive. This happens when $x-1>2$, or $x>3$. Then we have $x-1-2=\frac{m}{100}$, which simplifies to $x=\frac{m}{100}+3$.
  
  b. $|x-1|-2$ is negative. This happens when $x-1<2$, or $x<3$. Then we have $-(x-1-2)=\frac{m}{100}$, which simplifies to $x=3-\frac{m}{100}$.

2. Solving $-(|x-1|-2)=\frac{m}{100}$:

  This is the same as solving $|x-1|-2=-\frac{m}{100}$, and it will give the same solutions as in case 1, but with the opposite inequality for $x$.

So, we have found four distinct solutions: $x=\frac{m}{100}+3$, $x=3-\frac{m}{100}$, $x=\frac{m}{100}+3-\frac{2m}{100}=3-\frac{m}{50}$, and $x=3-\frac{m}{100}-\frac{2m}{100}=3-\frac{3m}{100}$.

To ensure that these are distinct, we must have $\frac{m}{100}+3 \neq 3-\frac{m}{100}$, $\frac{m}{100}+3 \neq 3-\frac{m}{50}$, $\frac{m}{100}+3 \neq 3-\frac{3m}{100}$, $3-\frac{m}{100} \neq 3-\frac{m}{50}$, $3-\frac{m}{100} \neq 3-\frac{3m}{100}$, and $3-\frac{m}{50} \neq 3-\frac{3m}{100}$.

Solving these inequalities, we find that only $m=50$ satisfies all of them.

Therefore, the positive integer $m$ that makes the equation $| |x-1|-2|=\frac{m}{100}$ have 4 distinct solutions is 50. The answer is: $50$

Interesting, let's analyze step by step:



1. The equation $|\vert x-1 \vert -2|=\frac{m}{100}$ has four distinct solutions. This means that there will be a range of m-values for which this equation will have four distinct solutions. To find the range of m-values, we first need to analyze the behavior of the equation.

2. The equation $|\vert x-1 \vert -2|=\frac{m}{100}$ has four distinct solutions if and only if $0 < \frac{m}{100} \leq 2$. This is because the expression $|\vert x-1 \vert -2|$ can take any value between 0 and 2.

3. To find the range of m-values, we need to multiply each inequality by 100: $0 < m \leq 200$.

4. Therefore, the number of positive integers m in the range $0 < m \leq 200$ is the required solution. We can find this by subtracting the lower limit from the upper limit and adding 1 (since both the lower and upper limits are inclusive).

5. Let's now write the python code to perform these steps:

```python


INTERMEDIATE OUT :

def count_m():
    lower_limit = 1
    upper_limit = 200
    count = upper_limit - lower_limit + 1
    return count

result = count_m()
print(result)
```

This is a challenging problem and requires a deep understanding of the absolute value function and its properties. The number of distinct solutions to the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ depends on the value of $m$. The equation can be solved graphically or by considering the different cases for the absolute value function.

The equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ will have four distinct solutions when $\frac{m}{100}$ is strictly between $1$ and $2$. This means $\frac{m}{100} \in (1,2)$, or equivalently $1 < \frac{m}{100} < 2$. From this inequality, we can find the range of $m$ by multiplying all sides by $100$, yielding $100 < m < 200$. The problem asks for the number of positive integers $m$ in this range, which is simply $200 - 100 - 1 = 99$. So the number of positive integers $m$ for which the equation has four distinct solutions is $99$.

Therefore, the answer is $99$. The Python code to calculate this is:
```python


INTERMEDIATE OUT :

def number_of_m():
    return 200 - 100 - 1

result = number_of_m()

Interesting, let's analyze step by step:



First, we need to know that the equation $||x-1|-2|=\frac{m}{100}$ has 4 distinct solutions. 

This equation is equivalent to the two cases: 

1. $|x-1|-2=\frac{m}{100}$,
2. $-(|x-1|-2)=\frac{m}{100}$ or $|x-1|-2=-\frac{m}{100}$.

We solve each case separately:

1. For the first case $|x-1|-2=\frac{m}{100}$, we have two sub-cases:

   a. $x-1-2=\frac{m}{100}$ or $x-3=\frac{m}{100}$, so $x=3+\frac{m}{100}$.

   b. $-(x-1)-2=\frac{m}{100}$ or $-x+1-2=\frac{m}{100}$, so $x=1-2-\frac{m}{100}$ or $x=-1-\frac{m}{100}$.

2. For the second case $|x-1|-2=-\frac{m}{100}$, we have two sub-cases:

   a. $x-1-2=-\frac{m}{100}$ or $x-3=-\frac{m}{100}$, so $x=3-\frac{m}{100}$.

   b. $-(x-1)-2=-\frac{m}{100}$ or $-x+1-2=-\frac{m}{100}$, so $x=1-2+\frac{m}{100}$ or $x=-1+\frac{m}{100}$.

For the equation $|x-1|-2=\frac{m}{100}$ to have 4 distinct solutions, we need to make sure that none of the solutions for the first case coincide with any of the solutions for the second case. This is equivalent to the conditions:

1. $3+\frac{m}{100} \neq 3-\frac{m}{100}$,
2. $3+\frac{m}{100} \neq -1+\frac{m}{100}$,
3. $3+\frac{m}{100} \neq -1-\frac{m}{100}$,
4. $-1-\frac{m}{100} \neq 3-\frac{m}{100}$,
5. $-1-\frac{m}{100} \neq -1+\frac{m}{100}$.

After checking these conditions, we find that they are all satisfied when $m=50$.

Therefore, the only positive integer $m$ for which the equation $||x-1|-2|=\frac{m}{100}$ has 4 distinct solutions is $m=50$. The answer is: $50$
