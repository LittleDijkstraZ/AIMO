Below is a math problem you are to solve (positive numerical answer):
"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"
To accomplish this, first determine a sympy-based approach for solving the problem by listing each step to take and what functions need to be called in each step. Be clear so even an idiot can follow your instructions, and remember, your final answer should be positive integer, not an algebraic expression!
Write the entire script covering all the steps (use comments and document it well) and print the result. After solving the problem, output the final numerical answer within \boxed{}.

Assistant: 

Interesting, let's analyze step by step:



1. The equation is satisfied if either $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$.
2. These conditions are satisfied if and only if either $|x + y| = 10$, $|x - y| = 10$, $|x| = 8$, or $|y| = 8$.
3. These conditions define a square with side length 16 centered at the origin.
4. The area of this square is $16^2 = 256$.

So the area of the convex polygon is 256.

```python


INTERMEDIATE OUT :

from sympy import *

def area_of_polygon():
    """The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"""
    # The square has side length 16
    side_length = 16

    # Calculate the area of the square
    area = side_length**2

    return area

result = area_of_polygon()
print(result)
```

256

Assistant:

 The given equation is a product of two expressions equal to zero, which means that either the first expression is zero or the second expression is zero. 

The first expression is $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)$, and it equals to zero if and only if $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. These two equations represent two squares with side length 10, centered at the origin, and aligned with the x and y axes respectively. Their intersection is the set of points that satisfy both equations, which forms a square with side length 10 and area $10^2 = 100$.

The second expression is $((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2)$, and it equals to zero if and only if $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$. These two equations represent two squares with side length 16, centered at the origin, and aligned with the x and y axes respectively. Their intersection is the set of points that satisfy both equations, which forms a square with side length 16 and area $16^2 = 256$.

However, the area of the convex polygon formed by the intersection of these two squares is the area of the smaller square, which is 100. So the area of the convex polygon is 100.

```python


INTERMEDIATE OUT :

def polygon_area():
    """The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"""
    # The area of the convex polygon is the area of the smaller square
    side_length = 10
    area = side_length ** 2
    return area

result = polygon_area()
print(result)
```

100

The area of the convex polygon is $100$. The answer is: $100$.

Assistant:

 The given equation is a product of two expressions equal to zero, so either the first expression is zero or the second expression is zero.

The first expression is $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)$. This expression is zero if and only if both $\vert x + y \vert - 10 = 0$ and $\vert x - y \vert - 10 = 0$, which means $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. These equations imply that $x + y = \pm 10$ and $x - y = \pm 10$. Solving these equations, we get the vertices of the polygon as $(0, 10)$, $(0, -10)$, $(10, 0)$, and $(-10, 0)$.

The second expression is $((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2)$. This expression is zero if and only if both $\vert x \vert - 8 = 0$ and $\vert y \vert - 8 = 0$, which means $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$. These equations imply that $x = \pm 8$ and $y = \pm 8$. Solving these equations, we get the vertices of the polygon as $(8, 8)$, $(8, -8)$, $(-8, 8)$, and $(-8, -8)$.

The polygon formed by these vertices is a square with side length 10. The area of this square is $10^2 = 100$.

So, the area of the convex polygon is 100. The answer is: $100$

Write the entire script covering all the steps (use comments and document it well) and print the result. After solving the problem, output the final numerical answer within \boxed{}.

Assistant: 

Interesting, let's analyze step by step:



1. First, we need to understand the given equation: $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$.

2. The product of two factors equals zero if and only if at least one of the factors equals zero. Therefore, we have two cases:

   a) $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$
   b) $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$

3. For case (a) to be true, both $\vert x + y \vert - 10 = 0$ and $\vert x - y \vert - 10 = 0$, which implies $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. This means $x + y = \pm 10$ and $x - y = \pm 10$. Solving these equations, we get the vertices of the polygon as $(0, 10)$, $(0, -10)$, $(10, 0)$, and $(-10, 0)$.

4. For case (b) to be true, both $\vert x \vert - 8 = 0$ and $\vert y \vert - 8 = 0$, which implies $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$. This means $x = \pm 8$ and $y = \pm 8$. Solving these equations, we get the vertices of the polygon as $(8, 8)$, $(8, -8)$, $(-8, 8)$, and $(-8, -8)$.

5. Combining both cases, we get the vertices of the polygon as $(0, 10)$, $(0, -10)$, $(10, 0)$, $(-10, 0)$, $(8, 8)$, $(8, -8)$, $(-8, 8)$, and $(-8, -8)$.

6. Now, we can calculate the area of the polygon. The polygon is a square with side length 10 (from the vertices $(0, 10)$, $(0, -10)$, $(10, 0)$, and $(-10, 0$)) and a smaller square with side length 8 (from the vertices $(8, 8)$, $(8, -8)$, $(-8, 8)$, and $(-8, -8$)). The area of the larger square is $10^2 = 100$ and the area of the smaller square is $8^2 = 64$.

7. The area of the convex polygon is the difference of the areas of the two squares, which is $100 - 64 = 36$.

So, the area of the convex polygon is 36.

```python


INTERMEDIATE OUT :

def polygon_area():
    # Calculate the area of the larger square
    area_larger_square = 10**2

    # Calculate the area of the smaller square
    area_smaller_square = 8**2

    # Calculate the area of the convex polygon
    area_convex_polygon = area_larger_square - area_smaller_square

    return area_convex_polygon

result = polygon_area()
print(result)
```

36

CODE RESULTS 36

INTERMEDIATE OUT :
```output

```
The area of the convex polygon is $36$. The answer is $\boxed{36}$.

Interesting, let's analyze step by step:



1. The expression $A = ((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2)$ is equal to zero if and only if at least one of the factors is equal to zero.

2. The factor $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)$ is equal to zero if and only if $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. These two equations represent two squares being equal to 100, so their solutions are all points in the plane that are at a distance of 10 from the origin in both the x+y and x-y directions. These are the vertices of a square with side length 20 and centered at the origin.

3. The factor $((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2)$ is equal to zero if and only if $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$. These two equations represent a square with side length 16 and centered at the origin.

4. The intersection of these two squares is a smaller square with side length 8 and centered at the origin.

5. To find the area of this square, we simply square the length of its side, so the area is $8^2 = 64$.

So the area of the convex polygon is 64. The answer is: $64$

 The equation $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + (\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ implies that $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. These two equations are only satisfied when $x = \pm 10$ and $y = \pm 10$. Similarly, the equation $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + (\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ implies that $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$, which are satisfied when $x = \pm 8$ and $y = \pm 8$. Therefore, the points that satisfy the given equation are $(\pm 10, \pm 10)$ and $(\pm 8, \pm 8)$. These points form a square with side length 20. The area of this square is $20^2 = 400$. So, the area of the convex polygon is 400.

2. Each of these equations is satisfied if $\vert x + y \vert = 10$, $\vert x - y \vert = 10$, $\vert x \vert = 8$, or $\vert y \vert = 8$.

3. Solving these equations gives us the vertices of the polygon: $(8,0)$, $(0,8)$, $(-8,0)$, $(0,-8)$, $(8,10)$, $(10,8)$, $(-8,-10)$, and $(-10,-8)$.

4. To find the area of the polygon, we can divide it into four right triangles and one square.

5. The side length of the square is 10, so its area is $10^2 = 100$.

6. Each right triangle has legs of length 8 and 10, so its area is $\frac{1}{2} \cdot 8 \cdot 10 = 40$.

7. Since there are four right triangles, their total area is $4 \cdot 40 = 160$.

8. The total area of the polygon is the sum of the area of the square and the total area of the right triangles, which is $100 + 160 = 260$.

So, the area of the convex polygon is 260. The answer is: $260$

Interesting, let's analyze step by step:



The expression $A \cdot B = 0$ is true if and only if $A = 0$ or $B = 0$. Therefore, the given equation is satisfied if either of the following two conditions is met:

1. $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$
2. $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$

For the first condition to be met, we must have $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. This implies that $x + y = \pm 10$ and $x - y = \pm 10$. Solving these equations, we find that the points that satisfy this condition are $(5,5)$, $(5,-5)$, $(-5,5)$, and $(-5,-5)$.

For the second condition to be met, we must have $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$. This implies that $x = \pm 8$ and $y = \pm 8$. Solving these equations, we find that the points that satisfy this condition are $(8,8)$, $(8,-8)$, $(-8,8)$, and $(-8,-8)$.

The points that satisfy either condition are the vertices of a square with side length 10. Therefore, the area of the square is $10^2 = 100$. The answer is: $100$
