Below is a math problem you are to solve (positive numerical answer):
"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"
To accomplish this, first determine a sympy-based approach for solving the problem by listing each step to take and what functions need to be called in each step. Be clear so even an idiot can follow your instructions, and remember, your final answer should be positive integer, not an algebraic expression!
Write the entire script covering all the steps (use comments and document it well) and print the result. After solving the problem, output the final numerical answer within \boxed{}.

Assistant: 

Interesting, let's analyze step by step:



1. The expression equals zero if either of the two terms equals zero. So we have two sets of equations to solve: $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ and $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$, and $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ and $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$.

2. Solving these equations, we get the following solutions: $(x, y) = (8, 8), (8, -8), (-8, 8), (-8, -8), (10, 0), (0, 10), (-10, 0), (0, -10)$.

3. These points are the vertices of a square with side length 16.

4. The area of the square is side length squared, which is $16^2 = 256$.

So the area of the convex polygon is 256. The answer is: $256$

Interesting, let's analyze step by step:



The equation $A \cdot B = 0$ implies that either $A = 0$ or $B = 0$. Thus, either of the two groups of absolute values must equal 10 for the first part to work, or both $|x|$ and $|y|$ must equal 8 for the second part to work. This means that the polygon is the union of two squares: one with side length 16, and another with side length 20. The area of the polygon is thus $16^2 + 20^2$.

    # Side lengths of the squares

    side2 = 20

"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"
Analyze this problem and think step by step to come to a solution with programs. After solving the problem, output the final numerical answer within \boxed{}.

Assistant:

 The equation is of the form $A \cdot B = 0$, which means that either $A = 0$ or $B = 0$. This gives us two cases to consider:

1. $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$. This implies that $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. These are two equations of lines in the plane, and they form a square with side length $20$. The area of this square is $400$.

2. $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$. This implies that $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$. These are two equations of lines in the plane, and they form a square with side length $16$. The area of this square is $256$.

Therefore, the area of the convex polygon is the sum of the areas of these two squares, which is $400 + 256 = 656$. So the answer is:

```python


INTERMEDIATE OUT :

def area_of_polygon():
    """The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"""
    area_square1 = 400
    area_square2 = 256
    total_area = area_square1 + area_square2
    return total_area

result = area_of_polygon()
print(result)
```

656

The area of the convex polygon is $656$. The answer is: $656$ square units.

"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"
Analyze this problem and think step by step to come to a solution with programs. After solving the problem, output the final numerical answer within \boxed{}.

Assistant:

 The given equation is a product of two terms equal to zero. This means that either the first term is zero or the second term is zero. 

The first term is $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)$ and the second term is $((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2)$. 

If the first term is zero, then $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. This means that $x + y = \pm 10$ and $x - y = \pm 10$. Solving these equations gives us the lines $y = x \pm 10$ and $y = -x \pm 10$.

If the second term is zero, then $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$. This means that $x = \pm 8$ and $y = \pm 8$. Solving these equations gives us the lines $x = 8$, $x = -8$, $y = 8$, and $y = -8$.

The intersection of these lines forms a square with side length 16. Therefore, the area of the square is $16^2 = 256$.
The answer is: $256$

Assistant:

 The given equation is equal to zero if and only if both $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ and $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$, or both $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ and $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$.
The first pair of equations implies $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$, which means $x + y = \pm 10$ and $x - y = \pm 10$.
The second pair of equations implies $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$, which means $x = \pm 8$ and $y = \pm 8$.
Plotting these points on a coordinate plane, we can see that they form a square with side length 16.
The area of this square is $16^2 = 256$. The answer is: $256$

Interesting, let's analyze step by step:



The product of two numbers is zero if and only if at least one of the numbers is zero. So, in our problem, we can say that:
\[((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2) = 0 \quad \text{or} \quad ((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0.\]

From the first equation, we have $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$.
This means that either $x + y = 10$ or $x + y = -10$, and either $x - y = 10$ or $x - y = -10$.
Solving these equations, we find that the points lie on the lines $x + y = 10$ and $x - y = 10$, or $x + y = -10$ and $x - y = -10$.

From the second equation, we have $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$.
This means that either $x = 8$ or $x = -8$, and either $y = 8$ or $y = -8$.
Solving these equations, we find that the points lie on the lines $x = 8$ and $y = 8$, or $x = -8$ and $y = -8$.

The four lines intersect at the points $(8,8)$, $(8,-8)$, $(-8,8)$, and $(-8,-8)$.
These points form a square with side length $16$, so its area is $16^2 = 256$.
The area of the convex polygon formed by these points is $256$. The answer is: $256$
