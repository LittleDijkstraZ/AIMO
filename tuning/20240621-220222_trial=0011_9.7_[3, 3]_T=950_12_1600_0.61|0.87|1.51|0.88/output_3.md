Below is a math problem you are to solve (positive numerical answer!):
"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"

Assistant:

 The equation $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ implies that $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. This means that $x + y = \pm 10$ and $x - y = \pm 10$. Solving these equations gives us the vertices of the square: $(8, 2)$, $(8, -2)$, $(-8, -2)$, and $(-8, 2)$.

Similarly, the equation $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ implies that $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$. This means that $x = \pm 8$ and $y = \pm 8$. So we get the vertices of the square: $(8, 8)$, $(8, -8)$, $(-8, -8)$, and $(-8, 8)$.

The convex polygon formed by the intersection of these two squares is a square with side length $8$. The area of this square is $8^2 = 64$. So the area of the convex polygon is 64 square units.

The answer is: $64$

Interesting, let's analyze step by step:



1. First, we need to understand the given equation. It's a product of two terms equal to zero. This means that either the first term is zero or the second term is zero.

2. The first term is $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)$. This term equals zero if and only if both $(\vert x + y \vert - 10) = 0$ and $(\vert x - y \vert - 10) = 0$. This implies that $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. The only way this can happen is if $x = y = 5$ or $x = -y = -5$. So the first term equals zero if and only if $(x, y)$ is either $(5, 5)$ or $(-5, 5)$.

3. The second term is $((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2)$. This term equals zero if and only if both $(\vert x \vert - 8) = 0$ and $(\vert y \vert - 8) = 0$. This implies that $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$. The only way this can happen is if $x = 8$ or $x = -8$ and $y = 8$ or $y = -8$. So the second term equals zero if and only if $(x, y)$ is either $(8, 8)$, $(8, -8)$, $(-8, 8)$, or $(-8, -8)$.

4. Now we know that the points satisfying the equation are $(5, 5)$, $(5, -5)$, $(-5, 5)$, $(-5, -5)$, $(8, 8)$, $(8, -8)$, $(-8, 8)$, or $(-8, -8)$. These points form a square with side length 10.

5. The area of this square is side length squared, which is $10^2 = 100$.

So the area of the convex polygon is 100. The answer is: $100$

 The given equation is a product of two expressions equal to zero. This means that either the first expression is zero or the second expression is zero.

The first expression is $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)$, and it equals zero if and only if $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. This implies that $x + y = \pm 10$ and $x - y = \pm 10$. Solving these equations, we get the vertices of the polygon as $(0, 10)$, $(0, -10)$, $(10, 0)$, $(-10, 0)$, $(8, 2)$, $(8, -2)$, $(-8, 2)$, and $(-8, -2)$.

The second expression is $((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2)$, and it equals zero if and only if $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$. This implies that $x = \pm 8$ and $y = \pm 8$.

The points satisfying either of these conditions form a square with side length $16$.

Therefore, the area of the convex polygon is the area of this square, which is $16^2 = 256$. The answer is: $256$

Interesting, let's analyze step by step:



1. The equation is $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + (\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + (\vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$. The product of two terms equals zero if and only if at least one of the terms is zero. Therefore, we have two cases to consider:

   a) $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$. This implies $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. The solutions to these equations are all points $(x, y)$ that lie on the lines $x + y = 10$ and $x - y = 10$.

   b) $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$. This implies $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$. The solutions to these equations are all points $(x, y)$ that lie on the lines $x = 8$ and $y = 8$.

2. The lines $x + y = 10$, $x - y = 10$, $x = 8$, and $y = 8$ form a rectangle.

3. To find the dimensions of the rectangle, we can find the intersections of the lines. The intersection of $x + y = 10$ and $x - y = 10$ is found by adding the two equations, giving $2x = 20$, so $x = 10$ and $y = 0$. The intersection of $x + y = 10$ and $x = 8$ is found by substituting $x = 8$ into the first equation, giving $8 + y = 10$, so $y = 2$. The intersection of $x - y = 10$ and $x = 8$ is found by substituting $x = 8$ into the second equation, giving $8 - y = 10$, so $y = -2$. The intersection of $x - y = 10$ and $y = 8$ is found by substituting $y = 8$ into the second equation, giving $x - 8 = 10$, so $x = 18$.

4. Therefore, the rectangle has vertices at $(8, 2)$, $(8, -2)$, $(18, 0)$, and $(0, 8)$.

5. To find the area of the rectangle, we can use the formula for the area of a rectangle, which is the product of the lengths of its sides. The length of the side along the x-axis is the difference in the x-coordinates of the points $(8, 2)$ and $(0, 8)$, which is $18 - 8 = 10$. The length of the side along the y-axis is the difference in the y-coordinates of the points $(8, 2)$ and $(8, -2)$, which is $2 - (-2) = 4$.

6. Therefore, the area of the rectangle is $10 \times 4 = 40$.

So, the area of the convex polygon is 40. The answer is: $40$

Interesting, let's analyze step by step:



The expression $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + (\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ implies that $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. This means that $x + y = \pm 10$ and $x - y = \pm 10$. Solving these equations gives us four lines: $x + y = 10$, $x + y = -10$, $x - y = 10$, and $x - y = -10$.

Similarly, the expression $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + (\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ implies that $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$. This means that $x = \pm 8$ and $y = \pm 8$. This gives us four lines: $x = 8$, $x = -8$, $y = 8$, and $y = -8$.

The intersection of these lines forms a square with side length 10 (the distance between the lines $x + y = 10$ and $x + y = -10$, or $x - y = 10$ and $x - y = -10$). The area of this square is $10^2 = 100$.

So, the area of the convex polygon is 100.

The answer is: $100$

"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"

 The equation given is a product of two expressions equal to zero. This means that either the first expression is zero or the second expression is zero. 

The first expression is $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)$ and the second expression is $((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2)$.

If the first expression is zero, then $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. This implies that $x + y = \pm 10$ and $x - y = \pm 10$. Solving these equations gives us the vertices of a square with side length 10.

If the second expression is zero, then $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$. This implies that $x = \pm 8$ and $y = \pm 8$. Solving these equations gives us the vertices of a square with side length 16.

The total area of the convex polygon is the sum of the areas of these two squares. The area of a square is given by the square of the length of its side, so the area of the first square is $10^2 = 100$ and the area of the second square is $16^2 = 256$. Therefore, the total area of the convex polygon is $100 + 256 = 356$.

So, the area of the convex polygon is 356. The answer is: $356$

 The given equation is a product of two expressions equal to zero, so either the first expression is zero or the second expression is zero. This means that the points that satisfy the equation are either on the curve defined by the first expression being zero or on the curve defined by the second expression being zero.

The first expression is $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2) = 0$. This expression is zero if and only if both $(\vert x + y \vert - 10) = 0$ and $(\vert x - y \vert - 10) = 0$. This means that $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. Solving these equations gives us the lines $x + y = \pm 10$ and $x - y = \pm 10$.

The second expression is $((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$. This expression is zero if and only if both $(\vert x \vert - 8) = 0$ and $(\vert y \vert - 8) = 0$. This means that $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$. Solving these equations gives us the lines $x = \pm 8$ and $y = \pm 8$.

The four lines $x + y = \pm 10$, $x - y = \pm 10$, $x = \pm 8$, and $y = \pm 8$ enclose a rectangle with side lengths 20 and 16. The area of this rectangle is $20 \times 16 = 320$.

So the area of the convex polygon is 320. The answer is: $320$

 The given equation is a product of two expressions equal to zero, so either the first expression is zero or the second expression is zero.
The first expression is zero when either $|x+y| - 10 = 0$ or $|x-y| - 10 = 0$.
This means $|x+y| = 10$ or $|x-y| = 10$.
The second expression is zero when either $|x| - 8 = 0$ or $|y| - 8 = 0$.
This means $|x| = 8$ or $|y| = 8$.
The solutions to these equations are the vertices of a square with side length 16.
To find the area of this square, we simply square the length of one side: $16^2 = 256$.
So the area of the convex polygon is 256 square units.

Interesting, let's analyze step by step:



1. The product of two numbers is zero if and only if at least one of the numbers is zero. Therefore, we have two cases to consider:
   a) $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$
   b) $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$

2. For case a), we have $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ or $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. This gives us four lines in the plane: $x + y = 10$, $x + y = -10$, $x - y = 10$, and $x - y = -10$.

3. For case b), we have $\vert x \vert = 8$ or $\vert y \vert = 8$. This gives us four lines in the plane: $x = 8$, $x = -8$, $y = 8$, and $y = -8$.

4. The intersection of these lines forms a square with side length 10.

5. The area of this square is $10^2 = 100$.

So the area of the convex polygon is 100. The answer is: $100$

The equation is $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + (\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + (\vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$.

The product of two numbers is zero if and only if at least one of the numbers is zero. Therefore, either $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + (\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + (\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$.

For the first equation to be zero, it must be the case that both $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ and $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$. This implies that $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. The only way this can happen is if $x = y = 5$ or $x = -y = -5$.

For the second equation to be zero, it must be the case that both $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ and $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$. This implies that $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$. The only way this can happen is if $x = 8$ or $x = -8$, and $y = 8$ or $y = -8$.

Therefore, the points that satisfy the equation are $(5, 5)$, $(-5, -5)$, $(8, 8)$, $(-8, -8)$, $(8, -8)$, and $(-8, 8)$. These points form a square with side length 10, so the area of the square is $10^2 = 100$. The answer is: $100$
