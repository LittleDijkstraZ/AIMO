Below is a math problem you are to solve (positive numerical answer!):
"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"
Analyze this problem and think step by step to come to a solution with programs. After solving the problem, output the final numerical answer within \boxed{}.

Assistant:

 The given equation is equal to zero if either of the factors is zero. This means that either $|x+y| - 10 = 0$, $|x-y| - 10 = 0$, $|x| - 8 = 0$, or $|y| - 8 = 0$. 

Solving each of these equations:

1. $|x+y| - 10 = 0$ gives $|x+y| = 10$, so $x+y = \pm 10$.
2. $|x-y| - 10 = 0$ gives $|x-y| = 10$, so $x-y = \pm 10$.
3. $|x| - 8 = 0$ gives $|x| = 8$, so $x = \pm 8$.
4. $|y| - 8 = 0$ gives $|y| = 8$, so $y = \pm 8$.

These equations form a rectangle with vertices at $(\pm 8, \pm 8)$. The length and width of the rectangle are both 16, so the area of the rectangle is $16 \times 16 = 256$. 

Therefore, the area of the convex polygon is 256.
The answer is: 256

Below is a math problem you are to solve (positive numerical answer!):
"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"

The expression $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2)$ is equal to zero if and only if either of the following two conditions holds:

1. $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ and $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ and $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$.
2. $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ and $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ and $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$.

From the first condition, we have $\vert x + y \vert = 10$, $\vert x \vert = 8$, and $\vert y \vert = 8$. This gives us the vertices of the square with side length 8: $(8, 0)$, $(0, 8)$, $(-8, 0)$, and $(0, -8)$.

From the second condition, we have $\vert x - y \vert = 10$, $\vert x \vert = 8$, and $\vert y \vert = 8$. This gives us the vertices of the square with side length 8: $(8, 0)$, $(0, 8)$, $(-8, 0)$, and $(0, -8)$.

Therefore, the points satisfying the given equation enclose a square with side length 8. The area of this square is $8^2 = 64$. The answer is: $64$

Below is a math problem you are to solve (positive numerical answer!):
"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"

This problem requires a deep understanding of absolute value and algebraic expressions. The equation given, $ ((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0 $, is equal to zero if either of the two factors is equal to zero. This implies that either:

1. $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$
2. $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$

For the first factor to be zero, both $\vert x + y \vert - 10 = 0$ and $\vert x - y \vert - 10 = 0$, which implies that $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. This means that the points $(x, y)$ lie on a square with side length 20.

For the second factor to be zero, both $\vert x \vert - 8 = 0$ and $\vert y \vert - 8 = 0$, which implies that $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$. This means that the points $(x, y)$ lie on a square with side length 16.

The intersection of these two squares is the convex polygon we are looking for. The side length of this polygon is the minimum of the side lengths of the two squares, which is 16. The area of a square with side length $s$ is $s^2$, so the area of this convex polygon is $16^2 = 256$.

So the area of the convex polygon is 256 square units.

Here is a Python function that calculates the area:
```python


INTERMEDIATE OUT :

def polygon_area():
    """The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"""
    side_length_square1 = 20
    side_length_square2 = 16
    side_length_polygon = min(side_length_square1, side_length_square2)
    area_polygon = side_length_polygon ** 2
    return area_polygon

result = polygon_area()
print(result)
```

CODE RESULTS 256

INTERMEDIATE OUT :
```output
256
```
The area of the convex polygon is 256 square units. The answer is $\boxed{256}$.

"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"
Analyze this problem and think step by step to come to a solution with programs. After solving the problem, output the final numerical answer within \boxed{}.

Assistant:

 The given equation is equal to zero if and only if either $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$, $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$, $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$, or $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$.
This implies that $\vert x + y \vert = 10$, $\vert x - y \vert = 10$, $\vert x \vert = 8$, or $\vert y \vert = 8$.
The solutions to $\vert x + y \vert = 10$, $\vert x - y \vert = 10$, $\vert x \vert = 8$, and $\vert y \vert = 8$ are the vertices of the polygon.
By drawing these lines on the coordinate plane, we can see that the vertices of the polygon are $(-8, -8), (-8, 8), (8, -8), (8, 8)$.
To find the area of the polygon, we can calculate the area of a square with side length $16$ and subtract the areas of the four right triangles with legs of length $8$ each.
The area of the square is $16^2 = 256$, and the area of each right triangle is $\frac{1}{2}(8)(8) = 32$.
So the area of the polygon is $256 - 4(32) = 256 - 128 = 128$. The answer is: $128$

Below is a math problem you are to solve (positive numerical answer!):
"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"

Assistant:

 The equation $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ is true if either of the two factors is equal to zero. 
The first factor will be zero if $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ or $\vert x - y \vert = 10$, which are the equations of two circles in the coordinate plane.
The second factor will be zero if $\vert x \vert = 8$ or $\vert y \vert = 8$, which are the equations of two more circles in the coordinate plane.
The intersection of these four circles is a square with side length 16, so the area of the convex polygon is $16^2 = 256$. The answer is: $256$
