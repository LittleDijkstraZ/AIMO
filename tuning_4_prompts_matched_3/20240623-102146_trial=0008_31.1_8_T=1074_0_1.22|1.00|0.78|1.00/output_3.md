"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"

 To solve this problem, we need to understand the equation and the conditions it imposes on $x$ and $y$. The equation is a product of two squares, which is equal to zero. This means that either one of the factors is zero. 

For the first factor, we have the equations:
$$(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0 \quad \text{and} \quad (\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0.$$
This implies that $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. The only way for these conditions to hold is if $x = y = \pm 10$ or $x = -y = \pm 10$. These are the coordinates of four points: $(10, 10)$, $(10, -10)$, $(-10, 10)$, and $(-10, -10)$.

For the second factor, we have the equations:
$$(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0 \quad \text{and} \quad (\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0.$$
This implies that $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$. The only way for these conditions to hold is if $x = \pm 8$ and $y = \pm 8$. These are the coordinates of the four points: $(8, 8)$, $(8, -8)$, $(-8, 8)$, and $(-8, -8)$.

The points that satisfy the equation are all eight of these points. The convex polygon they enclose is a square with side length of 20 units (the diagonal of a square with side length 8 units), so its area is $\frac{20^2}{2} = 100$ square units. Therefore, the area of the convex polygon is 100 square units.

The answer is: $100$

Below is a math problem you are to solve (positive numerical answer!):
"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"

Assistant:


We first need to understand the logic behind the problem. The expression equals $0$ if any of the terms equal $0$.
The first term equals $0$ if either $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ or $\vert x - y \vert = 10$.
The second term equals $0$ if either $\vert x \vert = 8$ or $\vert y \vert = 8$.
So, any point $(x, y)$ that satisfies one of these conditions is part of the polygon.
The points $\left(x, y\right)$ that satisfy $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ are on a square with side length $10$ and vertices at $(\pm 5, 0)$, $(0, \pm 5)$.
The points $\left(x, y\right)$ that satisfy $\vert x - y \vert = 10$ are on a square with side length $10$ and vertices at $(\pm 5, 0)$, $(0, \pm 5)$.
The points $\left(x, y\right)$ that satisfy $\vert x \vert = 8$ are on a square with side length $16$ and vertices at $(\pm 8, 0)$, $(0, \pm 8)$.
The points $\left(x, y\right)$ that satisfy $\vert y \vert = 8$ are on a square with side length $16$ and vertices at $(\pm 8, 0)$, $(0, \pm 8)$.
The intersection of these four squares is the convex polygon we are looking for.
The area of this polygon is the sum of the areas of the squares minus the overlap area.
The area of each square with side length $10$ is $10^2 = 100$, and the area of each square with side length $16$ is $16^2 = 256$.
The overlap area is the area of the square with side length $10$, which is $10^2 = 100$.
So, the area of the convex polygon is $4 \cdot 100 + 4 \cdot 256 - 4 \cdot 100 = 1000$.
The answer is $\boxed{1000}$.

Below is a math problem you are to solve (positive numerical answer!):
"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"
Analyze this problem and think step by step to come to a solution with programs. After solving the problem, output the final numerical answer within \boxed{}.

Assistant:

 The given equation is $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$.
For the product of two factors to be zero, either one or both of the factors must be zero.

So we have two cases:

1. $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$
This implies $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$.
Solving these equations gives us the lines $x + y = \pm 10$ and $x - y = \pm 10$.

2. $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$
This implies $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$.
Solving these equations gives us the lines $x = \pm 8$ and $y = \pm 8$.

Plotting these lines on a coordinate plane, we find that they form a square with side length 16. The area of the square is $16^2 = 256$.

So the area of the convex polygon is 256 square units. The answer is:

```
    The area of the convex polygon is: 256
```
With the value in the answer section, the answer is $256$ square units. In the context of this problem, we are calculating the area of a square. The square is formed by the intersection of the lines $x+y=\pm10$, $x-y=\pm10$, $x=\pm8$, and $y=\pm8$. The side length of the square is 16 units, giving an area of $16^2=256$. So the area of the convex polygon, in this case the square, is 256 square units. The answer is: $256$.

"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"

 The product of two factors equals zero if and only if at least one of the factors equals zero. Therefore, the given equation is equivalent to the following system of equations:
1. $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$
2. $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$
3. $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$
4. $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$

From equation 1, we have $\vert x + y \vert = 10$. From equation 2, we have $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. From equation 3, we have $\vert x \vert = 8$. From equation 4, we have $\vert y \vert = 8$.

The solutions to the first two equations are:
- $x + y = 10$ and $x - y = 10$; these give the points $(5, 5)$ and $(10, 0)$, respectively.
- $x + y = -10$ and $x - y = -10$; these give the points $(-5, -5)$ and $(0, -10)$, respectively.

The solutions to the last two equations are:
- $x = 8$ and $y = 8$; this gives the point $(8, 8)$.
- $x = -8$ and $y = -8$; this gives the point $(-8, -8)$.

The points $(5, 5)$, $(10, 0)$, $(-5, -5)$, $(0, -10)$, $(8, 8)$, and $(-8, -8)$ form a hexagon.

To find the area of this hexagon, we can divide it into two rectangles and a square.

The two rectangles have dimensions $10 \times 8$, so each has area $80$. The square has side length $10$, so its area is $100$.

The total area of the hexagon is $2(80) + 100 = 260$. The answer is the last computed numerical value. So, the area of the convex polygon is $\boxed{260}$.

Remember that the area of a rectangle is given by length x width and the area of a square is given by side x side (or side^2). Also, when using absolute values remember that the absolute value of a number gives the non-negative value of that number. So if you have an equation involving absolute values, you should have two equations since the expression inside the absolute value can be either positive or negative.
The answer is: $260$.

 This problem involves the theory of absolute values and inequalities, as well as the understanding of the properties of the square function.

When analyzing the expression $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$, we note that the product of two numbers is zero if and only if one of the numbers is zero. This implies that either 
1. $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$, $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$, $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$, $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$,
or 
2. $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$, or $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$.
The first option corresponds to the point being $(8, 8)$, and the other two options do not yield real solutions for $(x, y)$.
So the only solution that gives real coordinates is $(8, 8)$. 
This implies that the only point that satisfies the given equation is $(8, 8)$. Thus, the enclosed convex polygon is a single point with coordinates $(8, 8)$. The area of a single point is 0. Hence, the area of the convex polygon is 0. 

Here is the final solution: 0.

Here is a python code to calculate the area, according to the mathematical reasoning. But remember, the area of the polygon is 0.
```python


INTERMEDIATE OUT :

def polygon_area():
    """The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"""
    return 0

result = polygon_area()

"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"

Assistant:


The equation $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + (\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + (\vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ will be equal to zero if and only if at least one of the factors is zero. This means that either $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + (\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + (\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$. 

The first factor will be zero if and only if $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. This results in the square with side length 20, centered at the origin, with vertices at $(10,0),(0,10),(-10,0),(0,-10)$.

The second factor will be zero if and only if $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$. This results in the square with side length 16, centered at the origin, with vertices at $(8,0),(0,8),(-8,0),(0,-8)$.

The intersection of these two squares is a smaller square with side length 8, centered at the origin, with vertices at $(4,0),(0,4),(-4,0),(0,-4)$.

Therefore, the area of the convex polygon is the area of the smaller square, which is $8^2 = 64$. The answer is: $64$ square units

"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"

Assistant:


The given equation is $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + (\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + (\vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$. In order for a product to be zero, one or both of the factors must be zero. Hence, either $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + (\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + (\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$.
For the first factor to be zero, we must have $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. These equations represent a rectangle with side lengths $20$ in the x-y plane.
For the second factor to be zero, we must have $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$. These equations represent a square with side length $16$ in the x-y plane.
The convex polygon is the intersection of the two shapes (rectangle and square), so it is a square with side length $10$ (the smaller of the two side lengths). The area of the square is therefore $10^2 = 100$. The answer is: $100$

 The equation is satisfied when at least one of the factors is equal to zero.
The first factor is equal to zero when $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ or $\vert x - y \vert = 10$.
The second factor is equal to zero when $\vert x \vert = 8$ or $\vert y \vert = 8$.
These conditions define a square with side length 16.
The area of the square is $16^2 = 256$.
Therefore, the area of the convex polygon is 256 square units.
The answer is $\boxed{256}$.
