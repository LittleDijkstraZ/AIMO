Interesting, let's analyze step by step:


The product of two numbers is zero if at least one of them is zero. This translates to a system of two equations:

$$((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2) = 0 $$
$$((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$$

Solving for this will result in a list of points which are vertices of the polygon. The problem requires us to find the area of this polygon. 

The first equation is satisfied if and only if $ \vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $ \vert x - y \vert = 10$, which simplifies to $x + y = \pm 10$ and $x - y = \pm 10$. Solving these pairs of equations gives the points:
\[ A=(5,-5),\ B=(5,5),\ C=(-5,5),\ D=(-5,-5) \]

The second equation is satisfied if and only if $|x|=8$ and $|y|=8$, which simplifies to $x=\pm 8$ and $y=\pm 8$. Solving these pairs of equations gives the points:
\[ E=(8,0),\ F=(-8,0),\ G=(0,8),\ H=(0,-8) \]

Thus, all vertices of the polygon are $A,B,C,D,E,F,G,H$. By calculating the distances between each consecutive pair of vertices, we find that the polygon is a square with side length $10\sqrt{2}$.

Therefore, the area of the polygon is $(10\sqrt{2})^2 = 200$. Hence, the required area is $200$. The answer is: $200$

There are no immediate "solve" solutions to use because there is no $x$ or $y$ in the equation to solve. In a problem like this, we look for the domain of the equation to find the points that will form our polygon. This will involve breaking down what each absolute value means.

This equation has two cases. If $A \cdot B = 0$, then either $A = 0$ or $B = 0$. So our cases will be when:

1) $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0 \Rightarrow \vert x + y \vert = 10$.
2) $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0 \Rightarrow \vert x - y \vert = 10$.
3) $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0 \Rightarrow \vert x \vert = 8$.
4) $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0 \Rightarrow \vert y \vert = 8$.

Let's analyze the four cases one by one.

1) For the first equation $\vert x + y \vert = 10$, $x + y$ could be either 10 or -10. So we have two lines: $y = -x + 10$ and $y = -x - 10$.
2) The second equation $\vert x - y \vert = 10$ gives $y = x - 10$ and $y = x + 10$. This forms a rectangle with vertices (10,0), (0,10), (-10,0) and (0,-10).
3) The third equation $\vert x \vert = 8$ gives $x = 8$ and $x = -8$, which are vertical lines.
4) The fourth equation $\vert y \vert = 8$ gives $y = 8$ and $y = -8$, which are horizontal lines.

So now we have a square with side length of 16. Thus the area is the square of the side, or $16^2 = 256$. This is a positive integer as required. The answer is: $256$

0. The problem involves absolute values and square terms, which can make it tricky. However, if we recall that $a^2 = 0 \iff a=0$, the product of two or more factors equaling zero means that at least one of the factors must be zero. This provides a way to simplify the problem.
1. Recognizing that the product of the two factors must be zero, we set each factor equal to zero. 
2. Simplifying, we get two systems of equations: $\vert x + y \vert - 10 = 0$, $\vert x - y \vert - 10 = 0$, $\vert x \vert - 8 = 0$, and $\vert y \vert - 8 = 0$.
3. Solving each system of equations, we find the coordinates of the vertices of the polygon.
4. Finally, we find the area of the polygon by calculating the area of a polygon with the given vertices.

Now let's solve it using Python:

```python


INTERMEDIATE OUT :

from sympy import symbols, Abs, solve

def find_vertices():
    x, y = symbols('x y')

    # Setting each factor equal to zero
    eq1 = Abs(x + y) - 10
    eq2 = Abs(x - y) - 10
    eq3 = Abs(x) - 8
    eq4 = Abs(y) - 8

    # Solving each system of equations
    solutions1 = solve((eq1, eq3, eq4), (x, y))
    solutions2 = solve((eq2, eq3, eq4), (x, y))

    return solutions1 + solutions2

vertices = find_vertices()
print(vertices)
```

INTERMEDIATE OUT :
```output
[]
```
The output is empty because the `solve` function does not support absolute value equations. However, from our analysis above, we know that the vertices of the polygon are the solutions to the absolute value equations. To solve the absolute value equations, we can simply consider the different possibilities for the absolute values:

For $\vert x + y \vert - 10 = 0$, $\vert x - y \vert - 10 = 0$, we have the following cases:

- If $x + y = 10$, $x - y = 10$, solve to get $(x, y) = (5, 5)$.
- If $x + y = 10$, $x - y = -10$, solve to get $(x, y) = (0, 10)$ and $(x, y) = (10, 0)$.
- If $x + y = -10$, $x - y = 10$, solve to get $(x, y) = (-5, -5)$.
- If $x + y = -10$, $x - y = -10$, solve to get $(x, y) = (-10, 0)$ and $(x, y) = (0, -10)$.

For $\vert x \vert - 8 = 0$ and $\vert y \vert - 8 = 0$, we have:

- If $x = 8$, $y = 8$, we already have the vertex $(8, 8)$.
- If $x = -8$, $y = 8$, we have the vertex $(-8, 8)$.
- If $x = 8$, $y = -8$, we have the vertex $(8, -8)$.
- If $x = -8$, $y = -8$, we have the vertex $(-8, -8)$.

So the vertices of the polygon are: $(5, 5)$, $(0, 10)$, $(10, 0)$, $(-5, -5)$, $(-10, 0)$, $(0, -10)$, $(8, 8)$, $(-8, 8)$, $(8, -8)$, $(-8, -8)$.

Let's plot these points and find the area of the polygon. Although it's a bit more complicated than plotting points in a Cartesian plane and calculating the area of a polygon formed by those points, we can use a standard formula for the area of a polygon given its vertices. Let's use Python to calculate the area:

```python


INTERMEDIATE OUT :

from sympy import Matrix, Rational, simplify

def polygon_area(vertices):
    # Vertices of the polygon
    v = Matrix(vertices)

    # Number of vertices
    n = len(vertices)

    # Compute the area
    area = Rational(1, 2) * abs(sum([v[i % n, 0] * v[(i + 1) % n, 1] - v[i % n, 1] * v[(i + 1) % n, 0] for i in range(n)]))

    return simplify(area)

area = polygon_area([(5, 5), (0, 10), (10, 0), (-5, -5), (-10, 0), (0, -10), (8, 8), (-8, 8), (8, -8), (-8, -8)])
print(area)
```

CODE RESULTS 15

INTERMEDIATE OUT :
```output
15
```
The area of the polygon is 15 square units. Now we need to verify that it's a positive integer. The area is indeed positive and an integer. Thus, the area of the convex polygon is 15 square units. The answer is: $15$.

Interesting, let's analyze step by step:


1- The conditions $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ implies that one of the two following conditions has to be satisfied:

a) $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$
b) $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$

2- From condition a), we know that $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$, which implies that x and y are either both 5 or both -5.
3- From condition b), we know that $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$, which implies that the point lies on a square with side length 16 centered at the origin.

4- From conditions a) and b) being equivalent, the only points that satisfy both are the vertices of the square, which are (8, 8), (8, -8), (-8, 8), and (-8, -8).

5- The side length of the square is 16, so the area of the square is $16*16=256$.
The answer is: $256$

Interesting, let's analyze step by step:



The given equation $ ((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0 $

It has a product of two terms equal to zero, so either one of them must be zero. 

This gives us four absolute value equations:

1. $ (\vert x + y \vert - 10) = 0 $ which implies $ \vert x + y \vert = 10 $.
2. $ (\vert x - y \vert - 10) = 0 $ which implies $ \vert x - y \vert = 10 $.
3. $ (\vert x \vert - 8) = 0 $ which implies $ \vert x \vert = 8 $.
4. $ (\vert y \vert - 8) = 0 $ which implies $ \vert y \vert = 8 $.

The solutions of these equations are:
1. $ x + y = 10 $ or $ x + y = -10 $.
2. $ x - y = 10 $ or $ x - y = -10 $.
3. $ x = 8 $ or $ x = -8 $.
4. $ y = 8 $ or $ y = -8 $.

These solutions form a square with side length 16 (from -8 to 8 in both x and y directions). The area of this square is $ 16^2 = 256 $. So, the area of the polygon is 256.

Therefore, the area of the convex polygon is 256. Since 256 is a positive integer, the solution is correct. The answer is: $\boxed{256}$.

Interesting, let's analyze step by step:


$(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ is valid if and only if $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$, which implies $x = \pm y$, that is, the points form on a line through the origin at $45^o$, which is the bisector of the I and III quadrant.
Similarly, $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + (\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ if and only if $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$, or in other words: $(x, y)$ is one of the points of the square with vertices at $(\pm8, \pm8)$.
Thus, the solution set are all points that belong to both polygons, i.e., are vertices of the square, and lie on the line bisecting the I and III quadrant at $45^o$. 
This line will intersect the square at a distance of $8/\sqrt{2} = 8 \sqrt{2}/2 = 4 \sqrt{2}$ from the origin along the line bisecting the I and III quadrant, that is at the points $(\pm 4\sqrt{2}, \pm 4\sqrt{2})$.
The area of the convex polygon is the area of the square minus the area of the isosceles right triangle with legs of length $4\sqrt{2}$:
The area of the square is $(8 \times 8) = 64$ and the area of the triangle is $\frac{1}{2} \cdot (4\sqrt{2}) \cdot (4\sqrt{2}) = 16$, so the area of the convex polygon is $64 - 16 = 48$.
The answer is: 48

Interesting, let's analyze step by step:



First, understand the problem: The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ form a convex polygon. We need to find the area of this polygon.

Next, consider the multiplication: If the product of two numbers is 0, then at least one of the numbers must be 0. Thus either $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$. 

This gives us the following two conditions: 

1) $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ and $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ which simplifies to $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. 

2) $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ and $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ which simplifies to $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$. 

These conditions describe a square with side length 16 (from -8 to 8 on each axis). The area of this square is $16^2 = 256$.

Therefore, the area of the convex polygon formed by the points that satisfy the given equation is 256.

As required, the answer is a positive integer, and the solution is $\boxed{256}$.
