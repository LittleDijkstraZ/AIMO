Interesting, let's analyze step by step:



The given equation can be expressed as $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$. Now, let's denote $x-2y=a$ and $y-2x=b$ so that $a+b=40$. Hence the question is now to find the minimum value of the function $f(x,y) = 5x^2 + 5y^2 - 8xy$ given the constraint $|x - 2y| + |y - 2x| = 40$.

Firstly, we know the function to be minimized can be represented as $f(x, y) = \frac{9}{2}((x - \frac{4}{3}y)^2 + (y - \frac{4}{3}x)^2)$, so $f(x, y)$ reaches its minimum value when $x = \frac{4}{3}y$ or $y = \frac{4}{3}x$. Now we only need to find the value of $f(x, y)$ with this constraint.

Secondly, with the constraint $a + b = 40$, we can consider the cases of $a = 40 - b$ or $a = -(40 - b)$. This means either $x - 2y = 40 - (y - 2x)$ or $x - 2y = -(40 - (y - 2x))$. Simplifying, we find $x = 2y + \frac{40}{3}$ or $x = 2y - \frac{40}{3}$. This means either $x = \frac{4}{3}y + \frac{40}{9}$ or $x = \frac{4}{3}y - \frac{40}{9}$, which further implies that $x = \frac{4}{3}y$ (since $x - \frac{4}{3}y = 0$ and $x - \frac{4}{3}y = \pm\frac{40}{9}$ are both satisfied).

Therefore, $f(x, y)$ is minimized when $x = \frac{4}{3}y$. Now, we can substitute $x = \frac{4}{3}y$ into the function to be minimized:
\[f\left(\frac{4}{3}y, y\right) = 5\left(\frac{4}{3}y\right)^2 + 5y^2 - 8\left(\frac{4}{3}y\right)y = \frac{80}{9}y^2 + 5y^2 - \frac{32}{3}y^2 = \frac{104}{9}y^2.\]

However, the constraint $a + b = 40$ does not give us a direct way to determine the value of $y$, hence we have to minimize $f(x, y)$ with respect to $y$ (since $f(x, y)$ in this form only contains $y$). The minimum of $\frac{104}{9}y^2$ is clearly achieved when $y = 0$, hence the minimum value of $f(x, y)$ under the given constraint is $f(x, 0) = \frac{80}{9}\cdot0^2 + 5\cdot0^2 - 8\cdot0\cdot0 = 0$. But this is not the answer we are looking for.

Recall that $f(x, y) = \frac{9}{2}((x - \frac{4}{3}y)^2 + (y - \frac{4}{3}x)^2)$, so when $x = \frac{4}{3}y$, $f(x, y) = \frac{9}{2}(0 + 0) = 0$. This indicates that the minimum value of $f(x, y)$ is indeed $0$, and the corresponding $x$ and $y$ can be found from the equation $x = \frac{4}{3}y$, which gives $x:y = 4:3$.

Therefore, we have found the minimum of $f(x, y)$ under the constraint $|x - 2y| + |y - 2x| = 40$, and the minimum value is $0$.
However, the question asks for a positive integer value, and $0$ is not a positive integer. We must have made a mistake somewhere in our reasoning.

Let's return to the constraint equation $|x - 2y| + |y - 2x| = 40$. Since the sum of two absolute values is $40$, each absolute value must be less than or equal to $40$. Thus, we have:
\[|x - 2y| \le 40 \quad \text{and} \quad |y - 2x| \le 40.\]
The left inequality can be rewritten as $-40 \le x - 2y \le 40$, and similarly the right inequality as $-40 \le y - 2x \le 40$. This means:
\[2y - 40 \le x \le 2y + 40 \quad \text{and} \quad 2x - 40 \le y \le 2x + 40.\]
By substituting $x = \frac{4}{3}y$ into these inequalities, we get:
\[2y - 40 \le \frac{4}{3}y \le 2y + 40 \quad \text{and} \quad 2\left(\frac{4}{3}y\right) - 40 \le y \le 2\left(\frac{4}{3}y\right) + 40.\]
The first inequality simplifies to $-40 \le \frac{2}{3}y \le 40$, or $-60 \le y \le 60$, and the second simplifies to $-40 \le \frac{8}{3}y - 40 \le 40$, or $0 \le \frac{8}{3}y \le 80$, or $0 \le y \le 30$. The intersection of these two intervals is $0 \le y \le 30$, which implies that $0 \le x \le 40$.

Finally, we substitute $x = \frac{4}{3}y$ into $f(x, y)$:
\[f\left(\frac{4}{3}y, y\right) = \frac{9}{2}\left(\left(\frac{4}{3}y - \frac{4}{3}y\right)^2 + \left(y - \frac{4}{3}\left(\frac{4}{3}y\right)\right)^2\right) = \frac{9}{2}\left(0 + y^2\right) = \frac{9}{2}y^2.\]
We still want to minimize this function subject to $0 \le y \le 30$. The minimum value occurs at $y = 0$, but this is a boundary point and does not satisfy $0

Interesting, let's analyze step by step:



The constraint equation can be rewritten as $|2y - x| + |2x - y| = 40$. Now, consider a point $P(x, y)$ in the $xy-$plane. As $x$ and $y$ vary over all real numbers, the geometric interpretation of the constraint equation being equal to 40, is that $P(x, y)$ traces a square with side length 20.

The function to minimize is $F = 5x^2 + 5y^2 - 8xy = (5x^2 - 8xy + 5y^2) = (5x^2 - 10xy + 5y^2) + (-2xy + 5y^2) = (5(x - y)^2 - 2xy) + (5y^2)$, and geometrically represents the squared distance between the point $P(x, y)$ and the origin plus five times the square of the distance between the origin and point $Q(y, \frac{x}{2})$. 

By the Triangle Inequality, the minimum value of $|x - y| + 2|y - \frac{x}{2}|$ is achieved when $x = y = 10$. Thus, the minimum value of $F$ is achieved at the point $(10, 10)$ which satisfies the constraint equation since $|2(10) - 10| + |2(10) - 10| = 20 + 20 = 40$.

Now we just substitute $x = 10$ and $y = 10$ into the function $F$ to find the minimum value:

```python

from sympy import symbols

def min_value_of_function():
    x, y = symbols('x y')
    F = 5*x**2 + 5*y**2 - 8*x*y
    F = F.subs({x: 10, y: 10})
    return F

result = min_value_of_function()
print(result)
```

CODE RESULTS 200

```output

```

So the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ when $x$ and $y$ range over all real numbers such that $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$ is 200. Since 200 is a positive integer, the result is $\boxed{200}$.

Therefore, the minimum value of the expression $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ under the constraint $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$ is 200. To get the positive numerical answer, we just plug in the values of x and y that give the minimum value, which are both 10. Then, we calculate the value of the expression $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ when $x=10$ and $y=10$. Using a calculator or a software like Sympy, we find that $5(10)^2+5(10)^2-8(10)(10) = 200$. So, the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ under the given constraint is 200. The result is a positive integer, which confirms that our calculation is correct. The answer is: $\boxed{200}$

Interesting, let's analyze step by step:



Given the expression $f(x,y) = 5x^2+5y^2-8xy$, we know that we want to minimize its value under the constraint $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$.
This constraint is equivalent to $|x-2y| = 40 - |y-2x|$.

The double absolute value can be handled by considering three cases:

Case 1: $x - 2y = 40 - (y - 2x)$
Case 2: $x - 2y = 40 + y - 2x$
Case 3: $x - 2y = -(40 - y + 2x)$

Solving these equations, we obtain three expressions for the line segments in the plane: $3x - 3y = 40$, $3x - y = 40$, and $x - 3y = -40$. Plotting these lines along with the ellipse $\frac{x^2}{8} + \frac{y^2}{8} - \frac{xy}{5} = 1$ (from the expression for $f(x,y)$), we see that the minimum is achieved at the intersection of the line $3x - 3y = 40$ with the ellipse.

Solving the system of equations $3x - 3y = 40$ and $\frac{x^2}{8} + \frac{y^2}{8} - \frac{xy}{5} = 1$, we find the intersection point $(x, y) = (10, 0)$. Substituting this into the expression for $f(x, y)$, we get $f(10, 0) = 5 \cdot 10^2 + 5 \cdot 0^2 - 8 \cdot 10 \cdot 0 = 500$.

So the minimum value of $f(x, y)$ is 500. It's a positive integer, as required. The answer is: $500$

The problem is to find the minimum value of the function $f(x, y) = 5x^2 + 5y^2 - 8xy$ under the condition $|x - 2y| + |y - 2x| = 40$.

    return result[0]

The minimum value solver is designed to work on systems of equations and inequalities, but doesn't support inequality constraints directly. 

In such case, a general strategy is to try and substitute one variable in terms of another using the constraint equation, and then simplify the function by the substituted variable. Then use calculus (taking derivative and setting it to zero) to find the extrema.

So, let's solve this problem step by step.

First, we have the constraint equation $|x - 2y| + |y - 2x| = 40$. If we solve this equation for $x$ we can substitute it into $f(x, y)$. Then we can take the partial derivatives with respect to $y$, set them equal to zero, and solve for $y$. These steps are fairly straightforward but could be quite tedious due to the absolute value function. 

Let's simplify things a bit first. From $|x - 2y| + |y - 2x| = 40$, we know that $|x - 2y|$ and $|y - 2x|$ must be either both positive or both negative. If we make both positive, we have:
\[x - 2y + y - 2x = 40 \implies - x - y = 40,\]
which obviously can't be true. So we must have that $|x - 2y|$ and $|y - 2x|$ are both negative:
\[-(x - 2y) - (y - 2x) = 40 \implies 4x - 3y = 40.\]
Solve this equation for $x$ to find:
\[x = \frac{40 + 3y}{4}.\]
Substitute this into $f(x, y)$:
\[f(y) = 5 \left(\frac{40 + 3y}{4}\right)^2 + 5y^2 - 8 \left(\frac{40 + 3y}{4}\right)y = \frac{125 y^2 + 150y + 400}{4} + 5y^2 - 80y - 6y^2 = \frac{75y^2 - 130y + 400}{4}.\]
Now take the derivative of $f(y)$ with respect to $y$:
\[f'(y) = \frac{150y - 130}{4}.\]
Setting $f'(y)$ equal to zero gives:
\[150y - 130 = 0 \implies y = \frac{13}{15}.\]
Finally, substitute this value of $y$ back into our equation for $x$:
\[x = \frac{40 + 3\left(\frac{13}{15}\right)}{4} = 11.\]
So the minimum of the function under the constraint occurs at $x = 11$ and $y = \frac{13}{15}$, and the minimum value is 
\[f\left(11, \frac{13}{15}\right) = 5(11)^2 + 5\left(\frac{13}{15}\right)^2 - 8(11)\left(\frac{13}{15}\right) = 32.\]
The answer is $\boxed{32}$.
