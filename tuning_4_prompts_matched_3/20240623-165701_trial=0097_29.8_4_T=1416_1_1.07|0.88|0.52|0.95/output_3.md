Interesting, let's analyze step by step:



We have two functions inside absolute value, $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2$ and $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2$, and two more, $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2$ and $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2$. The product of these four functions equals zero. In order for this to happen, one (or more) of the functions must be zero. This means that either:

1. $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$.

The only way for any of these expressions to be zero is if the values inside the absolute value are zero. So we have four possible cases:

1. $x + y = 10$ or $x + y = -10$.
2. $x - y = 10$ or $x - y = -10$.
3. $x = 8$ or $x = -8$.
4. $y = 8$ or $y = -8$.

These are the equations of 8 lines in the plane. They form a square with side length 16. The area of this square is $16^2 = 256$.

So the area of the convex polygon is 256. The problem statement asks for a positive numerical answer, so the result is $\boxed{256}$. The answer is: $\boxed{256}$.

Interesting, let's analyze step by step:



1. We have two absolute value expressions, and we know that the square of any real number is nonnegative. So for the expression to be zero, both the factors must be zero.

2. This gives us two systems of equations:
   $$\begin{cases} (\vert x + y \vert - 10) = 0 \\ (\vert x - y \vert - 10) = 0 \end{cases}$$
   and
   $$\begin{cases} (\vert x \vert - 8) = 0 \\ (\vert y \vert - 8) = 0 \end{cases}$$

3. Solving the first system gives us $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$.
   Solving the second system gives us $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$.

4. The solutions to $\vert x \vert = 8$ are $x = 8$ and $x = -8$, and the solutions to $\vert y \vert = 8$ are $y = 8$ and $y = -8$.

5. For $\vert x + y \vert = 10$, we have the following cases:
   - For $x = 8$ and $y = 8$, we have $16 = 10$, which is not possible.
   - For $x = 8$ and $y = -8$, we have $0 = 10$, which is also not possible.
   - For $x = -8$ and $y = 8$, we have $0 = 10$, which is also not possible.
   - For $x = -8$ and $y = -8$, we have $-16 = 10$, which is not possible.

6. So, the only possible solutions are from the second system. This gives us the vertices of the rectangle formed by the points $(8, 8)$, $(8, -8)$, $(-8, 8)$, and $(-8, -8)$.

7. The length of the rectangle is $16$ (from $8$ to $-8$ in the $x$ direction) and the width is $16$ (from $8$ to $-8$ in the $y$ direction).

8. The area of the rectangle is $16 \times 16 = 256$.

Therefore, the area of the convex polygon is $256$. The result is a positive integer as required. The answer is: $256$

Interesting, let's analyze step by step:



The equation $A \cdot B = 0$ implies that $A = 0$ or $B = 0$.
So, either $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$.

For the first equation to be 0, it must be that $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. This forms a square with side length 10, and the area is $10^2 = 100$.

For the second equation to be 0, it must be that $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$. This forms a square with side length 8, and the area is $8^2 = 64$.

Therefore, the area of the convex polygon is the sum of the areas of these two squares, $100 + 64 = 164$.

However, it seems there is a mistake in the problem. The points enclosed by the equation $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ form a square with side length 10, not 8, and the area is $10^2 = 100$.

So, the area of the convex polygon should be $100 + 64 = 164$. But the correct area should be $100$. 

Let's correct the mistake in the problem and recalculate the area.

The points satisfying $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ form a square with side length 10 and area 100.

The points satisfying $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ form a square with side length 8 and area 64.

Interesting, let's analyze step by step:



The expression $AB = 0$ is true if and only if $A = 0$ or $B = 0$. Therefore, the given equation is satisfied if and only if at least one of the following conditions is met:

1. $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$
2. $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$

From condition 1, we have $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ or $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. From condition 2, we have $\vert x \vert = 8$ or $\vert y \vert = 8$.

The solutions to these equations give us the coordinates of the vertices of the polygon. The polygon is a square with side length 16 units (since $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$ implies a square with side length $2 \times 8 = 16$).

The area of a square is given by side length squared, so the area of this square is $16^2 = 256$.

So the area of the convex polygon is 256 square units. The answer is: $\boxed{256}$

Interesting, let's analyze step by step:



The equation involves absolute values, which are difficult to deal with directly. However, we can simplify the equation by considering the fact that the product of two numbers is zero if and only if at least one of them is zero. Thus, we can set each factor equal to zero separately and solve for the values of $x$ and $y$ that satisfy the equation.

1. Solve the equation $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$: This gives us $\vert x + y \vert = 10$, which implies $x + y = 10$ or $x + y = -10$.
2. Solve the equation $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$: This gives us $\vert x - y \vert = 10$, which implies $x - y = 10$ or $x - y = -10$.
3. Solve the equation $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$: This gives us $\vert x \vert = 8$, which implies $x = 8$ or $x = -8$.
4. Solve the equation $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$: This gives us $\vert y \vert = 8$, which implies $y = 8$ or $y = -8$.

Now, we can find the intersection points of these lines:

1. Intersection of $x + y = 10$ and $x - y = 10$: Solving this system of equations gives $x = 10$ and $y = 0$.
2. Intersection of $x + y = 10$ and $x - y = -10$: Solving this system of equations gives $x = 0$ and $y = 10$.
3. Intersection of $x + y = -10$ and $x - y = 10$: Solving this system of equations gives $x = -10$ and $y = -20$.
4. Intersection of $x + y = -10$ and $x - y = -10$: Solving this system of equations gives $x = -10$ and $y = 0$.
5. Intersection of $x = 8$ and $y = 8$: This gives us the point $(8, 8)$.
6. Intersection of $x = 8$ and $y = -8$: This gives us the point $(8, -8)$.
7. Intersection of $x = -8$ and $y = 8$: This gives us the point $(-8, 8)$.
8. Intersection of $x = -8$ and $y = -8$: This gives us the point $(-8, -8)$.

Now, we can plot these points on a coordinate plane and connect them to form a square with side length $20$. The area of this square is $20^2 = 400$.

So the area of the convex polygon is 400 square units. The result is a positive integer, as required.
The answer is: $400$

Interesting, let's analyze step by step:



The product of two terms gives zero if and only if at least one of them is zero. Therefore, the equation implies that each term must be zero:

$$((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2) = 0$$
$$(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$$

From the first equation, we have:
$$\vert x + y \vert = 10$$
$$\vert x - y \vert = 10$$

From the second equation, we have:
$$\vert x \vert = 8$$
$$\vert y \vert = 8$$

The solutions to the above equations are:
$$x = 8, y = 8$$
$$x = 8, y = -8$$
$$x = -8, y = 8$$
$$x = -8, y = -8$$

These points form a square with side length 16. The area of a square is given by the side length squared, so the area of this square is $16^2 = 256$. Therefore, the area of the convex polygon is 256.

The solution is:
$$\boxed{256}$$
