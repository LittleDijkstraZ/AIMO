Assistant:

 The given equation is a product of two expressions equal to zero. This means that either the first expression is zero or the second expression is zero.

The first expression is $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)$, and this equals zero if and only if both $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. This means that the points $(x, y)$ must lie on the lines $x + y = 10$ and $x - y = 10$. These lines intersect at the point $(5, 5)$.

The second expression is $((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2)$, and this equals zero if and only if both $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$. This means that the points $(x, y)$ must lie on the lines $x = 8$ and $y = 8$. These lines form a square with vertices at $(8, 0)$, $(0, 8)$, $(-8, 0)$, and $(0, -8)$.

The intersection of the two sets of points is the point $(5, 5)$. Therefore, the convex polygon formed by the points $(x, y)$ is a square with side length $10$. The area of this square is $10^2 = 100$. The answer is: $100$

The equation $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + (\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + (\vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ is satisfied if and only if either $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$.
This means that either $\vert x + y \vert = 10$, $\vert x - y \vert = 10$, $\vert x \vert = 8$, or $\vert y \vert = 8$.
The points satisfying $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ form a square with side length 10, the points satisfying $\vert x - y \vert = 10$ form another square with side length 10, the points satisfying $\vert x \vert = 8$ form a square with side length 16, and the points satisfying $\vert y \vert = 8$ form another square with side length 16.
The convex polygon is the intersection of these four squares, which is a square with side length 10.
Therefore, the area of the convex polygon is $10^2 = 100$.
The answer is: $100$

Below is a math problem you are to solve (positive numerical answer!):
"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"

This problem is asking for the area of a polygon formed by the set of points $(x, y)$ that satisfy the equation $$((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0.$$

The equation is equal to zero if either of the two factors is zero. The first factor is zero if either $\vert x + y \vert - 10 = 0$ or $\vert x - y \vert - 10 = 0$, which simplifies to $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ or $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. The second factor is zero if either $\vert x \vert - 8 = 0$ or $\vert y \vert - 8 = 0$, which simplifies to $\vert x \vert = 8$ or $\vert y \vert = 8$.

The solutions to $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ are the lines $x + y = 10$ and $x + y = -10$. The solutions to $\vert x - y \vert = 10$ are the lines $x - y = 10$ and $x - y = -10$. The solutions to $\vert x \vert = 8$ are the lines $x = 8$ and $x = -8$. The solutions to $\vert y \vert = 8$ are the lines $y = 8$ and $y = -8$.

These lines form a rectangle with vertices at $(8, 8)$, $(8, -8)$, $(-8, -8)$, and $(-8, 8)$. The area of this rectangle is $16 \times 16 = 256$. So the area of the convex polygon is 256. The answer is: $256$

"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"

Assistant:


The given equation is a product of two terms equal to zero, which means either of the terms must be zero for the entire expression to be zero. Therefore, we have two sets of equations:
1. $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ and $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$
2. $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ and $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$

For the first set of equations, we have:
$\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$
This implies that $x + y = \pm 10$ and $x - y = \pm 10$.
Solving these equations, we get four lines: $x + y = 10$, $x + y = -10$, $x - y = 10$, and $x - y = -10$.

For the second set of equations, we have:
$\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$
This implies that $x = \pm 8$ and $y = \pm 8$.
So we get four lines: $x = 8$, $x = -8$, $y = 8$, and $y = -8$.

The intersection points of these lines are the vertices of the polygon:
$(8, 8)$, $(8, -8)$, $(-8, 8)$, and $(-8, -8)$.

To find the area of the polygon, we can use the formula for the area of a rectangle and subtract the areas of the four right triangles formed by the lines:
Area = $8 \times 8 - \frac{1}{2} \times 8 \times 8 - \frac{1}{2} \times 8 \times 8 - \frac{1}{2} \times 8 \times 8 = 64 - 32 = 32$.
The area of the convex polygon is 32 square units. The answer is: $32$

"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"

Assistant:

 The equation $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + (\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + (\vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ is equal to zero if and only if at least one of the factors is equal to zero. This means that either $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + (\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + (\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$.

The equation $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + (\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ implies that $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$, which means that $x + y = \pm 10$ and $x - y = \pm 10$. Solving these equations gives us the vertices of the square: $(8, 2)$, $(8, -2)$, $(-8, -2)$, and $(-8, 2)$.

The equation $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + (\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ implies that $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$, which means that $x = \pm 8$ and $y = \pm 8$. Solving these equations gives us the vertices of the square: $(8, 8)$, $(8, -8)$, $(-8, -8)$, and $(-8, 8)$.

The points that satisfy the equation are the vertices of two squares. The first square has side length 16 (from $(8, 2)$ to $(8, -2)$ or from $(8, 2)$ to $(-8, 2)$), and the second square has side length 16 (from $(8, 8)$ to $(8, -8)$ or from $(8, 8)$ to $(-8, 8)$). The area of a square is given by side length squared, so the area of the first square is $16^2 = 256$, and the area of the second square is also $16^2 = 256$. The total area of the convex polygon is the sum of the areas of the two squares, which is $256 + 256 = 512$. The answer is: 512

 The given equation is a product of two terms equal to zero. Therefore, either the first term is zero or the second term is zero. 

The first term is zero when $|x+y| = 10$ and $|x-y| = 10$. These are the equations of two lines passing through the origin with slopes 1 and -1 respectively. These lines form a square with side length 20 and vertices at $(10,0)$, $(0,10)$, $(-10,0)$, and $(0,-10)$.

The second term is zero when $|x| = 8$ and $|y| = 8$. These are the equations of two lines passing through the origin with slopes 1 and -1 respectively. These lines form a square with side length 16 and vertices at $(8,0)$, $(0,8)$, $(-8,0)$, and $(0,-8)$.

The intersection of these two squares is a smaller square with side length 16 and vertices at $(8,8)$, $(8,-8)$, $(-8,8)$, and $(-8,-8)$.

The area of the convex polygon is the area of the larger square minus the area of the smaller square. The area of a square is given by the square of the length of its side. Therefore, the area of the larger square is $20^2 = 400$ and the area of the smaller square is $16^2 = 256$.

So, the area of the convex polygon is $400 - 256 = 144$.

The answer is: $144$

The given equation is a product of two expressions equal to zero. This means that either the first expression is zero or the second expression is zero. 

Let's analyze the two expressions separately:

1. $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$: This expression is equal to zero if and only if $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. This means that the points $(x, y)$ lie on the lines $x + y = 10$ and $x - y = 10$.

2. $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$: This expression is equal to zero if and only if $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$. This means that the points $(x, y)$ lie on the lines $x = 8$ and $y = 8$.

The intersection of these lines forms a square with side length 10 (the distance between the lines $x + y = 10$ and $x - y = 10$, or the distance between the lines $x = 8$ and $y = 8$). 

The area of a square is given by the square of the length of its side, so the area of this square is $10^2 = 100$.
The answer is: $100$

 The equation is equal to zero if and only if both of the factors are equal to zero. The factors are:
$$((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)$$ and $$((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2).$$

The first factor equals to zero if and only if $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. This implies that $x + y = \pm 10$ and $x - y = \pm 10$. Solving these equations gives us the vertices of the square: $(8, 2)$, $(8, -2)$, $(-8, -2)$, and $(-8, 2)$.

The second factor equals to zero if and only if $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$. This implies that $x = \pm 8$ and $y = \pm 8$. Solving these equations gives us the vertices of the square: $(8, 8)$, $(8, -8)$, $(-8, -8)$, and $(-8, 8)$.

The convex polygon formed by the union of these two squares is a $4 \times 4$ square. The area of this square is $4^2 = 16$.

Therefore, the area of the convex polygon is 16. The answer is: $16$

This problem involves understanding the properties of absolute value functions and how they interact with multiplication and equality.

The equation $A \cdot B = 0$ implies that either $A = 0$ or $B = 0$. So the given equation is satisfied if either of the following two conditions hold:
1. $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$
2. $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$

For the first condition to be true, both $\vert x + y \vert - 10 = 0$ and $\vert x - y \vert - 10 = 0$, which implies $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. This forms a square with side length 20.

For the second condition to be true, both $\vert x \vert - 8 = 0$ and $\vert y \vert - 8 = 0$, which implies $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$. This forms a square with side length 16.

The area of the convex polygon is the sum of the areas of these two squares. The area of a square with side length $a$ is $a^2$, so the area of the larger square is $20^2 = 400$ and the area of the smaller square is $16^2 = 256$. The total area of the convex polygon is $400 + 256 = 656$.

 The given equation is $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$. For the product of two numbers to be zero, either one of the numbers must be zero. Therefore, we have two cases:

1. $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$. This can only happen if $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. This means $x + y = \pm 10$ and $x - y = \pm 10$. Solving these equations gives us the vertices of the square: $(8, 2)$, $(8, -2)$, $(-8, -2)$, and $(-8, 2)$.

2. $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$. This can only happen if $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$. This means $x = \pm 8$ and $y = \pm 8$. Solving these equations gives us the vertices of the square: $(8, 8)$, $(8, -8)$, $(-8, -8)$, and $(-8, 8)$.

Combining these two cases, we see that the points satisfying the equation enclose a square with side length 16. The area of this square is $16^2 = 256$. Therefore, the area of the convex polygon is 256. The answer is: $256$

"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"

 The equation given is a product of two expressions equal to zero, which means that either of the expressions must be zero for the entire equation to be zero. This gives us two separate cases to consider:

1. $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$
2. $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$

For the first case, both $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2$ and $( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2$ must be zero. This means that $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. This implies that $x + y = \pm 10$ and $x - y = \pm 10$. Solving these equations gives us the vertices of the polygon as $(0, 10)$, $(0, -10)$, $(10, 0)$, and $(-10, 0)$.

For the second case, both $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2$ and $( \vert y \vert - 8)^2$ must be zero. This means that $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$. This implies that $x = \pm 8$ and $y = \pm 8$. Solving these equations gives us the vertices of the polygon as $(8, 8)$, $(8, -8)$, $(-8, 8)$, and $(-8, -8)$.

The polygon formed by these vertices is a square with side length 10. The area of a square is given by the square of the length of its side, so the area of this square is $10^2 = 100$.

Therefore, the area of the convex polygon is 100. The answer is: $100$
