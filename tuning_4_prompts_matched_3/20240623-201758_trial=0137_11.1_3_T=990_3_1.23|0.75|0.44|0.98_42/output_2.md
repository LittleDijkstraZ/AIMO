Solve the following problem with a Python Script (positive numerical answer):
"For how many positive integers $m$ does the equation \[\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}\] have $4$ distinct solutions?"
Write comments to indicate the steps you take. Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Assistant:

Approach:


The equation $| |x-1|-2|=\frac{m}{100}$ has 4 distinct solutions if and only if $\frac{m}{100}$ is strictly between 0 and 2. Therefore, we have $0 < \frac{m}{100} < 2$, which gives $0 < m < 200$. The number of positive integers in this interval is $199$.

Python Implementation:
```python


INTERMEDIATE OUT :

def count_m():
    m_values = list(range(1, 200))
    return len(m_values)

result = count_m()
print(result)
```

CODE RESULTS 199

INTERMEDIATE OUT :
```output
199
```
The number of positive integers $m$ for which the equation $| |x-1|-2|=\frac{m}{100}$ has $4$ distinct solutions is $199$. The answer is: $199$

Solve the following problem with a Python Script (positive numerical answer):
"For how many positive integers $m$ does the equation \[\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}\] have $4$ distinct solutions?"

Approach:

 The given equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has 4 distinct solutions.
The absolute value function $\vert x \vert$ splits into two cases: $x$ if $x \geq 0$ and $-x$ if $x < 0$. Applying this to the equation, we get two cases:

Case 1: $\vert x-1 -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ or $\vert x-3 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$.
This gives us two sub-cases:

Sub-case 1.1: $x-3=\frac{m}{100}$ or $x=3+\frac{m}{100}$.
Sub-case 1.2: $-(x-3)=\frac{m}{100}$ or $x=3-\frac{m}{100}$.

Case 2: $\vert x-1 +2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ or $\vert x+1 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$.
This gives us two sub-cases:

Sub-case 2.1: $x+1=\frac{m}{100}$ or $x=-1+\frac{m}{100}$.
Sub-case 2.2: $-(x+1)=\frac{m}{100}$ or $x=-1-\frac{m}{100}$.

So we have 4 equations for $x$ in terms of $m$:

1. $x=3+\frac{m}{100}$
2. $x=3-\frac{m}{100}$
3. $x=-1+\frac{m}{100}$
4. $x=-1-\frac{m}{100}$

The equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has 4 distinct solutions when the 4 equations above have 4 distinct solutions. This happens when the 4 denominators $\frac{m}{100}$ are all distinct. So we require $m$ to be a positive integer such that $\frac{m}{100}$ is distinct from $2$, $1$, $-1$, and $-2$. This means $1 < \frac{m}{100} < 3$. The only positive integers $m$ that satisfy this are $101$, $200$, and $201$.

Therefore, there are 3 positive integers $m$ for which the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has 4 distinct solutions. However, we are asked for the number of positive integers $m$, so we must have counted the same value of $m$ multiple times. This is because in each case, the equation has the same number of distinct solutions. 

So the number of positive integers $m$ for which the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has 4 distinct solutions is 1.
The answer is: 1

Approach:



The equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has 4 distinct solutions if and only if $\frac{m}{100}$ is between $1$ and $2$ (exclusive). This is because the function $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert$ has 4 distinct solutions in the interval $(1,3)$.

So we have $1 < \frac{m}{100} < 2$, which can be rewritten as $100 < m < 200$.

The positive integers $m$ that satisfy this inequality are the integers from $101$ to $199$, inclusive. To find the number of these integers, we subtract the smallest integer from the largest and then add $1$. So the number of positive integers $m$ is $199 - 101 + 1 = 99$.

Therefore, the number of positive integers $m$ for which the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has 4 distinct solutions is $99$. The answer is: $99$

Assistant:

Approach:


The equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has $4$ distinct solutions if and only if $\frac{m}{100} = 1$. Thus, we solve for $m$ in the equation $\frac{m}{100} = 1$.

Solution:
To solve the equation $\frac{m}{100} = 1$, we multiply both sides by $100$ to get $m = 100$. Therefore, the only positive integer $m$ for which the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has $4$ distinct solutions is $m = 100$.
The answer is: $1$

Assistant:

Approach:


The equation $| |x-1| - 2 | = \frac{m}{100}$ has 4 distinct solutions if and only if the right side $\frac{m}{100}$ is between 1 and 2. So we need to find the number of positive integers $m$ such that $1 < \frac{m}{100} < 2$, or equivalently, $100 < m < 200$.

Counting the number of positive integers in this range, we see that there are $100$ such integers. So the answer is $100$.

The answer is: $100$

"For how many positive integers $m$ does the equation \[\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}\] have $4$ distinct solutions?"
Write comments to indicate the steps you take. Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Assistant:

Approach:


We start by considering the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$.
The number of distinct solutions of this equation depends on the value of $\frac{m}{100}$.
If $\frac{m}{100} < 2$, then the equation has no solutions because the absolute value cannot be negative.
If $\frac{m}{100} = 2$, then the equation has two solutions because the absolute value of a number is either positive or zero.
If $\frac{m}{100} > 2$, then the equation has four distinct solutions because the absolute value can be either positive or zero twice.
Therefore, we need to find the number of positive integers $m$ such that $\frac{m}{100} > 2$, or equivalently, $m > 200$.
The largest positive integer $m$ that satisfies this condition is 201.
Thus, the number of such positive integers $m$ is 1.
The answer is: $1$

Solve the following problem with a Python Script (positive numerical answer):
"For how many positive integers $m$ does the equation \[\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}\] have $4$ distinct solutions?"

Approach:


We can solve this problem by trying out different values of $m$ and checking if the equation has $4$ distinct solutions.

For $m=100$, the equation becomes $| |x-1| -2 | = 1$, which simplifies to two cases:
1. $|x-1| - 2 = 1 \Rightarrow |x-1| = 3$, leading to two solutions: $x = 4$ and $x = -2$.
2. $|x-1| - 2 = -1 \Rightarrow |x-1| = 1$, leading to two solutions: $x = 2$ and $x = 0$.
So, the equation has $4$ distinct solutions for $m=100$.

For $m=200$, the equation becomes $| |x-1| -2 | = 2$, which simplifies to two cases:
1. $|x-1| - 2 = 2 \Rightarrow |x-1| = 4$, leading to two solutions: $x = 5$ and $x = -3$.
2. $|x-1| - 2 = -2 \Rightarrow |x-1| = 0$, leading to one solution: $x = 1$.
So, the equation has $3$ distinct solutions for $m=200$.

For $m=300$, the equation becomes $| |x-1| -2 | = 3$, which simplifies to two cases:
1. $|x-1| - 2 = 3 \Rightarrow |x-1| = 5$, which has no solutions.
2. $|x-1| - 2 = -3 \Rightarrow |x-1| = -1$, which also has no solutions.
So, the equation has $0$ distinct solutions for $m=300$.

Therefore, the only value of $m$ for which the equation has $4$ distinct solutions is $m=100$. The answer is: $1$
