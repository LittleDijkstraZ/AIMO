Below is a math problem you are to solve (positive numerical answer!):
"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"
Analyze this problem and think step by step to come to a solution with programs. After solving the problem, output the final numerical answer within \boxed{}.

Assistant:

 The equation is satisfied if either $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$.

This means that either $|x + y| = 10$, $|x - y| = 10$, $|x| = 8$, or $|y| = 8$.

These equations represent the equations of four lines in the coordinate plane:

1. $|x + y| = 10$ is the equation of two lines: $x + y = 10$ and $x + y = -10$.
2. $|x - y| = 10$ is the equation of two more lines: $x - y = 10$ and $x - y = -10$.
3. $|x| = 8$ is the equation of two lines: $x = 8$ and $x = -8$.
4. $|y| = 8$ is the equation of two more lines: $y = 8$ and $y = -8$.

These lines form a square with side length 16. The area of this square is $16^2 = 256$.

So, the area of the convex polygon is 256.
The answer is: $256$

Below is a math problem you are to solve (positive numerical answer!):
"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"
Analyze this problem and think step by step to come to a solution with programs. After solving the problem, output the final numerical answer within \boxed{}.

Assistant:


The given equation is a product of two terms, and for the product to be zero, one of the terms must be zero. So we have two cases to consider:

1. $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$
2. $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$

For the first case, we have $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. This gives us four lines in the coordinate plane: $x + y = 10$, $x + y = -10$, $x - y = 10$, and $x - y = -10$. These lines form a rectangle with vertices at $(10, 0)$, $(0, 10)$, $(-10, 0)$, and $(0, -10)$.

For the second case, we have $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$. This gives us four lines in the coordinate plane: $x = 8$, $x = -8$, $y = 8$, and $y = -8$. These lines form a square with vertices at $(8, 8)$, $(8, -8)$, $(-8, 8)$, and $(-8, -8)$.

The intersection of the two sets of lines is the convex polygon we are looking for. This polygon is a square with side length 10 (the rectangle formed by the first case has sides of length 20, and the square formed by the second case has sides of length 16, so the intersection is a square with side length 10).

The area of a square is given by the square of its side length, so the area of this convex polygon is $10^2 = 100$. The answer is: $100$

"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"
Analyze this problem and think step by step to come to a solution with programs. After solving the problem, output the final numerical answer within \boxed{}.

Assistant:

 The given equation is a product of two terms equal to zero, so either term must be zero for the equation to hold. This gives us the following systems of equations:

1. $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ and $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ and $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$.
2. $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ and $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ and $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$.

From the first system of equations, we have $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$. This implies $-8 \leq x, y \leq 8$.

From the second system of equations, we have $\vert x - y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$. This implies that the points $(x, y)$ that satisfy this system of equations form a square with side length $16$ centered at the origin.

Therefore, the points that satisfy the original equation form a square with side length $16$, and the area of this square is $16^2 = 256$. The answer is: $256$

Below is a math problem you are to solve (positive numerical answer!):
"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"
Analyze this problem and think step by step to come to a solution with programs. After solving the problem, output the final numerical answer within \boxed{}.

Assistant:


The equation $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + (\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + (\vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ is satisfied if and only if at least one of the factors is zero. This means that either $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + (\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + (\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$.

If $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + (\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$, then $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$, which implies that $x = 0$ and $y = 0$.

If $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + (\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$, then $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$, which implies that $-8 \leq x \leq 8$ and $-8 \leq y \leq 8$.

Therefore, the points satisfying the equation are all the points in the square with vertices at $(\pm 8, 8), (\pm 8, -8), (-8, \pm 8), (8, \pm 8)$. The side length of the square is $16$, so the area of the square is $16^2 = 256$.
The answer is: $256$

"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"

Assistant:

 The given equation is a product of two expressions equal to zero, which means that either the first expression is zero or the second expression is zero. 

The first expression is $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)$, and this equals to zero if and only if both $\vert x + y \vert - 10 = 0$ and $\vert x - y \vert - 10 = 0$. This implies that $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. The only way this can be true is if $x = \pm 10$ and $y = \pm 10$. 

The second expression is $((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2)$, and this equals to zero if and only if both $\vert x \vert - 8 = 0$ and $\vert y \vert - 8 = 0$. This implies that $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$. The only way this can be true is if $x = \pm 8$ and $y = \pm 8$. 

So the points that satisfy the equation are the four points $(\pm 10, \pm 10)$ and the four points $(\pm 8, \pm 8)$. These eight points form a square with side length 20. The area of this square is $20^2 = 400$. So the area of the convex polygon is 400 square units.

The python code to calculate the area of the convex polygon is:
```python

 The given equation is a product of two expressions equal to zero. This means that either the first expression is zero or the second expression is zero.

The first expression is $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)$, and this equals zero if and only if both $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. These equations represent a square with side length 20.

The second expression is $((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2)$, and this equals zero if and only if both $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$. These equations represent a square with side length 16.

Therefore, the points that satisfy the given equation are those that lie either on the square with side length 20 or on the square with side length 16. The intersection of these two squares is a smaller square with side length 8.

The area of a square is given by the square of its side length, so the area of the larger square is $20^2 = 400$, the area of the smaller square is $8^2 = 64$, and the area of the convex polygon formed by the intersection of the two squares is the difference of these two areas, $400 - 64 = 336$.

So, the area of the convex polygon is 336.

"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"
Analyze this problem and think step by step to come to a solution with programs. After solving the problem, output the final numerical answer within \boxed{}.

Assistant:


The equation given is $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$.
For this equation to be true, either $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$.
If $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$, then $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. This implies that $x = \pm 10$ and $y = \pm 10$.
If $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$, then $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$. This implies that $x = \pm 8$ and $y = \pm 8$.
The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying the equation form a square with side length 20, since the distance between the points $(10, 10)$ and $(-10, -10)$ is 20, and the distance between the points $(8, 8)$ and $(-8, -8)$ is 16.
The area of the square is therefore $20^2 = 400$.
The answer is: $400$.

"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"
Analyze this problem and think step by step to come to a solution with programs. After solving the problem, output the final numerical answer within \boxed{}.

Assistant:


The expression $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2)$ is equal to zero if and only if either of the two factors is equal to zero.
The first factor is equal to zero if and only if $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$, which means that $x + y = \pm 10$ and $x - y = \pm 10$.
Solving these equations, we find that the points that satisfy this condition are $(5, 5)$, $(5, -5)$, $(-5, 5)$, and $(-5, -5)$.
The second factor is equal to zero if and only if $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$, which means that $x = \pm 8$ and $y = \pm 8$.
Solving these equations, we find that the points that satisfy this condition are $(8, 0)$, $(0, 8)$, $(-8, 0)$, and $(0, -8)$.
Therefore, the points that satisfy the equation are the vertices of a square with side length 10.
The area of this square is $10^2 = 100$. The answer is: $100$

Assistant:


The given equation is $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$. For the product of two numbers to be zero, either one of the numbers must be zero. This gives us two cases:

1. $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$. This implies that both $\vert x + y \vert - 10 = 0$ and $\vert x - y \vert - 10 = 0$, which means $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. Solving these equations gives us the lines $x + y = 10$ and $x - y = 10$, or $x + y = -10$ and $x - y = -10$. These lines form a square with side length 10. The area of this square is $10^2 = 100$.

2. $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$. This implies that both $\vert x \vert - 8 = 0$ and $\vert y \vert - 8 = 0$, which means $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$. Solving these equations gives us the lines $x = 8$ and $x = -8$, and the lines $y = 8$ and $y = -8$. These lines form a square with side length 16. The area of this square is $16^2 = 256$.

However, the first case is the valid solution because the second case leads to a square that is entirely contained within the square from the first case. Therefore, the area of the convex polygon is 100.

```python
