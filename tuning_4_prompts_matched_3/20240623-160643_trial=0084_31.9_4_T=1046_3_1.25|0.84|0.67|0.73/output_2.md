Approach:

 To find the number of positive integers $m$ for which the equation $| |x-1|-2|=\frac{m}{100}$ has 4 distinct solutions, we first need to consider the possible forms of the right side. Since $\frac{m}{100}$ is always positive, we know that $| |x-1|-2|$ must be some positive value, say $a$, such that $| |x-1|-2|=a$. This will give us two sub-cases:
1. $|x-1|-2=a$, which implies $|x-1|=a+2$. This will give us two linear equations: $x-1=a+2$ and $x-1=-(a+2)$, or $x=a+3$ and $x=3-a$.
2. $|x-1|-2=-a$, which implies $|x-1|=2-a$. This will give us two linear equations: $x-1=2-a$ and $x-1=-(2-a)$, or $x=3-a$ and $x=a-1$.

The four distinct solutions will be $x=a+3$, $x=3-a$, $x=a-1$, and $x=1+a$. For these to be distinct, we must have $a+3 \neq 3-a$, $a+3 \neq a-1$, $3-a \neq a-1$, and $a+3 \neq 1+a$. This simplifies to $a \neq 1$, $a \neq 3$, and $a \neq 2$. So, $a$ must be one of the numbers $4, 5, 6, \ldots$.

Now we need to find the value of $m$ corresponding to each value of $a$. Since $| |x-1|-2|=a$, we have $\frac{m}{100}=a$, which implies $m=100a$. Therefore, the possible values of $m$ are $100 \cdot 4 = 400$, $100 \cdot 5 = 500$, $100 \cdot 6 = 600$, and so on. The question asks for the number of positive integers $m$, so we only consider the positive values of $m$. Hence, the number of positive integers $m$ for which the equation $| |x-1|-2|=\frac{m}{100}$ has 4 distinct solutions is the number of positive integers $m$ that can be expressed as $100a$ where $a$ is a positive integer greater than or equal to 4. This is infinite. However, the question asks for the number of positive integers $m$, so we must consider the largest possible value of $m$ within the given range. The largest value of $m$ that fits the given equation with 4 distinct solutions is $m=600$. The next value of $m$, $m=700$, would require $a=7$, which is not possible as $a$ must be at least 4. Therefore, the largest possible value of $m$ is $600$, and there is only $1$ positive integer $m$ that satisfies the given conditions. The answer is: 1

We first need to understand the number of solutions of the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$.
This equation will have 4 distinct solutions when $\frac{m}{100} = 2$.
This is because the graph of $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert$ will have 4 "pieces" corresponding to the cases when $\vert x-1 \vert -2$ is positive, negative, positive again, and negative again.
Setting $\frac{m}{100}=2$, we find that $m=200$.
So, there is only one value of $m$ for which the equation has 4 distinct solutions, namely $m=200$.

So, the number of positive integers $m$ for which the equation has 4 distinct solutions is 1.
The answer is: $1$

We can start by analyzing the structure of the equation:

\[\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}\]

We know that the equation on the left side will have 4 distinct solutions if the value of $\frac{m}{100}$ lies in a certain range.

The equation on the left side is a composition of two absolute value functions, so it will have a "V" shape when plotted. The number of distinct solutions will be equal to the number of times the value of $\frac{m}{100}$ intersects this "V" shape.

By analyzing the "V" shape of the left side of the equation, we find that $\frac{m}{100}$ must lie in the interval $(0, 2)$. So we have $0 < \frac{m}{100} < 2$, which simplifies to $0 < m < 200$.

The number of positive integers $m$ that satisfy this inequality is simply the number of integers from 1 to 199, inclusive.

Therefore, the number of positive integers $m$ for which the equation has 4 distinct solutions is 199.

The answer is: $199$

To find the number of positive integers $m$ for which the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has $4$ distinct solutions, we need to understand the behavior of the equation. The equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ represents a piecewise function with $4$ segments, each of which is a line segment. The number of distinct solutions is equal to the number of times these line segments intersect the x-axis. 

Let's consider the graph of the function $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert$. The function has a "V" shape with vertices at $(1-2,0)$, $(1,0)$, and $(1+2,0)$, which are $(-1,0)$, $(1,0)$, and $(3,0)$ respectively. The slope of the lines in the "V" shape is either $1$ or $-1$.

Now, we want to find the number of values of $m$ such that the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has $4$ distinct solutions. This occurs when the value of $\frac{m}{100}$ makes the "V" shape "open" twice, i.e., the distance between consecutive vertices of the "V" shape is greater than $\frac{m}{100}$. This happens when $4 \times \frac{m}{100} = 2$, or $m = 50$. 

Thus, there is only one positive integer $m$ for which the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has $4$ distinct solutions. The answer is: $1$

Assistant:

Approach:


We know that the absolute value function has a piecewise definition:
\[|x| = \begin{cases} x & \text{if } x \geq 0 \\ -x & \text{if } x < 0 \end{cases}\]
So the equation $| |x-1| - 2 | = \frac{m}{100}$ can be broken down into two cases based on the value of $|x-1|$.

Case 1: $|x-1| - 2 = \frac{m}{100}$
This simplifies to $|x-1| = 2 + \frac{m}{100}$. Now we need to consider two sub-cases based on the value of $x-1$.

Sub-case 1.1: $x-1 - 2 = \frac{m}{100}$, which simplifies to $x = 3 + \frac{m}{100}$.

Sub-case 1.2: $-(x-1) - 2 = \frac{m}{100}$, which simplifies to $x = -1 + \frac{m}{100}$.

Case 2: $|-(x-1) - 2| = \frac{m}{100}$, which simplifies to $|x+1| - 2 = \frac{m}{100}$.

This further simplifies to $|x+1| = 2 + \frac{m}{100}$, and then we have two sub-cases similar to the ones in Case 1.

Sub-case 2.1: $x+1 - 2 = \frac{m}{100}$, which simplifies to $x = -1 + \frac{m}{100}$.

Sub-case 2.2: $-(x+1) - 2 = \frac{m}{100}$, which simplifies to $x = 3 + \frac{m}{100}$.

So all four solutions are given by $x = -1 + \frac{m}{100}$, $x = 3 + \frac{m}{100}$, $x = -1 - \frac{m}{100}$, and $x = 3 - \frac{m}{100}$.

The number of distinct solutions will be 4 when the solutions are distinct and real. This happens when $-1 < \frac{m}{100} < 3$, which simplifies to $$-100 < m < 300.$$

The positive integers $m$ that satisfy this inequality and also make the equation true are the positive integers in the set $\{1, 2, ..., 299\}$.

So the number of such positive integers $m$ is 299.
The answer is: $299$

Approach:


The equation $| |x - 1| - 2| = \frac{m}{100}$ has 4 distinct solutions. This equation represents a piecewise function with 4 cases based on the absolute value operations. Each case will give us a quadratic equation which we solve to find the number of real solutions. The number of real solutions depends on the discriminant of the quadratic equation, specifically, if the discriminant is positive, then there are 2 real solutions. We need to find the value of $m$ for which the discriminant is positive for 2 of the 4 cases, and negative for the other two cases.

The solutions:
The 4 cases are:

Case 1: $x - 1 - 2 = \frac{m}{100}$, i.e., $x - 3 = \frac{m}{100}$. So, $x = 3 + \frac{m}{100}$.

Case 2: $x - 1 - 2 = -\frac{m}{100}$, i.e., $x - 3 = -\frac{m}{100}$. So, $x = 3 - \frac{m}{100}$.

Case 3: $-(x - 1) - 2 = \frac{m}{100}$, i.e., $-(x - 1) = \frac{m}{100} + 2$, i.e., $-(x - 1) = \frac{m + 200}{100}$. So, $x = 1 - \frac{m + 200}{100}$.

Case 4: $-(x - 1) - 2 = -\frac{m}{100}$, i.e., $-(x - 1) = -\frac{m}{100} + 2$, i.e., $-(x - 1) = \frac{200 - m}{100}$. So, $x = 1 + \frac{200 - m}{100}$.

For Case 1 and Case 2, the quadratic equations will have positive discriminant if $m < 200$.
For Case 3 and Case 4, the quadratic equations will have positive discriminant if $m > 200$.

Hence, we need to find the value of $m$ for which $m$ lies in the interval $(200, 200 + \epsilon)$ for some small positive $\epsilon$, i.e., $m$ is just above 200.

By trial and error, we find that $m = 201$ gives 4 distinct solutions.

Therefore, the only positive integer $m$ for which the equation $| |x - 1| - 2| = \frac{m}{100}$ has 4 distinct solutions is $m = 201$.

The answer is: $1$
