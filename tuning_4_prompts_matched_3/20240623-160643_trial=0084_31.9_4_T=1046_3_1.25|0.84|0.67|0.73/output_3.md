Solve the following problem with a Python Script (positive numerical answer):
"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"

Approach:



The given equation is:
\[((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0\]
The expression is equal to 0 if either of the two factors is 0. This gives us two equations to solve:
1) $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ and $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$
2) $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ and $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$

Solving these equations gives the vertices of the polygon:

For the first equation, $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x \vert = 8$. The possible combinations of these equations give the vertices $(8, 2), (8, -2), (-8, 2), (-8, -2)$.

For the second equation, $\vert x - y \vert = 10$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$. The possible combinations of these equations give the vertices $(2, 8), (2, -8), (-2, 8), (-2, -8)$.

So, the vertices of the polygon are $(8, 2), (8, -2), (-8, 2), (-8, -2), (2, 8), (2, -8), (-2, 8), (-2, -8)$.

These vertices form a square with side length $10$. The area of a square is given by side length squared. So, the area of the polygon is $10^2 = 100$.

The answer is: $100$

"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"

Approach:

 The given equation is zero, which means that either of the terms inside the product must be zero. Therefore, we have two sets of equations to solve for $x$ and $y$:

1. $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0 \implies \vert x + y \vert = 10 \implies x + y = \pm 10$
2. $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0 \implies \vert x - y \vert = 10 \implies x - y = \pm 10$
3. $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0 \implies \vert x \vert = 8 \implies x = \pm 8$
4. $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0 \implies \vert y \vert = 8 \implies y = \pm 8$

Solving these equations, we get the vertices of the polygon:

$(8, 8)$, $(8, -8)$, $(-8, 8)$, $(-8, -8)$, $(10, 0)$, $(0, 10)$, $(-10, 0)$, $(0, -10)$.

The polygon is a square with side length $16$. The area of the square is $16^2 = 256$. The answer is: $256$

Approach:

 The equation $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + (\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ implies that $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. This gives us four lines: $x + y = 10$, $x + y = -10$, $x - y = 10$, and $x - y = -10$. These lines form a square with side length 10 and vertices at $(5,5)$, $(5,-5)$, $(-5,-5)$, and $(-5,5)$.

Similarly, the equation $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + (\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ implies that $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$, which gives us four lines: $x = 8$, $x = -8$, $y = 8$, and $y = -8$. These lines form a square with side length 16 and vertices at $(8,8)$, $(8,-8)$, $(-8,-8)$, and $(-8,8)$.

The convex polygon formed by the intersection of these two squares is also a square, with side length equal to the side length of the smaller square, which is 10. The area of this square is therefore $10^2 = 100$.

So, the area of the convex polygon is 100.
The answer is: $100$

Solve the following problem with a Python Script (positive numerical answer):
"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"
Write comments to indicate the steps you take. Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Assistant:

Approach:


The given equation is equal to zero, which implies that one of the factors must be zero. This gives us two equations to work with:
1. $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2) = 0$
2. $((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$

For the first equation to be zero, both $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2$ and $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2$ must be zero. This implies that $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. The only way this can be true is if $x = y = \pm 10$ or $x = -y = \pm 10$.

For the second equation to be zero, both $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2$ and $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2$ must be zero. This implies that $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$. The only way this can be true is if $x = y = \pm 8$ or $x = -y = \pm 8$.

Now we can see that the points satisfying the original equation are the vertices of a square with side length 20 (from $-10$ to $10$ in both $x$ and $y$). Therefore, the area of the square is $20^2 = 400$. The answer is: $\boxed{400}$.

Approach:


The equation $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ is satisfied if and only if either $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$. 

The first equation is satisfied if and only if $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. These equations describe a square with side length 10 and its diagonals of length 10$\sqrt{2}$. 

The second equation is satisfied if and only if $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$. These equations describe a square with side length 8 and its diagonals of length 8$\sqrt{2}$. 

The area of the square with side length 10 is $10^2 = 100$. The area of the square with side length 8 is $8^2 = 64$. 

The area of the convex polygon formed by the union of these two squares is the sum of their areas, which is $100 + 64 = 164$. The answer is: $164$

The given equation is a product of two terms equal to zero, which implies that each term must be zero. So, we have two cases to consider:

1. $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ and $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ and $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$
2. $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$

Case 1:
From $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$, we have $\vert x + y \vert = 10$. This implies that $x + y = 10$ or $x + y = -10$.
From $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$, we have $\vert x \vert = 8$. This implies that $x = 8$ or $x = -8$.
From $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$, we have $\vert y \vert = 8$. This implies that $y = 8$ or $y = -8$.
Combining these, we have the following four points: $(8, 2)$, $(8, -18)$, $(-8, 2)$, and $(-8, -18)$.

Case 2:
From $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$, we have $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. This implies that $x - y = 10$ or $x - y = -10$.
Combining this with the points from Case 1, we can see that all the points satisfy this condition.

So, the convex polygon is a square with side length $16$ (from $(-8, 2)$ to $(8, 2)$ or from $(8, -18)$ to $(-8, -18)$ or from $(8, 2)$ to $(8, -18)$ or from $(-8, 2)$ to $(-8, -18)$).

The area of a square is given by side length squared, so the area of the convex polygon is $16^2 = 256$.

So, the area of the convex polygon is 256 square units. The answer is: $256$

Approach:


The equation $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ is satisfied if either of the factors is zero. If either of the factors is zero, it means that either $|x+y| - 10 = 0$, $|x - y| - 10 = 0$, $|x| - 8 = 0$ or $|y| - 8 = 0$.

1. $|x+y| - 10 = 0$ implies $|x+y| = 10$, so $x+y = \pm 10$. This gives us the lines $y = -x + 10$ and $y = -x - 10$.
2. $|x - y| - 10 = 0$ implies $|x - y| = 10$, so $x - y = \pm 10$. This gives us the lines $y = x - 10$ and $y = x + 10$.
3. $|x| - 8 = 0$ implies $|x| = 8$, so $x = \pm 8$. This gives us the lines $x = 8$ and $x = -8$.
4. $|y| - 8 = 0$ implies $|y| = 8$, so $y = \pm 8$. This gives us the lines $y = 8$ and $y = -8$.

The lines $x = 8$, $x = -8$, $y = 8$, and $y = -8$ form a square with side length 16. The area of this square is $16^2 = 256$.

The answer is: $\boxed{256}$.

The equation $AB = 0$ implies that either $A = 0$ or $B = 0$. So the given equation is satisfied when either of the following two equations is satisfied:
1. $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$
2. $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$

From equation 2., we get that both $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$, which implies that the points must lie on a square with side length 16. The vertices of this square are $(\pm8, \pm8)$.

From equation 1., we get that both $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$, which implies that the points must lie on a square with side length 20. The vertices of this square are $(\pm10, 0)$ and $(0, \pm10)$.

Taking the intersection of the two squares, we find that the points that satisfy the given equation are those that lie on a smaller square with side length 8 (the vertices of this square are $(\pm4, \pm4)$). The area of this square is $8^2 = 64$.
The answer is: $64$

This problem requires understanding the properties of absolute values and how they can be simplified. Additionally, it's important to understand the conditions under which the product of two numbers is zero.

We have the equation:

$$((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0.$$

This equation is satisfied when either of the following two conditions hold:
1. $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$
2. $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$

For the first condition to hold, we must have $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. This results in a square with side length 10.

For the second condition to hold, we must have $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$, which results in a square with side length 16.

So, the points that satisfy the given equation form two squares: one with side length 10 and the other with side length 16. The area of the convex polygon formed by the intersection of these two squares is the area of the smaller square, which is $(10)^2 = 100$. The answer is: $100$

Assistant:

Approach:



The equation given is a product of two expressions equal to zero. This means that either the first expression is zero or the second expression is zero.

The first expression is $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)$ and the second expression is $((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2)$.

If the first expression is zero, we have $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. This gives us the equations $x + y = 10$ or $x + y = -10$ and $x - y = 10$ or $x - y = -10$. Solving these equations, we find the lines $x + y = 10$, $x + y = -10$, $x - y = 10$, and $x - y = -10$.

If the second expression is zero, we have $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$. This gives us the lines $x = 8$, $x = -8$, $y = 8$, and $y = -8$.

The four lines $x + y = 10$, $x + y = -10$, $x - y = 10$, and $x - y = -10$ intersect the four lines $x = 8$, $x = -8$, $y = 8$, and $y = -8$ to form a square with side length 10. The area of this square is $10^2 = 100$.
The answer is $\boxed{100}$.
