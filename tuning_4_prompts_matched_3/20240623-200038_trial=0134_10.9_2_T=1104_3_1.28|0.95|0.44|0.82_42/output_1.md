Approach:



First, let's rewrite the target function $f(x, y) = 5x^2 + 5y^2 - 8xy = (5x^2 - 8xy + 5y^2)$, which can be recognized as the square of a binomial:

$f(x, y) = (x - 2y)^2$, using the identity $(a - b)^2 = a^2 - 2ab + b^2$.

So, the minimum value of the function $f(x, y)$ will be $0$ when $(x - 2y)^2 = 0$, or $x = 2y$.

However, we also need to satisfy the constraint $|x - 2y| + |y - 2x| = 40$. Using the condition $x = 2y$, we have $|x - 2y| + |y - 2x| = 0 + |-3x| = 3|x| = 40$. So $|x| = \frac{40}{3}$. 

However, this is a contradiction because no real value of $x$ (and hence of $y = \frac{x}{2}$) can satisfy $|x| = \frac{40}{3}$.

So we need to consider the cases when $x - 2y = 0$ or $y - 2x = 0$.

If $x - 2y = 0$, then $x = 2y$. Then $f(x, y) = (x - 2y)^2 = 0$. The constraint is $|x - 2y| + |y - 2x| = |-y| + |3y| = 4|y| = 40$, we get $|y| = 10$, so $y = 10$ or $y = -10$. The minimum value of $f(x, y)$ is thus $0$.

If $y - 2x = 0$, then $y = 2x$. Then $f(x, y) = (2x - x)^2 = x^2$. The constraint is $|x - 2y| + |y - 2x| = |x - 4x| + |2x - x| = 3|x| = 40$, we get $|x| = \frac{40}{3}$. The minimum value of $f(x, y)$ in this case is $\left(\frac{40}{3}\right)^2 = \frac{1600}{9}$.

However, we are looking for the minimum value of $f(x, y)$, which is the smaller of the two values. Comparing $0$ and $\frac{1600}{9}$, we see that $0$ is smaller. Therefore, the minimum value of $5x^2 + 5y^2 - 8xy$ when $x$ and $y$ satisfy the constraint is 0.
The answer is: $0$

Approach:


The given equation $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$ is equivalent to $|x-2y| = |2x-y| = 20$ due to the properties of absolute values.
Without loss of generality, let $x-2y \geq 0$ and $2x-y \geq 0$. Then we have $x-2y = 20$ and $2x-y = 20$, which is a system of linear equations. Solving this system, we get $x = 20$ and $y = 10$.
Now we substitute $x = 20$ and $y = 10$ into the expression $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ to find the minimum value.

We now have the problem of finding the minimum value of the function $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ for $x=20$ and $y=10$.

Assistant:

Approach:


The given expression $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ is a quadratic form and we are asked to find its minimum value under the constraint $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$. 

Firstly, let's simplify the constraint:
\[|x-2y| + |y-2x| = |x-2y| + |2y-x| = 40.\]

By the triangle inequality, we know that $|a| + |b| \geq |a+b|$ for all real numbers $a$ and $b$. Applying this inequality to the constraint gives
\[|x-2y+2y-x| = |0| \leq 40,\]
which is true, but doesn't help us to simplify the problem. However, we can think of another way to use the triangle inequality. Let $a = x-2y$ and $b = y-2x$. Then $|a| + |b| = 40$, and we know that $|a+b| \leq |a| + |b|$. Therefore, we have
\[|a + b| = |x-2y + y-2x| = |-x - y| = |-(x+y)| = |x+y| \leq 40.\]

Next, we need to find the relationship between $x$ and $y$ under this constraint. From the equation $x+y = 20$, we can express $y$ in terms of $x$: $y = 20 - x$.

Then we substitute $y$ into the quadratic form:
\[5x^2+5y^2-8xy = 5x^2 + 5(20-x)^2 - 8x(20-x).\]
Simplifying it, we get
\[5x^2 + 5(400 - 40x + x^2) - 8x(20-x) = 5x^2 + 2000 - 200x + 5x^2 - 160x + 8x^2 = 18x^2 - 360x + 2000.\]

Now, let's find the minimum of the quadratic function $f(x) = 18x^2 - 360x + 2000$. To find the minimum of a quadratic function $f(x) = ax^2 + bx + c$, the $x$-coordinate of the vertex is $-b/2a$. In this case, $a = 18$, $b = -360$, so the $x$-coordinate of the vertex is $x = -(-360)/2*18 = 10$.

Substitute $x = 10$ back into $y = 20 - x$ to get $y = 10$.

Finally, substitute $x = 10$ and $y = 10$ into the quadratic form $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$:
\[5*10^2 + 5*10^2 - 8*10*10 = 500 + 500 - 800 = 200.\]
So the minimum value of the quadratic form under the constraint is $200$.

Solution: The minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ when $x$ and $y$ range over all real numbers such that $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$ is $200$. Therefore, the answer is: $200$. The answer is $\boxed{200}$.

Approach:

 We begin by analyzing the second constraint $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$. By the triangle inequality, $|x-2y| + |y-2x|$ is greater than or equal to the absolute value of their difference, which gives $|x-2y - (y-2x)| = |x-2y-y+2x| = |3x-3y| = 3|x-y| = 40$. From this we obtain that $|x-y| = \frac{40}{3}$. 

Now let's consider $S = 5x^2+5y^2-8xy = 5(x^2+y^2) - 8xy$. By the identity $x^2 + y^2 = (x - y)^2 + 2xy$, we rewrite $S = 5[(x-y)^2 + 2xy] - 8xy = 5(x-y)^2 + 2xy$. We can rewrite this last expression as
\begin{align*}
S & = 5\left(\left(\frac{40}{3}\right)^2\right) + 2xy \\
& = \frac{800}{3} + 2xy.
\end{align*}From the second constraint we know that $|x-y| = \frac{40}{3}$, which implies $(x-y)^2 = \left(\frac{40}{3}\right)^2$. Hence we can obtain
\begin{align*}
xy & = \frac{1}{2}\left[ (x+y)^2 - (x-y)^2 \right] \\
& = \frac{1}{2}\left[ (2(x+y))^2 - 4(x-y)^2 \right] / 4\\
& = \frac{1}{8} \left[ (2x+2y)^2 - 4\left(\frac{40}{3}\right)^2 \right] \\
& = \frac{1}{8} \left[ (2x+2y)^2 - \frac{6400}{9} \right].
\end{align*}Since $|2x+2y|$ is bounded by $|x| + |y| \leq 2|x-y| + |y-2x| = 2\cdot \frac{40}{3} = \frac{80}{3}$, the value of $(2x+2y)^2$ must be no greater than $\left(\frac{80}{3}\right)^2$. This gives an upper bound for $xy$, and hence a lower bound for $S$. 

We now evaluate the lower bound for $S$:
\begin{align*}
S & = \frac{800}{3} + 2xy \\
& \geq \frac{800}{3} + 2\left( \frac{1}{8} \left[ \left(\frac{80}{3}\right)^2 - \frac{6400}{9} \right] \right)\\
& = \frac{800}{3} + \frac{1}{4} \left[ \left(\frac{80}{3}\right)^2 - \frac{6400}{9} \right]\\
& = \frac{800}{3} + \frac{1}{4}\cdot\frac{6400}{9} - \frac{1600}{9}\\
& = \frac{800}{3} + \frac{1600}{9} - \frac{1600}{9}\\
& = \frac{800}{3}.
\end{align*}Therefore, the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ is $\frac{800}{3}$. The answer is: $\boxed{\frac{800}{3}}$

Approach:



This problem involves a constraint given by the equation $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$. However, it is hard to directly solve this problem considering the constraint. To simplify the problem, let's substitute $u=x-2y$ and $v=y-2x$, so the constraint becomes $|u| + |v| = 40$. Now the problem only has two variables. From this constraint, we have:
$$
|u| + |v| = 40 \implies |u| = 40 - |v| \ge 0
$$
Which gives us $0 \le |v| \le 40$. Now we can rewrite our objective function with the substitution:
$$
f(x, y) = 5x^2 + 5y^2 - 8xy = \frac{5}{4}(u^2 + v^2) = \frac{5}{4}( (x-2y)^2 + (y-2x)^2 )
$$
We want to find the minimum value of $f(x, y)$ subject to the constraint $0 \le |v| \le 40$. 

To make the optimization simpler, let's first complete the square on the objective function $f(x, y)$:

$$
f(x, y) = \frac{5}{4} ((x^2 - 4xy + 4y^2) + (y^2 - 4xy + 4x^2)) = \frac{5}{4} (5(x^2 - 4xy + 4y^2)) = \frac{25}{4} (x^2 - 4xy + 4y^2) = \frac{25}{4} ((x - 2y)^2)
$$

Since $(x - 2y)^2 \ge 0$ and from the constraint $0 \le |v| \le 40$, we have $0 \le (x - 2y)^2 \le 1600$, hence we know that $0 \le \frac{25}{4} (x - 2y)^2 \le 10000$. Therefore the minimum value of the function is 0, which is achieved when $x = 2y$. This will be the case when $(x, y)$ is a solution to the system of equations:

$$
\begin{cases}
u = x - 2y = 0 \\
v = y - 2x = 0
\end{cases}
$$
Solving this system, we get $x = y$. Substituting $x = y$ into the constraint $0 \le |v| = |y - 2x| = |y - 2y| = |-y| \le 40$, we get $0 \le |-y| \le 40$, which simplifies to $0 \le y \le 40$. Therefore the minimum value of $f(x, y)$ subject to the constraint is $0$. So the minimum value of the expression is $\boxed{0}$.
The answer is: $\boxed{0}$

Approach:

 To find the minimum value of the expression $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ subject to the condition $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$, we first note that the condition is symmetric in $x$ and $y$, so without loss of generality, we can assume that $x \geq y$. Then we can write $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$ as $(x-2y) + (2x-y) = 40$, which simplifies to $3x - 3y = 40$, or $x - y = \frac{40}{3}$. Therefore, we have $x = y + \frac{40}{3}$.

Substitute $x = y + \frac{40}{3}$ into $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$, we get:
\[5\left(y + \frac{40}{3}\right)^2 + 5y^2 - 8y\left(y + \frac{40}{3}\right) = 5\left(y^2 + \frac{80y}{3} + \frac{1600}{9}\right) + 5y^2 - 8y^2 - \frac{320y}{3} = \frac{2000}{9} - \frac{80y}{3}.\]
Setting the derivative of this expression with respect to $y$ to zero gives:
\[-\frac{80}{3} = 0,\]
which has no solutions. However, we know that the function is continuous, and as $y$ goes to $\pm\infty$, the function value goes to $-\infty$. Therefore, the minimum value must occur at the endpoints of the domain of $y$. We consider two cases:

1. If $y = \frac{40}{3}$, then $x = \frac{40}{3} + \frac{40}{3} = \frac{80}{3}$.
Substituting these values into $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ gives $\frac{2000}{9}$.
2. If $y$ is far from $\frac{40}{3}$, then the minimum will occur when $y$ is close to $x$. In this case, we can ignore the terms involving $y$ in the expression $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$, and it is equivalent to minimizing $5x^2 - 8x^2 = -3x^2$. This is minimized when $x = 0$, and $y = -\frac{40}{3}$. However, this gives a value of $5\left(-\frac{40}{3}\right)^2 - 8\left(-\frac{40}{3}\right)\left(0\right) = \frac{2000}{9}$, which is the same as the value when $y = \frac{40}{3}$.

Therefore, the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ is $\frac{2000}{9}$, given the condition $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$. The answer is: $\boxed{\frac{2000}{9}}$

Approach:


To solve this problem, we need to find the minimum value of the function $f(x, y) = 5x^2 + 5y^2 - 8xy$ subject to the constraint $|x - 2y| + |y - 2x| = 40$.

The function $f(x, y)$ is a quadratic function, and its minimum value can be found by completing the square or by finding its critical points. The constraint $|x - 2y| + |y - 2x| = 40$ is a bit difficult to work with directly.

However, we can rewrite the constraint as $x - 2y + y - 2x = \pm 40$, which simplifies to $-x - y = \pm 40$. This constraint equation tells us that the points $(x, y)$ lie on the lines $y = -x + 40$ and $y = -x - 40$. We can plot these lines and the function $f(x, y)$ on the same coordinate system to visualize the situation.

Solution:
After plotting the function and the constraints, we observe that the minimum of $f(x, y)$ occurs at the intersection of the lines $y = -x + 40$ and $y = -x - 40$. Solving these equations simultaneously gives $x = 20$ and $y = -20$.

Substituting these values back into the function $f(x, y)$ gives:
\[f(20, -20) = 5(20)^2 + 5(-20)^2 - 8(20)(-20) = 2000 + 2000 + 3200 = 7200.\]

Therefore, the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ when $x$ and $y$ range over all real numbers such that $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$ is $7200$. The answer is: $7200$

Approach:

 

This is an optimization problem with a constraint $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$. To solve this problem, we can use the technique of Lagrange multipliers. The Lagrangian function is given by:

$$\mathcal{L}(x, y, \lambda) = 5x^2+5y^2-8xy - \lambda (|x-2y| + |y-2x| - 40).$$

However, this problem involves absolute values, which makes the optimization process more complicated. To simplify the problem, we can consider two cases: $x \geq 2y$ and $x < 2y$. For the first case, $|x - 2y| = x - 2y$ and $|y - 2x| = -y + 2x$. So the constraint equation becomes:

$$(x-2y) + (2x-y) = 40 \implies 3x - 3y = 40 \implies x - y = \frac{40}{3}.$$

Similarly, for the second case ($x < 2y$), we have:

$$(-x+2y) + (-2x+y) = 40 \implies -3x + y = 40 \implies y - 3x = 40.$$

Now we have two constraint equations, and we can find their intersection points by setting $x - y = \frac{40}{3}$ and $y - 3x = 40$. Solving these equations, we find that the only intersection point of the two constraints is $x = \frac{80}{9}$ and $y = \frac{40}{9}$.

Now we can substitute these values back into the expression $5x^2 + 5y^2 - 8xy$ to find the minimum value.

$$5\left(\frac{80}{9}\right)^2 + 5\left(\frac{40}{9}\right)^2 - 8\left(\frac{80}{9}\right)\left(\frac{40}{9}\right) = \frac{800}{9}.$$

Therefore, the minimum value of the expression $5x^2 + 5y^2 - 8xy$ when $|x - 2y| + |y - 2x| = 40$ is $\frac{800}{9}$. The answer is: $\frac{800}{9}$

Assistant:

Approach:

 To find the minimum value of the expression $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ with the condition $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$, we first solve the constraint equation for $x$ and $y$ such that the value of the expression is solely dependent on a single variable.

Constraint equation: $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$.
We can rewrite this as $|2x - y| + |2y - x| = 40$. 
By the triangle inequality, $|a| + |b| \geq |a+b|$, we have $|2x - y + 2y - x| = |x| \geq 40$. 
Thus, $x = \pm 20$. 

Substitute $x = 20$ into the constraint equation: $|2(20) - y| + |2y - 20| = 40$, we get $y = 20$. 
Substitute $x = -20$ into the constraint equation: $|-2(20) - y| + |2y + 20| = 40$, we get $y = -20$. 

Hence the constraint equation implies that $x = \pm 20$ and $y = \pm 20$. 

Now substitute $x = 20$ and $y = 20$ into the expression: $5(20)^2 + 5(20)^2 - 8(20)(20) = 2000$. 
Substitute $x = -20$ and $y = -20$ into the expression: $5(-20)^2 + 5(-20)^2 - 8(-20)(-20) = 2000$. 

The minimum value of the expression is 2000.

So the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ under the condition $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$ is $2000$. The answer is: $\boxed{2000}$

Approach:


To solve this problem, we first notice that the function $f(x, y) = 5x^2 + 5y^2 - 8xy$ can be rewritten as $f(x, y) = (5x^2 - 8xy + 5y^2) = (5x^2 - 10xy + 5y^2) + (-2xy) = (5(x-y)^2) - 2xy$.

Now, by the Triangle Inequality, we know that $|x - 2y| + |y - 2x| \geq |(x - 2y) - (y - 2x)| = 4|x - y|$. Given that $|x - 2y| + |y - 2x| = 40$, it follows that $4|x - y| = 40$, so $|x - y| = 10$.

Since $x$ and $y$ are interchangeable in the function $f(x, y)$ and the constraint equation, we may assume without loss of generality that $x \geq y$. Then, $x - y = 10$, or $x = y + 10$. Substituting into the constraint equation, we get $|y - 2(y + 10)| + |(y + 10) - 2y| = 40 \Rightarrow |-y - 20| + |y - 10| = 40$.

Because the absolute value function is symmetric around the origin, the terms $-y - 20$ and $y - 10$ have equal magnitude. Thus, $|-y - 20| = |y - 10|$, so the constraint equation simplifies to $2|y - 10| = 40 \Rightarrow |y - 10| = 20 \Rightarrow y = 30 \text{ or } y = -10$.

Therefore, the only possible pairs $(x, y)$ are $(30, 10)$ and $(-10, -20)$. Checking these pairs into the expression for $f(x, y)$, we get $f(30, 10) = (5(30 - 10)^2) - 2(30)(10) = 400$ and $f(-10, -20) = (5(-10 + 20)^2) - 2(-10)(-20) = 400$.

Because the function $f(x, y)$ is symmetric with respect to $x$ and $y$, we can conclude that the minimum value of $f(x, y)$ under the constraint is 400. The answer is: $400$

Approach:

 To solve this problem, we need to use the fact that $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$ to eliminate one of the variables. We can use the property $|a| + |b| = |a+b| + |a-b|$ to rewrite the equation as $|2y-x| + |2x-y| = 40$, which is equivalent to $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$. Then, we solve the quadratic equation $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ for a given $x$ and $y$ that satisfy the equation $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$. Finally, we find the minimum value of this expression.

Steps:

1. Rewrite the equation $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$ as $|2y-x| + |2x-y| = 40$. This is equivalent to the original equation.

2. Let $u = x - 2y$ and $v = y - 2x$. Then the equation becomes $|u| + |v| = 40$. From this equation, we can deduce that $u$ and $v$ have the same absolute value, so $u = -v$. This implies $x - 2y = - (y - 2x)$, which simplifies to $3x = 3y$, or $x = y$.

3. Substitute $x = y$ into the equation $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$, we get $10x^2 - 8x^2 = 2x^2$. To find the minimum value of this expression, we take the derivative with respect to $x$ and set it equal to zero. The derivative is $4x$, and setting it to zero gives $x = 0$. Substituting $x = 0$ back into the equation $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$, we get $|y| + |-2y| = 40$, which simplifies to $3|y| = 40$, and then $|y| = \frac{40}{3}$.

4. Substituting $x = 0$ and $|y| = \frac{40}{3}$ back into the equation $2x^2$, we get $2 \cdot 0^2 = 0$.

So the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ when $x$ and $y$ range over all real numbers such that $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$ is 0. The answer is: $\boxed{0}$.
