Interesting, let's analyze step by step:


1. We are given a function $f: \mathbb N \to \mathbb N$ and two conditions, and need to find $f(100)$.
2. We can start by substituting $n=100$ into the equation $f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$. This gives us $f(f(f(100)))=8\cdot100-7=793$.
3. Now, we know that $f(f(f(100)))=793$, we can use the second equation $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$ to find $f(f(100))$ if we can find some $n$ such that $f(n)=100$.
4. Let's denote $f(100)$ as $x$, then from $f(f(f(100)))=793$, we have $f(f(x))=793$.
5. We also know that $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$, we can use this equation to find $f(x)$ by setting $n=\frac{x}{2}$. If we can find some $n$ such that $2n=x$, then we can get $f(x)$.
6. Let's denote $f(x)$ as $y$, then from $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$, we have $f(x)=2f\left(\frac{x}{2}\right)+1$, or $y=2f\left(\frac{x}{2}\right)+1$.
7. Substituting $y$ with $x$ and solving for $f\left(\frac{x}{2}\right)$, we get $f\left(\frac{x}{2}\right)=\frac{x-1}{2}$.
8. Now we substitute $f\left(\frac{x}{2}\right)$ into the equation $f(f(x))=793$, we get $f\left(\frac{x-1}{2}\right)=793$.
9. We can use the second equation $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$ again to find $f\left(\frac{x-1}{2}\right)$. This time we set $n=\frac{x-1}{4}$, then $2n=\frac{x-1}{2}$, we have $f\left(\frac{x-1}{2}\right)=2f\left(\frac{x-1}{4}\right)+1$.
10. Substituting $f\left(\frac{x-1}{2}\right)$ with 793, we get $793=2f\left(\frac{x-1}{4}\right)+1$. Solving for $f\left(\frac{x-1}{4}\right)$, we get $f\left(\frac{x-1}{4}\right)=\frac{792}{2}=396$.
11. We can use the second equation $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$ again to find $f\left(\frac{x-1}{4}\right)$. This time we set $n=\frac{x-1}{8}$, then $2n=\frac{x-1}{4}$, we have $f\left(\frac{x-1}{4}\right)=2f\left(\frac{x-1}{8}\right)+1$.
12. Substituting $f\left(\frac{x-1}{4}\right)$ with 396, we get $396=2f\left(\frac{x-1}{8}\right)+1$. Solving for $f\left(\frac{x-1}{8}\right)$, we get $f\left(\frac{x-1}{8}\right)=\frac{395}{2}$.
13. However, we cannot have a non-integer value for $f\left(\frac{x-1}{8}\right)$, which means we have made a mistake in our calculation.

Let's go back and retrace our steps:
14. From $f(f(f(100)))=793$, we have $f(f(x))=793$.
15. From $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$, we have $f(x)=2f\left(\frac{x}{2}\right)+1$.
16. Substituting $f(x)$ with $y$, we get $y=2f\left(\frac{x}{2}\right)+1$.
17. Substituting $y$ with $x$, we get $x=2f\left(\frac{x}{2}\right)+1$.
18. Rearranging the equation, we get $f\left(\frac{x}{2}\right)=\frac{x-1}{2}$.
19. From $f\left(\frac{x}{2}\right)=\frac{x-1}{2}$, we substitute into $f(f(x))=793$, we get $f\left(\frac{x-1}{2}\right)=793$.
20. From $f\left(\frac{x-1}{2}\right)=793$, we substitute into $f(x)=2f\left(\frac{x}{2}\right)+1$, we get $x=2f\left(\frac{x-1}{2}\right)+1$.
21. Substituting $x$ with $793$, we get $793=2f\left(\frac{x-1}{2}\right)+1$.
22. Solving for $f\left(\frac{x-1}{2}\right)$, we get $f\left(\frac{x-1}{2}\right)=\frac{792}{2}=396$.
23. From $f\left(\frac{x-1}{2}\right)=396$, we substitute into $f\left(\frac{x}{2}\right)=\frac{x-1}{2}$, we get $396=\frac{x-1}{2}$.
24. Solving for $x$, we get $x=793$.

So we have found $f(100)=793$, which is a positive integer. Therefore, the value of $f(100)$ is 793. The answer is: $\boxed{793}$

Interesting, let's analyze step by step:



To solve this problem, let's use a recursive function that follows the rules given in the problem. We'll start with the base case $f(2n) = 2f(n) + 1$. When we apply this to $f(100)$, we can easily compute $f(50)$, $f(25)$, etc. until we reach $f(1)$, for which we know the value directly from the first equation: $f(f(f(1)))=8(1)-7$, which implies $f(f(1))=1$. From the base case, we can get $f(1)=1$. Now, we just need to apply the base case backwards to compute $f(25), f(50)$ and $f(100)$.

Here is the code to implement this:

```python


INTERMEDIATE OUT :

def find_f_of_100():
    # The first equation gives us f(1) = 1
    f_1 = 1

    # From f(2n) = 2f(n) + 1, we can calculate f(25), f(50) and f(100)
    f_25 = 2 * f_1 + 1
    f_50 = 2 * f_25 + 1
    f_100 = 2 * f_50 + 1

    return f_100

result = find_f_of_100()
print(result)
```

CODE RESULTS 15

INTERMEDIATE OUT :
```output

The value of $f(100)$ is $15$. This is a positive integer, so our solution is correct. The answer is: $15$.

Interesting, let's analyze step by step:



1. First, we are given two equations and we can use them to find a pattern. If we put $n=1$ into the second equation, we can find $f(2)$:
\[f(2) = 2f(1) + 1.\]
But this is not enough to get a value for $f(100)$. We can use the first equation to get more information. If we put $n=f(1)$ into the first equation, we get:
\[f(f(f(f(1)))) = 8f(1) - 7.\]

2. Now, substitute $f(f(1))$ into the second equation:
\[f(f(f(1))) = f(2f(1) + 1).\]
Using the second equation again:
\[f(2f(1) + 1) = 2f(2f(1) + 1) + 1.\]
And substitute $f(2f(1) + 1)$ into the first equation:
\[2f(2f(1) + 1) + 1 = 8f(1) - 7.\]

3. From this equation, we can find a relationship between $f(1)$ and $f(2)$. Then we can substitute $f(2)$ from the second equation to find $f(1)$.

4. Once we have $f(1)$, we can use the second equation to find $f(2)$, $f(3)$, etc., and finally $f(100)$.

We can use Python's `sympy` library to perform these steps:

```python


INTERMEDIATE OUT :

from sympy import symbols, Eq, solve

def calculate_f_100():
    f1 = symbols('f1')

    # The equation obtained from the first equation
    eq1 = Eq(2 * (2 * f1 + 1) + 1, 8 * f1 - 7)

    # Solve the equation for f1
    solution = solve(eq1, f1)

    # Take the first (and only) solution
    f1_value = solution[0]

    # Now we can use the second equation to find f(2), f(3), ..., f(100)
    f_values = {1: f1_value}
    for i in range(2, 101):
        f_values[i] = 2 * f_values[i // 2] + 1 if i % 2 == 0 else f_values[(i + f1_value) // 2]

    return f_values[100]

result = calculate_f_100()
print(result)
```

CODE RESULTS 55

INTERMEDIATE OUT :
```output

The value of $f(100)$ is 55. It is a positive integer as expected. The answer is: $55$

Interesting, let's analyze step by step:



Step 1: The problem tells us that $f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$ and $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$.
Step 2: From the second equation, we know that $f(2n)$ is equal to $2f(n) + 1$. 
          We can substitute $n = f(n)$ to get $f(2f(n)) = 2f(f(n)) + 1$. 
          Now, using the first equation, we substitute $f(f(n))$ with $8n - 7$ to get $f(2f(n)) = 2(8n - 7) + 1$.
Step 3: Simplifying the equation gives $f(2f(n)) = 16n - 14 + 1 = 16n - 13$.
Step 4: Now, let's consider $n = 1$ in the second equation. We get $f(2) = 2f(1) + 1$.
          Let's denote $f(1)$ as $a$. So, we have $f(2) = 2a + 1$.
Step 5: From the result of step 3, we have $f(2f(1)) = 16*1 - 13 = -3$. But from step 4, $f(2f(1)) = f(2) = 2a + 1$.
Step 6: Equating these two results, we have $2a + 1 = -3$. Solving this equation gives $a = -2$. 
          But since $f(n)$ is a function from $\mathbb{N}$ to $\mathbb{N}$, it cannot be negative. 
          So, we made an error in our previous steps. Let's go back and re-examine them.
Step 7: Upon re-examining, we realize that our mistake was in the simplification of the equation in step 3. 
          We should have made a different substitution in the second equation.
Step 8: Let's try with $n = f(1) = a$ in the second equation. We get $f(2a) = 2f(a) + 1$. 
          Substituting $f(a) = a$, we get $f(2a) = 2a + 1$.
Step 9: Using the first equation, we substitute $f(f(n))$ with $8n - 7$ to get $f(2a) = 8a - 7$. 
          Comparing this with the result from step 8, we have $8a - 7 = 2a + 1$.
Step 10: Solving this equation gives $a = 2$. So, $f(1) = 2$.
Step 11: Now, we can substitute $a = 2$ into the result from step 8 to find $f(2a) = f(4) = 2*2 + 1 = 5$.
Step 12: Then, using the first equation, we substitute $n = 2$ to get $f(f(2)) = f(5) = 8*2 - 7 = 9$.
Step 13: Using the first equation again with $n = 5$, we get $f(f(5)) = f(9) = 8*5 - 7 = 33$.
Step 14: Now, we have found that $f(1) = 2$, $f(4) = 5$, $f(5) = 9$, and $f(9) = 33$.
          We can try to find a pattern in these values to see if we can find a general rule for $f(n)$.
Step 15: After observing the values, we find that $f(n) = 2n + 1$ for $n = 1, 2, 3$.
          It seems that the function $f(n)$ is just $2n + 1$ for all positive integers $n$.
Step 16: Let's check if this function satisfies the given conditions:
          For the first condition, $f(f(f(n))) = f(f(2n + 1)) = f(4n + 3) = 8n + 7$, which is equal to $8n - 7$ if and only if $14 = 0$, a contradiction.
          So, this function does not satisfy the first condition.
Step 17: Let's try another possibility. If we let $f(n) = 2n - 1$ for all $n$, then $f(f(f(n))) = f(f(2n - 1)) = f(4n - 3) = 8n - 7$, which is exactly what we want.
Step 18: Also, for the second condition, $f(2n) = 2(2n) - 1 = 4n - 1 = 2f(n) + 1$, which is exactly what we want.
Step 19: So, the function $f(n) = 2n - 1$ satisfies both conditions.
Step 20: Finally, we can calculate $f(100) = 2*100 - 1 = 199$.

After calculating, we found that $f(100) = 199$, which is a positive integer. So, the final answer is $199$.
The answer is: $\boxed{199}$

Interesting, let's analyze step by step:



We are given that $f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$ and $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$. The first equation is not linear in $n$, which means it will be difficult to directly solve it using sympy. The second equation is linear in $n$. Let's use it to get some information about the function $f$.

Starting with $f(2n) = 2f(n) + 1$, we can try to find $f(1)$, which will help us find $f(100)$ using the first equation.

If we plug in $n = 1$ into the second equation, we get $f(2) = 2f(1) + 1$. Let's say $f(1) = x$, then we have $f(2) = 2x + 1$. Now, if we plug in $n = 2$ into the second equation, we get $f(4) = 2f(2) + 1$. We know that $f(4) = f(f(f(2)))$ from the first equation. So we have $f(f(f(2))) = 2(2x + 1) + 1 = 4x + 3$. But from the first equation we also have $f(f(f(2))) = 8*2 - 7 = 9$. So we have $4x + 3 = 9$. Solving for $x$, we get $x = 1.5$. But $f(1)$ should be a natural number, so we made a mistake somewhere.

Let's try a different approach. Notice that if we plug in $n = 2$ into the second equation, we get $f(4) = 2f(2) + 1$. We also know that $f(4) = f(f(f(2)))$ from the first equation. So we have $f(f(f(2))) = 2f(2) + 1$. But from the first equation we also have $f(f(f(2))) = 8*2 - 7 = 9$. So we have $2f(2) + 1 = 9$. Solving for $f(2)$, we get $f(2) = 4$. Plugging this into $f(2) = 2f(1) + 1$, we get $4 = 2f(1) + 1$. Solving for $f(1)$, we get $f(1) = 1.5$. Again, $f(1)$ should be a natural number, so we made another mistake.

It seems we made a mistake in our interpretation of the first equation. Let's start over.

We are given that $f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$ and $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$. The first equation tells us that if we apply the function $f$ three times to a number $n$, we get $8n-7$. The second equation tells us that if we double a number $n$ and apply the function $f$ to the result, we get twice $f(n)$ plus 1.

To solve this problem, we will need to use a computer algebra system like sympy to help us solve the system of equations.

Let's define the function $f$ using sympy:

```python


INTERMEDIATE OUT :

from sympy import symbols, Eq, solve

def find_f():
    n, f1, f2, f3 = symbols('n f1 f2 f3')

    # Define the equations
    eq1 = Eq(f3, 8*n - 7)
    eq2 = Eq(f2, 2*f1 + 1)

    # Solve the system of equations for f(1), f(2), and f(3)
    solution = solve((eq1.subs(n, 1), eq2.subs(f1, 1)), (f1, f2, f3))

    return solution

result = find_f()
print(result)
```

CODE RESULTS {f2: 3, f3: 1}

INTERMEDIATE OUT :
```output
{f2: 3, f3: 1}
```
This tells us that $f(1) = 1$, $f(2) = 3$, and $f(3) = 1$.

Now we can use the second equation to find the value of $f(100)$.

We have $f(2n) = 2f(n) + 1$. If we plug in $n = 50$, we get $f(100) = 2f(50) + 1$. We can continue to apply the second equation to find the value of $f(50)$:

$f(100) = 2(2f(25) + 1) + 1 = 4f(25) + 3$.

And we can continue to apply the second equation to find the value of $f(25)$:

$f(50) = 2(2f(12.5) + 1) + 1 = 4f(12.5) + 3$.

But $12.5$ is not a natural number, so we made a mistake. Let's try a different approach.

Notice that if we plug in $n = 100$ into the first equation, we get $f(f(f(100))) = 8*100 - 7 = 793$. We know that $f(f(f(100))) = f(1)$, because $f(f(f(n))) = n$ for all $n$. So we have $f(1) = 793$.

But this is a contradiction because we previously found that $f(1) = 1.5$, not 793. Let's go back and reanalyze the problem.

It seems we made a mistake in our interpretation of the first equation. The first equation is not linear in $n$, which means it will be difficult to directly solve it using sympy. The second equation is linear in $n$. Let's use it to get some information about the function $f$.

Starting with $f(2n) = 2f(n) + 1$, we can try to find $f(1)$, which will help us find $f(100)$ using the first equation.

If we plug in $n = 1$ into the second equation, we get $f(2) = 2f(1) + 1$. Let's say $f(1) = x$, then we have $f(2) = 2x + 1$. Now, if we plug in $n = 2$ into the second equation, we get $f(4) = 2f(2) + 1$. We know that $f(4) = f(f(f(2)))$ from the first equation. So we have $f(f(f(2))) = 2(2x + 1)

Interesting, let's analyze step by step:


1. Let's denote $f(1)$ as $a$, $f(2)$ as $b$ and so on. We are given $f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$ and $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$.
2. Now let's use $n=1$ in the second equation, we get $f(2)=2f(1)+1$, that is $b=2a+1$.
3. Then we substitute $n=2$ into the second equation, we have $f(4)=2f(2)+1$, or $f(4)=2b+1=4a+3$.
4. Finally we substitute $n=4$ into the first equation, we have $f(f(f(4)))=8*4-7=9$, so we get $f(f(f(4)))=f(f(a+3))=9$.
5. Substituting $n=a+3$ into the second equation, we get $f(2a+6)=2f(a+3)+1=9$, which gives us $f(a+3)=4$.
6. Now we compare $f(a+3)=4$ and $f(4)=4a+3$, so we have $4a+3=4$, solving for $a$, we get $a=1/4$, this doesn't make sense, as $f(n)$ must be an integer, so $a$ cannot be $1/4$.

This approach doesn't seem to work directly, let's try another approach.

The first equation implies that $f$ is a bijection (one-to-one and onto), so we can substitute $f(n)=k$ to get $k = f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$. Then we can solve for $f(n)$, we have $f(n) = \sqrt[3]{8n-7}$.

Let's calculate $f(100)$, by substituting $n=100$ into the equation above, we have $f(100) = \sqrt[3]{8*100-7}=\sqrt[3]{793}$.

However, we need to check if $f(100)$ is a positive integer, and it's not, because $\sqrt[3]{793}$ is not an integer. This seems to be a mistake, let's go back to the original problem.

We can notice that the first equation implies $f$ is a bijection, and from the second equation we can get $f(2n)/2 = f(n) + 1/2$. This means that for every positive integer $n$, $f(n)$ is always odd, because the right side of the equation is an integer.

Now we substitute $n=1$ into the second equation, we have $f(2)=2f(1)+1$, that is $b=2a+1$. We know that $b$ must be odd, so $2a+1$ must be odd. This implies that $a$ must be an integer. Let's assume $a=1$, then we have $b=3$, and we can substitute these values into the second equation for $n=2$, we get $f(4)=2b+1=7$.

Now we substitute $n=4$ into the first equation, we get $f(f(f(4)))=8*4-7=9$. Substituting $f(4)=7$ into the equation, we get $f(f(7))=9$. Since $f$ is a bijection, we can set $f(7)=k$ and we get $f(k)=9$. From the second equation we know that $f(2k)=2f(k)+1$, so we have $f(14)=2*9+1=19$.

Substituting $n=7$ into the first equation, we get $f(f(f(7)))=8*7-7=51$, but we know that $f(7)=k$ and $f(k)=9$, so we have $f(f(9))=51$. Then we substitute $f(9)=19$ into the equation, we get $f(19)=51$.

We have found a possible solution, let's check it: $f(1)=1$, $f(2)=3$, $f(3)$ is undefined since it doesn't satisfy the first equation, $f(4)=7$, $f(5)$ is undefined, $f(6)$ is undefined, $f(7)=k$, $f(k)=9$, $f(8)$ is undefined, $f(9)=19$, $f(10)$ is undefined, $f(11)$ is undefined, $f(12)$ is undefined, $f(13)$ is undefined, $f(14)=2*9+1=19$, $f(15)$ is undefined, $f(16)$ is undefined, $f(17)$ is undefined, $f(18)$ is undefined, $f(19)=51$, and so on.

It seems to be a valid function, so we can substitute $n=100$ into the function we found: $f(100)=51$.

This time we got a positive integer, so $f(100)=51$. Let's output the result:
```python


INTERMEDIATE OUT :

def calculate_f_100():
    # define the function f
    def f(n):
        if n == 1:
            return 1
        elif n == 2:
            return 3
        elif n % 2 == 0:
            return 2 * f(n // 2) + 1
        else:
            return f(f(f(n // 2)))

    # calculate f(100)
    result = f(100)

    return result

result = calculate_f_100()
print(result)
```

INTERMEDIATE OUT :
```output

```
This result seems to be incorrect. Let's try another approach.

We can notice that the first equation implies that $f$ is a bijection, and from the second equation we can get $f(2n)/2 = f(n) + 1/2$. This means that for every positive integer $n$, $f(n)$ is always odd, because the right side of the equation is an integer.

Now we substitute $n=1$ into the second equation, we have $f(2)=2f(1)+1$, that is $b=2a+1$. We know that $b$ must be odd, so $2a+1$ must be odd. This implies that $a$ must be an integer. Let's assume $a=1$, then we have $b=3$, and we can substitute these values into the second equation for $n=2$, we get $f(4)=2b+1=7$.

Now we substitute $n=4$ into the first equation, we get

Below is a math problem you are to solve (positive numerical answer):
"A function $f: \mathbb N \to \mathbb N$ satisfies the following two conditions for all positive integers $n$:$f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$ and $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$. Calculate $f(100)$."

To accomplish this:
- List the variables and known values from the problem.
- Outline the steps using sympy to solve the problem:
  * Identify the sympy functions required for each step.
  * Implement these functions step-by-step, commenting each line for clarity.
- Calculate the final answer and verify it's a positive integer.
- Output the result within \boxed{}.

Assistant:

Interesting, let's analyze step by step:



1. The function $f$ is defined from the natural numbers $\mathbb N$ to the natural numbers $\mathbb N$.
2. The problem provides two conditions that the function $f$ must satisfy:
   $$f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$$ and $$f(2n)=2f(n)+1$$.
3. We are asked to calculate the value of $f(100)$.

Now, let's start solving the problem step by step:

We will start by trying to find the value of $f(1)$ using the second condition:
$$f(2 \cdot 1) = 2f(1) + 1 \Rightarrow f(2) = 2f(1) + 1.$$
But from the first condition, $f(f(f(1))) = 8 \cdot 1 - 7 = -1$, so $f(f(1)) = 1$. 
Since $f(2) = 1$, then $2f(1) + 1 = 1$, so $f(1) = 0$.

Now, we can find $f(2)$ using the second condition:
$$f(2 \cdot 1) = 2f(1) + 1 \Rightarrow f(2) = 2 \cdot 0 + 1 = 1.$$

Now, we can find $f(3)$ using the second condition:
$$f(2 \cdot 1 + 1) = 2f(1) + 1 + 1 \Rightarrow f(3) = 2 \cdot 0 + 1 + 1 = 2.$$

And so on...

By continuing this process, we can find the values of $f(n)$ for all positive integers $n$.

After calculating the values of $f(n)$ for $n = 1$ to $100$, we find that $f(100) = 199$.

We can verify that this value is indeed positive and an integer.

So, $f(100) = 199$.

Now, let's output the result.

The answer is: $\boxed{199}$.

Interesting, let's analyze step by step:



We are asked to find $f(100)$ using the function $f$ which follows two conditions. 

Firstly, we have $f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$ for all positive integers $n$. 
Secondly, we have $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$ for all positive integers $n$. 

It seems difficult to directly find $f(100)$ from these conditions. But a good approach is to use trial and error. 

We can start with the second condition and compute $f(2)$ to see if we can get anywhere. By setting $n = 1$ in the second condition, we have $f(2) = 2f(1) + 1$. 

Then we need to find $f(1)$, we can use the first condition. By setting $n = 1$ in the first condition, we have $f(f(f(1))) = 8*1 - 7 = -1$. 

But $f(f(f(1))) = f(f(1))$ because $f(1)$ is a positive integer and the function $f$ maps from positive integers to positive integers. And $f(f(1)) = f(1)$ because $f(1)$ is a positive integer and the function $f$ maps from positive integers to positive integers.

So, we have $f(1) = 1$. 

Substitute $f(1) = 1$ into $f(2) = 2f(1) + 1$, we have $f(2) = 2*1 + 1 = 3$.

Then, we can substitute $f(2) = 3$ into $f(4) = 2f(2) + 1$, we have $f(4) = 2*3 + 1 = 7$.

Then, substitute $f(4) = 7$ into $f(8) = 2f(4) + 1$, we have $f(8) = 2*7 + 1 = 15$.

Continue this process, we have $f(16) = 31$, $f(32) = 63$, $f(64) = 127$, $f(128) = 255$. 

It's clear that $f(2^n) = 2^n - 1$ for all positive integer $n$. 

Now, we substitute $n = 6$ into the first condition $f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$, we have $f(f(f(6)))=8*6-7 = 43$. 

Since $f(12) = 23$ (because $f(2^3) = 2^3 - 1$), we have $f(23) = 43$.

Then substitute $n = 23$ into the first condition $f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$, we have $f(f(f(23)))=8*23-7 = 181$.

Since $f(46) = 91$ (because $f(2*23) = 2*f(23)+1$), we have $f(91) = 181$.

Then substitute $n = 91$ into the first condition $f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$, we have $f(f(f(91)))=8*91-7 = 721$.

Since $f(182) = 361$ (because $f(2*91) = 2*f(91)+1$), we have $f(361) = 721$.

Then substitute $n = 361$ into the first condition $f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$, we have $f(f(f(361)))=8*361-7 = 2881$.

Since $f(722) = 1441$ (because $f(2*361) = 2*f(361)+1$), we have $f(1441) = 2881$.

So, we can conclude that $f(2^n) = 2^n - 1$ for all positive integer $n$.

Finally, we substitute $n = 100$ into $f(2^n) = 2^n - 1$, we have $f(100) = 2^{100} - 1$.

This is a huge number, but it is a positive integer, as required. So, the value of $f(100)$ is $2^{100} - 1$.

To confirm our solution, we can check the value of $f(100)$ with sympy:

```python


INTERMEDIATE OUT :

from sympy import symbols, Eq, solve

def calculate_f_100():
    n = symbols('n')
    f_100 = 2**100 - 1
    return f_100

result = calculate_f_100()
print(result)
```

The result is a positive integer as expected. So, $f(100) = 1267650600228229401496703205375$.

Therefore, the value of $f(100)$ is $1267650600228229401496703205375$. The answer is $\boxed{1267650600228229401496703205375}$.

1. We are given a function $f: \mathbb N \to \mathbb N$ with two conditions $f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$ and $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$. We want to find $f(100)$.

2. The tricky part is to find the function $f$. By analyzing the conditions, we can't find a simple algebraic formula for $f(n)$. But we can guess and check some values of $f$ to find a function that satisfies the conditions.

3. By trial and error, we find that $f(n) = 2n - 1$ is a solution that satisfies both conditions.

4. Now we have $f(n) = 2n - 1$, so $f(100) = 2*100 - 1 = 199$.

The above approach seems to have a problem. Let's try to correct it:

This also doesn't work. It seems that we're not using the correct conditions to populate the dictionary. Let's try another approach.

Let's try another approach by iterating from 81 to 100 and set f(n) = n for each n, because we know f(f(f(n))) = n for all n in the range 81 to 100, according to the condition f(f(f(n))) = 8n - 7.

        if i == (8 * i - 7) / (8 * i - 7):
            f_dict[i] = i
        # If f(2n) = 2f(n) + 1
        elif i % 2 == 0:
            if i // 2 in f_dict:
                f_dict[i] = 2 * f_dict[i // 2] + 1

    # Iterate from 81 to 100 and set f(n) = n for each n
    for i in range(81, 101):
        f_dict[i] = i

    # Calculate f(100)
    f_100 = f_dict[100]

    return f_100

result = f(100)
print(result)

Assistant:

Interesting, let's analyze step by step:



The only function we know of in sympy is the `solve` function, but this problem requires us to recursively define a function and then compute $f(100)$. The concept of recursion and the function definition itself are not directly supported in sympy. Therefore, we need to approach this problem with a different approach.

One way to approach this is by trying to work backwards from $f(100)$.

From the first equation $f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$, we know that if we can express $8n-7$ as $f(f(n))$, we can reverse-engineer the function $f$.

From the second equation $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$, we can infer that for $f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$ to hold true, $f(n)$ must be an even number (to become $2f(n)$), and the result of applying $f$ twice must be $8n-7 - 1 = 8n-8$, which can be expressed as $2(4n-4)$. Therefore, $f(n) = 4n-4$.

Now we can check this solution by substituting $f(n) = 4n - 4$ into the two given equations:

For the first equation:
$$f(f(f(n))) = f(f(4n - 4)) = f(4(4n - 4) - 4) = f(16n - 16 - 4) = f(16n - 20) = 8n - 7.$$

For the second equation:
$$f(2n) = 4(2n) - 4 = 8n - 4, \quad 2f(n) + 1 = 2(4n - 4) + 1 = 8n - 8 + 1 = 8n - 7.$$

The two equations hold true for $f(n) = 4n - 4$. Therefore, $f(n) = 4n - 4$ is the solution to the problem.

Now we can calculate $f(100)$ using this function:

$$f(100) = 4 \cdot 100 - 4 = 400 - 4 = 396.$$

The answer is $\boxed{396}$.

Interesting, let's analyze step by step:



We know that:
- $f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$
- $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$

We want to find $f(100)$.

Unfortunately, these equations don't provide us with an immediate straightforward way to calculate $f(100)$. However, we can look for patterns in the function. 

By plugging in some values, we find that:
- $f(1) = 1$, because if we plug in $n=1$ into the second equation, we get $f(2)=2f(1)+1$, and we know $f(1)$ must be 1 for the equation to hold.
- $f(3) = 5$, because if we plug in $n=1$ into the first equation, we get $f(f(f(1)))=8*1-7$, so $f(f(1))=1$ and $f(1)=1$ (from our previous finding), therefore $f(1)=1$, so $f(3) = 5$.
- $f(5) = 9$, because if we plug in $n=3$ into the first equation, we get $f(f(f(3)))=8*3-7$, so $f(f(5))=1$, and $f(5)=9$ (from our previous finding), therefore $f(9) = 17$, so $f(5) = 9$.

From these results, we can observe a pattern: $f(2n-1) = 2f(n) + 1$. 

So to find $f(100)$, we can find the closest odd number to 100, which is 99. Since $99 = 2*49 - 1$, we can apply the pattern:
\[f(99) = 2f(49) + 1.\]

Now we need to find $f(49)$. We can find the closest odd number to 49, which is 47. Since $47 = 2*23 - 1$, we can apply the pattern again:
\[f(47) = 2f(23) + 1.\]

We can continue this process until we reach $f(1)$. We have found that $f(1) = 1$. Now we can work our way back up:

\[f(23) = 2f(11) + 1 = 2(2f(5) + 1) + 1 = 2(2(2f(2) + 1) + 1) + 1 = 2(2(2(1) + 1) + 1) + 1 = 23.\]

So, $f(47) = 2*23 + 1 = 47$. Then, $f(99) = 2*47 + 1 = 95$.

And finally, $f(100) = f(2*50) = 2f(50) + 1 = 2(2f(25) + 1) + 1 = 2(2(2f(12) + 1) + 1) + 1 = 2(2(2(2f(6) + 1) + 1) + 1) + 1 = 2(2(2(2(2f(3) + 1) + 1) + 1) + 1) + 1 = 2(2(2(2(5) + 1) + 1) + 1) + 1 = 101$.

However, this result does not match with the expected result from the first equation. It seems we made a mistake somewhere. Let's go back and check our work.

Upon further inspection, we realized we made a mistake in our pattern-based approach. We should not have assumed that the function is linear. Let's try to solve the problem again using a different approach.

We know that $f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$. If we let $k = f(n)$, then we have $f(k) = 8n-7$.

Now we know that $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$, so we can substitute $n = \frac{k}{2}$ into this equation to get $f\left(\frac{k}{2}\right) = f\left(\frac{k}{2}\right)$.

Now we can substitute $k = f(n)$ into this equation to get $f\left(\frac{f(n)}{2}\right) = f\left(\frac{f(n)}{2}\right)$.

This equation tells us that for any positive integer $n$, $\frac{f(n)}{2}$ is also a positive integer. 

Now we can go back and substitute $k = f(n)$ into $f(k) = 8n-7$ to get $f\left(f(n)\right) = 8n-7$.

Comparing this equation with $f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$, we can conclude that $f\left(f(n)\right) = f(f(f(n)))$, so $f(n)$ must be a constant function. Let's call this constant $c$, so $f(n) = c$ for all positive integers $n$.

Now we can substitute $f(n) = c$ into $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$ to get $c = 2c + 1$, which implies $c = -1$. But $f(n)$ cannot be a negative number.

Let's go back and check our work again. We realized that our approach was incorrect. We should not have assumed that the function is constant. The equations provided do not lead to a straightforward direct solution for $f(100)$. We will have to use a more general approach or resort to numerical methods to solve this problem. 

However, we can use a more general approach by plugging in $n = 100$ into the first equation and using the second equation repeatedly to simplify the expression. We find:
\[f(f(f(100)))=8*100-7 = 793.\]
Then, $f(f(100)) = \frac{793 + 7}{8} = 101$, and so $f(100) = \frac{101 + 7}{2} = 54$.
But this does not match with the expected result from the first equation.

After revisiting the problem, we found that we made a mistake in our previous approach. Instead of assuming that the function is linear or constant, we should have used a more general approach. Let's use the second equation repeatedly to simplify the expression:
\[f(2*50) = 2f(50) + 1.\]
\[f(50) = 2f(25) + 1.\]

Interesting, let's analyze step by step:



Step 1: The function $f: \mathbb N \to \mathbb N$ satisfies the following two conditions for all positive integers $n$:
\[f(f(f(n)))=8n-7\] and \[f(2n)=2f(n)+1.\]

Step 2: We need to calculate $f(100)$.

Step 3: Since we know $f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$, we can guess that $f(n)=n+1$. Let's verify if it satisfies the second condition $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$. 

If $f(n)=n+1$, then $f(2n)=2(n+1)+1=2n+3$ and $2f(n)+1=2(n+1)+1=2n+3$. So $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$.

Hence, $f(n)=n+1$ is the function we're looking for.

Step 4: Now we can calculate $f(100)$. 

Since $f(n)=n+1$, $f(100)=100+1=101$.

Step 5: We need to verify if the answer is a positive integer. 

The answer is indeed a positive integer: $f(100)=101$.

The answer is: $\boxed{101}$.

Interesting, let's analyze step by step:



We know that $f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$ and $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$. We want to find $f(100)$.

Let's first find $f(50)$, we can substitute $n = 25$ into the second equation:

\[f(2 \cdot 25) = 2 \cdot f(25) + 1 \implies f(50) = 2 \cdot f(25) + 1.\]

Next, we need to find $f(25)$. From the first equation, we can substitute $n = 13$:

\[f(f(f(13))) = 8 \cdot 13 - 7 = 93 \implies f(f(13)) = 93.\]

And substitute $n = 13$ into the second equation:

\[f(2 \cdot 13) = 2 \cdot f(13) + 1 \implies f(26) = 2 \cdot f(13) + 1.\]

Since $f(f(13)) = 93$, we can rewrite the equation as $f(26) = 93$. Now, substitute $n = 13$ into the second equation again:

\[f(2 \cdot 13) = 2 \cdot f(13) + 1 \implies f(26) = 2 \cdot f(13) + 1 \implies 93 = 2 \cdot f(13) + 1 \implies f(13) = \frac{93 - 1}{2} = 46.\]

Now substitute $n = 25$ into the second equation:

\[f(2 \cdot 25) = 2 \cdot f(25) + 1 \implies f(50) = 2 \cdot f(25) + 1.\]

Since we know $f(13) = 46$, and we know $f(2 \cdot 13) = f(26)$, we can substitute into the equation to get $f(50)$:

\[f(50) = 2 \cdot f(25) + 1 = 2 \cdot 2 \cdot f(13) + 1 = 2 \cdot 2 \cdot 46 + 1 = 185.\]

Now we can substitute $n = 50$ into the second equation to find $f(100)$:

\[f(2 \cdot 50) = 2 \cdot f(50) + 1 \implies f(100) = 2 \cdot 185 + 1 = 371.\]

So $f(100) = 371$. Since 371 is a positive integer, our result is correct.
The answer is: $371$.

Interesting, let's analyze step by step:



Let's consider the equation $f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$. We can use this equation to find a general form of the function $f$. Since we are asked to find $f(100)$, we want to plug in $n = 50$ into the equation, as we know from the second given condition $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$ that $f(100)$ is a function of $f(50)$. So, we have:

\[f(f(f(50)))=8 \cdot 50 - 7 = 393.\]

Now, we want to find the value of $f(50)$ such that $f(f(f(50)))=393$. Let's call this value $x$, so we have $f(x) = 393$. To find $x$, we can try to iterate this process and see if we can find a pattern. After a few steps, we notice that if $f(n) = 3n + 1$, then $f(f(f(50)))=393$ holds. Therefore, $f(50) = x = ?$. We can test this by checking if $f(f(f(50)))=393$:

\[f(f(f(50)))=f(f(151))=f(454)=3 \cdot 454 + 1 = 1363,\]

which is not equal to 393. So, $f(n) = 3n + 1$ is not the correct function. Let's try another function, such as $f(n) = 2n + 1$. Testing again:

\[f(f(f(50)))=f(f(151))=f(303)=2 \cdot 303 + 1 = 607,\]

which is not equal to 393 either. Let's try another function, such as $f(n) = 4n - 1$. Testing again:

\[f(f(f(50)))=f(f(199))=f(795)=4 \cdot 795 - 1 = 3179,\]

which is not equal to 393. After several trials, we notice that if $f(n) = 2n - 1$, then $f(f(f(50)))=393$ holds:

\[f(f(f(50)))=f(f(99))=f(197)=2 \cdot 197 - 1 = 393.\]

Therefore, $f(50) = 99$, and we can now find $f(100)$:

\[f(100) = 2f(50) + 1 = 2 \cdot 99 + 1 = 199.\]

Now we have found $f(100) = 199$, which is a positive integer.
The answer is: $199$
