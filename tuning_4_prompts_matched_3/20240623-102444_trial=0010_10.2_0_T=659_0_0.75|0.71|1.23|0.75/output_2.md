 The problem asks for the number of positive integers $m$ such that the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has 4 distinct solutions.

The equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ can be solved by considering the different cases for the absolute values. This will result in a total of 8 different equations to solve. For each of these equations, we need to find the number of distinct solutions.

After solving all these equations and counting the number of distinct solutions for each, we find that only when $m=50$ does the equation have 4 distinct solutions.

So, the number of positive integers $m$ for which the equation has 4 distinct solutions is 1, namely $m=50$. The answer is: $1$

 The equation $| |x - 1| - 2 | = \frac{m}{100}$ has 4 distinct solutions if and only if $\frac{m}{100} = 2$.

To see this, consider the function $f(x) = | |x - 1| - 2 |$. The function $f(x)$ is a "V" shape with its minimum value at $x = 1$. The function $f(x)$ equals 2 at $x = 3$ and $x = -1$, and equals 0 at $x = 1$. The function $f(x)$ is decreasing on the interval $(- \infty, 1]$ and increasing on the interval $[1, \infty)$.

If $| |x - 1| - 2 | = \frac{m}{100}$, then $\frac{m}{100}$ is the height of the "V" shape that we are interested in. If $\frac{m}{100} > 2$, then the equation has no solutions. If $\frac{m}{100} = 2$, then the equation has 4 solutions. If $\frac{m}{100} < 2$, then the equation has 2 solutions.

Therefore, the only value of $m$ that gives 4 solutions is $m = 200$. So the number of positive integers $m$ is 1. The answer is: $1$

"For how many positive integers $m$ does the equation \[\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}\] have $4$ distinct solutions?"
Analyze this problem and think step by step to come to a solution with programs. After solving the problem, output the final numerical answer within \boxed{}.

Assistant:

 The equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has 4 distinct solutions if and only if $\frac{m}{100} = 2$.

This is because the expression inside the absolute value, $\vert x-1 \vert -2$, changes its sign at $x=1$. So, for $x<1$, we have $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert = -(x-1) - 2 = -x + 3$, and for $x>1$, we have $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert = x - 1 - 2 = x - 3$.

Setting these equal to $\frac{m}{100}$, we get two equations:

1. For $x<1$, we have $-x + 3 = \frac{m}{100}$, which gives $x = 3 - \frac{m}{100}$.
2. For $x>1$, we have $x - 3 = \frac{m}{100}$, which gives $x = 3 + \frac{m}{100}$.

The equation has 4 distinct solutions if and only if the two solutions $3 - \frac{m}{100}$ and $3 + \frac{m}{100}$ are both in the intervals $(-\infty, 1)$ and $(1, \infty)$, respectively. This is equivalent to $0 < \frac{m}{100} < 2$, which gives $0 < m < 200$.

Therefore, the only positive integer $m$ that satisfies this condition is $m = 200$.

However, we are asked to find the number of positive integers $m$ that satisfy the condition, not the value of $m$. Since $m = 200$ is the only such integer, the number of positive integers $m$ that satisfy the condition is 1.

Therefore, the number of positive integers $m$ for which the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has 4 distinct solutions is 1. The answer is: $1$

 The number of distinct solutions to the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ is equal to 4 when $\frac{m}{100} = 2$. Therefore, we have $m = 200$.
The answer is: $200$

Assistant:

 The equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has 4 distinct solutions if and only if $\frac{m}{100} = 2$. This is because the expression inside the absolute value, $\vert x-1 \vert -2$, changes its sign at $x=1 \pm 2$, which gives us three transition points: $x= -1$, $x=3$, and $x=1$. For $x<1-2= -1$, the equation simplifies to $-\vert x-1 \vert +2 = \frac{m}{100}$, which has no solution because the left hand side is always non-negative while the right hand side is always non-negative. For $x \in [-1, 1-2]=[-1, -1]$, the equation simplifies to $\vert x-1 \vert -2 = \frac{m}{100}$, which has one solution. For $x \in [1-2, 1+2]=[-1, 3]$, the equation simplifies to $-\vert x-1 \vert +2 = \frac{m}{100}$, which has two solutions. For $x>1+2=3$, the equation simplifies to $\vert x-1 \vert -2 = \frac{m}{100}$, which has one solution. Therefore, the equation has 4 distinct solutions when $\frac{m}{100} = 2$, which gives $m=200$. So the number of positive integers $m$ that satisfy the condition is 1, namely $m=200$. The answer is: $1$
