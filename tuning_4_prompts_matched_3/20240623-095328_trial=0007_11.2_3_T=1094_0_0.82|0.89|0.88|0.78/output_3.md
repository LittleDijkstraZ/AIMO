Below is a math problem you are to solve (positive numerical answer!):
"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"
Analyze this problem and think step by step to come to a solution with programs. After solving the problem, output the final numerical answer within \boxed{}.

Assistant:

 The given equation is equal to zero if either $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$.

For the first two equations, we have $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. This gives us a square with side length 10.
For the last two equations, we have $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$. This gives us a square with side length 16.

The intersection of these two squares is a smaller square with side length 8. Therefore, the area of the convex polygon is $8^2 = 64$. The answer is: $64$

Below is a math problem you are to solve (positive numerical answer!):
"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"
Analyze this problem and think step by step to come to a solution with programs. After solving the problem, output the final numerical answer within \boxed{}.

Assistant:

 The equation is satisfied only when both $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ and $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$, or both $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ and $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$.
This means that either $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$, or $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$.
The first case gives us two lines $x + y = \pm 10$ and $x - y = \pm 10$, which form a square with side length 10.
The second case gives us two lines $x = \pm 8$ and $y = \pm 8$, which also form a square with side length 8.
The total area of the convex polygon is the sum of the areas of these two squares.
The area of a square with side length $a$ is $a^2$, so the area of the first square is $10^2 = 100$, and the area of the second square is $8^2 = 64$.
Therefore, the total area of the convex polygon is $100 + 64 = 164$. The answer is: $164$

The given equation is a product of two expressions equal to zero, which means either the first expression is zero or the second expression is zero.
The first expression is $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)$, and it equals zero if and only if $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$.
These two equations represent two squares with side length 10 centered at the origin. The intersection of these two squares is a square with side length 10 centered at the origin.
The second expression is $((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2)$, and it equals zero if and only if $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$.
This represents a square with side length 16 centered at the origin.
The intersection of the two squares is the convex polygon enclosed by the points satisfying the given equation.
The area of the convex polygon is the area of the square with side length 10, which is $10^2 = 100$. The answer is: $100$

 The given equation is a product of two terms equal to zero. This means that either the first term is zero or the second term is zero.

The first term is $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)$. This term is zero if and only if both $(\vert x + y \vert - 10) = 0$ and $(\vert x - y \vert - 10) = 0$. This implies that $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. The solutions to these equations are the lines $x + y = 10$, $x + y = -10$, $x - y = 10$, and $x - y = -10$.

The second term is $((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2)$. This term is zero if and only if both $(\vert x \vert - 8) = 0$ and $(\vert y \vert - 8) = 0$. This implies that $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$. The solutions to these equations are the lines $x = 8$, $x = -8$, $y = 8$, and $y = -8$.

The intersection points of these lines are $(8, 8)$, $(8, -8)$, $(-8, 8)$, and $(-8, -8)$. These points form a square with side length $16$. The area of this square is $16^2 = 256$. So, the area of the convex polygon is $256$. The answer is: $256$

 The equation $AB=0$ implies that either $A=0$ or $B=0$. Thus, the given equation is equivalent to either $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$.

From $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$, we have $\vert x + y \vert = 10$. This is a square with side length 20.
From $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$, we have $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. This is a square with side length 20.
From $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$, we have $\vert x \vert = 8$, which gives us two lines $x = 8$ and $x = -8$.
From $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$, we have $\vert y \vert = 8$, which gives us two lines $y = 8$ and $y = -8$.

The four squares intersect at the points $(8,8)$, $(8,-8)$, $(-8,8)$, and $(-8,-8)$. The area of the convex polygon is the sum of the areas of the two squares minus the area of the four triangles formed at the intersections. The side length of each square is 20, so the area of each square is $20^2 = 400$. The area of the two squares is $2 \times 400 = 800$. Each triangle has base and height of 8, so the area of each triangle is $\frac{1}{2} \times 8 \times 8 = 32$. The area of the four triangles is $4 \times 32 = 128$.

Therefore, the area of the convex polygon is $800 - 128 = 672$. The answer is: $672$

 The equation given is equivalent to the product of two equations being zero, which means each equation must be zero individually. So we have two systems of equations:

1. $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ and $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$.
2. $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ and $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$.

For the first system, we have $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x \vert = 8$. This implies that $-10 \leq x + y \leq 10$ and $-8 \leq x \leq 8$. Similarly, for the second system, we have $\vert x - y \vert = 10$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$. This implies that $-10 \leq x - y \leq 10$ and $-8 \leq y \leq 8$.

The solutions to these inequalities form a square with side length 16, so the area of the square is $16^2 = 256$.
The answer is: $256$

"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"

The equation given is a product of two terms equal to zero, which means that either the first term is zero or the second term is zero.
The first term is $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)$, and it equals zero if and only if $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$.
The second term is $((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2)$, and it equals zero if and only if $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$.
The solutions to the first set of equations are all points $(x, y)$ such that the distance from $(x, y)$ to the origin is 10, i.e., they lie on a circle of radius 10 centered at the origin.
The solutions to the second set of equations are all points $(x, y)$ such that the distance from $(x, y)$ to the $x$-axis and the $y$-axis is 8, i.e., they lie on a square with side length 16 centered at the origin.
The intersection of these two sets of points is the convex polygon formed by the vertices of the square that lie inside the circle.
The side length of this square is 16, and the radius of the circle is 10, so the square is entirely contained within the circle.
Therefore, the area of the convex polygon is the area of the square, which is $16^2 = 256$. The answer is: $256$

The equation given is a product of two terms equal to zero. This means that either the first term is zero, or the second term is zero, or both are zero. 

The first term is zero when $|\pm x \pm y| = 10$ and the second term is zero when $|\pm x| = 8$ and $|\pm y| = 8$. 

The solutions to $|\pm x \pm y| = 10$ are the lines $x + y = \pm 10$ and $x - y = \pm 10$. 

The solutions to $|\pm x| = 8$ and $|\pm y| = 8$ are the lines $x = \pm 8$ and $y = \pm 8$. 

These lines form a square with side length 16. The area of this square is $16^2 = 256$. 

So, the area of the convex polygon is 256 square units.

Here is a Python code to calculate the area:

```python


INTERMEDIATE OUT :

def area_of_polygon():
    """The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"""
    side_length = 16
    area = side_length ** 2
    return area

result = area_of_polygon()
print(result)
```

CODE RESULTS 256

INTERMEDIATE OUT :
```output
256
```
The area of the convex polygon is 256 square units. The answer is $\boxed{256}$.
