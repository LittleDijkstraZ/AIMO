Interesting, let's analyze step by step:



First, let's observe the equation: $ ((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$.

In order for the product of two numbers to be zero, one or both of them must be zero. Hence, either one of the following conditions must hold:

1. $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$
2. $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$

The second condition implies that $x = \pm 8$ and $y = \pm 8$. So the points lie on a square with side length 16.

The first condition implies that $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. This is only possible if $x = 0$ and $y = 0$.

So the only points that satisfy the equation are the vertices of the square with side length 16. Therefore, the area of the convex polygon is the area of this square, which is $16^2 = 256$.

The value is indeed a positive integer, so the answer is:

The area of this convex polygon is 256 square units.
The answer is: $256$

Interesting, let's analyze step by step:



Step 1: Define the variables and known values
We have two variables, $x$ and $y$. The problem involves absolute values, so we can split the expressions into cases based on the signs of $x$ and $y$.

Step 2: Solve the problem using sympy
We can use sympy to solve this problem step by step.

Step 2.1: Identify the sympy functions required for each step
For each absolute value expression, we need to consider all possible cases. For example, $|x + y|$ can be $x + y$ or $-(x + y)$, depending on the signs of $x$ and $y$. The same goes for $|x - y|$, $|x|$, and $|y|$.

Step 2.2: Implement these functions step-by-step, commenting each line for clarity
We will first solve the equation $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$. This equation is satisfied only when $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. This implies that $x + y = \pm10$ and $x - y = \pm10$. Solving these two equations gives us the possible pairs $(x, y)$ as $(5, 5), (5, -5), (-5, 5),$ and $(-5, -5)$.

Similarly, we can solve the equation $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$. This equation is satisfied only when $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$. This implies that $x = \pm8$ and $y = \pm8$. So the possible pairs $(x, y)$ are $(8, 8), (8, -8), (-8, 8),$ and $(-8, -8)$.

Step 2.3: Combine the solutions from both equations
The solutions from both equations must satisfy both equations simultaneously. By comparing the solutions, we find that the only common solutions are $(5, 5)$ and $(-5, -5)$. So the points that satisfy the given equation are $(5, 5), (-5, -5)$.

Step 3: Calculate the area of the polygon
The points $(5, 5)$ and $(-5, -5)$ form a square with side length $10$. The area of this square is $10^2 = 100$.

Step 4: Verify it's a positive integer
The area of the square is a positive integer, as we found it to be $100$.

Step 5: Output the result
The area of the convex polygon is $\boxed{100}$.
The answer is $\boxed{100}$.

Interesting, let's analyze step by step:



We have an equation of the form $AB = 0$, which is equivalent to $A = 0$ or $B = 0$. So the given equation splits into two cases:

1. $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ and $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ and $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$.
2. $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$.

From the first case, we get $\vert x + y \vert = 10$, $\vert x \vert = 8$, and $\vert y \vert = 8$. This implies that the points are in the rectangle with vertices at $(8,8)$, $(-8,8)$, $(-8,-8)$, and $(8,-8)$.

From the second case, we get $\vert x - y \vert = 10$, which implies that the points are in one of the two diagonals of the rectangle.

Therefore, the points are on the square with side length $16$ centered at the origin. The area of this square is $16^2 = 256$.

```python


INTERMEDIATE OUT :

from sympy import symbols, Rational, simplify

def area_of_square():
    """The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"""
    # Side length of the square
    side_length = 16

    # Area of the square
    area = side_length**2

    return area

result = area_of_square()
print(result)

The area of the convex polygon is $256$ square units. The answer is: $256$

If the product of two numbers is zero, then at least one of the numbers must be zero. So, we can conclude that either $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$.

This implies that either $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ or $\vert x - y \vert = 10$ or $\vert x \vert = 8$ or $\vert y \vert = 8$.

The solutions for $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$ are the lines $x + y = \pm 10$ and $x - y = \pm 10$. The solutions for $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$ are the lines $x = \pm 8$ and $y = \pm 8$.

These lines enclose a square with side length 16 (since the distance between the lines $x = 8$ and $x = -8$ is 16). The area of this square is $16^2 = 256$. So, the area of the convex polygon is 256 square units.

To verify that this area is a positive integer, it's easy to see that 256 is a positive integer. Therefore, the area of the convex polygon is indeed 256 square units. The answer is: $256$
