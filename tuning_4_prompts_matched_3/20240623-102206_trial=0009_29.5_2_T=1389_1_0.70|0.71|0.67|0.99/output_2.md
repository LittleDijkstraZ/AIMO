Interesting, let's analyze step by step:



The equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has 4 distinct solutions. We know that the absolute value function makes the expression inside it non-negative, so we have four cases to consider:

1. When $x-1 \geq 2$, the equation becomes $|x-1-2|=\frac{m}{100}$, or $|x-3|=\frac{m}{100}$.
2. When $1 \geq x-1 \geq -2$, the equation becomes $|1-(x-1)-2|=\frac{m}{100}$, or $|-x-2|=\frac{m}{100}$.
3. When $x-1 \leq -2$, the equation becomes $|-(x-1)-2|=\frac{m}{100}$, or $|-x+3|=\frac{m}{100}$.

Now, let's solve each case:

1. For $|x-3|=\frac{m}{100}$, we have two sub-cases: $x-3=\frac{m}{100}$ and $x-3=-\frac{m}{100}$. Solving these gives $x=3+\frac{m}{100}$ and $x=3-\frac{m}{100}$ respectively.

2. For $|-x-2|=\frac{m}{100}$, we have two sub-cases: $-x-2=\frac{m}{100}$ and $-x-2=-\frac{m}{100}$. Solving these gives $x=-2-\frac{m}{100}$ and $x=-2+\frac{m}{100}$ respectively.

3. For $|-x+3|=\frac{m}{100}$, we have two sub-cases: $-x+3=\frac{m}{100}$ and $-x+3=-\frac{m}{100}$. Solving these gives $x=3-\frac{m}{100}$ and $x=3+\frac{m}{100}$ respectively.

Comparing the solutions from the three cases, we see that the solutions $x=3+\frac{m}{100}$ and $x=3-\frac{m}{100}$ are repeated twice. So, we only need to consider the distinct solutions $x=-2-\frac{m}{100}$, $x=-2+\frac{m}{100}$, $x=2+\frac{m}{100}$, and $x=2-\frac{m}{100}$.

For these solutions to be distinct, we need $-2+\frac{m}{100} > -2-\frac{m}{100}$, which implies $\frac{m}{100} > -\frac{m}{100}$, or $m > 0$. Also, $2+\frac{m}{100} > 2-\frac{m}{100}$, which is always true. So, we need $0 < m < 100$.

The number of positive integers $m$ in the interval $(0, 100)$ is 99. Therefore, there are 99 possible values of $m$ for which the equation has 4 distinct solutions. The answer is: $99$.
The answer is: $99$

Interesting, let's analyze step by step:



The equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has 4 distinct solutions. This means that the right-hand side $\frac{m}{100}$ must be equal to 2. Hence, $m=200$.

Therefore, the number of positive integers $m$ for which the equation has 4 distinct solutions is 1.

The answer is: $1$

Interesting, let's analyze step by step:



The equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has 4 distinct solutions. This means that the right side of the equation, $\frac{m}{100}$, is the value that splits the graph of $f(x) = \vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert$ into 4 distinct pieces.

The function $f(x) = \vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert$ is a "hockey stick" function with 4 pieces. The value of $\frac{m}{100}$ that splits the graph into 4 pieces is between the third and fourth "jumps" of the function.

The third jump occurs when $\frac{m}{100} = 1$, and the fourth jump occurs when $\frac{m}{100} = 2$. So, the value of $m$ that we are looking for is in the range $100 \leq m < 200$.

Therefore, there is only one positive integer $m$ that satisfies the condition, and that is $m = 100 + 1 = 101$.

So the answer is $\boxed{1}$.

Now, we need to verify that this value of $m$ indeed gives us 4 distinct solutions. Let's substitute $m = 200$ into the equation and solve it:

\[\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{200}{100} \Rightarrow \vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=2.\]

This equation has 4 distinct solutions: $x = -1, 1, 5, 7$.

So, the value of $m$ that gives us 4 distinct solutions is 200, which is a positive integer.
The answer is: $1$

Now, we need to verify if $m=200$ is a positive integer. It is, so the answer is $\boxed{1}$.

However, this doesn't seem to be the correct answer. Let's reevaluate the problem.

The equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has 4 distinct solutions. This means that the right side of the equation, $\frac{m}{100}$, must be equal to 2. Therefore, we have $m=200$.

However, we also need to consider the cases when the right side of the equation is less than 2. In these cases, the equation will have 2 distinct solutions. Let's find the value of $m$ for which the right side of the equation is equal to 1. This gives us $m=100$.

So, the possible values of $m$ are 100 and 200. To find out how many of these values satisfy the condition that the equation has 4 distinct solutions, we can simply count them. There are 2 values.

Therefore, the number of positive integers $m$ for which the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has 4 distinct solutions is 2. The answer is:
\[2\]
