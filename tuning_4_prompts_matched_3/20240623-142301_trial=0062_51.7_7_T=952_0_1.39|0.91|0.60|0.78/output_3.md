Below is a math problem you are to solve (positive numerical answer!):
"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"
Analyze this problem and think step by step to come to a solution with programs. After solving the problem, output the final numerical answer within \boxed{}.

 The given equation is a product of two terms equal to zero, so for the entire expression to equal zero, either of the terms must equal zero. Therefore, either
\begin{align*}
(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + (\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 &= 0, \\
(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + (\vert y \vert - 8)^2 &= 0.
\end{align*}
For the first term to equal zero, $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. The absolute value equation can be split into two cases, $x + y = 10$ or $x + y = -10$, and $x - y = 10$ or $x - y = -10$. Solving these equations simultaneously, we get the lines $x + y = 10$, $x + y = -10$, $x - y = 10$, and $x - y = -10$.

For the second term to equal zero, $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$. This gives us the lines $x = 8$, $x = -8$, $y = 8$, and $y = -8$.

The intersection points of these lines are: $(8,8)$, $(8,-8)$, $(-8,8)$, and $(-8,-8)$. The convex polygon formed by these points is a square with side length 16.

The area of the square is $16^2 = 256$.
The answer is $\boxed{256}$.

Below is a math problem you are to solve (positive numerical answer!):
"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"

The problem asks for the area of a convex polygon that is enclosed by the points that satisfy the equation. The equation is given by:
\[((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0\]
This equation is satisfied if and only if at least one of the factors is equal to zero.

If $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$, then $\vert x + y \vert = 10$, which means that $x + y = 10$ or $x + y = -10$. These two lines are parallel to the line $y = -x$.

If $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$, then $\vert x - y \vert = 10$, which means that $x - y = 10$ or $x - y = -10$. These two lines are parallel to the line $y = x$.

If $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$, then $\vert x \vert = 8$, which means that $x = 8$ or $x = -8$. These two lines are parallel to the y-axis.

If $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$, then $\vert y \vert = 8$, which means that $y = 8$ or $y = -8$. These two lines are parallel to the x-axis.

Therefore, the points that satisfy the equation are the vertices of a square with side length 20. The area of this square is $20^2 = 400$. The answer is:
\[\boxed{400}\]

Below is a math problem you are to solve (positive numerical answer!):
"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"

In this problem, we notice that a product of two numbers is zero if and only if one of the numbers is zero. So, we have either:

1. $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$, or
2. $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$.

If the first case happens, we have $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$, which is only possible when $x = 0$ and $y = 0$. However, this doesn't make sense in a geometric context, so we ignore this case.

If the second case happens, we have $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$, which means $x = 8$ or $x = -8$ and $y = 8$ or $y = -8$. These four points form a square with side length $16$. The area of the square is $16^2 = 256$.

So the area of the convex polygon is $256$ square units. The code to solve this problem is as follows:

```python


INTERMEDIATE OUT :

def area_of_polygon():
    """The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"""
    # The points (8, 8), (8, -8), (-8, 8), and (-8, -8) form a square with side length 16.
    side_length = 16
    area = side_length ** 2
    return area

result = area_of_polygon()
print(result)
```

CODE RESULTS 256

INTERMEDIATE OUT :
```output
256
```
The area of the convex polygon is $256$ square units.
The answer is $\boxed{256}$.

Analyze this problem and think step by step to come to a solution with programs. After solving the problem, output the final numerical answer within \boxed{}.

Assistant:

 First, notice that the product of two numbers is zero if and only if one or both of the numbers is zero. Therefore, we can either have $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$, $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$, $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$, or $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$. Solving each of these equations, we get the following systems of equations:

1. For $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$, $\vert x + y \vert = 10$, which gives us the lines $x + y = 10$ and $x + y = -10$.
2. For $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$, $\vert x - y \vert = 10$, which gives us the lines $x - y = 10$ and $x - y = -10$.
3. For $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$, $\vert x \vert = 8$, which gives us the lines $x = 8$ and $x = -8$.
4. For $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$, $\vert y \vert = 8$, which gives us the lines $y = 8$ and $y = -8$.

The points that satisfy the original equation are those that lie on these lines. When we plot these lines, they enclose a rectangle with vertices at $(8,8)$, $(8,-8)$, $(-8,8)$, and $(-8,-8)$. The area of this rectangle is $(8-(-8))(8-(-8)) = 16 \times 16 = 256$.
Therefore, the area of the convex polygon is 256 square units. The answer is: $256$
