Assistant:

 The equation given is equal to zero if and only if either $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$, $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$, $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$, or $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$.
These equations are satisfied if and only if $\vert x + y \vert = 10$, $\vert x - y \vert = 10$, $\vert x \vert = 8$, or $\vert y \vert = 8$.
The equations $\vert x + y \vert = 10$, $\vert x - y \vert = 10$, $\vert x \vert = 8$, and $\vert y \vert = 8$ define the sides of a square with side length 16.
The area of this square is $16^2 = 256$.
Therefore, the area of the convex polygon is 256 square units.
The answer is: $256$

Below is a math problem you are to solve (positive numerical answer!):
"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"
Analyze this problem and think step by step to come to a solution with programs. After solving the problem, output the final numerical answer within \boxed{}.

Assistant:

 The given equation is a product of two expressions, and the product equals zero if and only if at least one of the factors equals zero. Therefore, the points that satisfy the equation must satisfy either $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$, $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$, $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$, or $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$.

If $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$, then $\vert x + y \vert = 10$, which means $x + y = 10$ or $x + y = -10$.
If $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$, then $\vert x - y \vert = 10$, which means $x - y = 10$ or $x - y = -10$.
If $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$, then $\vert x \vert = 8$, which means $x = 8$ or $x = -8$.
If $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$, then $\vert y \vert = 8$, which means $y = 8$ or $y = -8$.

The points that satisfy the given equation are therefore on the lines $x + y = 10$, $x + y = -10$, $x - y = 10$, $x - y = -10$, $x = 8$, $x = -8$, $y = 8$, and $y = -8$. These lines enclose a rectangle with side lengths 16 and 20. The area of this rectangle is $16 \times 20 = 320$. The answer is: $320$

Below is a math problem you are to solve (positive numerical answer!):
"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"
Analyze this problem and think step by step to come to a solution with programs. After solving the problem, output the final numerical answer within \boxed{}.

Assistant:

 The problem states that we need to find the area of the convex polygon enclosed by the points that satisfy the equation.
The equation is $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$.
For this equation to be zero, either one of the two terms in the product must be zero.
The first term, $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)$, being zero means that $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. This results in the points lying on the lines $x + y = \pm 10$ and $x - y = \pm 10$.
The second term, $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$, being zero means that $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$, which results in the points lying on the lines $x = \pm 8$ and $y = \pm 8$.
These lines form a square with side length 16, as the distance between the lines $x + y = 10$ and $x + y = -10$ is 16, and similarly for the other pairs of lines.
The area of a square is given by the square of its side length, so the area of this square is $16^2 = 256$. The answer is: $256$

"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"
Analyze this problem and think step by step to come to a solution with programs. After solving the problem, output the final numerical answer within \boxed{}.

Assistant:

 The equation $A \cdot B = 0$ implies that $A=0$ or $B=0$. Therefore, either $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$. 
If $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$, then $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$, which implies that $x = \pm y$. 
If $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$, then $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$, which implies that $x = \pm 8$ and $y = \pm 8$. 
So the points that satisfy the equation are of the form $(x,x)$, $(-x,x)$, $(x,-x)$, $(-x,-x)$, $(8,8)$, $(-8,8)$, $(8,-8)$, and $(-8,-8)$. These points form a square with side length $16$. Therefore, the area of the square is $16^2 = 256$. The answer is: $256$

Below is a math problem you are to solve (positive numerical answer!):
"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"
Analyze this problem and think step by step to come to a solution with programs. After solving the problem, output the final numerical answer within \boxed{}.

Assistant:

 The problem is asking for the area of the convex polygon that is enclosed by the points that satisfy the given equation. The equation is $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$. If a product of two numbers is zero, then at least one of the numbers must be zero. This means that either $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$. If the first equation equals zero, then both $\vert x + y \vert - 10 = 0$ and $\vert x - y \vert - 10 = 0$, which means $x + y = 10$ and $x - y = 10$ or $x + y = 10$ and $x - y = -10$. Solving these equations gives the points $(5,5)$ and $(0,-5)$. Similarly, if the second equation equals zero, then $x = \pm 8$ and $y = \pm 8$, which gives the points $(8,0)$, $(0,8)$, $(-8,0)$, and $(0,-8)$. The points $(5,5)$, $(0,-5)$, $(8,0)$, $(0,8)$, $(-8,0)$, and $(0,-8)$ form a hexagon. To find the area of the hexagon, we can find the area of the square that contains it and subtract the areas of the four right triangles that are outside the hexagon. The side length of the square is $10$, so its area is $10^2 = 100$. The base and height of each right triangle are both $5$, so its area is $0.5 \times 5 \times 5 = 12.5$. Since there are four such triangles, the total area of the four triangles is $4 \times 12.5 = 50$. Therefore, the area of the hexagon is $100 - 50 = 50$. The answer is: $50$

"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"

Assistant:

 The problem statement asks for the area of the convex polygon enclosed by the points that satisfy the given equation.

The equation is: $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$.

For the product of two numbers to be zero, either one of the numbers must be zero. Therefore, we have two cases to consider:

1. $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$.
2. $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$.

From case 1, we have $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. This means that $x + y = \pm 10$ and $x - y = \pm 10$. Solving these equations, we get the lines $x + y = 10$, $x + y = -10$, $x - y = 10$, and $x - y = -10$. These lines form a square with side length 10. The area of this square is $10^2 = 100$.

From case 2, we have $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$. This means that $x = \pm 8$ and $y = \pm 8$. So we get the lines $x = 8$, $x = -8$, $y = 8$, and $y = -8$. These lines form a square with side length 16. The area of this square is $16^2 = 256$.

However, the convex polygon that is formed by the intersection of these two squares is the smaller square with side length 10. Therefore, the area of this convex polygon is $10^2 = 100$.

So, the area of the convex polygon is $100$. The answer is: $100$

Assistant:

 The given equation is satisfied if either $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$. This translates to the following four conditions:
1. $|x + y| = 10$
2. $|x - y| = 10$
3. $|x| = 8$
4. $|y| = 8$

The first two conditions represent lines in the plane, while the last two represent two pairs of parallel lines. The intersection of these lines form a rectangle with side lengths 16 and 20. Therefore, the area of the rectangle is $16 \times 20 = 320$.
The answer is: $320$

"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"

Assistant:

 The equation $AB = 0$ implies that either $A = 0$ or $B = 0$. Therefore, the given equation is satisfied if either of the following two sets of equations are satisfied:

1. $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ and $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ and $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$.
2. $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ and $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ and $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$.

From the first set of equations, we have $\vert x + y \vert = 10$, $\vert x \vert = 8$, and $\vert y \vert = 8$. This implies that $-8 \leq x, y \leq 8$ and $x + y = \pm 10$. The points that satisfy these conditions are $(8,2)$, $(8,-2)$, $(-8,2)$, and $(-8,-2)$.

From the second set of equations, we have $\vert x - y \vert = 10$, $\vert x \vert = 8$, and $\vert y \vert = 8$. This implies that $x - y = \pm 10$. The points that satisfy these conditions are $(8, -2)$, $(8, 2)$, $(-8, -2)$, and $(-8, 2)$.

Therefore, the four points that satisfy the given equation are $(8,2)$, $(8,-2)$, $(-8,2)$, and $(-8,-2)$. These four points form a square with side length $16$, so the area of the square is $16^2 = 256$. The answer is: $256$
