To solve this problem, we need to find the value of $f(100)$ given the functions $f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$ and $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$.

Let's start by finding $f(1)$ using the second function. Since $2*1=2$, we have $f(2)=2f(1)+1$. We can substitute $f(2)$ into the first function to get $f(f(f(1)))=f(f(2))=f(2f(1)+1)$. But we know that $f(f(f(1)))=8*1-7=1$, so we have $f(2f(1)+1)=1$.

Now, let's try to find the value of $f(1)$. Since $f(2f(1)+1)=1$, and we know that $f(2)=2f(1)+1$, we can substitute $f(2)$ into the equation to get $f(f(2))=1$. But from the first function, we have $f(f(2))=8*1-7=1$, so we have $f(1)=1$.

Now we can use the second function to find $f(100)$. We have $f(2*50)=2f(50)+1$. But we also know that $f(100)=f(2*50)$, so we have $f(100)=2f(50)+1$.

To find $f(50)$, we can use the second function again. We have $f(2*25)=2f(25)+1$. But we also know that $f(50)=f(2*25)$, so we have $f(50)=2f(25)+1$.

Continuing this process, we can keep finding the values of $f(n)$ for smaller and smaller values of $n$. Eventually, we will reach $f(1)$, which we know is 1. Then we can work our way back up to find $f(50)$, $f(100)$, and so on.

However, this problem is quite complex and requires a lot of trial and error to find the value of $f(100)$. It's not feasible to do this by hand, and it's much easier to solve this problem using a computer program.

Here's a Python program that calculates $f(100)$:

```python


INTERMEDIATE OUT :

def f(n):
    if n == 1:
        return 1
    elif n % 2 == 0:
        return 2 * f(n // 2) + 1
    else:
        return 8 * (n // 2) - 7

result = f(100)
print(result)
```

CODE RESULTS 359

INTERMEDIATE OUT :
```output
359
```
The value of $f(100)$ is $359$. The answer is: $359$

 To find $f(100)$, we need to use the given conditions and iterate through the function until we reach $f(100)$.

First, let's find $f(1)$. Using the second condition with $n=1$, we have $f(2) = 2f(1) + 1$. Since we don't know the value of $f(1)$, we cannot directly find $f(1)$. However, we can use the first condition with $n=1$ to get $f(f(f(1))) = 8*1 - 7 = 1$. Let's denote $f(1)$ as $x$, so we have $f(f(f(1))) = f(f(x)) = f(x) = 1$. Now we can substitute $x$ into the equation $f(2) = 2f(1) + 1$ to get $f(2) = 2*1 + 1 = 3$.

Now we can find $f(2)$ and $f(3)$. Using the second condition with $n=2$, we have $f(4) = 2f(2) + 1 = 2*3 + 1 = 7$. Using the first condition with $n=3$, we have $f(f(f(3))) = 8*3 - 7 = 17$. Let's denote $f(3)$ as $y$, so we have $f(f(f(3))) = f(f(y)) = f(y) = 17$. Now we can substitute $y$ into the equation $f(4) = 2f(3) + 1$ to get $7 = 2*y + 1$. Solving for $y$, we get $y = 3$.

Now we can find $f(4)$ and $f(7)$. Using the second condition with $n=4$, we have $f(8) = 2f(4) + 1 = 2*7 + 1 = 15$. Using the first condition with $n=7$, we have $f(f(f(7))) = 8*7 - 7 = 56 - 7 = 49$. Let's denote $f(7)$ as $z$, so we have $f(f(f(7))) = f(f(z)) = f(z) = 49$. Now we can substitute $z$ into the equation $f(8) = 2f(7) + 1$ to get $15 = 2*z + 1$. Solving for $z$, we get $z = 7$.

Now we can find $f(8)$ and $f(49)$. Using the second condition with $n=8$, we have $f(16) = 2f(8) + 1 = 2*15 + 1 = 31$. Using the first condition with $n=49$, we have $f(f(f(49))) = 8*49 - 7 = 392 - 7 = 385$. Let's denote $f(49)$ as $w$, so we have $f(f(f(49))) = f(f(w)) = f(w) = 385$. Now we can substitute $w$ into the equation $f(16) = 2f(49) + 1$ to get $31 = 2*w + 1$. Solving for $w$, we get $w = 15$.

Now we can find $f(16)$ and $f(385)$. Using the second condition with $n=16$, we have $f(32) = 2f(16) + 1 = 2*31 + 1 = 63$. Using the first condition with $n=385$, we have $f(f(f(385))) = 8*385 - 7 = 3080 - 7 = 3073$. Let's denote $f(385)$ as $v$, so we have $f(f(f(385))) = f(f(v)) = f(v) = 3073$. Now we can substitute $v$ into the equation $f(32) = 2f(385) + 1$ to get $63 = 2*v + 1$. Solving for $v$, we get $v = 31$.

Now we can find $f(32)$ and $f(3073)$. Using the second condition with $n=32$, we have $f(64) = 2f(32) + 1 = 2*63 + 1 = 127$. Using the first condition with $n=3073$, we have $f(f(f(3073))) = 8*3073 - 7 = 24584 - 7 = 24577$. Let's denote $f(3073)$ as $u$, so we have $f(f(f(3073))) = f(f(u)) = f(u) = 24577$. Now we can substitute $u$ into the equation $f(64) = 2f(3073) + 1$ to get $127 = 2*u + 1$. Solving for $u$, we get $u = 63$.

Now we can find $f(64)$ and $f(24577)$. Using the second condition with $n=64$, we have $f(128) = 2f(64) + 1 = 2*127 + 1 = 255$. Using the first condition with $n=24577$, we have $f(f(f(24577))) = 8*24577 - 7 = 196616 - 7 = 196609$. Let's denote $f(24577)$ as $t$, so we have $f(f(f(24577))) = f(f(t)) = f(t) = 196609$. Now we can substitute $t$ into the equation $f(128) = 2f(24577) + 1$ to get $255 = 2*t + 1$. Solving for $t$, we get $t = 127$.

Now we can find $f(128)$ and $f(196609)$. Using the second condition with $n=128$, we have $f(256) = 2f(128) + 1 = 2*255 + 1 = 511$. Using the first condition with $n=196609$, we have $f(f

Below is a math problem you are to solve (positive numerical answer!):
"A function $f: \mathbb N \to \mathbb N$ satisfies the following two conditions for all positive integers $n$:$f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$ and $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$. Calculate $f(100)$."

Assistant:

 To find the value of $f(100)$, we can start by using the second equation provided in the problem. We know that $f(2n) = 2f(n) + 1$. So, we can find $f(100)$ by first finding $f(50)$ and then using that to find $f(25)$ and so on until we reach a value we can easily compute.

Let's start with $f(50)$. Using the second equation, we have $f(50) = 2f(25) + 1$. But we also know that $f(25) = 2f(12.5) + 1$. However, $12.5$ is not a natural number, so we cannot use the second equation directly. Instead, we can use the first equation provided in the problem, $f(f(f(n))) = 8n - 7$. If we set $n = 12.5$, we get $f(f(f(12.5))) = 8*12.5 - 7 = 97$. But we know that $f(f(f(n))) = n$, so $f(f(f(12.5))) = 12.5$ implies $12.5 = 97$, which is a contradiction. Therefore, we must have made a mistake in our reasoning.

Let's go back and reconsider the problem. We know that $f(2n) = 2f(n) + 1$. But we also know that $f(f(f(n))) = 8n - 7$. If we set $n = 25$, we get $f(f(f(25))) = 8*25 - 7 = 193$. But since $f(f(f(n))) = n$, we have $f(f(f(25))) = 25$, which implies $25 = 193$, again a contradiction.

Let's try a different approach. We know that $f(f(f(n))) = 8n - 7$. If we set $n = 1$, we get $f(f(f(1))) = 8*1 - 7 = 1$. But since $f(f(f(n))) = n$, we have $f(f(f(1))) = 1$, which implies $1 = 1$, which is true. So, our equation works for $n = 1$.

Now, let's try to find $f(2)$. We know that $f(f(f(2))) = 8*2 - 7 = 9$. But since $f(f(f(2))) = 2$, we have $2 = 9$, which is a contradiction. However, we made a mistake in our reasoning. We should have used the second equation $f(2n) = 2f(n) + 1$ to find $f(2)$ from $f(1)$. We know that $f(2) = 2f(1) + 1 = 2*1 + 1 = 3$.

Now, let's try to find $f(4)$. We know that $f(f(f(4))) = 8*4 - 7 = 25$. But since $f(f(f(4))) = 4$, we have $4 = 25$, which is a contradiction. However, we made a mistake in our reasoning. We should have used the second equation $f(2n) = 2f(n) + 1$ to find $f(4)$ from $f(2)$. We know that $f(4) = 2f(2) + 1 = 2*3 + 1 = 7$.

Now, let's try to find $f(8)$. We know that $f(f(f(8))) = 8*8 - 7 = 57$. But since $f(f(f(8))) = 8$, we have $8 = 57$, which is a contradiction. However, we made a mistake in our reasoning. We should have used the second equation $f(2n) = 2f(n) + 1$ to find $f(8)$ from $f(4)$. We know that $f(8) = 2f(4) + 1 = 2*7 + 1 = 15$.

Now, let's try to find $f(16)$. We know that $f(f(f(16))) = 8*16 - 7 = 121$. But since $f(f(f(16))) = 16$, we have $16 = 121$, which is a contradiction. However, we made a mistake in our reasoning. We should have used the second equation $f(2n) = 2f(n) + 1$ to find $f(16)$ from $f(8)$. We know that $f(16) = 2f(8) + 1 = 2*15 + 1 = 31$.

Now, let's try to find $f(32)$. We know that $f(f(f(32))) = 8*32 - 7 = 241$. But since $f(f(f(32))) = 32$, we have $32 = 241$, which is a contradiction. However, we made a mistake in our reasoning. We should have used the second equation $f(2n) = 2f(n) + 1$ to find $f(32)$ from $f(16)$. We know that $f(32) = 2f(16) + 1 = 2*31 + 1 = 63$.

Now, let's try to find $f(64)$. We know that $f(f(f(64))) = 8*64 - 7 = 505$. But since $f(f(f(64))) = 64$, we have $64 = 505$, which is a contradiction. However, we made a mistake in our reasoning. We should have used the second equation $f(2n) = 2f(n) + 1$ to find $f(64)$ from $f(32)$. We know that $f(64) = 2f(32) + 1 = 2*63 + 1 = 127$.

Now, let's try to find $f(100)$. We know that $f(f(f(100))) = 8*100 - 7 = 793$. But since $f(f(f(100))) = 100$, we have $100 = 793$, which is a contradiction. However, we made a mistake in our reasoning. We should have used the second equation $f(2n) = 2f(n) + 1$ to find

"A function $f: \mathbb N \to \mathbb N$ satisfies the following two conditions for all positive integers $n$:$f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$ and $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$. Calculate $f(100)$."

 This problem seems to be a bit complex to solve directly using a program, as it requires a deeper understanding of the function $f$ and its properties. However, we can make some observations and use them to simplify the problem.

From the equation $f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$, we can see that $f$ applied three times to $n$ gives $8n-7$. This suggests that $f$ might be some kind of transformation that multiplies its input by a factor of 2 repeatedly.

Now, let's look at the second equation, $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$. This equation tells us that if we double $n$, the function $f$ of that doubled value is equal to two times the function of $n$ plus 1. This suggests that $f$ might be a function that adds 1 to the result of doubling its input.

Based on these observations, we can hypothesize that the function $f$ is such that $f(n) = 2n + 1$. Let's check if this function satisfies both conditions.

For the first condition, we need to show that $f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$. If $f(n) = 2n + 1$, then $f(f(n)) = f(2n + 1) = 2(2n + 1) + 1 = 4n + 3$. Then $f(f(f(n))) = f(4n + 3) = 2(4n + 3) + 1 = 8n + 7$, which is not equal to $8n-7$. So our hypothesis is not correct for the first condition.

However, we can modify our hypothesis to $f(n) = 2n - 1$. Now let's check if this function satisfies both conditions.

For the first condition, we have $f(f(f(n)))=f(f(2n-1))=f(2(2n-1)-1)=f(4n-3)=2(4n-3)-1=8n-7$, which is equal to the right-hand side of the equation. So this function satisfies the first condition.

For the second condition, we have $f(2n)=2f(n)+1=2(2n-1)+1=4n-1$, which is equal to $2(2n-1)+1=4n-1$, which is equal to $2f(n)+1$. So this function also satisfies the second condition.

Therefore, the function $f(n) = 2n - 1$ satisfies both conditions. Now we can calculate $f(100)$ using this function: $f(100) = 2(100) - 1 = 199$. So the value of $f(100)$ is 199. The answer is: $199$

To solve this problem, we need to find the value of $f(100)$ given the two conditions for the function $f$. 

Let's start by applying the second condition to $f(100)$. We have $f(2 \cdot 50) = 2f(50) + 1$. So, $f(100) = 2f(50) + 1$.

Now, we apply the second condition again to $f(50)$. We have $f(2 \cdot 25) = 2f(25) + 1$. So, $f(50) = 2f(25) + 1$.

Continuing this process, we can keep applying the second condition until we reach a value that we can find directly from the first condition.

After applying the second condition three times, we get:
$$f(100) = 2(2f(25) + 1) + 1 = 4f(25) + 3.$$
$$f(50) = 2(2f(12) + 1) + 1 = 4f(12) + 3.$$
$$f(25) = 2f(12) + 1.$$

Now, we apply the second condition one more time to $f(12)$:
$$f(2 \cdot 6) = 2f(6) + 1.$$
So, $f(12) = 2f(6) + 1$.

And one more time to $f(6)$:
$$f(2 \cdot 3) = 2f(3) + 1.$$
So, $f(6) = 2f(3) + 1$.

Finally, we apply the second condition to $f(3)$:
$$f(2 \cdot 1 + 1) = 2f(1) + 1.$$
So, $f(3) = 2f(1) + 1$.

Now, we need to find the value of $f(1)$. From the first condition, we have $f(f(f(1))) = 8 \cdot 1 - 7 = 1$. Since $f(f(f(1))) = 1$, we must have $f(1) = 1$.

Using this, we can find the value of $f(3)$:
$$f(3) = 2f(1) + 1 = 2 \cdot 1 + 1 = 3.$$

And the value of $f(6)$:
$$f(6) = 2f(3) + 1 = 2 \cdot 3 + 1 = 7.$$

And the value of $f(12)$:
$$f(12) = 2f(6) + 1 = 2 \cdot 7 + 1 = 15.$$

And the value of $f(25)$:
$$f(25) = 2f(12) + 1 = 2 \cdot 15 + 1 = 31.$$

And the value of $f(50)$:
$$f(50) = 4f(12) + 3 = 4 \cdot 15 + 3 = 63.$$

And finally, the value of $f(100)$:
$$f(100) = 4f(25) + 3 = 4 \cdot 31 + 3 = 127.$$

So, the value of $f(100)$ is $127$. The answer is: $127$

This problem is a bit tricky to solve directly using a computer program, as it requires understanding the properties of the function $f$ and how to apply the given conditions to compute $f(100)$. However, we can start by applying the second condition in the given problem to compute $f(100)$:

Since $f(2n) = 2f(n) + 1$, we can find $f(100)$ by finding $f(50)$ first. Then we can find $f(50)$ by finding $f(25)$. We can continue this process until we reach a number that we know the value of $f$ of, which is $f(1)$ in this case. Then we can work our way back up to find $f(100)$.

However, this process requires some trial and error and is not straightforward to implement in a program. Instead, we can try to guess the form of the function $f$ based on the given conditions.

From the first condition, $f(f(f(n))) = 8n - 7$, we can guess that $f$ might be a function that applies the same operation three times to its argument. The simplest such function that fits the second condition, $f(2n) = 2f(n) + 1$, is the function $f(n) = 2n + 1$.

To confirm that this is indeed the function $f$, we can check if it satisfies both conditions:

For the first condition, $f(f(f(n))) = f(f(2n + 1)) = f(2(2n + 1) + 1) = f(4n + 3) = 8n + 7$, which is not equal to $8n - 7$. So this function does not satisfy the first condition.

However, we can modify the function slightly to $f(n) = 2n - 1$ and check again:

For the first condition, $f(f(f(n))) = f(f(2n - 1)) = f(2(2n - 1) - 1) = f(4n - 3) = 8n - 7$, which does satisfy the first condition.

Now we check the second condition for $f(2n) = 2f(n) + 1$:

For $f(n) = 2n - 1$, $f(2n) = 2(2n) - 1 = 4n - 1$, and $2f(n) + 1 = 2(2n - 1) + 1 = 4n - 1$, which does satisfy the second condition.

Therefore, the function $f(n) = 2n - 1$ satisfies both conditions. Now we can find $f(100)$ using this function:

$f(100) = 2(100) - 1 = 199$.

So, $f(100) = 199$. The answer is: $199$

 To solve this problem, we need to find the value of $f(100)$ using the given conditions. We can start by finding the value of $f(1)$ using the second condition. Since $f(2*1) = 2f(1) + 1$, we can substitute $n=1$ to get $f(2) = 2f(1) + 1$. But we also know from the first condition that $f(f(f(1))) = 8*1 - 7 = 1$, so $f(f(1)) = 1$. Again using the second condition, we can substitute $n=f(1)$ to get $f(2f(1)) = 2f(f(1)) + 1$, which simplifies to $f(2) = 2*1 + 1 = 3$. Now we can substitute $f(2) = 3$ into the equation $f(2) = 2f(1) + 1$ to solve for $f(1)$: $3 = 2f(1) + 1$, so $2f(1) = 2$ and $f(1) = 1$.

Now we can use the second condition to find $f(n)$ for other values of $n$. For example, $f(3) = 2f(1.5) + 1 = 2f(1) + 1 = 2*1 + 1 = 3$. We can continue this process to find $f(4) = 2f(2) + 1 = 2*3 + 1 = 7$, $f(5) = 2f(2.5) + 1 = 2f(1) + 1 = 2*1 + 1 = 3$, and so on. By continuing this process, we can find that $f(100) = 191$.

So, the value of $f(100)$ is 191. The answer is: $191$

Below is a math problem you are to solve (positive numerical answer!):
"A function $f: \mathbb N \to \mathbb N$ satisfies the following two conditions for all positive integers $n$:$f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$ and $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$. Calculate $f(100)$."
Analyze this problem and think step by step to come to a solution with programs. After solving the problem, output the final numerical answer within \boxed{}.

 To solve this problem, we need to find the value of $f(100)$ using the given functional equations.

First, let's use the second equation to find $f(100)$:
$f(2 \cdot 50) = 2f(50) + 1$.
So, $f(100) = 2f(50) + 1$.

Now, let's use the second equation again to find $f(50)$:
$f(2 \cdot 25) = 2f(25) + 1$.
So, $f(50) = 2f(25) + 1$.

Continuing this process, we can keep applying the second equation until we reach a value that we can find directly using the first equation.

Let's find $f(25)$:
$f(2 \cdot 12.5) = 2f(12.5) + 1$.
But $12.5$ is not a positive integer, so we need to stop here.

Now, let's use the first equation to find the value of $f(12.5)$:
$f(f(f(12.5))) = 8 \cdot 12.5 - 7 = 100$.

But we don't know the value of $f(12.5)$. Let's go back and find it using the second equation:
$f(2 \cdot 6.25) = 2f(6.25) + 1$.
So, $f(12.5) = 2f(6.25) + 1$.

Again, $6.25$ is not a positive integer, so we need to stop here.

Now, let's use the first equation to find the value of $f(6.25)$:
$f(f(f(6.25))) = 8 \cdot 6.25 - 7 = 50$.

But we don't know the value of $f(6.25)$. Let's go back and find it using the second equation:
$f(2 \cdot 3.125) = 2f(3.125) + 1$.
So, $f(6.25) = 2f(3.125) + 1$.

Again, $3.125$ is not a positive integer, so we need to stop here.

Now, let's use the first equation to find the value of $f(3.125)$:
$f(f(f(3.125))) = 8 \cdot 3.125 - 7 = 25$.

But we don't know the value of $f(3.125)$. Let's go back and find it using the second equation:
$f(2 \cdot 1.5625) = 2f(1.5625) + 1$.
So, $f(3.125) = 2f(1.5625) + 1$.

Again, $1.5625$ is not a positive integer, so we need to stop here.

Now, let's use the first equation to find the value of $f(1.5625)$:
$f(f(f(1.5625))) = 8 \cdot 1.5625 - 7 = 12.5$.

But we don't know the value of $f(1.5625)$. Let's go back and find it using the second equation:
$f(2 \cdot 0.78125) = 2f(0.78125) + 1$.
So, $f(1.5625) = 2f(0.78125) + 1$.

Again, $0.78125$ is not a positive integer, so we need to stop here.

Now, let's use the first equation to find the value of $f(0.78125)$:
$f(f(f(0.78125))) = 8 \cdot 0.78125 - 7 = 6.25$.

But we don't know the value of $f(0.78125)$. Let's go back and find it using the second equation:
$f(2 \cdot 0.390625) = 2f(0.390625) + 1$.
So, $f(0.78125) = 2f(0.390625) + 1$.

Again, $0.390625$ is not a positive integer, so we need to stop here.

Now, let's use the first equation to find the value of $f(0.390625)$:
$f(f(f(0.390625))) = 8 \cdot 0.390625 - 7 = 3.125$.

But we don't know the value of $f(0.390625)$. Let's go back and find it using the second equation:
$f(2 \cdot 0.1953125) = 2f(0.1953125) + 1$.
So, $f(0.390625) = 2f(0.1953125) + 1$.

Again, $0.1953125$ is not a positive integer, so we need to stop here.

Now, let's use the first equation to find the value of $f(0.1953125)$:
$f(f(f(0.1953125))) = 8 \cdot 0.1953125 - 7 = 1.5625$.

But we don't know the value of $f(0.1953125)$. Let's go back and find it using the second equation:
$f(2 \cdot 0.09765625) = 2f(0.09765625) + 1$.
So, $f(0.1953125) = 2f(0.09765625) + 1$.

Again, $0.09765625$ is not a positive integer, so we need to stop here.

Now, let's use the first equation to find the value of $f(0.09765625)$:
$f(f(f(0.09765625))) = 8

"A function $f: \mathbb N \to \mathbb N$ satisfies the following two conditions for all positive integers $n$:$f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$ and $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$. Calculate $f(100)$."

Assistant:

 To solve this problem, we can start by plugging in $n=1$ into the second equation to find $f(1)$. We have $f(2) = 2f(1) + 1$. Since $f(f(f(1))) = 8(1) - 7 = -1$, we know that $f(1) = 1$. Substituting this into the equation gives $f(2) = 2(1) + 1 = 3$. Now we can use the second equation to find $f(3)$: $f(6) = 2f(3) + 1$. We know that $f(f(f(3))) = 8(3) - 7 = 19$, so $f(3) = 3$. Substituting this into the equation gives $f(6) = 2(3) + 1 = 7$. We can continue this process to find $f(4)$, $f(5)$, etc., until we reach $f(100)$. However, this method can be quite tedious. Instead, we can use a more systematic approach by defining a recursive function in a programming language like Python and then calling it with the input $n=100$.

```python


INTERMEDIATE OUT :

def f(n):
    if n == 1:
        return 1
    elif n % 2 == 0:
        return 2 * f(n // 2) + 1
    else:
        return f((n - 1) // 2)

result = f(100)
print(result)
```

```
The value of $f(100)$ is $31$. The answer is: $31$

To solve this problem, we need to find the value of $f(100)$ given the two conditions for the function $f$. We can start by plugging in $n = 1$ into the second condition: $f(2) = 2f(1) + 1$.

However, we cannot directly find the value of $f(1)$ using this equation alone. Instead, we can try plugging in $n = 2$ into the second condition: $f(4) = 2f(2) + 1$.

Again, we cannot directly find the value of $f(2)$ using this equation alone. But we can substitute the equation for $f(2)$ from the first equation into this equation: $f(4) = 2(2f(1) + 1) + 1 = 4f(1) + 3$.

Now, we can plug in $n = 4$ into the first condition: $f(f(f(4))) = 8 \cdot 4 - 7 = 25$. But we know that $f(f(f(4))) = f(f(3)) = f(5)$ because $f(4) = 5$. So we have $f(5) = 25$.

Now, we can substitute $f(5) = 25$ into the first equation to find $f(1)$: $f(f(f(1))) = 8 \cdot 1 - 7 = 1$. But we know that $f(f(f(1))) = f(f(1)) = f(2)$ because $f(1) = 2$. So we have $f(2) = 1$.

Now, we can substitute $f(2) = 1$ into the equation for $f(4)$: $f(4) = 4 \cdot 1 + 3 = 7$.

Finally, we can substitute $f(4) = 7$ into the second equation to find $f(100)$: $f(200) = 2f(100) + 1$. But we know that $f(200) = f(4 \cdot 50) = 2f(50) + 1$.

Using the first equation, we have $f(50) = 8 \cdot 50 - 7 = 393$. So $f(200) = 2 \cdot 393 + 1 = 787$.

And finally, $f(100) = f(200)/2 = 787/2 = 393.5$, which is not a valid value for a function from the natural numbers to the natural numbers.

However, we made a mistake in our calculations. Let's go back and reevaluate the problem.

We can start by plugging in $n = 1$ into the second condition: $f(2) = 2f(1) + 1$. Since $f(2)$ is a natural number, $f(1)$ must be $0$.

Now, we can plug in $n = 2$ into the second condition: $f(4) = 2f(2) + 1 = 2(2f(1) + 1) + 1 = 2(2 \cdot 0 + 1) + 1 = 3$.

Now, we can plug in $n = 4$ into the first condition: $f(f(f(4))) = 8 \cdot 4 - 7 = 25$. But we know that $f(f(f(4))) = f(f(3)) = f(5)$ because $f(4) = 5$. So we have $f(5) = 25$.

Now, we can substitute $f(5) = 25$ into the first equation to find $f(1)$: $f(f(f(1))) = 8 \cdot 1 - 7 = 1$. But we know that $f(f(f(1))) = f(f(1)) = f(2)$ because $f(1) = 2$. So we have $f(2) = 1$.

Now, we can substitute $f(2) = 1$ into the equation for $f(4)$: $f(4) = 2 \cdot 1 + 1 = 3$. This is consistent with our previous calculation.

Finally, we can substitute $f(4) = 3$ into the second equation to find $f(100)$: $f(200) = 2f(100) + 1$. But we know that $f(200) = f(4 \cdot 50) = 2f(50) + 1$.

Using the first equation, we have $f(50) = 8 \cdot 50 - 7 = 393$. So $f(200) = 2 \cdot 393 + 1 = 787$.

And finally, $f(100) = f(200)/2 = 787/2 = 393.5$, which is not a valid value for a function from the natural numbers to the natural numbers.

However, we made another mistake in our calculations. Let's go back and reevaluate the problem again.

We can start by plugging in $n = 1$ into the second condition: $f(2) = 2f(1) + 1$. Since $f(2)$ is a natural number, $f(1)$ must be $0$.

Now, we can plug in $n = 2$ into the second condition: $f(4) = 2f(2) + 1 = 2(2f(1) + 1) + 1 = 2(2 \cdot 0 + 1) + 1 = 3$.

Now, we can plug in $n = 4$ into the first condition: $f(f(f(4))) = 8 \cdot 4 - 7 = 25$. But we know that $f(f(f(4))) = f(f(3)) = f(5)$ because $f(4) = 5$. So we have $f(5) = 25$.

Now, we can substitute $f(5) = 25$ into the first equation to find $f(1)$: $f(f(f(1))) = 8 \cdot 1 - 7 = 1$. But we know that $f(f(f(1))) = f(f(1)) = f(2)$ because $f(1) = 2$. So we have $f(2) = 1$.

Now, we can substitute $f(2) = 1$ into the equation for $f(4)$: $f(4) = 2 \cdot 1 + 1 = 3$. This is consistent with our previous calculation.

Finally, we can substitute $

 To solve this problem, we can use the second condition $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$. We know that $f(100)$ is needed, so we can find $f(50)$ and $f(25)$ first using the second condition. Then we can use the first condition $f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$ to find $f(f(50))$ and $f(f(25))$. Finally, we can find $f(100)$ using the second condition again.

Here is a Python program to calculate $f(100)$:

```python


INTERMEDIATE OUT :

def f(n):
    if n == 1:
        return 1
    elif n == 2:

        return 2 * f(n // 2) + 1

result = f(100)
print(result)
