 The given equation is a product of two expressions equal to zero. This means that either the first expression is zero or the second expression is zero.

Let's consider the first expression: $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2) = 0$. For this expression to be zero, both $\vert x + y \vert - 10 = 0$ and $\vert x - y \vert - 10 = 0$, which implies $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. These two equations represent two lines in the coordinate plane, and the intersection of these lines forms a square with side length 10.

Now let's consider the second expression: $((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$. For this expression to be zero, both $\vert x \vert - 8 = 0$ and $\vert y \vert - 8 = 0$, which implies $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$. These two equations represent two circles centered at the origin with radius 8. The intersection of these circles is a square with side length 8.

The area of the convex polygon formed by the intersection of these two regions is the area of the square formed by the intersection of the lines $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$, which is 100 square units. The area of the square formed by the intersection of the circles $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$ is 64 square units.

The area of the convex polygon formed by the intersection of these two regions is the difference of these two areas, which is $100 - 64 = 36$ square units. Therefore, the area of the convex polygon is 36 square units. The answer is: $36$

Assistant:


The equation $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ implies that $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. This means that $x + y = \pm 10$ and $x - y = \pm 10$. Solving these equations, we get the vertices of the polygon as $(0, 10), (0, -10), (10, 0), (-10, 0)$.

Similarly, the equation $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ implies that $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$. This means that $x = \pm 8$ and $y = \pm 8$. So the vertices of the polygon are also $(8, 8), (8, -8), (-8, 8), (-8, -8)$.

The polygon formed by these vertices is a square with side length 10 (from the distance between $(0, 10)$ and $(0, -10)$ or $(10, 0)$ and $(-10, 0)$), so its area is $10^2 = 100$. The answer is: $100$

"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"

This problem involves understanding the properties of absolute value and the properties of zero.

The equation $ab = 0$ implies that either $a = 0$ or $b = 0$. So, the given equation is equivalent to either $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$, $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$, $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$, or $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$.

Each of these equations implies that $\vert x + y \vert = 10$, $\vert x - y \vert = 10$, $\vert x \vert = 8$, or $\vert y \vert = 8$.

The solutions to $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ are all points $(x, y)$ that are 10 units away from the line $x + y = 0$. Similarly, the solutions to $\vert x - y \vert = 10$ are all points $(x, y)$ that are 10 units away from the line $x - y = 0$. The solutions to $\vert x \vert = 8$ are all points $(x, y)$ on the lines $x = 8$ and $x = -8$. Similarly, the solutions to $\vert y \vert = 8$ are all points $(x, y)$ on the lines $y = 8$ and $y = -8$.

The points that satisfy any of these conditions form a square with side length 16. Therefore, the area of the convex polygon is $16^2 = 256$. The answer is: $256$

Assistant:

 The given equation is equal to zero if and only if both of its factors are equal to zero. This means that either $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$.

The first equation is satisfied if and only if $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. This implies that $x + y = \pm 10$ and $x - y = \pm 10$. Solving these equations gives us the vertices of the square: $(8, 2)$, $(8, -2)$, $(-8, -2)$, and $(-8, 2)$.

The second equation is satisfied if and only if $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$. This implies that $x = \pm 8$ and $y = \pm 8$. Solving these equations gives us the vertices of the square: $(8, 8)$, $(8, -8)$, $(-8, -8)$, and $(-8, 8)$.

The convex polygon formed by the union of these two squares is a $4 \times 4$ square. The area of this square is $4 \times 4 = 16$. Therefore, the area of the convex polygon is $16$.

 The equation given is a product of two terms equal to zero, so either the first term is zero or the second term is zero.
The first term is zero when $|x+y| = 10$ or $|x-y| = 10$.
The second term is zero when $|x| = 8$ or $|y| = 8$.
These conditions define a square with side length 16, centered at the origin.
The area of this square is $16^2 = 256$. The answer is: $256$

"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"

Assistant:

 The given equation is a product of two expressions equal to zero, so it equals zero if either of the expressions equals zero. Therefore, the points that satisfy the equation are the points that satisfy either $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$, $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$, $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$, or $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$.

The equation $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ implies $\vert x + y \vert = 10$, which means $x + y = 10$ or $x + y = -10$. Similarly, the equation $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ implies $\vert x - y \vert = 10$, which means $x - y = 10$ or $x - y = -10$. The equations $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ and $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ imply $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$, respectively, which means $-8 \le x \le 8$ and $-8 \le y \le 8$.

The points that satisfy these conditions form a square with side length 20 (from the equations $x + y = 10$ and $x - y = 10$), so the area of the square is $20^2 = 400$.

Therefore, the area of the convex polygon is 400. The answer is: $400$

 The equation is satisfied if either $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$.
The first two equations are satisfied if $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ or $\vert x - y \vert = 10$, which form a square with side length 20.
The last two equations are satisfied if $\vert x \vert = 8$ or $\vert y \vert = 8$, which form a square with side length 16.
The intersection of these two squares is a smaller square with side length 8.
Therefore, the area of the convex polygon is $20^2 - 8^2 = 400 - 64 = 336$.

The given equation is $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$. This equation is equal to zero if and only if either $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$, $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$, $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$, or $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$.

"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"

Assistant:


The given equation is $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$. For the product of two numbers to be zero, either one of the numbers must be zero. This gives us two cases:

1. $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$. This is only possible when both $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ and $( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$. This implies that $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. This means that the points lie on the lines $x + y = 10$ and $x - y = 10$.

2. $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$. This is only possible when both $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ and $( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$. This implies that $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$. This means that the points lie on the lines $x = 8$ and $y = 8$.

The intersection of these lines forms a square with side length 10 (from the equations $x + y = 10$ and $x - y = 10$), so the area of the square is $10^2 = 100$.
The answer is: $100$

Assistant:

 The equation given is a product of two terms equal to zero, which means either of the terms must be zero.

The first term is $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)$, which is zero if and only if $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. These are the equations of two lines: $x + y = \pm 10$ and $x - y = \pm 10$.

The second term is $((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2)$, which is zero if and only if $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$. These are the equations of two circles: $x^2 + y^2 = 64$.

The intersection of these lines and circles encloses a square with side length 16. The area of this square is $16^2 = 256$.

Therefore, the area of the convex polygon is 256.

Here is a Python function that calculates the area of the square:
