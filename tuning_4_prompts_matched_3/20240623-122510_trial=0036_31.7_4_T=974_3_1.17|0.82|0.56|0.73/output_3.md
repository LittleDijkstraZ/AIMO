Solve the following problem with a Python Script (positive numerical answer):
"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"

Approach:

 The equation implies that either $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$. These conditions translate to:
1. $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ or $\vert x + y \vert = 0$.
2. $\vert x - y \vert = 10$ or $\vert x - y \vert = 0$.
3. $\vert x \vert = 8$ or $\vert x \vert = 0$.
4. $\vert y \vert = 8$ or $\vert y \vert = 0$.
The absolute value equations are met when:
1. $x + y = \pm 10$ or $x + y = 0$.
2. $x - y = \pm 10$ or $x - y = 0$.
3. $x = \pm 8$ or $x = 0$.
4. $y = \pm 8$ or $y = 0$.

These conditions define a square with side length 16. The area of the square is $16^2 = 256$.

So the area of the convex polygon is 256.

The answer is: 256$

Approach:

 The equation $AB = 0$ is equivalent to either $A = 0$ or $B = 0$. Therefore, the given equation is equivalent to either $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$. The first equation implies $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$, which represent a square with side length 10 and diagonals of length 10$\sqrt{2}$. The second equation implies $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$, which represent a square with side length 8 and diagonals of length $8\sqrt{2}$. The area of the convex polygon formed by the intersection of these squares is the area of the smaller square, which is $8^2 = 64$. Therefore, the area of the convex polygon is 64 square units. The answer is: $64$

Solve the following problem with a Python Script (positive numerical answer):
"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"

Approach:


The equation $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ is satisfied only when either of the two factors is zero.

1. The first factor is zero when either $\vert x + y \vert - 10 = 0$ or $\vert x - y \vert - 10 = 0$. This implies that $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ or $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. The solutions to these equations are the lines $x + y = 10$, $x + y = -10$, $x - y = 10$, and $x - y = -10$. These lines form a rectangle with vertices at $(10,0)$, $(-10,0)$, $(0,10)$, and $(0,-10)$.

2. The second factor is zero when either $\vert x \vert - 8 = 0$ or $\vert y \vert - 8 = 0$. This implies that $\vert x \vert = 8$ or $\vert y \vert = 8$. The solutions to these equations are the lines $x = 8$, $x = -8$, $y = 8$, and $y = -8$. These lines form a square with vertices at $(8,8)$, $(-8,8)$, $(-8,-8)$, and $(8,-8)$.

The intersection of the two sets of lines forms a smaller square inside the rectangle. The side length of the smaller square is the distance between the points $(8,8)$ and $(-8,8)$, which is $16$ units. Therefore, the area of the convex polygon is the area of the rectangle minus the area of the square, which is $(20 \times 20) - (16 \times 16) = 400 - 256 = 144$ square units.

So, the area of the convex polygon is 144 square units.
The answer is: $144$

"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"

Approach:


The given equation is $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$. The product of two numbers is zero if and only if at least one of the numbers is zero. Hence, either $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$.

The first equation implies that $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. This gives us four lines: $x + y = 10$, $x + y = -10$, $x - y = 10$, and $x - y = -10$. These lines form a square with side length 10 and diagonal length $10\sqrt{2}$.

The second equation implies that $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$. This gives us four lines: $x = 8$, $x = -8$, $y = 8$, and $y = -8$. These lines form a square with side length 16.

The convex polygon enclosed by these points is a square with side length 10. Therefore, its area is $10^2 = 100$.

So the area of the convex polygon is $\boxed{100}$.
The answer is: $100$

Approach:



The equation $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ is true only when either of the factors is zero. This means that either $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$.

For the first factor to be zero, both $\vert x + y \vert - 10 = 0$ and $\vert x - y \vert - 10 = 0$, which means $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. The solutions to these equations are the lines $x + y = 10$, $x + y = -10$, $x - y = 10$, and $x - y = -10$. These lines form a rectangle with vertices at $(0, 10)$, $(10, 0)$, $(0, -10)$, and $(-10, 0)$.

For the second factor to be zero, both $\vert x \vert - 8 = 0$ and $\vert y \vert - 8 = 0$, which means $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$. The solutions to these equations are the lines $x = 8$, $x = -8$, $y = 8$, and $y = -8$. These lines form a square with vertices at $(8, 8)$, $(8, -8)$, $(-8, 8)$, and $(-8, -8)$.

The convex polygon enclosed by the points satisfying the equation is the intersection of the rectangle and the square, which is also a square with side length 8.

The area of this square is $8^2 = 64$.
The answer is: 64

Assistant:

Approach:


The given equation is a product of two terms, which is equal to zero. This means that either the first term is zero or the second term is zero. Therefore, we can break this problem into two cases:

Case 1: $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$.

Case 2: $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$.

For Case 1, both $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2$ and $( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2$ must be zero. This implies that $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. The only way this can happen is if $x = y = 5$ or $x = y = -5$.

For Case 2, both $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2$ and $( \vert y \vert - 8)^2$ must be zero. This implies that $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$. The only way this can happen is if $x = 8$ or $x = -8$ and $y = 8$ or $y = -8$.

Combining these two cases, the points that satisfy the equation are $(5, 5)$, $(-5, -5)$, $(8, 8)$, $(-8, -8)$, $(8, -8)$, and $(-8, 8)$. These points form a square with side length 10. The area of a square is side length squared, so the area of the square is $10^2 = 100$. The answer is: $100$

Approach:

 The given equation is equivalent to the product of two expressions being zero, i.e., $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2) = 0$ or $((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$. The first expression equals zero if and only if $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. These two equations represent two squares with side length 10, one with vertices at $(10,0), (0,10), (-10,0), (0,-10)$ and the other with vertices at $(0,10), (10,0), (0,-10), (-10,0)$. The second expression equals zero if and only if $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$, which represent two squares with side length 8, one with vertices at $(8,0), (0,8), (-8,0), (0,-8)$ and the other with vertices at $(0,8), (8,0), (0,-8), (-8,0)$. The intersection of these two squares forms a square with side length 6, centered at the origin. The area of this square is $6^2 = 36$. The answer is: 36

Approach:


The given equation is a product of two expressions equal to zero, which implies that either one of the expressions is zero. So, we need to find the values of $(x, y)$ that make each expression zero.

1. $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0 \Rightarrow \vert x + y \vert = 10 \Rightarrow x + y = \pm 10$
2. $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0 \Rightarrow \vert x - y \vert = 10 \Rightarrow x - y = \pm 10$
3. $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0 \Rightarrow \vert x \vert = 8 \Rightarrow x = \pm 8$
4. $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0 \Rightarrow \vert y \vert = 8 \Rightarrow y = \pm 8$

By solving these equations, we can find the vertices of the polygon:
1. If $x = 8$, from $x + y = 10$, we get $y = 2$. So, one vertex is $(8, 2)$.
2. If $x = 8$, from $x - y = 10$, we get $y = -2$. So, another vertex is $(8, -2)$.
3. If $x = -8$, from $x + y = 10$, we get $y = 18$. So, another vertex is $(-8, 18)$.
4. If $x = -8$, from $x - y = 10$, we get $y = -18$. So, another vertex is $(-8, -18)$.

Now, we can plot these points on a graph and observe that they form a square with side length $20$. The area of the square is $20^2 = 400$. Therefore, the area of the convex polygon is $400$. The answer is: $400$

The given equation is a product of two expressions, which makes it equal to zero if and only if at least one of the expressions is zero. So, we have two cases:

1. $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$.
2. $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$.

For the first case, either $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ or $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. This implies that either $x + y = \pm 10$ or $x - y = \pm 10$. These are the equations of four lines.

For the second case, either $\vert x \vert = 8$ or $\vert y \vert = 8$. This implies that either $x = \pm 8$ or $y = \pm 8$. These are the equations of four lines.

Therefore, the points that satisfy the given equation are the intersection points of these eight lines. By plotting these lines, we can see that they form a square with side length 16. The area of this square is $16^2 = 256$.

Therefore, the area of the convex polygon is $256$. The answer is: $256$

The expression $AB=0$ is equivalent to either $A=0$ or $B=0$. Therefore, the given equation is equivalent to either $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$.

For the first equation, $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$, it is only possible when $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. This means that $x + y = \pm 10$ and $x - y = \pm 10$. Solving these equations gives us the vertices of the polygon: $(5,5)$, $(5,-5)$, $(-5,5)$, and $(-5,-5)$.

For the second equation, $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$, it is only possible when $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$. This means that $x = \pm 8$ and $y = \pm 8$. So we get four more vertices: $(8,8)$, $(8,-8)$, $(-8,8)$, and $(-8,-8)$.

Therefore, the polygon is a square with side length 10. The area of a square is side length squared, so the area of this square is $10^2 = 100$.

So, the area of the convex polygon is $100$. The answer is: $100$.

The equation $A \cdot B = 0$ is true if and only if either $A = 0$ or $B = 0$. Therefore, the given equation is equivalent to either $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + (\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + (\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$.

The first equation implies $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. This results in a square with side length $10\sqrt{2}$, so its area is $(10\sqrt{2})^2 = 200$.

The second equation implies $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$, which results in a square with side length $16$, so its area is $16^2 = 256$.

The area of the convex polygon formed by the intersection of these two squares is the area of the smaller square, which is $200$.

Therefore, the area of the convex polygon is $200$.

The answer is: $200$

Write comments to indicate the steps you take. Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Assistant:

Approach:

 The equation given in the problem is a product of two expressions equal to zero. This means that either the first expression is zero or the second expression is zero. We will solve each case separately and then find the intersection of the solutions to get the points that satisfy both expressions.

Step 1: Solve $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$
This equation is satisfied when $\vert x + y \vert = 10$. The absolute value function can be split into two cases: $x + y = 10$ or $x + y = -10$. These are the equations of two lines.

Step 2: Solve $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$
Similarly, this equation is satisfied when $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. This gives us two more lines: $x - y = 10$ and $x - y = -10$.

Step 3: Solve $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$
This equation is satisfied when $\vert x \vert = 8$, which gives us two lines: $x = 8$ and $x = -8$.

Step 4: Solve $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$
This equation is satisfied when $\vert y \vert = 8$, which gives us two lines: $y = 8$ and $y = -8$.

Step 5: Find the intersection points
We have a total of 4 lines, and we need to find the intersection points of these lines. After calculating, we find that there are 9 intersection points. These points form a polygon when connected in order.

Step 6: Calculate the area of the polygon
The polygon formed by these points is a square with side length 16 (since the distance between the lines $x = 8$ and $x = -8$ or $y = 8$ and $y = -8$ is 16). The area of a square is given by side length squared, so the area of the polygon is $16^2 = 256$.
The answer is: $256$.

"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"

Assistant:

Approach:


The expression $A \cdot B = 0$ is true if and only if either $A = 0$ or $B = 0$. So the given equation is equivalent to the system of equations:
\[((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2) = 0,\]
\[((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0.\]

The equation $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ implies that $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. This means $x + y = \pm 10$ and $x - y = \pm 10$, which results in four lines: $x + y = 10$, $x + y = -10$, $x - y = 10$, and $x - y = -10$.

The equation $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ implies that $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$, which means $x = \pm 8$ and $y = \pm 8$, resulting in four lines: $x = 8$, $x = -8$, $y = 8$, and $y = -8$.

The intersection of these lines form a square with side length 10. The area of the square is $10^2 = 100$.
The answer is: 100.
