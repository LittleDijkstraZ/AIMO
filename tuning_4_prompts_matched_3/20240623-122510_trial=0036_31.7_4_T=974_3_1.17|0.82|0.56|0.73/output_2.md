Approach:



We need to find the value of $m$ such that the equation $| |x-1| - 2| = \frac{m}{100}$ has 4 distinct solutions.

This equation can be rewritten as two separate cases: $|x-1| - 2 = \frac{m}{100}$ and $-(|x-1| - 2) = \frac{m}{100}$.

Let's solve the first case: $|x-1| - 2 = \frac{m}{100}$, which simplifies to $|x-1| = 2 + \frac{m}{100}$. This gives us two sub-cases: $x-1 = 2 + \frac{m}{100}$ and $-(x-1) = 2 + \frac{m}{100}$, or $x-1 = -2 - \frac{m}{100}$ and $x-1 = 2 - \frac{m}{100}$.

Solving these gives us the solutions: $x = 3 + \frac{m}{100}$, $x = -1 - \frac{m}{100}$, $x = -1 + \frac{m}{100}$, and $x = 3 - \frac{m}{100}$.

For these solutions to be distinct, the values of $\frac{m}{100}$ must not be equal. This implies that $m$ cannot be a multiple of 100.

Now let's solve the second case: $-(|x-1| - 2) = \frac{m}{100}$, which simplifies to $-|x-1| + 2 = \frac{m}{100}$, or $|x-1| = 2 - \frac{m}{100}$. This gives us two sub-cases: $x-1 = 2 - \frac{m}{100}$ and $-(x-1) = 2 - \frac{m}{100}$, or $x-1 = -2 + \frac{m}{100}$ and $x-1 = 2 + \frac{m}{100}$.

Solving these gives us the solutions: $x = 3 - \frac{m}{100}$, $x = -1 + \frac{m}{100}$, $x = 3 + \frac{m}{100}$, and $x = -1 - \frac{m}{100}$.

Again, for these solutions to be distinct, the values of $\frac{m}{100}$ must not be equal. This also implies that $m$ cannot be a multiple of 100.

Comparing the solutions from both cases, we see that the solutions are the same. So, we only need to consider one of the cases.

The solutions are distinct when the values of $\frac{m}{100}$ are not equal. This means that $m$ cannot be a multiple of 100. The possible values of $m$ are the positive integers that are not multiples of 100. There are 99 such integers from 1 to 99.

Therefore, there are 99 positive integers $m$ such that the equation $| |x-1| - 2| = \frac{m}{100}$ has 4 distinct solutions.
The answer is: $99$

Approach:



We first consider the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$.

The equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ will have four distinct solutions if and only if $\frac{m}{100}$ is less than $2$ but greater than or equal to $0$. This is because the function $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert$ oscillates between $0$ and $4$ and only equals $\frac{m}{100}$ at four distinct points.

So we have $0 \leq \frac{m}{100} < 2$, which gives $0 \leq m < 200$.

The positive integers $m$ that satisfy this inequality are $1, 2, ..., 199$. So the number of such positive integers is $199$.

Therefore, the number of positive integers $m$ for which the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has four distinct solutions is $199$. The answer is: $199$

Approach:


To solve the problem, we need to understand the nature of the function $f(x) = | |x - 1| - 2 |$. This function is a piecewise linear function with a triangular shape. It reaches its minimum value of 0 at $x = 3$ and $x = -1$, and its maximum value of 2 at $x = 1$. The function is decreasing on the interval $[-1, 1]$ and increasing on the interval $[1, 3]$.

The equation $| |x - 1| - 2 | = \frac{m}{100}$ has 4 distinct solutions if and only if $\frac{m}{100}$ is in the interval $(0, 2)$. Thus, $0 < \frac{m}{100} < 2$, which implies $0 < m < 200$. The number of positive integers $m$ in this interval is $199$.

Therefore, the number of positive integers $m$ for which the equation has 4 distinct solutions is 199.

The answer is: $199$.

Approach:


To solve this problem, we need to find the number of positive integers $m$ for which the equation $| |x - 1| - 2| = \frac{m}{100}$ has four distinct solutions.

The right side of the equation is a constant value, and the left side is the absolute value of an absolute value expression. This is a piecewise function with four cases to consider.

1. For $|x - 1| - 2 = \frac{m}{100}$, we have two cases:

   a. $|x - 1| - 2 = \frac{m}{100}$ and $|x - 1| - 2 \geq 0$, which gives $|x - 1| = 2 + \frac{m}{100}$.

   b. $|x - 1| - 2 = -\frac{m}{100}$ and $|x - 1| - 2 < 0$, which gives $|x - 1| = 2 - \frac{m}{100}$.

2. For $-(|x - 1| - 2) = \frac{m}{100}$, we have two cases:

   a. $-(|x - 1| - 2) = \frac{m}{100}$ and $-(|x - 1| - 2) \geq 0$, which gives $|x - 1| = 2 - \frac{m}{100}$.

   b. $-(|x - 1| - 2) = -\frac{m}{100}$ and $-(|x - 1| - 2) < 0$, which gives $|x - 1| = 2 + \frac{m}{100}$.

For each case, we need to find the number of distinct solutions for $x$. We then sum up the number of solutions for each case and equate it to 4. This will give us the value of $m$ we are looking for.

Solution:
After solving each case and summing up the number of solutions, we find that there is only one value of $m$ that satisfies the condition, namely $m = 100$. Therefore, the number of positive integers $m$ for which the equation has four distinct solutions is 1.
The answer is: $1$

Approach:


The equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has 4 distinct solutions, we need to find the values of $m$ that satisfy this condition.

First, let's analyze the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$.

If $\frac{m}{100}$ is less than 2, the equation has no solutions.

If $\frac{m}{100}$ is equal to 2, the equation has 2 solutions.

If $\frac{m}{100}$ is between 2 and 3, the equation has 4 solutions.

If $\frac{m}{100}$ is greater than 3, the equation has no solutions.

Therefore, the equation has 4 distinct solutions when $\frac{m}{100}$ is between 2 and 3. This means $200 \leq m < 300$.

So we need to find the number of positive integers in this range.

This is simply $300 - 200 - 1 = 99$.

So the number of positive integers $m$ that satisfy the condition is 99.
The answer is: $99$.

Approach:

 The number of distinct solutions to the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ is equal to the number of times the graph of $y = \vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert$ intersects the horizontal line $y=\frac{m}{100}$. The graph of $y = \vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert$ is a piecewise function with $4$ pieces, and each piece is a line segment. The intersections with the horizontal line $y=\frac{m}{100}$ occur when $\frac{m}{100}$ equals the $y$-coordinates of the $4$ endpoints of the line segments. 

For example, if $\frac{m}{100} = 0$, then there is one solution. If $\frac{m}{100} = 1$, then there are two solutions. If $\frac{m}{100} = 2$, then there are three solutions. If $\frac{m}{100} = 3$, then there are four solutions. 

To find the value of $m$ for which $\frac{m}{100}=3$, we multiply both sides of the equation by $100$ to get $m=300$. 

Therefore, there is only one positive integer value of $m$ for which the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has $4$ distinct solutions, and that value is $m=300$. The answer is: $1$

Approach:



The equation $| |x - 1| - 2| = \frac{m}{100}$ has four distinct solutions means that the expression $|x - 1| - 2$ takes on two positive and two negative values, each with a magnitude of $\frac{m}{100}$. This is because the equation $|u| = a$ has two solutions, $u = a$ and $u = -a$.

So, we have $|x - 1| - 2 = \pm \frac{m}{100}$.

This gives us two equations:

1. $|x - 1| - 2 = \frac{m}{100}$, and
2. $|x - 1| - 2 = -\frac{m}{100}$.

For the first equation, we have $|x - 1| = 2 + \frac{m}{100}$. The expression $|x - 1|$ is the distance between $x$ and $1$ on the number line. So, $x - 1 = 2 + \frac{m}{100}$ or $x - 1 = -(2 + \frac{m}{100})$.

The solutions to these equations are $x = 3 + \frac{m}{100}$ and $x = -1 + \frac{m}{100}$.

For the second equation, we have $|x - 1| = 2 - \frac{m}{100}$. The solutions to these equations are $x = 3 - \frac{m}{100}$ and $x = -1 - \frac{m}{100}$.

So, the four distinct solutions to the original equation are $x = 3 + \frac{m}{100}$, $x = -1 + \frac{m}{100}$, $x = 3 - \frac{m}{100}$, and $x = -1 - \frac{m}{100}$.

These four solutions are distinct if and only if the expressions $\frac{m}{100}$, $2 + \frac{m}{100}$, and $2 - \frac{m}{100}$ are all positive. This happens if and only if $0 < \frac{m}{100} < 2$.

Multiplying all sides of the inequalities by $100$, we get $0 < m < 200$. The positive integers $m$ that satisfy this inequality are $1, 2, 3, \dots, 199$.

Therefore, there are $199$ positive integers $m$ for which the equation $| |x - 1| - 2| = \frac{m}{100}$ has $4$ distinct solutions. The answer is: $199$

Solve the following problem with a Python Script (positive numerical answer):
"For how many positive integers $m$ does the equation \[\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}\] have $4$ distinct solutions?"

Approach:


We want the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ to have $4$ distinct solutions. 

First, we note that the number of solutions depends on the value of $m$. 

We can consider the two cases for the absolute value:

1. When $\vert x-1 \vert -2 > 0$, the equation becomes $\vert x-1 \vert -2 = \frac{m}{100}$. 
2. When $\vert x-1 \vert -2 < 0$, the equation becomes $-( \vert x-1 \vert -2) = \frac{m}{100}$.

For the first case, we have $\vert x-1 \vert = 2 + \frac{m}{100}$. This gives us two equations:

1.1. $x-1 = 2 + \frac{m}{100}$, which simplifies to $x = 3 + \frac{m}{100}$.
1.2. $-(x-1) = 2 + \frac{m}{100}$, which simplifies to $x = -1 + \frac{m}{100}$.

For the second case, we have $\vert x-1 \vert = 2 - \frac{m}{100}$. This gives us two more equations:

2.1. $x-1 = 2 - \frac{m}{100}$, which simplifies to $x = 3 - \frac{m}{100}$.
2.2. $-(x-1) = 2 - \frac{m}{100}$, which simplifies to $x = -1 - \frac{m}{100}$.

So we have a total of 4 possible solutions: $x = 3 + \frac{m}{100}$, $x = -1 + \frac{m}{100}$, $x = 3 - \frac{m}{100}$, and $x = -1 - \frac{m}{100}$.

For these 4 solutions to be distinct, the fractions $\frac{m}{100}$ must be different. This means $m$ must be different integers. 

For $m$ to be a positive integer, we need $m$ to be in the range $0 < m \le 100$. 

We want to find how many values of $m$ in this range make the 4 solutions distinct.

The equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ will have 4 distinct solutions if and only if $0 < m \le 100$ has exactly 4 different integer values. 

For example, if $m=1$, the 4 solutions are $x = 4$, $x=0$, $x=2$, and $x=-2$. These are distinct. 

If $m=2$, the 4 solutions are $x = \frac{9}{2}$, $x=-\frac{1}{2}$, $x=\frac{7}{2}$, and $x=-\frac{5}{2}$. These are not distinct. 

So, we need to find how many values of $m$ in the range $0 < m \le 100$ make the 4 solutions distinct.

We can find this by manually checking the values of $m$ or by using a computer program to count the number of values of $m$ that make the 4 solutions distinct.

After checking, we find that there are exactly 16 values of $m$ in the range $0 < m \le 100$ that make the 4 solutions distinct.

So, the number of positive integers $m$ for which the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has 4 distinct solutions is 16.

The answer is: $16$.

Approach:


The given equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has 4 distinct solutions.
We know that the absolute value function $\vert x \vert$ is equal to $x$ if $x \geq 0$, and $-x$ if $x < 0$. Therefore, the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ can be broken down into cases based on the value of $\vert x-1 \vert$.

Case 1: $\vert x-1 \vert -2 = \frac{m}{100}$
In this case, $\vert x-1 \vert = \frac{m}{100} + 2$.
This gives us two sub-cases based on the sign of $x-1$:

Case 1a: $x-1 - 2 = \frac{m}{100} \Rightarrow x = \frac{m}{100} + 3$
Case 1b: $-(x-1) - 2 = \frac{m}{100} \Rightarrow x = 1 - \frac{m}{100} - 2 = - \frac{m}{100} - 1$

Case 2: $\vert x-1 \vert -2 = -\frac{m}{100}$
In this case, $\vert x-1 \vert = 2 - \frac{m}{100}$.
This also gives us two sub-cases based on the sign of $x-1$:

Case 2a: $x-1 - 2 = - \frac{m}{100} \Rightarrow x = 1 - \frac{m}{100} - 2 = - \frac{m}{100} - 1$
Case 2b: $-(x-1) - 2 = - \frac{m}{100} \Rightarrow x = \frac{m}{100} + 3$

From the above cases, we can see that in each case, we get two solutions for $x$. Therefore, the total number of distinct solutions for $x$ is 4 if and only if the two solutions in each case are distinct. This happens when $\frac{m}{100} + 3 \neq - \frac{m}{100} - 1$, which simplifies to $m \neq -50$.

Therefore, the only positive integer $m$ that satisfies the equation is 50. However, 50 is not a valid value for $m$ because it would make the absolute value equation unsolvable (since absolute value cannot be negative). Thus, there is no positive integer $m$ that satisfies the given equation with 4 distinct solutions.

The answer is: $0$

Approach:



To count the number of positive integers $m$ for which the equation $| |x - 1| - 2| = \frac{m}{100}$ has four distinct solutions, we first need to consider the number of changes in the function $| |x - 1| - 2|$.

The function $| |x - 1| - 2|$ changes its value at $x = 1 \pm 2$, which gives $x = -1, 3$. These are the points where the function $| |x - 1| - 2|$ changes its slope.

Now we consider the function $| |x - 1| - 2| = \frac{m}{100}$. This function will have four distinct solutions if the value $\frac{m}{100}$ falls strictly between the values of the function at $x = -1$ and $x = 3$. 

At $x = -1$, the value of $| |x - 1| - 2|$ is $| |-1 - 1| - 2| = |2 - 2| = 0$.

At $x = 3$, the value of $| |x - 1| - 2|$ is $| |3 - 1| - 2| = |2 - 2| = 0$.

So the value $\frac{m}{100}$ must be strictly between $0$ and $0$. This means $\frac{m}{100} = 0$, and hence $m = 0$.

However, we are asked to find the number of positive integers $m$, so $m = 0$ is not a valid solution.

This indicates that we have made a mistake in our reasoning. The function $| |x - 1| - 2|$ actually changes its value at $x = 1 \pm 2$, which gives $x = -1, 3$. But these are the points where the function $| |x - 1| - 2|$ changes its slope, not its value.

Let's correct this.

The function $| |x - 1| - 2|$ changes its value at $x = 1 \pm 2$, which gives $x = -1, 3$. The values of the function at these points are $| |-1 - 1| - 2| = |2 - 2| = 0$ and $| |3 - 1| - 2| = |2 - 2| = 0$, respectively. 

And the function $| |x - 1| - 2|$ changes its value again at $x = 1 \pm (2 + 1)$, which gives $x = 0, 4$. The values of the function at these points are $| |0 - 1| - 2| = |-1 - 2| = 3$ and $| |4 - 1| - 2| = |3 - 2| = 1$, respectively.

So the value $\frac{m}{100}$ must fall strictly between $1$ and $3$. This means $1 < \frac{m}{100} < 3$, or equivalently, $100 < m < 300$.

The positive integers $m$ that satisfy this inequality are the integers from $101$ to $299$, inclusive. To count the number of these integers, we can subtract the smallest value from the largest value and then add $1$. This gives us $299 - 101 + 1 = 199$.

So there are $199$ positive integers $m$ for which the equation $| |x - 1| - 2| = \frac{m}{100}$ has four distinct solutions.
The answer is: $199$
