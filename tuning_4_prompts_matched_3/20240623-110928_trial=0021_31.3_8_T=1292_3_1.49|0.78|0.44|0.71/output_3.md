"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"

Approach:


The given equation is a product of two terms equal to zero. This means that either the first term is zero or the second term is zero.

1) Let's consider the first term, $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$. Since squares are always non-negative, the only way this equation can be zero is if both terms inside the square are zero. This gives us two equations: $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. Solving these absolute value equations gives us four lines: $x + y = 10$, $x + y = -10$, $x - y = 10$, and $x - y = -10$. These lines form a rectangle with vertices at $(0, 10)$, $(10, 0)$, $(-10, 0)$, and $(0, -10)$.

2) Now let's consider the second term, $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$. Similar to the first term, this equation can only be zero if both terms inside the square are zero. This gives us two equations: $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$. Solving these absolute value equations gives us four lines: $x = 8$, $x = -8$, $y = 8$, and $y = -8$. These lines form a square with vertices at $(8, 8)$, $(-8, 8)$, $(-8, -8)$, and $(8, -8)$.

The convex polygon formed by the intersection of these two figures is a square with side length 8. The area of a square is given by the square of the side length, so the area of the convex polygon is $8^2 = 64$. The answer is: $64$

Solve the following problem with a Python Script (positive numerical answer):
"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"

Approach:


The given equation implies that either $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$.
The equation $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ implies $\vert x + y \vert = 10$. This represents a square with side length $20$ and diagonal length $20\sqrt{2}$. The vertices of the square are at the points $(10, 0)$, $(-10, 0)$, $(0, 10)$, and $(0, -10)$.
The equation $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ implies $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. This also represents a square with side length $20$ and diagonal length $20\sqrt{2}$. The vertices of this square are at the points $(10, -10)$, $(-10, 10)$, $(0, -10)$, and $(10, 0)$.
The equation $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ implies $\vert x \vert = 8$, which represents two vertical lines at $x = 8$ and $x = -8$. The equation $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ implies $\vert y \vert = 8$, which represents two horizontal lines at $y = 8$ and $y = -8$.
The convex polygon formed by the intersection of all these lines is a square with side length $16$ (the distance between the lines $x = 8$ and $x = -8$ or $y = 8$ and $y = -8$). The area of this square is $16^2 = 256$.
Therefore, the area of the convex polygon is $256$ square units.
The answer is: $256$

Solve the following problem with a Python Script (positive numerical answer):
"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"

Approach:

 The equation given in the problem is equivalent to a system of equations:
1. $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$
2. $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$

For the first equation, we have $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ or $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. This gives us the equations $x + y = \pm 10$ and $x - y = \pm 10$. These four lines form a rectangle with vertices at (0, 10), (0, -10), (20, 0), and (-20, 0).

For the second equation, we have $\vert x \vert = 8$ or $\vert y \vert = 8$. This gives us the equations $x = \pm 8$ and $y = \pm 8$. These four lines form a square with vertices at (8, 0), (-8, 0), (0, 8), and (0, -8).

The convex polygon formed by the intersection of these two shapes is a smaller square with side length 6 (since the side length of the larger square is 16, and we subtract twice the distance from the origin to the nearest edge of the larger square, which is 4*2 = 8, to get the side length of the smaller square).

The area of the smaller square is therefore $6^2 = 36$.

```python


INTERMEDIATE OUT :

def area_of_polygon():
    side_length = 6
    area = side_length ** 2
    return area

result = area_of_polygon()

The area of the convex polygon is 36 square units. The answer is: $36$

Assistant:

Approach:

 The equation given is a product of two expressions, which is zero if and only if at least one of the expressions is zero. This means that the points that satisfy the equation either satisfy $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$, $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$, $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$, or $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$. Each of these four equations represents a circle on the plane. The intersection of these circles forms a rectangle, which is the convex polygon that we are looking for.

To find the area of this rectangle, we simply multiply its length by its width. The length is the diameter of the circles centered at $(0, 0)$ and $(0, 0)$, which is $2*10 = 20$. The width is the diameter of the circles centered at $(0, 0)$ and $(0, 0)$, which is $2*8 = 16$. Therefore, the area of the rectangle is $20*16 = 320$.

So, the area of the convex polygon is 320.
The answer is: $320$

Write comments to indicate the steps you take. Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Assistant:

Approach:


The given equation is a product of two expressions equal to zero. Therefore, either of the two expressions must be zero. We can analyze these two cases separately.

Case 1: $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$
For the sum of two squares to be zero, both squares must be zero. Therefore, we have:
$$\vert x + y \vert - 10 = 0 \quad \text{and} \quad \vert x - y \vert - 10 = 0.$$
Solving these two equations, we get:
$$\vert x + y \vert = 10 \quad \text{and} \quad \vert x - y \vert = 10.$$
This implies that $x + y = \pm 10$ and $x - y = \pm 10$. Solving these four equations, we get the vertices of the polygon as:
$$(5,5), (5,-5), (-5,5), (-5,-5).$$

Case 2: $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$
Following the same logic as in Case 1, we have:
$$\vert x \vert - 8 = 0 \quad \text{and} \quad \vert y \vert - 8 = 0.$$
This implies that $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$. Solving these two equations, we get the vertices of the polygon as:
$$(8,0), (0,8), (-8,0), (0,-8).$$

The four vertices from both cases form a square with side length 10 units. The area of a square is side length squared, so the area of the square is $10^2 = 100$ square units.
The answer is: 100

Approach:


The expression $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ is true if either of the two terms is equal to zero. 
If $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$, then $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ or $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. This represents a square with side length of 20 units.
If $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$, then $\vert x \vert = 8$ or $\vert y \vert = 8$. This represents a square with side length of 16 units.
The area of the convex polygon is the sum of the areas of these two squares.

```python


INTERMEDIATE OUT :

def polygon_area():
    side1 = 20
    side2 = 16

Assistant:

Approach:

 The expression equals zero when either $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$, or when either $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$. 

These give us the following sets of equations:
1. $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$
2. $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$

Solving these gives us the vertices of the polygon:
1. From $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$, we get the four vertices $(8,2)$, $(8,-2)$, $(-8,2)$, and $(-8,-2)$.
2. From $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$, we get the four vertices $(8,8)$, $(8,-8)$, $(-8,8)$, and $(-8,-8)$.

These eight points form a square with side length $16$.

Finally, the area of the square is $16^2 = 256$.
The answer is: 256

Approach:

 The given equation is satisfied only when both $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ and $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$, which implies that $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. These two equations represent two squares with side length 10. The intersections of these squares form a square with side length 8 (since the distance between $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$ is 8 by Pythagorean theorem). So the area of the convex polygon is the area of this square, which is $8^2 = 64$.

Therefore, the area of the convex polygon is 64. The answer is: $64$

Approach:

 The given equation is equivalent to $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ and $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ and $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ and $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$. Setting each absolute value equal to zero gives us the equations:
1. $x + y = 10$
2. $x - y = 10$
3. $x = 8$
4. $y = 8$

Solving the first two equations gives $x = 10$ and $y = 0$ for the first equation and $x = 10$ and $y = 0$ for the second equation. This means the points are $(10, 0)$, $(10, 0)$, $(8, 8)$ and $(-8, 8)$. These four points form a square with side length 8. The area of a square is side length squared, so the area of the convex polygon is $8^2 = 64$.
The answer is: $64$

The given equation is a product of two expressions equals to zero. This means either of the two expressions should be zero for the entire equation to be zero. Hence, we can break the equation into two parts and solve each part separately.

1. $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$
2. $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$

For the first equation to be zero, we need $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. This means that $x + y = \pm 10$ and $x - y = \pm 10$. Solving these two equations we get four lines: $x + y = 10$, $x + y = -10$, $x - y = 10$, and $x - y = -10$.

For the second equation to be zero, we need $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$, which gives us four more lines: $x = 8$, $x = -8$, $y = 8$, and $y = -8$.

These eight lines enclose a square with side length $16$ (since the square's sides are parallel to the x and y axes and pass through the intersection points of the lines). The area of a square is side length squared, so the area of this square is $16^2 = 256$.
The answer is: 256

The product of two numbers is zero if and only if at least one of the numbers is zero. Therefore, we have the following two equations from the given equation:

1. $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + (\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$.
2. $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + (\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$.

From equation 1, we get that $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. Taking the absolute value into account, we have $x + y = \pm 10$ and $x - y = \pm 10$.

From equation 2, we get that $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$. Taking the absolute value into account, we have $x = \pm 8$ and $y = \pm 8$.

The system of equations $x + y = \pm 10$ and $x - y = \pm 10$ implies that the only possible solutions are $(x, y) = (5, 5), (5, -5), (-5, 5),$ and $(-5, -5)$.

Similarly, the system of equations $x = \pm 8$ and $y = \pm 8$ implies that the only possible solutions are $(x, y) = (8, 8), (8, -8), (-8, 8),$ and $(-8, -8)$.

Combining these results, we see that the points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying the original equation are $(5, 5), (5, -5), (-5, 5),$ and $(-5, -5)$ and $(8, 8), (8, -8), (-8, 8),$ and $(-8, -8)$.

These points form a rectangle with vertices at $(5, 5), (5, -5), (-5, -5),$ and $(-5, 5)$. The lengths of the sides of the rectangle are $10$ and $16$, so the area of the rectangle is $10 \times 16 = 160$.

The answer is: $\boxed{160}$.

The given equation is a product of two expressions equal to zero, which implies that each of the expressions must be zero individually. Therefore, we have two sets of equations to solve:

1. $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ and $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$.
2. $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ and $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$.

Solving these equations gives the vertices of the polygon. Once we have the vertices, we can use a formula for the area of a polygon to find the area of the polygon.

The following Python script solves the problem:

```python

The vertices of the polygon are $(-8, -2)$, $(-8, 18)$, $(8, -18)$, $(8, 2)$, $(-18, -8)$, $(-2, 8)$, $(2, -8)$, and $(18, 8)$.

The area of a polygon can be found using the Shoelace formula. However, this polygon is an octagon, so it's easier to divide it into four rectangles. The side lengths of the rectangles are 16 and 20, so the areas of the rectangles are $16 \times 20 = 320$.

Since the area of each rectangle is the same, the total area of the octagon is $4 \times 320 = 1280$.

So, the area of the convex polygon is 1280 square units.
The answer is: $1280$

This problem is based on the properties of absolute value functions and the equation given. First, we observe that the product of two terms equals zero if and only if one of the terms is zero. Therefore, we can set each term in the product equal to zero and solve for the possible values of x and y.

First term: $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0 \implies \vert x + y \vert = 10$
Second term: $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0 \implies \vert x - y \vert = 10$
Third term: $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0 \implies \vert x \vert = 8 \implies x = \pm 8$
Fourth term: $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0 \implies \vert y \vert = 8 \implies y = \pm 8$

From the equations above, we can see that the polygon is a square with side length 10. The area of a square is given by the formula $s^2$, where s is the length of the side. Therefore, the area of the square is $10^2 = 100$. The answer is: $100$

Solve the following problem with a Python Script (positive numerical answer):
"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"

Approach:

 The equation $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ is satisfied when either of the factors is zero. The factors are:

1. $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2) = 0$,
2. $((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$.

The first factor is zero if both $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. These two conditions describe a square with side length 10. The second factor is zero if both $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$, which describes a square with side length 16. The area of the convex polygon formed by the intersection of these two squares is the area of the smaller square, which is $10 \times 10 = 100$. So the area of the convex polygon is 100.
The answer is: $100$

Approach:



This problem is essentially asking for the area of the set of points $\left(x, y\right)$ that satisfy the given equation.

From the equation, we know that one of the two terms in the left-hand side must be zero for the entire expression to be zero.

This gives us two cases:

1. $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ and $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$.
2. $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ and $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$.

For case 1, we have $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. These are the equations of two lines parallel to the x-axis and y-axis respectively, at a distance of 10 units from the origin.

For case 2, we have $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$. These are the equations of two circles centered at the origin with radius 8.

The area of the convex polygon enclosed by the points satisfying the given equation is the intersection of these two cases, which is a square with side length 16.

Calculating the area of the square gives us $16^2 = 256$.

Therefore, the area of the convex polygon is 256.
The answer is: $\boxed{256}$.
