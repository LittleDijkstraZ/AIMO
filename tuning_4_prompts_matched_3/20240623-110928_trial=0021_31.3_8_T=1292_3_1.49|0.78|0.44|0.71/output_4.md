Approach:


We will try to find a value of $f(1)$ first, then use the second condition to find $f(2)$, $f(4)$, $f(8)$, ..., and eventually $f(100)$.

Step 1: Setting $n=1$ in the first equation, we have $f(f(f(1)))=8*1-7=1$.

Step 2: Since $f(f(f(1)))=1$, we have $f(f(1))=1$ or $f(1)=1$.

Step 3: Setting $n=2$ in the second equation, we have $f(2*2)=2*f(2)+1$, or $f(4)=2f(2)+1$.

Step 4: Setting $n=1$ in the second equation, we have $f(2*1)=2*f(1)+1$, or $f(2)=2*1+1=3$.

Step 5: Substituting $f(2)=3$ into the equation from step 3, we have $f(4)=2*3+1=7$.

Step 6: Setting $n=4$ in the second equation, we have $f(2*4)=2*f(4)+1$, or $f(8)=2*7+1=15$.

Step 7: Setting $n=8$ in the second equation, we have $f(2*8)=2*f(8)+1$, or $f(16)=2*15+1=31$.

Step 8: Continuing this process, we find that $f(32)=63$, $f(64)=127$, and so on. We can observe that $f(2^k)=2^{k+2}-3$.

Step 9: Now we can find $f(100)$, since $100=2^2*5^2$. We know that $f(2^2)=7$, and from the step 7, we have $f(5^2)=127$. Using the second equation, we have $f(100)=2*f(50)+1$.

Step 10: Setting $n=50$ in the second equation, we have $f(2*50)=2*f(50)+1$, or $f(100)=2*f(50)+1$.

Step 11: We know that $f(100)=2*f(50)+1$, and $f(50)=2*f(25)+1=2*(2*f(12.5)+1)+1=2*(2*(2*f(6.25)+1)+1)+1=2*(2*(2*(2*f(3.125)+1)+1)+1)+1=2*(2*(2*(2*(2*f(1.5625)+1)+1)+1)+1)+1=2*(2*(2*(2*(2*(2*f(0.78125)+1)+1)+1)+1)+1)+1$.

We can continue this process until we reach $f(1)$, which we found in step 2 that $f(1)=1$.

Step 12: Substituting $f(1)=1$ back into the equation, we can work our way back up to find $f(50)=127$, and finally $f(100)=2*127+1=255$.

So, the value of $f(100)$ is 255. The answer is: $\boxed{255}$

Approach:


To find $f(100)$, we first need to understand the given function $f$. The first equation gives us a recursive relationship for the function, and the second equation provides an alternative way to compute $f(n)$ when $n$ is an even number.

Let's start by finding $f(1)$, then use the second equation to find $f(2)$, $f(4)$, $f(8)$, and so on. Then we can use the first equation to find $f(f(f(n)))$ for various $n$, which will help us find $f(100)$.

First, set $n = 1$ in the second equation to get $f(2) = 2f(1) + 1$. Since we don't know $f(1)$, we cannot directly solve for it. However, we can use the first equation to express $f(f(f(1)))$ in terms of $f(1)$. Set $n = f(1)$ in the first equation to get $f(f(f(1))) = 8f(1) - 7$. But from the first equation, we know that $f(f(f(1))) = f(2)$. So we have $f(2) = 8f(1) - 7$. Now we can substitute $f(2) = 2f(1) + 1$ into this equation to get $2f(1) + 1 = 8f(1) - 7$, which simplifies to $6f(1) = 8$ and hence $f(1) = 4/3$. But this is not a valid solution as $f(1)$ should be a positive integer. This means we made a mistake in our reasoning.

Let's try another approach. Since $f(2n) = 2f(n) + 1$, we can find $f(2)$ as follows: $f(2) = 2f(1) + 1 = 2(1) + 1 = 3$.
Now we can find $f(4)$ using the second equation: $f(4) = 2f(2) + 1 = 2(3) + 1 = 7$.
Next, we can find $f(8)$ using the second equation: $f(8) = 2f(4) + 1 = 2(7) + 1 = 15$.
We can continue this process to find $f(16)$, $f(32)$, and so on. We notice a pattern here: $f(2^n) = 2^n + 2^{n-1} - 1$. For example, $f(2) = 3 = 2^2 + 2^{2-1} - 1$, $f(4) = 7 = 2^3 + 2^{3-1} - 1$, and so on.

Now let's find $f(100)$. We can write $100$ as $2^6 + 2^2$. Then $f(100) = f(2^6 + 2^2) = f(64 + 4) = f(68)$.
Using the pattern we found, we have $f(68) = 2^{6} + 2^{6-1} - 1 = 64 + 32 - 1 = 95$.
So $f(100) = 95$.

Now we can confirm this result using the first equation. We need to check if $f(f(f(100))) = 8(100) - 7$. We already know $f(100) = 95$, so we need to find $f(f(95))$.
We already know the pattern $f(2^n) = 2^n + 2^{n-1} - 1$, so $f(95) = f(2^6 + 2^3 - 1) = f(64 + 8 - 1) = f(71)$. Using the pattern again, we get $f(71) = 2^7 + 2^{7-1} - 1 = 128 + 32 - 1 = 161$.
Finally, we find $f(f(95)) = f(161)$. Using the pattern once more, we get $f(161) = 2^{8} + 2^{8-1} - 1 = 256 + 128 - 1 = 383$. But $383$ is not equal to $8(100) - 7 = 793$, so we made a mistake somewhere.

After examining our calculations, we realize that the pattern $f(2^n) = 2^n + 2^{n-1} - 1$ does not hold true for all $n$. We must have made a mistake in our pattern derivation. Let's go back and re-derive the pattern.

From the first equation, we know that $f(f(f(n))) = 8n - 7$. Let $n = 2^k$ for some integer $k$. Then $f(f(f(2^k))) = 8(2^k) - 7 = 2^{k+3} + 2^{k+2} - 7$. But $f(f(f(2^k))) = f(f(2^{k+1})) = f(2^{k+2}) = 2^{k+2} + 2^{k+1} - 1$. So we have $2^{k+2} + 2^{k+1} - 1 = 2^{k+3} + 2^{k+2} - 7$. This simplifies to $2^{k+1} - 6 = 2^{k+2} - 7$, which leads to $2^{k+1} = 1$, but this is a contradiction as $k+1 \geq 1$. Therefore, our initial pattern was incorrect.

After revisiting our calculations and re-deriving the pattern, we find that the correct pattern is $f(2^n) = 3 \cdot 2^{n-1} - 1$. Let's confirm this pattern with some examples.

For $n = 1$, $f(2) = 3 \cdot 2^{1-1} - 1 = 3 \cdot 1 - 1 = 2$. For $n = 2$, $f(4) = 3 \cdot 2^{2-1} - 1 = 3 \cdot 2 - 1 = 5$. For $n = 3$, $f(8) = 3 \cdot 2^{3-1} - 1 = 3 \cdot 4 - 1 = 11$.

Now let's check if $f(f(f(100))) = 8(100) - 7$. We already know $f(10

Approach:


This problem requires using the given conditions iteratively to calculate $f(100)$.
First, we use the condition $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$ to express $f(100)$ in terms of $f(50)$ and then in terms of $f(25)$. Next, we use the condition $f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$ to express $f(25)$ in terms of $n$. Finally, we substitute $n=25$ into the equation to find $f(25)$, and then substitute $f(25)$ back into the equation for $f(50)$ to find $f(50)$. We can continue this process until we get to $f(100)$.

Approach:



We are given two equations to work with. We can use the second equation to simplify the first one.

Let's start with $f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$. By using the second equation $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$, we can replace $f(f(f(n)))$ with $f(2f(f(n)))$.

Then we have $f(2f(f(n)))=8n-7$. By applying the second equation again, we get $2f(f(f(n)))+1=8n-7$.

This gives us $2f(f(f(n)))=8n-8$, so $f(f(f(n)))=4n-4$.

Now, let's set $n=f(n)$ in $f(f(f(n)))=4n-4$. We get $f(f(f(f(n)))) = 4f(n) - 4$. By the first equation, $f(f(f(f(n)))) = 8n - 7$.

So we have $4f(n) - 4 = 8n - 7$.

Solving for $f(n)$, we get $f(n) = 2n - 1$.

Now, to find $f(100)$, we simply plug in $n=100$ into the equation $f(n) = 2n - 1$.

So, $f(100) = 2(100) - 1 = 200 - 1 = 199$.
The answer is $\boxed{199}$.

Approach:


We will try to find the value of $f(100)$ using the given functional equations.

Firstly, we know that $f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$. If we let $n=1$, we have $f(f(f(1)))=8*1-7=1$, and since $f(1)$ must be a positive integer, we can conclude that $f(1)=1$.

Next, we use the second equation $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$. We know that $f(1)=1$, so we can find $f(2)$ by setting $n=1$:
$$f(2) = 2f(1)+1 = 2*1+1 = 3.$$
Then, we find $f(4)$ by setting $n=2$:
$$f(4) = 2f(2)+1 = 2*3+1 = 7.$$
And we find $f(8)$ by setting $n=4$:
$$f(8) = 2f(4)+1 = 2*7+1 = 15.$$
Continuing this process, we find $f(16)$ by setting $n=8$:
$$f(16) = 2f(8)+1 = 2*15+1 = 31.$$
We observe a pattern that $f(2^k) = 2^k + 2^k - 1 = 2^{k+1} - 1$.

Now, we want to find $f(100)$. We can write $100$ as $2^6 + 2^2$, then we have:
$$f(100) = f(2^6 + 2^2) = f(64 + 4) = f(68).$$
We know that $f(2^k) = 2^{k+1} - 1$, so we have:
$$f(68) = f(2^6 + 4) = f(64 + 4) = f(2^6) + f(4) = (2^{6+1} - 1) + (2*3+1) = 63 + 7 = 70.$$

So the value of $f(100)$ is $70$.

But we must have been mistaken, because our answer doesn't match the given conditions. Let's check the conditions again:
- $f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$: We have $f(f(f(1)))=1$, but $8*1-7 = 1$, so this condition is satisfied.
- $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$: We have $f(2)=3$, $f(4)=7$, $f(8)=15$, $f(16)=31$, and it seems to hold true for $n=1,2,4,8$. However, when we compute $f(100)$, we found $f(100)=70$. But from the condition $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$, we should have $f(100)=2f(50)+1$. Let's compute $f(50)$ using the condition $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$. We have:
$$f(50) = f(2*25) = 2f(25)+1.$$
Since $25 = 2^4 + 1$, we know $f(25) = 2^{4+1} - 1 = 15$, so:
$$f(50) = 2*15 + 1 = 31.$$
And then:
$$f(100) = 2f(50) + 1 = 2*31 + 1 = 63.$$
However, this result doesn't match with our previous result $f(100)=70$. This indicates that there might be a mistake in our calculations. Let's go back and retrace our steps.

After careful examination, we realize that our mistake came from the incorrect application of the second condition $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$. We were using this condition to compute $f(100)$, which is incorrect because we should have first computed $f(50)$ and then used that result to compute $f(100)$. 

Let's correct this and compute $f(100)$ again. 

First, we know that $f(1)=1$, $f(2)=3$, $f(4)=7$, $f(8)=15$, and $f(16)=31$. We can use these results to compute $f(32)$ and $f(64)$ using the second condition $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$:
$$f(32) = 2f(16) + 1 = 2*31 + 1 = 63,$$
$$f(64) = 2f(32) + 1 = 2*63 + 1 = 127.$$

Now, we can compute $f(50)$ using the first condition $f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$:
$$f(50) = f(2^5 + 2^1 - 2) = f(32 + 2 - 2) = f(32) = 63.$$

Finally, we can compute $f(100)$ using the second condition $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$:
$$f(100) = 2f(50) + 1 = 2*63 + 1 = 127.$$

So the value of $f(100)$ is indeed $127$. 

But this result doesn't match the condition $f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$. Let's check:
$$f(f(f(100))) = f(f(127)) = f(254).$$
To compute $f(254)$, we first write $254 = 2^8 + 2^1 - 2$, and then use the first condition $f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$:
$$f(254) = f(2^8 + 2^1 - 2) = f(256 - 2) = f(

Approach:



To solve this problem, we can start by finding a pattern in the second condition $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$. By plugging in $n=1$, we get $f(2)=2f(1)+1$. If we let $f(1)=x$, then $f(2)=2x+1$.

Now, plugging in $n=2$ in the second condition, we get $f(4)=2f(2)+1=2(2x+1)+1=4x+3$.

Continuing this process, we can find that $f(8)=2f(4)+1=2(4x+3)+1=8x+7$, and so on. By observing this pattern, we can see that $f(2^k)=2^kf(1)+2^{k-1}-1$.

Now, let's look at the first condition $f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$. If we plug in $n=1$, we get $f(f(f(1)))=8*1-7=1$. Since $f(1)=x$, we have $f(f(x))=1$. From the pattern we observed, we know that $f(2^k)=2^kf(1)+2^{k-1}-1$. Thus, $f(2^k)=2^kx+2^{k-1}-1$. If we set this equal to 1, we get $2^kx+2^{k-1}-1=1$, which simplifies to $2^kx=2-2^{k-1}$. If $x$ is an integer, $2-2^{k-1}$ must be a power of 2, which only happens when $k=2$. Therefore, we have $f(1)=x=1$.

Now that we have $f(1)=1$, we can use the pattern we observed to find $f(100)=f(2^6+2^2)=2^6f(1)+2^5-1=64+32-1=95$. Therefore, $f(100)=95$.

The solution is: $f(100) = 95$. The answer is: $\boxed{95}$

We will first try to find the value of $f(1)$ using the second condition. Since $f(2 \cdot 1) = 2f(1) + 1$, we have $f(2) = 2f(1) + 1$. But from the first condition, $f(f(f(1))) = 8 \cdot 1 - 7 = -1$, and thus $f(f(1)) = 1$. Substituting $n=1$ in the second condition again, we get $f(2) = 2f(1) + 1 = f(f(1)) = 1$. So we have $2f(1) + 1 = 1$, and thus $f(1) = 0$.

Now we have found $f(1) = 0$. We can substitute $n = 1$ into the second condition to find $f(2) = 2f(1) + 1 = 2 \cdot 0 + 1 = 1$. Similarly, we can find $f(3) = f(2 \cdot 1.5) = 2f(1.5) + 1$. But from the first condition, $f(f(f(1.5))) = 8 \cdot 1.5 - 7 = 1$, and thus $f(f(1.5)) = 1$. Substituting $n = 1.5$ into the second condition, we get $f(3) = 2f(1.5) + 1 = f(f(1.5)) = 1$. This means $2f(1.5) + 1 = 1$, and thus $f(1.5) = 0$. Similarly, we can find that $f(4) = f(2 \cdot 2) = 2f(2) + 1 = 2 \cdot 1 + 1 = 3$.

We can continue this process to find the values of $f(n)$ for all positive integers $n$. After doing so, we find that $f(100) = 199$.
The answer is: $199$

Approach:


We will try to find the value of $f(100)$ by using the given functional equations step by step.

First, we will find the value of $f(100)$ using the equation $f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$. We have $n=100$, so we want to find $f(f(f(100)))$. Substituting $n=100$ into the equation gives us $f(f(f(100)))=8*100-7=793$.

Now, we want to find $f(f(f(100)))$, which is equal to 793, and we know that $f(f(f(n)))=793$. Setting $n=100$ in this equation gives us $f(f(100))=793$.

Next, we want to find $f(100)$. We can use the second given equation, $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$. To do this, we will set $n=50$ in this equation. This gives us $f(100)=2f(50)+1$.

To find $f(50)$, we can again use the second given equation. Setting $n=25$ gives us $f(50)=2f(25)+1$. We can continue to apply the second equation to reduce the values of $n$ until we get a value that can be directly calculated from the first given equation.

After several steps, we find that $f(2)=3$, $f(4)=7$, $f(8)=15$, $f(16)=31$, $f(32)=63$, and $f(64)=127$. Then, we have $f(100)=2f(50)+1=2(2f(25)+1)+1=2(2(2f(12.5)+1)+1)+1=2(2(2(2f(6.25)+1)+1)+1)+1=2(2(2(2(2f(3.125)+1)+1)+1)+1)+1=2(2(2(2(2(3*2+1)+1)+1)+1)+1)+1=2(2(2(2(7)+1)+1)+1)+1=2(2(2(15)+1)+1)+1=2(2(31)+1)+1=2(63)+1=127$.

So, $f(100)=127$.

Approach:


This problem involves a functional equation with two conditions. We can start by using the second condition to simplify the problem.

Let's calculate $f(f(f(100))) = 8*100 - 7 = 793$.
Then from $f(f(f(100))) = 793$, we can deduce $f(f(100)) = x$ and $f(x) = 793$.
Let's substitute $f(100)$ into the second condition:
\[f(2*100) = 2f(100) + 1 \Rightarrow f(200) = 2f(100) + 1.\]
We know $f(f(f(100))) = 793$, therefore $f(200) = 793$.

We now have the equation $f(200) = 793$. We want to find $f(100)$, we can take the second condition $f(2n) = 2f(n) + 1$ and substitute $n = 100$:
\[f(2*100) = 2f(100) + 1 \Rightarrow f(200) = 2f(100) + 1.\]
We already know that $f(200) = 793$, so:
\[793 = 2f(100) + 1 \Rightarrow 792 = 2f(100).\]
Solving for $f(100)$, we get $f(100) = \frac{792}{2} = 396$.

Finally, we have found that $f(100) = 396$. Therefore, the value of $f(100)$ is 396. The answer is: $396$.

Approach:


To find $f(100)$, we first need to find the function $f$. From the given conditions, we have $f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$ and $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$. The second equation gives us a clue on how to find the function $f$. We can guess that $f(n) = 2n-1$ based on the equation $f(2n) = 2f(n)+1$. Let's check if this guess works with the first equation $f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$.

Substitute $f(n) = 2n-1$ into $f(f(f(n)))$, we get
\[f(f(f(n))) = f(f(2n-1)) = f(2(2n-1)-1) = f(4n-3) = 2(4n-3)-1 = 8n-7.\]

So indeed, $f(n) = 2n-1$ is a solution to both given conditions. Therefore, $f(100) = 2(100) - 1 = 199$.

The value of $f(100)$ is $199$. The answer is: $199$.

Approach:


To calculate $f(100)$, we will use the provided functional equations step by step.

First, we need to find $f(f(f(100)))$. We know that from the first equation, $f(f(f(100)))=8*100-7=793$. So now we need to find $f(793)$.

Next, we can apply the second equation to find $f(2*396.5) = 2f(396.5) + 1$. Since $f(f(f(100)))=793$ implies $f(396.5)=396.5$, we get $f(793)=2*396.5+1=794$.

Finally, we apply the second equation again to find $f(2*397) = 2f(397) + 1$. Since $f(794)=794$, we have $f(794)=2*397+1=795$.

So, we have found that $f(100) = 795$. The answer is: $795$

Solve the following problem with a Python Script (positive numerical answer):
"A function $f: \mathbb N \to \mathbb N$ satisfies the following two conditions for all positive integers $n$:$f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$ and $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$. Calculate $f(100)$."

Approach:

 We will use the second equation to simplify the first one.
Let's set $n = f(k)$ in the second equation, then we have $f(2f(k)) = 2f(f(k)) + 1$,
which means $f(f(f(k))) = 2f(f(k)) + 1$. 
Now we can substitute this into the first equation:
\[f(f(f(n)))=8n-7 \Rightarrow f(2f(n)+1) = 8n - 7.\]

Next, we set $n = 1$ in the second equation:
\[f(2) = 2f(1) + 1.\]
If we can find $f(1)$, we can find $f(2)$ and then use the second equation to find $f(4)$, $f(8)$, and so on, to find $f(100)$.

We set $n = 2$ in the second equation:
\[f(4) = 2f(2) + 1.\]
And set $n = 4$ in the second equation:
\[f(8) = 2f(4) + 1.\]
Continue this way, we can find $f(16)$, $f(32)$, and so on, until we reach $f(100)$.

By trial and error, we find that $f(1) = 1$. So we can find $f(2) = 2f(1) + 1 = 3$, $f(4) = 2f(2) + 1 = 7$, $f(8) = 2f(4) + 1 = 15$, and so on.

After finding $f(32) = 127$, we can use the first equation to find $f(100)$:
\[f(100) = \frac{f(127) + 7}{8}.\]
We know that $f(127) = 127$, because $127$ is $2^7 - 1$, and $f(2^n - 1) = 2^n - 1$ for all positive integers $n$.

Therefore, $f(100) = \frac{127 + 7}{8} = 16$.

So the answer is $f(100) = 16$. The Python script to solve this problem is as follows:

```python


INTERMEDIATE OUT :

def f(n):
    if n == 1:
        return 1
    elif n == 2:
        return 3
    elif n == 4:
        return 7
    elif n == 8:
        return 15
    elif n == 16:
        return 31
    elif n == 32:
        return 127
    else:
        return (f(127) + 7) // 8

print(f(100))
```
```output

CODE RESULTS Traceback: line 6, in f
    if n == 1:
RecursionError: maximum recursion depth exceeded in comparison

FAIL


INTERMEDIATE OUT :

Traceback: line 6, in f
    if n == 1:
RecursionError: maximum recursion depth exceeded in comparison

FAIL

```
The recursion error is because the Python script tries to calculate $f(100)$ by calling $f(127)$, and then calls $f(127)$ by calling $f(1)$ again and again. This causes the recursion depth to exceed the maximum allowed recursion depth. The issue is that the script tries to calculate $f(100)$ by using the equation $f(100) = \frac{f(127) + 7}{8}$, which involves calculating $f(127)$ first. But calculating $f(127)$ involves repeatedly calling $f(n)$ for values of $n$ that are smaller than $127$, which leads to the recursion depth error.

To solve this problem, we need to find another way to calculate $f(100)$. Let's reconsider the original problem.

We know that $f(1) = 1$. Using the second equation, we can find $f(2) = 2f(1) + 1 = 3$, $f(4) = 2f(2) + 1 = 7$, $f(8) = 2f(4) + 1 = 15$, and so on. After finding $f(32) = 127$, we can continue using the second equation to find $f(64)$, $f(128)$, and so on, until we reach $f(100)$.

However, this process will take a long time and is not efficient. Let's try another approach.

We can observe that the function $f$ is defined in a way that it doubles the argument and then adds 1. But we also know that $f(f(f(n))) = 8n - 7$. Combining these two facts, we can come up with the following equation:

\[f(f(f(n))) = 2f(f(n)) + 1 = 8n - 7.\]

This equation holds for all positive integers $n$. So, if we can find the value of $f(n)$ for some $n$, we can use this equation to find the value of $f(f(n))$ and $f(f(f(n)))$.

Let's start with $n = 1$. We know that $f(1) = 1$. Now we can find $f(2) = 2f(1) + 1 = 3$. Then we can find $f(4) = 2f(2) + 1 = 7$. We continue this process until we reach $f(100)$.

By using this approach, we can calculate $f(100) = 16$. This is much more efficient than the previous approach. The modified Python script to solve this problem is as follows:

```python


INTERMEDIATE OUT :

def f(n):
    if n == 1:
        return 1
    else:
        return 2 * f((n - 1) // 2) + 1

print(f(100))
```
```output

CODE RESULTS Traceback: line 6, in f
    if n == 1:
RecursionError: maximum recursion depth exceeded in comparison

FAIL


INTERMEDIATE OUT :

Traceback: line 6, in f
    if n == 1:
RecursionError: maximum recursion depth exceeded in comparison

FAIL

```
The recursion error is because the Python script tries to calculate $f(100)$ by calling $f((100 - 1) // 2)$, and then calls $f((49 - 1) // 2)$, and so on, until it calls $f(0)$, which leads to the recursion depth error. This is because the function $f$ is defined in a way that it doubles the argument and then adds 1, and this operation is applied repeatedly until the argument becomes 1, after which the recursion stops. However, in the Python script, the recursion stops when the argument becomes 0, which is not the base case of the recursion.

To solve this problem, we need to modify the

Approach:


This problem requires a series of substitutions to reduce the complexity and identify a pattern or a relation between the function $f(n)$ and the input $n$. 

1. Substitute $n = 1$ into the equation $f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$ to get $f(f(f(1)))=8*1-7=1$.
2. Since $f(f(f(1)))=1$, we can write this as $f(f(1))=f^{-1}(1)$.
3. Now substitute $n = f(1)$ into the equation $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$ to get $f(2f(1))=2f(f(1))+1$.
4. Substituting $f(f(1))=f^{-1}(1)$, the equation becomes $f(2f(1))=2f^{-1}(1)+1$.
5. But from step 2, we know $f(f(1))=1$, therefore we can substitute $f(1)=1$ into the equation above to get $f(2)=2f^{-1}(1)+1$.
6. Now substitute $f(1)=1$ into the equation $f(f(1))=1$ to get $f(1)=1$.
7. From step 5, we can find $f(2)$ in terms of $f^{-1}(1)$, and from step 6, we know $f(1)=1$, so we can substitute $f(1)=1$ into the equation $f(2)=2f^{-1}(1)+1$ to get $f(2)=2*1+1=3$.
8. Now we have found $f(1)=1$ and $f(2)=3$. 
9. We can use these values to find $f(3)$ by substituting $n=2$ into the equation $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$ to get $f(4)=2f(2)+1=2*3+1=7$.
10. We can then find $f(6)$ by substituting $n=3$ into the equation $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$ to get $f(6)=2f(3)+1$. But we don't know $f(3)$ yet, so we need to find it.
11. Substitute $n=1$ into the equation $f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$ to get $f(f(f(1)))=8*1-7=1$. From step 2, we know $f(f(1))=1$, therefore $f(1)=1$.
12. Substitute $n=2$ into the equation $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$ to get $f(4)=2f(2)+1$. But from step 7, we know $f(2)=3$, therefore $f(4)=2*3+1=7$.
13. Now substitute $n=3$ into the equation $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$ to get $f(6)=2f(3)+1$. But we know from step 12 that $f(4)=7$, therefore $f(6)=2*f(3)+1$.
14. Since $f(4)=7$, we can write this as $7=2f(2)+1$. Solving for $f(2)$, we get $f(2)=\frac{7-1}{2}=3$. 
15. Substitute $n=2$ into the equation $f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$ to get $f(f(f(2)))=8*2-7=9$. From step 7, we know $f(2)=3$, therefore $f(3)=9$.
16. Now we can substitute $f(3)=9$ into the equation $f(6)=2f(3)+1$ to get $f(6)=2*9+1=19$.
17. Finally, substitute $n=100$ into the equation $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$ repeatedly to find $f(200)$, $f(400)$, $f(800)$, and $f(1600)$. We find that $f(1600)=12799$.

Solution: The value of $f(100)$ is 12799. The answer is: $\boxed{12799}$

Assistant:

Approach:

 We will solve the problem by first computing $f(100)$ using the given functional equations. The second equation can be used to simplify $f(100)$ until we reach a value that we can find using the first equation.

Step 1: Apply the second equation to compute $f(100)$.
We have $f(100) = 2f(50) + 1$.

Step 2: Apply the second equation again to compute $f(50)$.
We have $f(50) = 2f(25) + 1$.

Step 3: Apply the second equation again to compute $f(25)$.
We have $f(25) = 2f(12.5)$.

At this point, we need to use the first equation, which says $f(f(f(n))) = 8n - 7$. Setting $n = 12.5$, we get
$$f(f(f(12.5))) = 8 \cdot 12.5 - 7 = 97.$$

Now, since $f(12.5)$ is the value that we want to find for $f(25)$, and $f(25)$ is the value we need to find for $f(50)$, and $f(50)$ is the value we need to find for $f(100)$,

we can use the fact that $f(f(f(12.5))) = 97$ to say that $f(12.5)$ is a value $x$ such that $f(f(x)) = 97$. So, setting $n = x = 12.5$ in the first equation, we get
$$f(f(12.5)) = 8 \cdot 12.5 - 7 = 97.$$

So, $f(12.5)$ is a value $x$ such that $f(x) = 97$. Now, we can substitute $x = 97$ into the second equation to get
$$f(50) = 2 \cdot 97 + 1 = 195.$$

Substituting $f(50) = 195$ into the second equation again to find $f(100)$, we get
$$f(100) = 2 \cdot 195 + 1 = 391.$$

So, $f(100) = 391$. The value of $f(100)$ is $391$. The answer is: $391$

Approach:


To calculate $f(100)$, we will use the provided functional equations.
We can start by plugging in $n = 100$ into the equation $f(2n) = 2f(n) + 1$. This gives us $f(200) = 2f(100) + 1$.
Now, we will use the equation $f(f(f(n))) = 8n - 7$ with $n = 100$. This gives us $f(f(f(100))) = 8*100 - 7 = 793$.
From $f(f(f(100))) = 793$, we can say $f(f(100)) = a$ (where $a$ is a number) such that $f(a) = 793$.

Now, from the equation $f(2n) = 2f(n) + 1$, we can say that $f(200) = 2f(100) + 1$. We already know that $f(200) = 2f(100) + 1$. So we have $f(100) = b$ (where $b$ is a number) such that $f(b) = a$.

Therefore, from $f(f(100)) = a$ and $f(100) = b$, we can deduce that $f(b) = a$.

And we know that $f(a) = 793$.

So we have $f(b) = a$ and $f(a) = 793$. Hence $f(b) = 793$.

We can now use the equation $f(2n) = 2f(n) + 1$ to find the value of $b$ such that $f(b) = 793$. By trial and error, we find that $b = 793/2 = 396.5$, which is not an integer, contradiction.

We made a mistake in our reasoning, and we should use the equation $f(f(f(n))) = 8n - 7$ again to find another value of $a$. Let's try $n = 50$. We have $f(f(f(50))) = 8*50 - 7 = 393$. So we have $f(f(50)) = c$ (where $c$ is a number) such that $f(c) = 393$.

Now, from the equation $f(2n) = 2f(n) + 1$, we can say that $f(100) = 2f(50) + 1$. We already know that $f(100) = 2f(50) + 1$. So we have $f(50) = d$ (where $d$ is a number) such that $f(d) = c$.

Therefore, from $f(f(50)) = c$ and $f(50) = d$, we can deduce that $f(d) = c$.

And we know that $f(c) = 393$.

So we have $f(d) = c$ and $f(c) = 393$. Hence $f(d) = 393$.

We can now use the equation $f(2n) = 2f(n) + 1$ to find the value of $d$ such that $f(d) = 393$. By trial and error, we find that $d = 393/2 = 196.5$, which is not an integer, contradiction.

We made a mistake again. Let's try a smaller value of $n$ for the equation $f(f(f(n))) = 8n - 7$. Let's try $n = 25$. We have $f(f(f(25))) = 8*25 - 7 = 193$. So we have $f(f(25)) = e$ (where $e$ is a number) such that $f(e) = 193$.

Now, from the equation $f(2n) = 2f(n) + 1$, we can say that $f(50) = 2f(25) + 1$. We already know that $f(50) = 2f(25) + 1$. So we have $f(25) = f$ (where $f$ is a number) such that $f(f) = e$.

Therefore, from $f(f(25)) = e$ and $f(25) = f$, we can deduce that $f(f) = e$.

And we know that $f(e) = 193$.

So we have $f(f) = e$ and $f(e) = 193$. Hence $f(f) = 193$.

We can now use the equation $f(2n) = 2f(n) + 1$ to find the value of $f$ such that $f(f) = 193$. By trial and error, we find that $f = 193/2 = 96.5$, which is not an integer, contradiction.

We made a mistake yet again. Let's try a smaller value of $n$ for the equation $f(f(f(n))) = 8n - 7$. Let's try $n = 12$. We have $f(f(f(12))) = 8*12 - 7 = 88$. So we have $f(f(12)) = g$ (where $g$ is a number) such that $f(g) = 88$.

Now, from the equation $f(2n) = 2f(n) + 1$, we can say that $f(24) = 2f(12) + 1$. We already know that $f(24) = 2f(12) + 1$. So we have $f(12) = h$ (where $h$ is a number) such that $f(h) = g$.

Therefore, from $f(f(12)) = g$ and $f(12) = h$, we can deduce that $f(h) = g$.

And we know that $f(g) = 88$.

So we have $f(h) = g$ and $f(g) = 88$. Hence $f(h) = 88$.

We can now use the equation $f(2n) = 2f(n) + 1$ to find the value of $h$ such that $f(h) = 88$. By trial and error, we find that $h =

To find $f(100)$, we can first find $f(2 \cdot 50)$, using the second condition given in the problem. Then we use this result to find $f(f(50))$, and again use this result to find $f(100)$.

Let's start:
We have $f(2 \cdot 50) = 2f(50) + 1$.
Then we use this result to find $f(f(50))$: $f(f(50)) = 8 \cdot 50 - 7 = 393$.
Now we can find $f(100)$: $f(100) = f(f(50)) = 393$.

So the answer is: $f(100) = 393$. The answer is: $\boxed{393}$
