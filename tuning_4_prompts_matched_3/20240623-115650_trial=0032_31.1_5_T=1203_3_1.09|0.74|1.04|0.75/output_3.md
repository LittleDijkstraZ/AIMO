Approach:


The equation given is a product of two expressions equal to zero, so either one of the expressions must be zero for the entire equation to hold true. This gives us two sets of equations to solve:
1. $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$
2. $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$

For the first set of equations, both $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2$ and $( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2$ must be zero. This means $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. The absolute value equations can be split into two cases each:
- Case 1: $x + y = 10$ and $x - y = 10$
- Case 2: $x + y = -10$ and $x - y = -10$

Solving these cases gives the vertices of the polygon: $(5,5)$ and $(-5,-5)$.

For the second set of equations, both $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2$ and $( \vert y \vert - 8)^2$ must be zero. This means $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$. Again, the absolute value equations can be split into two cases each:
- Case 1: $x = 8$ and $y = 8$
- Case 2: $x = -8$ and $y = -8$

Solving these cases gives the vertices of the polygon: $(8,8)$, $(8,-8)$, $(-8,8)$, and $(-8,-8)$.

The polygon is a square with side length 10 units. The area of a square is given by the square of the length of its side, so the area of this square is $10^2 = 100$ square units.

The answer is: $100$

Solve the following problem with a Python Script (positive numerical answer):
"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"

Approach:


The equation given is a product of two terms equals to zero, so either one of the terms must be zero. This gives us two separate equations to solve:
1. $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$
2. $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$

For the first equation, both terms must be zero, which implies that $|x + y| = 10$ and $|x - y| = 10$. This gives us the vertices of a square with side length 10.
For the second equation, both terms must be zero, which implies that $|x| = 8$ and $|y| = 8$. This gives us a square with side length 16.

Combining the solutions from both equations, we have a square with side length 16 inside a square with side length 20. The area of the convex polygon enclosed by the points is the area of the larger square minus the area of the smaller square.

Solution:
The area of a square with side length $s$ is $s^2$. So the area of the larger square is $20^2 = 400$, and the area of the smaller square is $16^2 = 256$. The area of the convex polygon is therefore $400 - 256 = 144$.
The answer is: $144$

Solve the following problem with a Python Script (positive numerical answer):
"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"

Approach:

 The equation $AB = 0$ is equivalent to $A = 0$ or $B = 0$. So the given equation is equivalent to either $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$.

For the first equation to be true, we must have $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. These are the equations of two pairs of parallel lines with distance $10$ from the origin.

For the second equation to be true, we must have $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$. These are the equations of two circles centered at the origin with radius $8$.

The convex polygon formed by the intersection of these lines and circles is a square with side length $16$. The area of a square is given by the square of the length of its side, so the area of the polygon is $16^2 = 256$. The answer is: $256$

Solve the following problem with a Python Script (positive numerical answer):
"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"

Approach:


The equation $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ is satisfied if either of the two factors is zero. This means that the points that satisfy the equation are those that satisfy either $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$.

The first equation is satisfied if both $\vert x + y \vert - 10 = 0$ and $\vert x - y \vert - 10 = 0$, which implies $x + y = 10$ and $x - y = 10$ or $x + y = 10$ and $x - y = -10$. Solving these systems of equations gives the vertices of the polygon as $(5,5)$, $(10,0)$, $(0,10)$, $(-5,5)$, $(-5,-5)$, $(0,-10)$, $(10,0)$, and $(5,-5)$.

The second equation is satisfied if both $\vert x \vert - 8 = 0$ and $\vert y \vert - 8 = 0$, which implies $x = \pm 8$ and $y = \pm 8$. This gives the vertices $(8,8)$, $(8,-8)$, $(-8,8)$, and $(-8,-8)$.

Therefore, the points that satisfy the equation form a square with side length 10. The area of this square is $10^2 = 100$.

Therefore, the area of the convex polygon is $100$.
The answer is: $100$

Solve the following problem with a Python Script (positive numerical answer):
"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"

Approach:


The equation $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ is satisfied if either of the two factors is zero. This gives us two sets of equations to solve:
1. $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ and $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$
2. $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ and $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$

For the first set of equations, we have $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x \vert = 8$. This implies that $-10 \leq x + y \leq 10$ and $-8 \leq x \leq 8$. Similarly, for the second set of equations, we have $\vert x - y \vert = 10$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$. This implies that $-10 \leq x - y \leq 10$ and $-8 \leq y \leq 8$.

The solutions to these equations form a square with side length 16. The area of this square is $16^2 = 256$. Therefore, the area of the convex polygon is 256. The answer is: $256$

Solve the following problem with a Python Script (positive numerical answer):
"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"
Write comments to indicate the steps you take. Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Assistant:

Approach:

 The given equation is a product of two expressions equal to zero, so we can set each expression to zero and solve for the possible values of $(x, y)$.

The expressions are $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2$ and $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2$, and $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2$ and $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2$.

Setting each expression to zero gives us the following solutions:

1. For the first pair of expressions:
   a. $\vert x + y \vert - 10 = 0 \Rightarrow \vert x + y \vert = 10 \Rightarrow x + y = \pm 10$
   b. $\vert x - y \vert - 10 = 0 \Rightarrow \vert x - y \vert = 10 \Rightarrow x - y = \pm 10$

2. For the second pair of expressions:
   a. $\vert x \vert - 8 = 0 \Rightarrow \vert x \vert = 8 \Rightarrow x = \pm 8$
   b. $\vert y \vert - 8 = 0 \Rightarrow \vert y \vert = 8 \Rightarrow y = \pm 8$

The solutions to these equations form a square with side length 16. The area of this square is $16^2 = 256$. So, the area of the convex polygon is 256 square units.
The answer is: $256$

"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"

Approach:


The equation given is a product of two expressions equal to zero. This means that either the first expression is zero or the second expression is zero. We will consider each case separately.

1. $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0 \Rightarrow \vert x + y \vert = 10 \Rightarrow x + y = \pm 10$.
2. $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0 \Rightarrow \vert x - y \vert = 10 \Rightarrow x - y = \pm 10$.
3. $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0 \Rightarrow \vert x \vert = 8 \Rightarrow x = \pm 8$.
4. $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0 \Rightarrow \vert y \vert = 8 \Rightarrow y = \pm 8$.

From the above equations, we can see that the points satisfying the equation are those that satisfy either $x + y = \pm 10$ or $x = \pm 8$ and $y = \pm 8$.

Plotting these points on a graph, we find that they form a square with side length 10. The area of this square is side length squared, so the area is $10^2 = 100$.
The answer is: $100$

Solve the following problem with a Python Script (positive numerical answer):
"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"
Write comments to indicate the steps you take. Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Assistant:

Approach:


The equation given is a product of two terms equal to zero, which means either of the terms must be zero. This gives us two separate conditions that the points $(x, y)$ must satisfy:
1. $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$
2. $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$

For the first condition to be true, we must have $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. This means that the points $(x, y)$ must lie on the lines $x + y = 10$, $x + y = -10$, $x - y = 10$, and $x - y = -10$. These lines form a square with side length 10.

For the second condition to be true, we must have $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$. This means that the points $(x, y)$ must lie on the lines $x = 8$, $x = -8$, $y = 8$, and $y = -8$. These lines form a square with side length 16.

The intersection of the two sets of lines is the set of points that satisfy both conditions, which is the smaller square. The side length of this square is the minimum of the side lengths of the two squares, which is 10.

The area of a square is given by the square of its side length, so the area of the convex polygon is $10^2 = 100$.
The answer is: $100$
