First, let's consider the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$.

The number of distinct solutions of this equation depends on the value of $\frac{m}{100}$.

When $\frac{m}{100} < 2$, there are no solutions.

When $\frac{m}{100} = 2$, there is exactly one solution.

When $2 < \frac{m}{100} < 4$, there are exactly two solutions.

When $\frac{m}{100} = 4$, there are exactly three solutions.

When $\frac{m}{100} > 4$, there are exactly four solutions.

We are looking for the number of positive integers $m$ such that the equation has $4$ distinct solutions. This happens when $\frac{m}{100} > 4$.

The smallest integer $m$ that satisfies this condition is $400$. The largest integer $m$ that satisfies this condition is also $400$ because if $m > 400$, then $\frac{m}{100} > 4$ and the equation would have more than $4$ distinct solutions.

So the possible values of $m$ are the integers from $400$ to $400$, inclusive. The number of such integers is $1$.

Therefore, the number of positive integers $m$ for which the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has $4$ distinct solutions is $1$. The answer is: $1$

First, we need to understand the graph of $y = \vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert$. It is a piecewise function with four pieces. We can draw the graph by first considering the function $y = \vert x - 1 \vert - 2$. The graph of this function is a V-shape with the vertex at $(1, -2)$. Then, we take the absolute value of the function, which reflects the part of the graph that is below the x-axis.

The graph of $y = \vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert$ is a combination of three more V-shapes, one on each side of the vertex $(1, -2)$. The width of each V-shape is 1 unit.

Now, we consider the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$. The right side of the equation is a horizontal shift of the graph of $y = \vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert$ by $\frac{m}{100}$ units upwards.

For the equation to have 4 distinct solutions, the vertical shift must intersect the graph at exactly 4 points. This occurs when the shift is between 2 and 3 units. Therefore, $2 < \frac{m}{100} < 3$, which implies $200 < m < 300$.

The positive integers $m$ that satisfy this inequality are the integers from 201 to 299, inclusive. To find the number of such integers, we subtract the smallest integer from the largest integer and add 1. So the number of such integers is $299 - 201 + 1 = 99$.

Therefore, there are 99 positive integers $m$ for which the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has 4 distinct solutions. The answer is: $99$

The equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has $4$ distinct solutions, we need to find the number of positive integers $m$ for which this is true.

We can start by considering the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$.

This equation will have $4$ distinct solutions if and only if $\frac{m}{100} \in (0, 2)$.

So, we need to find the number of positive integers $m$ such that $0 < \frac{m}{100} < 2$.

Multiplying all sides of the inequality by $100$, we get $0 < m < 200$.

The positive integers $m$ that satisfy this inequality are $1, 2, 3, \ldots, 199$.

Counting the number of these integers, we find that there are $199$ such positive integers.
The answer is: $199$.

We first need to understand the structure of the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$. The equation will have 4 distinct solutions when $\frac{m}{100}$ is equal to the positive difference between the two absolute values of the piecewise function $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert$.

Let's denote the piecewise function as $f(x) = \vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert$. The function $f(x)$ has two "breakpoints" at $x=1$ and $x=3$, where the piecewise function changes its definition.

1. For $x<1$, $f(x) = \vert -x+1 -2 \vert = \vert -x-1 \vert = x+1$.
2. For $1 \leq x \leq 3$, $f(x) = \vert x-1 -2 \vert = \vert x-3 \vert = 3-x$.
3. For $x>3$, $f(x) = \vert x-1 -2 \vert = \vert x-3 \vert = x-3$.

The equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ will have 4 distinct solutions when $\frac{m}{100}$ is equal to the positive difference between the two breakpoints of the piecewise function, i.e., $\frac{m}{100} = 2 - 1 = 1$. Therefore, $m=100$.

So, there is only one positive integer $m$ for which the equation has 4 distinct solutions, and that is $m=100$. The answer is: $1$

Approach:


To find the number of positive integers $m$ for which the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has 4 distinct solutions, we need to understand the properties of the absolute value function and the number of solutions it can produce.

First, let's consider the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$. This equation is equivalent to two separate equations:

1. $\vert x-1 \vert -2 = \frac{m}{100}$
2. $\vert x-1 \vert -2 = -\frac{m}{100}$

Each of these equations has two sub-cases due to the absolute value:

For the first equation:
1.1. $x-1 -2 = \frac{m}{100}$, which simplifies to $x-3 = \frac{m}{100}$
1.2. $-(x-1) -2 = \frac{m}{100}$, which simplifies to $-x+1-2 = \frac{m}{100}$, or $-x-1 = \frac{m}{100}$.

For the second equation:
2.1. $x-1 -2 = -\frac{m}{100}$, which simplifies to $x-3 = -\frac{m}{100}$
2.2. $-(x-1) -2 = -\frac{m}{100}$, which simplifies to $-x+1-2 = -\frac{m}{100}$, or $-x-1 = -\frac{m}{100}$.

Now, we need to find the number of distinct solutions for each of these sub-cases. The number of solutions will depend on the value of $m$. If $m$ is such that $\frac{m}{100} > 2$, then there will be no solutions because the left side of the equation will always be less than or equal to 2. Similarly, if $\frac{m}{100} < 0$, there will also be no solutions because the left side of the equation will always be greater than or equal to 0.

For $0 \leq \frac{m}{100} \leq 2$, we have four distinct solutions: two from each of the equations 1.1 and 2.2, and two from each of the equations 1.2 and 2.1.

Therefore, the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has 4 distinct solutions when $0 \leq \frac{m}{100} \leq 2$, which implies $0 \leq m \leq 200$. The number of positive integers $m$ in this range is 200.

So, the number of positive integers $m$ for which the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has 4 distinct solutions is 200.
The answer is: $200$

To find the number of positive integers $m$ for which the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has 4 distinct solutions, we need to analyze the properties of the equation.

The equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ can be rewritten as $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=0.01m$.

The expression $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert$ is equal to 0 when $\vert x-1 \vert = 2$, which gives us two solutions $x=3$ and $x=-1$. So, the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=0$ has 2 distinct solutions.

For the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=0.01m$ to have 4 distinct solutions, the expression $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert$ must be equal to 0.01m in two different ways, such that each way results in two distinct solutions.

This occurs when $0.01m = 1$, which gives $m=100$. The equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=1$ has 4 distinct solutions.

Therefore, the only positive integer $m$ for which the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has 4 distinct solutions is $m=100$.
The answer is: 1

Approach:


The equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has 4 distinct solutions when $\frac{m}{100}$ is less than 2 but greater than 0. This is because the expression inside the absolute value, $\vert x-1 \vert -2$, will change its sign twice as $x$ varies. Each time it changes its sign, the equation will have one more solution. Therefore, if $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert$ is less than 2 but greater than 0, the equation will have exactly 4 distinct solutions.

Now we need to find the value of $m$ that makes $\frac{m}{100}$ fall into this range.

To find the value of $m$, we can multiply both sides of the inequality $0 < \frac{m}{100} < 2$ by 100, which gives $0 < m < 200$.

Therefore, the number of positive integers $m$ that satisfy this inequality is $200 - 1 = 199$. However, we need to subtract 1 because $m$ cannot be 0 (otherwise $\frac{m}{100}$ would not be greater than 0).

So, the number of positive integers $m$ for which the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has 4 distinct solutions is 198.
The answer is: $198$

The number of solutions of the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ depends on the value of $\frac{m}{100}$. Specifically, the equation has 4 distinct solutions when $\frac{m}{100}$ is equal to 2.

Therefore, we have $\frac{m}{100}=2$, which implies $m=200$.

Therefore, the value of $m$ that makes the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ have 4 distinct solutions is $m=200$.

Approach:


To find the number of positive integers $m$ for which the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has $4$ distinct solutions, we need to analyze the properties of the absolute value equation.

The equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has $4$ distinct solutions when the right-hand side is between $1$ and $2$, because the absolute value function "flattens" at integer values, causing the equation to have multiple solutions.

Therefore, we need to find the values of $m$ such that $1 \leq \frac{m}{100} < 2$.

Solving the inequalities:

For $1 \leq \frac{m}{100}$, we multiply both sides by $100$ to get $100 \leq m$.

For $\frac{m}{100} < 2$, we multiply both sides by $100$ to get $m < 200$.

So the values of $m$ that satisfy both inequalities are those in the range $100 \leq m < 200$.

The positive integers in this range are from $100$ to $199$, inclusive. To count the number of these integers, we subtract the smallest value from the largest value and add $1$. So the number of positive integers $m$ is $200 - 100 + 1 = 101$.

However, we need to check if $m = 200$ is a valid solution. If we plug $m = 200$ into the equation, we get $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{200}{100} = 2$, which has $8$ distinct solutions (corresponding to the intervals $x \leq -1$, $-1 < x \leq 3$, and $x > 3$). Therefore, $m = 200$ is not a valid solution.

So the number of positive integers $m$ for which the equation has $4$ distinct solutions is $100$. The answer is: $100$

Approach:


We want to find the number of positive integers $m$ for which the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has exactly 4 distinct solutions.

First, we need to understand the behavior of the function $f(x) = \vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert$.

The function $f(x)$ is a "V" shape with the vertex at $x=1$. The value of $f(x)$ is 2 when $x<1$, 1 when $1 \leq x \leq 3$, and 2 when $x>3$.

Now, we want to find the values of $m$ such that the equation $\frac{m}{100}$ has 4 distinct solutions. This means that the value of $\frac{m}{100}$ must be less than 1 and greater than 0. Therefore, we have $0 < \frac{m}{100} < 1$, which implies $0 < m < 100$.

So, we need to find the number of positive integers $m$ in the range $(0, 100)$. There are exactly 99 such integers.

To find the number of these integers that satisfy the equation, we need to count the number of times the value of $\frac{m}{100}$ is equal to the values of $f(x)$ at its transition points.

At $x=1$, $f(x)$ changes from 2 to 1, so we need to count the number of $m$ such that $\frac{m}{100} = 1$. This gives us $m=100$.

At $x=3$, $f(x)$ changes from 1 to 2, so we need to count the number of $m$ such that $\frac{m}{100} = 1$. This gives us $m=100$.

Therefore, there are exactly 2 values of $m$ in the range $(0, 100)$ that satisfy the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ having 4 distinct solutions.
The answer is: $2$

Approach:


To solve the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ with $4$ distinct solutions, we first need to understand the behavior of the absolute value function. The absolute value function $\vert x-1 \vert$ will be equal to $x-1$ when $x \geq 1$ and $1-x$ when $x < 1$. So we need to consider two cases: $x \geq 1$ and $x < 1$.

Case 1: $x \geq 1$. The equation becomes $\vert x-1 -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$, or $\vert x-3 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$. This gives us two equations: $x-3=\frac{m}{100}$ and $3-x=\frac{m}{100}$. Solving these equations gives $x=3+\frac{m}{100}$ and $x=3-\frac{m}{100}$. For these solutions to be distinct, we need $3+\frac{m}{100} \neq 3-\frac{m}{100}$, which implies $\frac{m}{100} \neq 0$, so $m \neq 0$.

Case 2: $x < 1$. The equation becomes $\vert 1-x -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$, or $\vert -x-1 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$, which simplifies to $\vert x+1 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$. This gives us two equations: $x+1=\frac{m}{100}$ and $-(x+1)=\frac{m}{100}$, or $x=-1+\frac{m}{100}$ and $x=-1-\frac{m}{100}$. For these solutions to be distinct, we need $-1+\frac{m}{100} \neq -1-\frac{m}{100}$, which implies $\frac{m}{100} \neq 0$, so $m \neq 0$.

So for both cases, we need $m \neq 0$. Now we need to find the values of $m$ such that the equation has exactly $4$ distinct solutions. The equation $\vert x-1 \vert -2=\pm\frac{m}{100}$ has $4$ distinct solutions when the distances between the two vertical lines on the left side of the equation are equal to $\frac{2m}{100}$. This gives us the equation $2\cdot\frac{m}{100}=2$, or $\frac{m}{100}=1$. Solving for $m$ gives $m=100$.

Therefore, there is only one value of $m$ that makes the equation have $4$ distinct solutions, and that is $m=100$.
The answer is: $1$
