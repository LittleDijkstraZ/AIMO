Question (hint: positive numerical answer):
"A function $f: \mathbb N \to \mathbb N$ satisfies the following two conditions for all positive integers $n$:$f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$ and $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$. Calculate $f(100)$."
Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:


We start by calculating $f(100)$ using the given conditions.

From the second condition, we have $f(2n) = 2f(n) + 1$.
Let's apply this to find $f(200)$:
$$f(200) = 2f(100) + 1.$$

From the first condition, we have $f(f(f(n))) = 8n - 7$.
Let's apply this to find $f(f(f(100)))$:
$$f(f(f(100))) = 8(100) - 7 = 793.$$

Now, from the second condition, we have $f(f(f(100))) = f(200)$:
$$f(200) = 793.$$

Substitute $f(200) = 2f(100) + 1$ with $f(200) = 793$, we get:
$$793 = 2f(100) + 1.$$

Solving for $f(100)$, we subtract 1 from both sides:
$$792 = 2f(100).$$

Then, divide both sides by 2:
$$f(100) = \frac{792}{2} = 396.$$
The answer is: 396

Question (hint: positive numerical answer):
"A function $f: \mathbb N \to \mathbb N$ satisfies the following two conditions for all positive integers $n$:$f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$ and $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$. Calculate $f(100)$."
Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:


We start by plugging $n=1$ into the equation $f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$ to get $f(f(f(1)))=8(1)-7=1$. Since $f(1)$ is a positive integer, it follows that $f(f(1))=1$. Then from the equation $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$, we can let $n=1$ to get $f(2)=2f(1)+1$. Substituting $f(1)=1$ gives $f(2)=2(1)+1=3$. Now, we have $f(f(1))=1$ and $f(2)=3$. 

Next, we consider the equation $f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$ again. If we plug in $n=2$, we get $f(f(f(2)))=8(2)-7=9$. We know that $f(f(2))=f(3)$, so we have $f(f(3))=9$.

We now know $f(1)=1$, $f(2)=3$, and $f(3)=f(f(2))=9$. We also know $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$, so if we let $n=3$, we get $f(6)=2f(3)+1=2(9)+1=19$. 

Finally, let's consider $f(f(f(100)))=8(100)-7=793$. We have that $f(f(100))=793$, and $f(100)=f(f(f(100))/8=793/8$. However, $793/8$ is not an integer, which contradicts our initial assumption that $f(100)$ is a positive integer. 

This means we have made an error in our calculations. We must have misunderstood the problem or made an error in our calculations. However, we can continue to try to find a pattern from the equations we have derived thus far.

From $f(f(1))=1$ and $f(2)=3$, we can see that $f(1)$ seems to be a constant value, and $f(2)$ is always equal to three times the value of $f(1)$ plus one. This is consistent with the equation $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$. 

Continuing with this pattern, if $f(1)=1$, then $f(2)=3$, $f(3)=9$, $f(6)=19$, $f(12)=39$, and so on. We can see a pattern here where $f(n)=2n-1$. Let's test this pattern with the first few values to confirm it:

- For $n=1$, $f(1)=2(1)-1=1$.
- For $n=2$, $f(2)=2(2)-1=3$.
- For $n=3$, $f(3)=2(3)-1=5$, but we know this should be $9$.
- For $n=6$, $f(6)=2(6)-1=11$, but we know this should be $19$.

Clearly, the pattern of $f(n)=2n-1$ does not hold for all $n$. However, we can modify the pattern slightly to get a consistent result for all $n$. If we let $f(n)=2n-1$ for $n$ odd and $f(n)=n$ for $n$ even, the pattern holds for all $n$. 

Let's check this modified pattern using the given equations:

- For odd $n$, $f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$ becomes $f(f(2n-1))=8n-7$. If we let $n=1$, then $f(f(1))=1$, which holds since $f(1)=1$. 
- For even $n$, $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$ becomes $f(2n)=2n$. If we let $n=2$, then $f(4)=4$, which holds since $f(4)=4$.

So the modified pattern $f(n)=2n-1$ for $n$ odd and $f(n)=n$ for $n$ even is consistent with the given equations. 

Therefore, $f(100)=100$ since $100$ is an even number.
The value of $f(100)$ is 100. The answer is: $\boxed{100}$

Question (hint: positive numerical answer):
"A function $f: \mathbb N \to \mathbb N$ satisfies the following two conditions for all positive integers $n$:$f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$ and $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$. Calculate $f(100)$."
Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:


First, let's plug $n=1$ into the second equation to find $f(1)$: $f(2)=2f(1)+1$.
Since $f(2)$ must be a positive integer, we can guess and check values for $f(1)$ to find that $f(1)=1$.
Then we can substitute $f(1)=1$ into the second equation to find $f(n)$ for other values of $n$:
$f(2)=2(1)+1=3$, $f(3)=2(3)+1=7$, $f(4)=2(7)+1=15$, and so on.
We can continue this process to find $f(5)=31$, $f(6)=63$, $f(7)=127$, and so on.
We notice that $f(n)=2^n-1$ for all positive integers $n$.
Now we can substitute $n=50$ into the first equation to find $f(f(f(50)))=8(50)-7=393$.
Since $f(f(f(50)))=f(f(2^50-1))$, we can substitute $n=2^50-1$ into the first equation to find
$f(f(2^50-1))=8(2^50-1)-7=393$.
Therefore, $f(f(2^50-1))=f(f(50))$.
And since we already found that $f(f(f(50)))=393$, we have $f(f(50))=393$.
Finally, we can substitute $n=50$ into the second equation to find $f(100)=2f(50)+1=2(393)+1=787$.
So, $f(100)=787$. The answer is: $787$

Question (hint: positive numerical answer):
"A function $f: \mathbb N \to \mathbb N$ satisfies the following two conditions for all positive integers $n$:$f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$ and $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$. Calculate $f(100)$."
Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:


To solve this problem, we need to find the value of $f(100)$ given the two conditions:
1. $f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$
2. $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$

Let's start with the second condition. If we set $n=50$, we get $f(100) = 2f(50) + 1$. We don't know $f(50)$ yet, but we can find it by applying the second condition again. Setting $n=25$, we get $f(50) = 2f(25) + 1$.

Continuing this pattern, if we set $n=12.5$, we get $f(25) = 2f(12.5) + 1$. But we know that $f(n)$ is only defined for positive integers, so this value doesn't help us directly. However, we can observe that this is very close to the first condition $f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$. If we set $n=1$ in the first condition, we get $f(f(f(1)))=8*1-7=1$, so $f(1)=1$. Now if we set $n=1$ in the second condition, we get $f(2) = 2f(1) + 1 = 2*1 + 1 = 3$. Continuing in this way, we can find $f(3)$, $f(4)$, and so on, until we reach $f(50)$, $f(25)$, and $f(12.5)$.

We find that $f(1) = 1$, $f(2) = 3$, $f(3) = 4$, $f(4) = 7$, $f(5) = 8$, $f(6) = 13$, and so on. By continuing this process, we can find that $f(12.5) = 1$. Then, we can use the second condition to find $f(25) = 2*1 + 1 = 3$, $f(50) = 2*3 + 1 = 7$, and finally $f(100) = 2*7 + 1 = 15$. So, $f(100) = 15$. The answer is: $\boxed{15}$

Question (hint: positive numerical answer):
"A function $f: \mathbb N \to \mathbb N$ satisfies the following two conditions for all positive integers $n$:$f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$ and $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$. Calculate $f(100)$."
Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:



Setting $n=1$ in the first equation, we get $f(f(f(1)))=8(1)-7=1$. Since $f$ maps from $\mathbb{N}$ to $\mathbb{N}$, it follows that $f(f(f(1)))=f(1)=1$. Thus, we have $f(1)=1$.

Then, applying the second equation with $n=1$, we get $f(2)=2f(1)+1=2(1)+1=3$.

Next, apply the second equation with $n=2$ to get $f(4)=2f(2)+1=2(3)+1=7$.

Then, applying the first equation with $n=4$, we get $f(f(f(4)))=8(4)-7=25$. But we know that $f(f(f(4)))=f(f(7))=f(25)$. So we have the equation $f(25)=25$.

Now, apply the second equation with $n=25$, we get $f(50)=2f(25)+1=2(25)+1=51$.

Finally, applying the first equation with $n=50$, we get $f(f(f(50)))=8(50)-7=393$. But we know that $f(f(f(50)))=f(f(51))=f(393)$. So we have the equation $f(393)=393$.

Now, since $f(100)$ is a part of the function $f$, let's substitute $n=50$ into the second equation to get $f(100)=2f(50)+1=2(51)+1=103$.

And we can verify this result by applying the first equation with $n=100$, we get $f(f(f(100)))=8(100)-7=793$. But we know that $f(f(f(100)))=f(f(103))=f(793)$. So we have the equation $f(793)=793$.

Therefore, the value of $f(100)$ is $103$. The answer is: $103$

Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:



First, let's try to find the value of $f(1)$. Using the second equation with $n=1$, we get $f(2)=2f(1)+1$. Now, using the first equation with $n=1$, we get $f(f(f(1)))=8*1-7=1$.

If $f(f(f(1)))=1$, and we know that $f(2)=2f(1)+1$, we can substitute $f(2)$ into the first equation to get $f(f(1))=2f(1)+1$.

Now, we substitute $f(f(1))=2f(1)+1$ into the first equation again to get $f(1)=2f(1)+1$. This implies that $f(1)=1$.

Now that we have found $f(1)=1$, we can substitute this into the equation $f(2)=2f(1)+1$ to get $f(2)=2*1+1=3$.

Using the second equation with $n=2$, we can find $f(4)=2f(2)+1=2*3+1=7$.

And, using the first equation with $n=2$, we get $f(f(f(2)))=8*2-7=9$.

Since we know that $f(f(f(1)))=1$, $f(f(f(2)))=9$, and $f(f(f(4)))=31$, we can infer that $f(n)=2n-1$ for all positive integers $n$.

Now, we can substitute $n=100$ into the equation $f(n)=2n-1$ to find $f(100)=2*100-1=199$.
The value of $f(100)$ is 199.
The answer is: 199.

Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:


First, we try to find the value of $f(1)$. By substituting $n = 1$ into the second equation, we have $f(2) = 2f(1) + 1$. Since $f(f(f(1))) = 8*1 - 7 = 1$, we have $f(f(1)) = 1$. By substituting $n = f(1)$ into the second equation, we have $f(2f(1)) = 2f(f(1)) + 1$, so $f(2) = 2*1 + 1 = 3$. Now we substitute $n = 2$ into the second equation, we have $f(4) = 2f(2) + 1 = 2*3 + 1 = 7$. By substituting $n = f(2)$ into the second equation, we have $f(2f(2)) = 2f(f(2)) + 1$, so $f(4) = 2*3 + 1 = 7$. Now we substitute $n = 4$ into the first equation, we have $f(f(f(4))) = 8*4 - 7 = 24 - 7 = 17$. But we know $f(f(f(4))) = f(17)$, and we also know that $f(f(1)) = 1$, so $f(17) = 1$. Therefore, we have $f(1) = 1$.
Now we know that $f(1) = 1$, we can substitute $n = 1$ into the second equation to find $f(2)$, and repeat the process until we find the value of $f(100)$. After several steps, we find that $f(100) = 199$. The answer is: $199$

Question (hint: positive numerical answer):
"A function $f: \mathbb N \to \mathbb N$ satisfies the following two conditions for all positive integers $n$:$f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$ and $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$. Calculate $f(100)$."
Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:



First, let's plug $n=1$ into the equation $f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$ to get $f(f(f(1)))=8*1-7=1$.
Since $f(f(f(1)))=1$, we can deduce that $f(1)$ must be a number such that $f(f(f(1)))=f(f(a))=1$ where $a=f(1)$.
Using the second condition $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$, we can find that $f(2)=2f(1)+1$. Since we know that $f(1)$ is a number such that $f(f(f(1)))=1$, we can deduce that $f(2)$ must be a number such that $f(f(f(2)))=8*2-7=9$.
Similarly, using the second condition we can find that $f(4)=2f(2)+1=2*(2f(1)+1)+1=4f(1)+3$.
Now, let's plug $n=2$ into the equation $f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$ to get $f(f(f(2)))=8*2-7=9$. Since $f(f(f(2)))=9$, we have $f(f(2))=a$ where $f(a)=9$. We know that $f(2)=2f(1)+1$, so $f(f(2))=f(2f(1)+1)=f(2f(1)+1)=2f(f(1))+1=2a+1$.
So we have $2a+1=9$, which gives $a=4$. So $f(f(2))=4$. Therefore, $f(2)=4f(1)+3$.
Since $f(f(2))=4$, we have $f(4f(1)+3)=4$. Plugging this into the second condition, we get $f(4)=2f(2)+1=2(4f(1)+3)+1=8f(1)+7$.
Now we know that $f(4)=f(4f(1)+3)=4$, so we have $8f(1)+7=4$, which gives $f(1)=-1/2$.
However, $f(1)$ must be a positive integer, so we must have made a mistake somewhere.
Let's go back and check our work.
We see that we made a mistake when we assumed that $f(1)$ is a number such that $f(f(f(1)))=1$. This assumption leads to a contradiction.
Let's try a different approach.
From the second condition $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$, we can find that $f(4)=2f(2)+1=2(2f(1)+1)+1=4f(1)+3$.
Now let's plug $n=4$ into the equation $f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$ to get $f(f(f(4)))=8*4-7=27$.
Since $f(f(f(4)))=27$, we have $f(f(4))=a$ where $f(a)=27$. We know that $f(4)=4f(1)+3$, so $f(f(4))=f(4f(1)+3)=2f(f(1))+1=2a+1$.
So we have $2a+1=27$, which gives $a=13$. So $f(f(4))=13$. Therefore, $f(4)=4f(1)+3$.
Since $f(f(4))=13$, we have $f(4f(1)+3)=13$. Plugging this into the second condition, we get $f(4)=2f(2)+1=2(2f(1)+1)+1=4f(1)+3$.
So we have $4f(1)+3=13$, which gives $f(1)=2$.
Now we can check if this solution works for the first equation.
We have $f(f(f(1)))=f(f(2))=f(4f(1)+3)=f(7)=f(7)=8*1-7=1$.
So this solution works for the first equation.
Now we can find $f(100)$ using the second condition repeatedly.
$f(200)=2f(100)+1$.
$f(400)=2f(200)+1=2(2f(100)+1)+1=4f(100)+3$.
$f(800)=2f(400)+1=2(4f(100)+3)+1=8f(100)+7$.
Since $f(800)=8f(100)+7$, and we know that $f(800)=27$, we can solve for $f(100)$.
$8f(100)+7=27$, which gives $f(100)=2$.
Therefore, $f(100)=2$. The value of $f(100)$ is 2.
The answer is: 2

## QUESTION 4 - 8 
- TIME_SPENT : 818 secs

Question (hint: positive numerical answer):
"A function $f: \mathbb N \to \mathbb N$ satisfies the following two conditions for all positive integers $n$:$f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$ and $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$. Calculate $f(100)$."
Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:


First, we know that $f(f(f(100)))=8\cdot100-7=793$.
By the given second condition, we know that $f(f(f(100)))=f(f(x))=793$, where $x=f(100)$.
So we have $f(x)=793$. Again using the second condition, we know that $f(2x)=2f(x)+1$. Let $x=100$, we have $f(200)=2f(100)+1$. Substituting $f(100)$ with $x$, we get $f(200)=2x+1$. But from the first condition, we know that $f(f(f(200)))=8\cdot200-7=1593$. Since $f(f(f(200)))=f(f(2x))=1593$, we know that $f(2x)=1593$. Equating $f(200)$ with $1593$, we have $2x+1=1593$, so $2x=1592$ and $x=796$. But this does not match with $f(x)=793$, which means we have made an error somewhere.

However, if we carefully re-examine the problem, we notice that we made a mistake in our logic when we equated $f(200)$ with $1593$. Actually, we should equate $f(f(200))$ with $1593$. So from the equation $f(2x)=1593$, we can solve for $x$:
$$x=\frac{1593-1}{2}=796.$$

But this $x$ is not the value we are looking for. Now, we need to find $f(100)$. We know that $f(f(f(100)))=793$, which means $f(f(x))=793$ where $x=f(100)$. So again using the second condition, we know that $f(2x)=2f(x)+1$. Let $x=f(100)$, we have $f(2f(100))=2f(f(100))+1=2\cdot793+1=1587$. Substituting $f(2f(100))$ with $1587$, we have $f(2x)=1587$, so $2x=1587$, and thus $x=\frac{1587}{2}=793.5$. This obviously does not make sense, as $f(100)$ must be a natural number. So we made another mistake.

The mistake in this case is that we wrongly substituted $x$ in the second condition. In fact, we should use the first condition directly to find the value of $f(100)$. From the equation $f(f(f(100)))=793$, we know that $f(x)=793$, where $x=f(100)$. Then we use the second condition $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$ to find the value of $f(100)$.

Substituting $x=f(100)$, we get $f(2f(100))=2f(f(100))+1=2\cdot793+1=1587$. Then, we substitute $f(2f(100))$ with $1587$ in the first condition $f(f(f(100)))=8\cdot100-7=793$, we get $f(1587)=793$. Since $f(f(f(100)))=793$, we have $f(1587)=793$. Solving this equation, we get $1587=f(793)$. But from the second condition $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$, we know that $f(794)=2f(397)+1$, and $f(398)=2f(199)+1$. If we continue this way, we will eventually find a value of $n$ such that $f(n)=793$. By trial and error, we find that $n=397$ satisfies this condition, because $f(397)=2f(198.5)+1$, and $198.5$ is not a natural number, which means $n=397$ is a possible solution.

Now we can substitute $n=397$ into the equation $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$ to find the value of $f(100)$. We get $f(794)=2f(397)+1=2\cdot793+1=1587$. But we know that $f(794)$ should equal to $1587$, and from the first condition $f(f(f(100)))=8\cdot100-7=793$, we know that $f(794)=793$. This is a contradiction, which means we made another mistake.

The mistake in this case is that we wrongly used the second condition to substitute $x$ in the first condition. Instead, we should substitute $x$ directly into the second condition to find the value of $f(100)$. From the equation $f(f(f(100)))=793$, we know that $f(x)=793$, where $x=f(100)$. Then we substitute $x=f(100)$ into the second condition $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$, we get $f(2f(100))=2f(f(100))+1=2\cdot793+1=1587$. Substituting $f(2f(100))$ with $1587$, we have $f(1587)=1587$. But from the first condition $f(f(f(100)))=8\cdot100-7=793$, we know that $f(1587)=793$. This is a contradiction, which means we made another mistake.

After reviewing the solution and finding the mistakes, we realize that we should not use the second condition to substitute $x$ in the first condition. Instead, we should substitute $x$ directly into the second condition to find the value of $f(100)$. From the equation $f(f(f(100)))=793$, we know that $f(x)=793$, where $x=f(100)$. Then we substitute $x=f(100)$ into the second condition $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$, we get $f(2f(100))=2

Question (hint: positive numerical answer):
"A function $f: \mathbb N \to \mathbb N$ satisfies the following two conditions for all positive integers $n$:$f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$ and $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$. Calculate $f(100)$."
Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:


First, we use the second condition $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$. Let's calculate $f(2)$:
\[f(2) = 2f(1) + 1.\]
We are looking for the value of $f(100)$, so we need to find the value of $f(1)$ first.
Next, we use the first condition $f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$. Let's plug in $n=1$:
\[f(f(f(1))) = 8(1) - 7 = 1.\]
So we have $f(f(f(1))) = 1$.
Using the second condition again, we can calculate $f(f(1))$:
\[f(f(1)) = 2f(1) + 1.\]
And again, we can calculate $f(1)$:
\[f(1) = 2f(1) + 1 - f(f(1)).\]
But we know $f(f(f(1))) = 1$, so $f(f(1)) = f(1)$. Substituting this into the equation for $f(1)$, we get:
\[f(1) = 2f(1) + 1 - f(1).\]
Simplifying this gives $f(1) = 1$.
Now we can use the second condition to find $f(2)$:
\[f(2) = 2f(1) + 1 = 2(1) + 1 = 3.\]
And we can use this value of $f(2)$ to find $f(100)$:
\[f(100) = 2f(50) + 1.\]
Then we use the second condition again to find $f(50)$:
\[f(50) = 2f(25) + 1.\]
Continuing in this way, we find:
\[f(25) = 2f(12.5) + 1,\]
\[f(12.5) = 2f(6.25) + 1,\]
\[f(6.25) = 2f(3.125) + 1,\]
\[f(3.125) = 2f(1.5625) + 1,\]
\[f(1.5625) = 2f(0.78125) + 1,\]
\[f(0.78125) = 2f(0.390625) + 1.\]
At this point, we notice that the argument of $f$ is getting smaller than $1$, so we stop here and start working backwards. We know that $f(1) = 1$, so:
\[f(0.390625) = 2(1) + 1 = 3.\]
Continuing, we find:
\[f(1.5625) = 2(3) + 1 = 7,\]
\[f(3.125) = 2(7) + 1 = 15,\]
\[f(6.25) = 2(15) + 1 = 31,\]
\[f(12.5) = 2(31) + 1 = 63,\]
\[f(25) = 2(63) + 1 = 127,\]
\[f(50) = 2(127) + 1 = 255,\]
\[f(100) = 2(255) + 1 = 511.\]
Therefore, $f(100) = 511$. The answer is: $511$

Question (hint: positive numerical answer):
"A function $f: \mathbb N \to \mathbb N$ satisfies the following two conditions for all positive integers $n$:$f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$ and $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$. Calculate $f(100)$."
Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:


To find $f(100)$, we need to use the given conditions. First, we can try to find a simple value of $f(n)$ to see if we can find a pattern.
From the second condition, we know that $f(2n) = 2f(n) + 1$.
Setting $n=1$, we get $f(2) = 2f(1) + 1$.
Since $f(f(f(1))) = 8*1 - 7 = 1$, we have $f(f(1)) = 1$.
Again using the second condition, $f(f(1)) = 2f(1) + 1$, so $2f(1) + 1 = 1$.
This implies $f(1) = 0$.

Substituting $f(1) = 0$ into the equation $f(2) = 2f(1) + 1$, we get $f(2) = 2*0 + 1 = 1$.
Now we can find $f(4)$ using the second condition: $f(4) = 2f(2) + 1 = 2*1 + 1 = 3$.
And then $f(8) = 2f(4) + 1 = 2*3 + 1 = 7$.

Now, we can find $f(16)$ using the second condition: $f(16) = 2f(8) + 1 = 2*7 + 1 = 15$.
Similarly, $f(32) = 2f(16) + 1 = 2*15 + 1 = 31$, $f(64) = 2f(32) + 1 = 2*31 + 1 = 63$, and so on.

We notice a pattern that $f(2^n) = 2^n - 1$ for all positive integers $n$.
Now, we can find $f(100) = f(2^6 + 2^2) = f(64 + 4) = f(68)$.
Using the second condition again, $f(68) = 2f(34) + 1$.
Similarly, $f(34) = 2f(17) + 1$, $f(17) = 2f(8.5) + 1$, but $8.5$ is not a positive integer, so we cannot use the second condition directly.

However, we can use the first condition to find $f(17)$. Since $f(f(f(17))) = 8*17 - 7 = 121$, and $f(f(17)) = 2f(17) + 1$, so $2f(17) + 1 = 121$, which implies $f(17) = 60$.
Then $f(34) = 2f(17) + 1 = 2*60 + 1 = 121$, and $f(68) = 2f(34) + 1 = 2*121 + 1 = 243$.
So, $f(100) = f(68) = 243$.

Therefore, the value of $f(100)$ is $243$.
The answer is: $243$

Question (hint: positive numerical answer):
"A function $f: \mathbb N \to \mathbb N$ satisfies the following two conditions for all positive integers $n$:$f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$ and $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$. Calculate $f(100)$."
Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:



We start by applying the second equation of the function $f$ to $n = 100$. We have $f(2 \cdot 100) = 2f(100) + 1$. That is, $f(200) = 2f(100) + 1$.

Next, we apply the first equation of the function $f$ to $f(100)$, which is $f(f(f(100))) = 8 \cdot 100 - 7 = 793$. Since $f(f(f(100))) = f(f(f(100))) = 793$, we have $f(f(f(100))) = 8 \cdot 100 - 7 = 793$.

Now, we substitute $f(100)$ with $x$ in the equation $f(f(f(100))) = 793$, we have $f(f(f(100))) = f(f(x)) = 793$.

Next, we substitute $f(x)$ with $y$ in the equation $f(f(x)) = 793$, we have $f(y) = 793$.

From the second equation of the function $f$, we know that $f(2n) = 2f(n) + 1$. Let's set $n = y/2$, we have $f(y) = 2f(y/2) + 1$.

Since $f(y) = 793$, we can substitute $f(y)$ with $793$ in the equation $f(y) = 2f(y/2) + 1$, we have $793 = 2f(y/2) + 1$.

Solving this equation for $f(y/2)$, we get $f(y/2) = (793 - 1)/2 = 396$.

Now, let's substitute $y/2$ with $100$ in the equation $f(y/2) = 396$, we have $f(100) = 396$.

So, the value of $f(100)$ is $396$. The answer is: $396$

Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:


We are given two conditions:
(1) $f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$
(2) $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$
To find $f(100)$, we need to find a pattern or a relation between $f(n)$ and $n$. Let's try to find a relationship by substituting $n=2$ into the second condition:
$f(2 \cdot 2) = 2f(2) + 1 \implies f(4) = 2f(2) + 1$
Now, let's try to find $f(2)$ by setting $n=1$ in the second condition:
$f(2 \cdot 1) = 2f(1) + 1 \implies f(2) = 2f(1) + 1$
From this equation, we can express $f(2)$ in terms of $f(1)$:
$f(2) = 2f(1) + 1$.
Now we can substitute this expression for $f(2)$ into the equation we found for $f(4)$:
$f(4) = 2(2f(1) + 1) + 1 = 4f(1) + 3$.
Now, let's find $f(8)$ using the second condition:
$f(2 \cdot 4) = 2f(4) + 1 \implies f(8) = 2(4f(1) + 3) + 1 = 8f(1) + 7$.
Finally, let's use the first condition to find $f(1)$:
$f(f(f(1))) = 8 \cdot 1 - 7 \implies f(f(1)) = 1$.
Since $f(2) = 2f(1) + 1$, we have $f(1) = 1$.
Then, $f(2) = 2 \cdot 1 + 1 = 3$.
And $f(4) = 4 \cdot 1 + 3 = 7$.
And $f(8) = 8 \cdot 1 + 7 = 15$.
We can see a pattern here: $f(2^k) = 2^k + 2^{k-1} - 1$.
Now we can find $f(100) = f(2^6 \cdot 5^2) = f(2^6 \cdot 5^2) = f(64 \cdot 25) = f(64 \cdot 5^2)$.
Using the pattern, we have $f(64 \cdot 5^2) = f(2^6 \cdot 5^2) = 2^6 + 2^5 - 1 = 64 + 32 - 1 = 95$.
Therefore, $f(100) = 95$. The answer is: $95$

Question (hint: positive numerical answer):
"A function $f: \mathbb N \to \mathbb N$ satisfies the following two conditions for all positive integers $n$:$f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$ and $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$. Calculate $f(100)$."
Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:


To find $f(100)$, we first need to understand the properties of the function $f$ given in the problem.

We know that $f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$. Let's set $n=1$, we get $f(f(f(1)))=8*1-7=1$. Since $f(1)$ is a natural number, the only possibility is that $f(1)=1$.

Then we have $f(f(f(2)))=8*2-7=9$. Again, since $f(2)$ is a natural number, we know that $f(2)=3$.

Now let's substitute $n=2$ into the equation $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$, we get $f(4)=2f(2)+1=2*3+1=7$.

If we substitute $n=4$ into the equation $f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$, we get $f(f(f(4)))=8*4-7=27$. We already know that $f(4)=7$, so we can substitute this into the equation to get $f(7)=27$.

Finally, let's substitute $n=100$ into the equation $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$, we get $f(200)=2f(100)+1$. 

Now we know that $f(200)=f(f(f(100)))$ according to the first equation. We already know that $f(100)$ is an unknown value that we are trying to find.

Now we can substitute $f(200)$ into the equation $f(200)=2f(100)+1$ with $f(200)=f(f(f(100)))$:
$$f(f(f(100)))=2f(100)+1.$$

But we also know that $f(f(f(100)))=8*100-7=793$.

So we have the equation: $$793=2f(100)+1.$$
Solving this equation for $f(100)$ gives: $$f(100)=\frac{793-1}{2}=396.$$
So the value of $f(100)$ is 396.
The answer is: $396$

Question (hint: positive numerical answer):
"A function $f: \mathbb N \to \mathbb N$ satisfies the following two conditions for all positive integers $n$:$f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$ and $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$. Calculate $f(100)$."
Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:


To find $f(100)$, we need to first understand the function $f$. Given the two conditions, we can start by calculating the first few values of $f(n)$.

From the second condition, we have $f(2) = 2f(1) + 1$. But we don't know the value of $f(1)$, so we cannot directly calculate $f(2)$. However, we can substitute $f(2)$ into the first condition to get $f(f(f(2))) = 8 \cdot 2 - 7 = 9$. Using the second condition again, we get $f(f(f(2))) = f(f(2)) = 9$.

Now we substitute $f(2) = 2f(1) + 1$ into the equation $f(f(2)) = 9$, we get $f(2f(1) + 1) = 9$. Since we know that $f(2) = 2f(1) + 1$, we can replace $2f(1) + 1$ with $f(2)$ in the equation to get $f(f(2)) = 9$. Substituting $f(2)$ with its value gives $f(2f(1) + 1) = 9$, or $f(f(2)) = 9$.

This tells us that the function $f$ maps any number $n$ such that $n = 2f(1) + 1$ to 9. Since we are looking for $f(100)$, we need to find a value of $n$ such that $n = 2f(1) + 1 = 100$. Solving this equation, we get $n = 100 = 2f(1) + 1$, so $2f(1) = 99$, and $f(1) = 49.5$. But this doesn't make sense because $f(1)$ must be an integer.

However, we made a mistake in our previous step. The equation $f(f(2)) = 9$ should actually be $f(2f(1)) = 9$. So the correct equation to solve is $f(2f(1)) = 9$. Substituting $f(2)$ with its value gives $f(2f(1)) = 9$. This tells us that the function $f$ maps any number $n$ such that $n = 2f(1)$ to 9. So we need to find a value of $n$ such that $n = 2f(1) = 100$. Solving this equation, we get $n = 100 = 2f(1)$, so $f(1) = 50$.

Now we can use the second condition $f(2n) = 2f(n) + 1$ to find $f(100)$. We have $f(100) = 2f(50) + 1$. We know $f(1) = 50$, so we can substitute $f(50)$ with its value: $f(50) = 2f(25) + 1$. Similarly, $f(25) = 2f(12.5) + 1$. But $f(12.5)$ is not an integer, which doesn't make sense because $f(n)$ must be an integer for all positive integers $n$. So we must have made a mistake in our calculations.

Let's go back and check our work. We made a mistake when we applied the first condition $f(f(f(n))) = 8n - 7$. We should have applied it to $f(2)$ instead of $f(2f(1))$. Let's try that.

From the second condition, we have $f(2) = 2f(1) + 1 = 2 \cdot 50 + 1 = 101$. Now we substitute this into the first condition to get $f(f(f(2))) = 8 \cdot 2 - 7 = 9$. Using the second condition again, we get $f(f(f(2))) = f(f(101)) = 9$. Now we substitute $f(101)$ into the first condition to get $f(f(f(101))) = 8 \cdot 101 - 7 = 808 - 7 = 801$. So we have $f(f(101)) = 9$, and $f(101) = 801$.

Now we can use the second condition $f(2n) = 2f(n) + 1$ to find $f(100)$. We have $f(100) = 2f(50) + 1$. We know $f(50) = f(101)/2 = 801/2 = 400.5$. But this doesn't make sense because $f(n)$ must be an integer for all positive integers $n$. So we must have made a mistake in our calculations.

Let's go back and check our work again. We made a mistake when we applied the first condition $f(f(f(n))) = 8n - 7$. We should have applied it to $f(2)$ instead of $f(2f(1))$. Let's try that again.

From the second condition, we have $f(2) = 2f(1) + 1 = 2 \cdot 50 + 1 = 101$. Now we substitute this into the first condition to get $f(f(f(2))) = 8 \cdot 2 - 7 = 9$. Using the second condition again, we get $f(f(f(2))) = f(f(101)) = 9$. Now we substitute $f(101)$ into the first condition to get $f(f(f(101))) = 8 \cdot 101 - 7 = 808 - 7 = 801$. So we have $f(f(101)) = 9$, and $f(101) = 801$. But this doesn't make sense because $f(101)$ should be 9 according to the given conditions.

The mistake in our previous step was in the application of the second condition. The correct equation should be $f(2n) = 2f(n) + 1$, not $f(n) = 2f(n/2) + 1$. So let's correct that.

From the second correct condition, we have $f(2) = 2f(1) + 1 = 2 \cdot 50 + 1 = 101$. Now we substitute this into the first condition to get $f(f(f(2))) = 8 \cdot 2 - 7 = 9$. Using the correct second condition again, we get $f(f

Question (hint: positive numerical answer):
"A function $f: \mathbb N \to \mathbb N$ satisfies the following two conditions for all positive integers $n$:$f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$ and $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$. Calculate $f(100)$."
Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:


To solve this problem, we need to find $f(100)$ given the two conditions: $f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$ and $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$.

Let's first try to find $f(1)$ using the second condition with $n=1$:
$$f(2) = 2f(1) + 1.$$

Then, using the second condition again with $n=2$:
$$f(4) = 2f(2) + 1 = 2(2f(1) + 1) + 1 = 4f(1) + 3.$$

And finally, using the first condition with $n=1$:
$$f(f(f(1))) = 8(1) - 7 = -1.$$
But we know that $f$ maps natural numbers to natural numbers, so $f(f(f(1))) = f(f(2))$ which should be a natural number. The only way this equation can be true is if $f(1) = 1$.

Now, let's use the value of $f(1)$ to find $f(2)$:
$$f(2) = 2f(1) + 1 = 2(1) + 1 = 3.$$

And then use the value of $f(2)$ to find $f(4)$:
$$f(4) = 2f(2) + 1 = 2(3) + 1 = 7.$$

And finally, using the first condition with $n=4$:
$$f(f(f(4))) = 8(4) - 7 = 29.$$
But we know that $f(f(f(4))) = f(f(7))$ which should be a natural number. The only way this equation can be true is if $f(7) = 7$.

Now, let's use the value of $f(7)$ to find $f(14)$:
$$f(14) = 2f(7) + 1 = 2(7) + 1 = 15.$$

And then use the value of $f(14)$ to find $f(30)$:
$$f(30) = 2f(14) + 1 = 2(15) + 1 = 31.$$

And finally, using the first condition with $n=100$:
$$f(f(f(100))) = 8(100) - 7 = 793.$$
But we know that $f(f(f(100))) = f(f(31))$ which should be a natural number. The only way this equation can be true is if $f(31) = 31$.

Now, let's use the value of $f(31)$ to find $f(62)$:
$$f(62) = 2f(31) + 1 = 2(31) + 1 = 63.$$

And then use the value of $f(62)$ to find $f(126)$:
$$f(126) = 2f(62) + 1 = 2(63) + 1 = 127.$$

And finally, using the first condition with $n=127$:
$$f(f(f(127))) = 8(127) - 7 = 1011.$$
But we know that $f(f(f(127))) = f(f(127))$ which should be a natural number. The only way this equation can be true is if $f(127) = 127$.

Since we've found that $f(100) = 127$, the answer is $127$. The answer is: $127$.
