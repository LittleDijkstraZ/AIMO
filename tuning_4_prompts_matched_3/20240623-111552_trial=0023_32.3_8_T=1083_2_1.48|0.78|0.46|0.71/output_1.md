Question (hint: positive numerical answer):
"What is the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ when $x$ and $y$ range over all real numbers such that $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$?"
Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:



To find the minimum value of the function $f(x, y) = 5x^2 + 5y^2 - 8xy$ subject to the constraint $|x - 2y| + |y - 2x| = 40$, we first need to find a relation between $x$ and $y$ from the constraint.

The constraint equation $|x - 2y| + |y - 2x| = 40$ can be simplified as follows:
\[|(2 - 1)x - 2y| + |(2 - 1)y - 2x| = 40,\]
which simplifies to
\[|x - 2y| + |y - 2x| = 40.\]
By the triangle inequality, we know that
\[|x - 2y| + |y - 2x| \ge |(x - 2y) - (y - 2x)| = |x - 2y - y + 2x| = |x - 3x + 2y - y| = |-2x + y| = 2|x - 0.5y| \ge 0,\]
so the equality must occur when $x = 2y$ or $y = 2x$. We can substitute these conditions into the constraint equation and find that both give the solution $x = 10$ and $y = 5$.

Now we can substitute $x = 2y$ or $y = 2x$ into the function $f(x, y) = 5x^2 + 5y^2 - 8xy$:
If $x = 2y$, then
\[f(x, y) = 5(2y)^2 + 5y^2 - 8(2y)y = 20y^2 + 5y^2 - 16y^2 = 9y^2.\]
If $y = 2x$, then
\[f(x, y) = 5x^2 + 5(2x)^2 - 8x(2x) = 5x^2 + 20x^2 - 16x^2 = 9x^2.\]
So both cases give the same expression $f(x, y) = 9x^2$ or $f(x, y) = 9y^2$.

Now we substitute $x = 10$ and $y = 5$ into the function $f(x, y)$:
\[f(10, 5) = 5(10)^2 + 5(5)^2 - 8(10)(5) = 500 + 125 - 400 = 225.\]
Therefore, the minimum value of $5x^2 + 5y^2 - 8xy$ when $x$ and $y$ range over all real numbers such that $|x - 2y| + |y - 2x| = 40$ is $225$. The answer is: $225$

Question (hint: positive numerical answer):
"What is the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ when $x$ and $y$ range over all real numbers such that $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$?"
Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:



First, we can simplify the equation $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$.

Since $|a-b| = |-(a-b)| = |b-a|$, we can rewrite the equation as $|x-2y| + |-y+2x| = 40$,
which simplifies to $|x-2y| + |2x-y| = 40$.

Now, let's use the property of absolute value that $|a| + |b| \ge |a+b|$.

Applying this property to our equation, we get
$|x-2y + 2x-y| \le |x-2y| + |2x-y|$,
which simplifies to $|3x-3y| \le 40$.

This implies that $-40 \le 3x-3y \le 40$, or $-40/3 \le x-y \le 40/3$.

Now, let's express the function $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ in terms of $u=x-y$.

We have $x = y + u$, so $5x^2+5y^2-8xy = 5(y+u)^2 + 5y^2 - 8y(y+u)$.

Expanding and simplifying, we get $5x^2+5y^2-8xy = 5u^2 + 2uy$.

Now, we substitute $y = \frac{x-u}{1}$, and get $5x^2+5y^2-8xy = 5u^2 + 2u(\frac{x-u}{1}) = 5u^2 + 2ux - 2u^2 = 3u^2 + 2ux$.

Since $-40/3 \le u \le 40/3$, the function $3u^2 + 2ux$ is minimized when $u$ is at its extreme values.

When $u = -40/3$, we get $3u^2 + 2ux = 3(-\frac{40}{3})^2 + 2(-\frac{40}{3})x = \frac{4800}{9} - \frac{80}{3}x$.

When $u = 40/3$, we get $3u^2 + 2ux = 3(\frac{40}{3})^2 + 2(\frac{40}{3})x = \frac{4800}{9} + \frac{80}{3}x$.

Both of these expressions are linear functions in $x$, and since they are both linear functions of $x$, they will have the same value when $x$ is at its extreme values as well.

Therefore, to minimize $3u^2 + 2ux$, we need to find the value of $x$ that minimizes the function when $u$ is at its extreme values.

When $u = -40/3$, we have $x = y + u = (\frac{x-u}{1}) - \frac{40}{3} \implies x = -\frac{80}{3}$.

When $u = 40/3$, we have $x = y + u = (\frac{x-u}{1}) + \frac{40}{3} \implies x = \frac{80}{3}$.

Substituting these values into $3u^2 + 2ux$, we get
When $u = -40/3$ and $x = -\frac{80}{3}$, we get $3(-\frac{40}{3})^2 + 2(-\frac{40}{3})(-\frac{80}{3}) = \frac{4800}{9} + \frac{6400}{9} = \frac{11200}{9}$.

When $u = 40/3$ and $x = \frac{80}{3}$, we get $3(\frac{40}{3})^2 + 2(\frac{40}{3})(\frac{80}{3}) = \frac{4800}{9} + \frac{6400}{9} = \frac{11200}{9}$.

Therefore, the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ is $\frac{11200}{9}$. The answer is: $\boxed{\frac{11200}{9}}$

Question (hint: positive numerical answer):
"What is the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ when $x$ and $y$ range over all real numbers such that $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$?"
Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:


First, we need to simplify the expression $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$.
We can rewrite it as $5(x^2+y^2) - 8xy$.
Now, we know that $(x^2+y^2) - 2xy = (x-y)^2$.
So, we can rewrite the expression as $5[(x-y)^2 + 2xy] - 8xy$.
Expanding, we get $5(x-y)^2 + 5(2xy) - 8xy$.
Simplifying further, we get $5(x-y)^2 + 10xy - 8xy$.
Combining like terms, we get $5(x-y)^2 + 2xy$.
Now, we want to find the minimum value of this expression given the constraint $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$.
Using the triangle inequality, we know that $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 2|x-2y| = 40$.
So, $|x-2y| = 20$.
Now, we can rewrite this as $(x-2y)^2 = 400$.
Expanding, we get $x^2 - 4xy + 4y^2 = 400$.
Now, we can substitute this into our original expression.
We have $5(x^2+y^2) - 8xy = 5(400 + 4xy) - 8xy$.
Simplifying, we get $2000 + 20xy - 8xy$.
Combining like terms, we get $2000 + 12xy$.
To find the minimum value of this expression, we need to minimize $12xy$ given the constraint $(x-2y)^2 = 400$.
By the Cauchy-Schwarz inequality, we know that $(1^2 + (-2)^2)(x^2 + y^2) \ge (x - 2y)^2$, which simplifies to $5(x^2 + y^2) \ge 400$, so $x^2 + y^2 \ge 80$.
Therefore, $20xy \ge -10(x^2 + y^2) \ge -10 \cdot 80 = -800$, so $12xy \ge -800$.
Therefore, the minimum value of $5x^2 + 5y^2 - 8xy$ is $2000 + 12xy \ge 2000 - 800 = 1200$.
The minimum value is 1200. The answer is: 1200

Question (hint: positive numerical answer):
"What is the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ when $x$ and $y$ range over all real numbers such that $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$?"
Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:


First, we can simplify the equation $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$.
Using the property $|a - b| = |b - a|$, we can rewrite this as $|x - 2y| + |2y - x| = 40$.
The absolute value function $|a|$ is equal to $a$ if $a \geq 0$ and $-a$ if $a < 0$. So we can break this down into two cases:
Case 1: $x - 2y \geq 0$ and $2y - x \geq 0$.
This simplifies to $x - 2y + 2y - x = 40$, which simplifies to $0 = 40$, a contradiction. So this case is not possible.
Case 2: $x - 2y < 0$ and $2y - x < 0$.
This simplifies to $-(x - 2y) - (2y - x) = 40$, which simplifies to $-2(x - 2y) = 40$. Dividing both sides by $-2$, we get $x - 2y = -20$. Rearranging, we have $x = 2y - 20$.
Now we substitute this into the expression $5x^2 + 5y^2 - 8xy$:
\[5(2y - 20)^2 + 5y^2 - 8(2y - 20)y = 5(4y^2 - 80y + 400) + 5y^2 - 16y^2 + 160y = 20y^2 - 400y + 2000 + 5y^2 - 16y^2 + 160y = -y^2 - 240y + 2000.\]
This is a quadratic function of $y$, and its minimum value can be found by completing the square:
\[-y^2 - 240y + 2000 = -(y^2 + 240y) + 2000 = -(y^2 + 240y + 14400) + 2000 + 14400 = -(y + 120)^2 + 16400.\]
The minimum value of this expression occurs when $y = -120$, and substituting this back into $x = 2y - 20$ gives $x = -120 \cdot 2 - 20 = -260$. Therefore, the minimum value of the expression $5x^2 + 5y^2 - 8xy$ is:
\[-(120 + 120)^2 + 16400 = -28800 + 16400 = -12400.\]
However, this is not possible because the value of a square cannot be negative, so there must be a mistake in our reasoning. Let's go back and check our steps:
In our first step, we assumed that $|x - 2y| = x - 2y$ and $|2y - x| = 2y - x$. This is not always true, and it led us to an impossible case. In fact, the correct way to solve this problem is by using the fact that $|a| = \sqrt{a^2}$ and then applying the AM-GM inequality (Arithmetic Mean-Geometric Mean inequality).
\[|x - 2y| + |2y - x| = 40 \Rightarrow \sqrt{(x - 2y)^2} + \sqrt{(2y - x)^2} = 40.\]
\[ \Rightarrow \sqrt{(x - 2y)^2 + (2y - x)^2} = 40 \Rightarrow \sqrt{2(x^2 + 4y^2 - 4xy)} = 40.\]
Squaring both sides gives:
\[2(x^2 + 4y^2 - 4xy) = 1600 \Rightarrow x^2 + 4y^2 - 4xy = 800.\]
Now we multiply this equation by 5:
\[5(x^2 + 4y^2 - 4xy) = 4000 \Rightarrow 5x^2 + 20y^2 - 20xy = 4000.\]
Next, we add this equation to the original expression:
\[5x^2 + 5y^2 - 8xy + 5x^2 + 20y^2 - 20xy = 4000 + 5y^2,\]
\[10x^2 + 25y^2 - 28xy = 4000 + 5y^2.\]
Finally, we use the AM-GM inequality: for any nonnegative real numbers $a$ and $b$, we have $\sqrt{ab} \leq \frac{a+b}{2}$, with equality if and only if $a = b$. Applying this to the expression $10x^2 + 25y^2 - 28xy$:
\[10x^2 + 25y^2 - 28xy \geq 2\sqrt{(10x^2)(25y^2)} - 28xy = 50xy - 28xy = 22xy.\]
Therefore,
\[10x^2 + 25y^2 - 28xy \geq 22xy,\]
\[4000 + 5y^2 \geq 22xy.\]
Dividing both sides by 2 gives:
\[2000 + \frac{5}{2}y^2 \geq 11xy.\]
Adding $11xy$ to both sides:
\[2000 + \frac{5}{2}y^2 + 11xy \geq 11xy + 11xy,\]
\[2000 + \frac{5}{2}y^2 + 11xy \geq 22xy.\]
Subtracting $22xy$ from both sides:
\[2000 + \frac{5}{2}y^2 + 11xy - 22xy \geq 0,\]
\[2000 + \frac{5}{2}y^2 - 11xy \geq 0.\]
This shows that the expression $5x^2 + 5y^2 - 8xy$ is always nonnegative, and its minimum value is 0. So the minimum value of $5x^2 + 5y^2 - 8xy$ under the condition $|x - 2y| + |2y - x| = 40$ is 0. The answer is: $\boxed{0}$

Question (hint: positive numerical answer):
"What is the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ when $x$ and $y$ range over all real numbers such that $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$?"
Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:


First, let's rewrite the given equation $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$ using the property $|a| = |-a|$ to get $|x-2y| + |2x-y| = 40$. Now, let's consider the expression $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$. We can rewrite this expression as $(5x^2-8xy+4y^2) + (y^2-8xy+4x^2) = (5x^2-8xy+4y^2) + (y-2x)^2$. Let's set $A = x-2y$ and $B = 2x-y$, then the given equation becomes $|A| + |B| = 40$ and the expression becomes $(5x^2-8xy+4y^2) + B^2$. Since $|A| + |B| = 40$ and $A + B = (x-2y) + (2x-y) = 3x-3y = x-y$, we have $|x-y| = 40$. Now, let's substitute $A = x-2y$ and $B = 2x-y$ into the expression $(5x^2-8xy+4y^2) + B^2$ to get $(5x^2-8xy+4y^2) + (2x-y)^2 = (5x^2-8xy+4y^2) + (4x^2-4xy+y^2) = 9x^2-12xy+5y^2$. We want to minimize this expression, subject to the constraint $|x-y| = 40$. By the Trivial Inequality, we know that $(a-b)^2 \ge 0$ for all real numbers $a$ and $b$. So, we have $(x-y)^2 \ge 0$, and since $|x-y| = 40$, we have $(x-y)^2 = 1600$. Now, let's substitute this into the expression $9x^2-12xy+5y^2$ to get $9x^2-12xy+5y^2 = 9(x^2-400) + 12xy + 5(y^2+400) = 9(x^2-400) + 12xy + 5(y^2+400)$. Taking the derivative with respect to $x$ and setting it to zero, we get $18x + 12y = 0$. Similarly, taking the derivative with respect to $y$ and setting it to zero, we get $12x + 10y = 0$. Solving this system of equations, we find that $x = -\frac{10}{3}y$. Substituting this into the equation $|x-y| = 40$, we get $\left|-\frac{10}{3}y-y\right| = 40$, or $\left|-\frac{13}{3}y\right| = 40$. Solving this, we get $y = -\frac{120}{13}$ and $x = \frac{400}{13}$. Substituting these values into the expression $9x^2-12xy+5y^2$, we get $9\left(\frac{400}{13}\right)^2 - 12\left(\frac{400}{13}\right)\left(-\frac{120}{13}\right) + 5\left(-\frac{120}{13}\right)^2 = -\frac{48000}{169}$. Therefore, the minimum value of the expression $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ is $-\frac{48000}{169}$. The answer is: $-\frac{48000}{169}$

Question (hint: positive numerical answer):
"What is the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ when $x$ and $y$ range over all real numbers such that $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$?"
Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:



First, we notice that $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$ is equivalent to $|2y-x| + |2x-y| = 40$. By the triangle inequality, we know that $|a| + |b| \ge |a+b|$ for all real numbers $a$ and $b$. Therefore, we have $|2y-x| + |2x-y| \ge |(2y-x) + (2x-y)| = |y| = 40$. 

From $|y| = 40$, we get $y = 40$ or $y = -40$. 

When $y = 40$, we substitute it into $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$ to get $|x-80| + |40-2x| = 40$. By the triangle inequality again, we have $|x-80| + |40-2x| \ge |(x-80) + (40-2x)| = |-40| = 40$. Therefore, this case is possible.

When $y = -40$, we substitute it into $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$ to get $|x+80| + |-40-2x| = 40$. By the triangle inequality, we have $|x+80| + |-40-2x| \ge |(x+80) + (-40-2x)| = |-40| = 40$. Therefore, this case is also possible.

Now, we substitute $y = 40$ into the expression $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ to get $5x^2+5(40)^2-8x(40) = 5x^2+8000-320x$.

This is a quadratic function of $x$, and its minimum value can be found by completing the square or by taking the derivative and setting it equal to zero. The derivative of $5x^2+8000-320x$ with respect to $x$ is $10x-320$, and setting it equal to zero gives $x = \frac{320}{10} = 32$.

Substituting $x = 32$ back into the expression $5x^2+8000-320x$, we get $5(32)^2+8000-320(32) = 53760$.

Therefore, the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ when $x$ and $y$ range over all real numbers such that $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$ is $53760$.
The answer is: $\boxed{53760}$.

Question (hint: positive numerical answer):
"What is the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ when $x$ and $y$ range over all real numbers such that $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$?"
Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:



We first note that the given condition $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$ can be rewritten as $|2y-x| + |2x-y| = 40$.
We recognize this as the condition for the absolute value of the sum of two numbers to be a fixed value.
This implies that the two numbers, $2y-x$ and $2x-y$, must be equal or opposite.
Case 1: If $2y-x = 2x-y$, then we have $3y = 3x$, or $y = x$.
Case 2: If $2y-x = -(2x-y)$, then we have $2y-x = y-2x$, or $y = 3x$.
Now, we substitute $y = x$ into the expression $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ to get $5x^2+5x^2-8x^2 = 2x^2$.
Similarly, substituting $y = 3x$ into the expression, we get $5x^2+5(3x)^2-8x(3x) = 5x^2+45x^2-24x^2 = 26x^2$.
To find the minimum value of $2x^2$ and $26x^2$, we need to find the minimum value of $x^2$.
We know that $x$ and $y$ must satisfy the condition $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$.
Substituting $y = x$, we have $|x-2x| + |x-2x| = 40$, which simplifies to $|x| + |-x| = 40$, or $2|x| = 40$.
Thus, $|x| = 20$, and since $x$ can be either positive or negative, we have $x^2 = 400$.
Similarly, substituting $y = 3x$, we have $|x-6x| + |3x-2x| = 40$, which simplifies to $5|x| = 40$.
Thus, $|x| = 8$, and $x^2 = 64$.
The minimum value of $x^2$ is $64$, so the minimum value of $26x^2$ is $26(64) = 1664$.
Since the minimum value of $2x^2$ is $2(400) = 800$, the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ is $\boxed{800}$. The answer is: 800.

Question (hint: positive numerical answer):
"What is the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ when $x$ and $y$ range over all real numbers such that $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$?"
Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:


The expression $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ can be rewritten as $(x-2y)^2 + (y-2x)^2$. Let's denote $a = x - 2y$ and $b = y - 2x$. Then, we have $|a| + |b| = 40$. 
By the Triangle Inequality, $|a| + |b| \geq |a + b|$. So, $|a + b| \leq 40$.
On the other hand, $a + b = (x - 2y) + (y - 2x) = -x - y$, so $|a + b| = |-x - y| = |-(x + y)| = |x + y|$.
Therefore, we have $|x + y| \leq 40$.
Now, let's find the minimum value of $5x^2 + 5y^2 - 8xy$. 
Using the identity $(x-2y)^2 + (y-2x)^2 = (x^2 - 4xy + 4y^2) + (y^2 - 4yx + 4x^2) = 5x^2 + 5y^2 - 8xy$, we have $5x^2 + 5y^2 - 8xy = (x-2y)^2 + (y-2x)^2 \geq 0$.
Equality occurs when $x = 2y$ and $y = 2x$, or equivalently, $x = y = 0$.
Therefore, the minimum value of $5x^2 + 5y^2 - 8xy$ is 0 when $x = y = 0$.
But we also have $|x + y| \leq 40$, and this is satisfied when $x = y = 0$.
Thus, the minimum value of $5x^2 + 5y^2 - 8xy$ is 0. The answer is: $0$

Question (hint: positive numerical answer):
"What is the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ when $x$ and $y$ range over all real numbers such that $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$?"
Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:


We have the equation $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$.
By the triangle inequality, $|x-2y| + |y-2x| \geq |x-2y+y-2x| = |-(x-y)| = |y-x| = |x-y|$, so we must have $|x-y| = 40$.
Now, let $z = x-y$. Then $x = y + z$ and we can substitute into the expression $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$:
\begin{align*}
5(y+z)^2 + 5y^2 - 8y(y+z) &= 5(y^2 + 2yz + z^2) + 5y^2 - 8y^2 - 8yz \\
&= 5y^2 + 10yz + 5z^2 + 5y^2 - 8y^2 - 8yz \\
&= 2y^2 + 2yz + 5z^2 \\
&= 2(y^2 + yz + \frac{5}{2}z^2).
\end{align*}
Now, let $u = y$ and $v = z$. Then the expression becomes $2(u^2 + uv + \frac{5}{2}v^2)$.
To minimize this expression, we want to minimize the quadratic $u^2 + uv + \frac{5}{2}v^2$.
By completing the square, we get:
\[u^2 + uv + \frac{5}{2}v^2 = \left(u + \frac{1}{2}v\right)^2 + \frac{3}{2}v^2.\]
The minimum value of this expression occurs when $u = -\frac{1}{2}v$.
Substituting this back into $|x-y| = 40$, we get $|(y + z) - y| = 40$, which simplifies to $|z| = 40$.
Thus, the minimum value of $2(u^2 + uv + \frac{5}{2}v^2)$ is achieved when $u = -\frac{1}{2}v$ and $|v| = 40$.
Substituting these values, we get:
\[2\left((-\frac{1}{2}v)^2 + (-\frac{1}{2}v)(v) + \frac{5}{2}v^2\right) = 2\left(\frac{1}{4}v^2 - \frac{1}{2}v^2 + \frac{5}{2}v^2\right) = 2\cdot \frac{9}{4}v^2 = \frac{9}{2}v^2.\]
Since $|v| = 40$, we have $v^2 = 1600$, so $\frac{9}{2}v^2 = \frac{9}{2} \cdot 1600 = 7200$.
Therefore, the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ is 7200. The answer is: $7200$

Question (hint: positive numerical answer):
"What is the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ when $x$ and $y$ range over all real numbers such that $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$?"
Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:


We start by noting that $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$ can be rewritten as $|2y-x| + |2x-y| = 40$.
Using the triangle inequality, we know that $|a| + |b| \geq |a+b|$, so we have $|2y-x| + |2x-y| \geq |(2y-x) + (2x-y)| = |y| = |2y/2| = |2y-0| = |2y-x+x-0| = |2y-x| + |x-0|$.
This means that $|2y-x| + |2x-y| \geq |2y-x| + |x|$.
So we have $|2y-x| + |2x-y| = 40 \geq |2y-x| + |x|$, which simplifies to $|y| = |2y/2| = |2y-0| = |2y-x+x-0| = |2y-x| + |x-0| \geq |2y-x| + |x| \geq |(2y-x) + x| = |2y| = 2|y|$.
This implies that $2|y| \leq 40$, so $|y| \leq 20$.
Similarly, we can show that $|x| \leq 20$.
Now we can consider the expression $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$.
We can rewrite it as $5(x^2-8/5xy+y^2) = 5((x-4y/5)^2 + 9y^2/5)$.
Since $|x| \leq 20$ and $|y| \leq 20$, we know that $|x-4y/5| \leq |x| + |4y/5| \leq 20 + 4*20/5 = 20 + 16 = 36$.
And $9y^2/5 \geq 0$.
So $5((x-4y/5)^2 + 9y^2/5) \geq 5*0 = 0$.
Therefore, the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ is 0. The answer is: $0$

Question (hint: positive numerical answer):
"What is the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ when $x$ and $y$ range over all real numbers such that $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$?"
Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:


First, we notice that the given equation $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$ is equivalent to $|x-2y| + |2y-x| = 40$, which simplifies to $|x-2y| - |x-2y| = 40$. This simplifies further to $0=40$, which is a contradiction. Therefore, there must be an error in our work.

Let's go back and look at the original equation $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$. We can rewrite this as $|x-2y| + |-1(x-2y)| = 40$, and since $|a|=|-a|$ for any real number $a$, we can further simplify this to $2|x-2y| = 40$. Dividing both sides by 2 gives us $|x-2y| = 20$.

Now, let's consider the expression $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$. We can rewrite this as $(5x^2-8xy+5y^2)$. Notice that $(a-b)^2=a^2-2ab+b^2$. We can use this identity to rewrite the expression as $[5(x^2-2xy+y^2)] = 5(x-y)^2$.

Now, we know that $|x-2y| = 20$, which is equivalent to $|x-y-y| = 20$. This simplifies to $|(x-y)-y| = 20$. Let $u = x-y$. Then, we have $|u-y| = 20$. We can square both sides to get $(u-y)^2 = 400$, which simplifies to $u^2 - 2uy + y^2 = 400$. Rearranging terms, we get $u^2 + y^2 - 2uy = 400$.

Comparing this with the expression $5(x-y)^2 = 5u^2$, we see that $5u^2 + 5y^2 - 8uy = 2000$. So, the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ is 2000.
The answer is: 2000
