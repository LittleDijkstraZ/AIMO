Question (hint: positive numerical answer):
"For how many positive integers $m$ does the equation \[\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}\] have $4$ distinct solutions?"
Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:


The number of solutions to the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ is equal to $4$ if and only if $\frac{m}{100} = 2$. This is because the function $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert$ oscillates between $0$ and $4$ and is equal to $2$ exactly twice.

So we solve the equation $\frac{m}{100} = 2$ for $m$:
\[m = 2 \cdot 100 = 200.\]

Therefore, the only positive integer $m$ for which the equation has $4$ distinct solutions is $200$. The answer is: $1$

Question (hint: positive numerical answer):
"For how many positive integers $m$ does the equation \[\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}\] have $4$ distinct solutions?"
Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:



The equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has 4 distinct solutions if and only if $\frac{m}{100}$ is in the interval $(0,2)$.
This is because $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert$ is a function that oscillates between 0 and 4.
If $\frac{m}{100}$ is less than 0, there are no solutions.
If $\frac{m}{100}$ is equal to 0, there is one solution.
If $\frac{m}{100}$ is between 0 and 2, there are four distinct solutions.
If $\frac{m}{100}$ is equal to 2, there are three solutions.
If $\frac{m}{100}$ is greater than 2, there are two solutions.
So we need to find how many positive integers $m$ are in the interval $(0,200)$.
The number of positive integers in the interval $(0,200)$ is 199.
However, we must exclude those values of $m$ that make the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ have only one solution.
When $\frac{m}{100}$ is equal to 0 or 2, there are only one or three solutions, respectively.
When $\frac{m}{100}$ is equal to 0, the equation is $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=0$. This has three solutions: $x=1,3,5$.
When $\frac{m}{100}$ is equal to 2, the equation is $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=2$. This has only one solution: $x=3$.
Therefore, we must exclude the value $m=200$ from our count of 199 positive integers in the interval $(0,200)$.
The number of positive integers $m$ for which the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has four distinct solutions is therefore $199-1=198$.
The answer is: $198$.

Question (hint: positive numerical answer):
"For how many positive integers $m$ does the equation \[\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}\] have $4$ distinct solutions?"
Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:


The equation $| |x-1| -2 | = \frac{m}{100}$ has 4 distinct solutions.
The expression $|x-1|$ is the distance from $x$ to 1 on the number line.
So the equation $| |x-1| -2 | = \frac{m}{100}$ is asking for the values of $x$ that are a distance of $\frac{m}{100}$ from the set $\{3, -1\}$.

The equation $| |x-1| -2 | = \frac{m}{100}$ is equivalent to the following two equations:
$|x-1| -2 = \frac{m}{100}$ or $|x-1| -2 = -\frac{m}{100}$.

Solving $|x-1| -2 = \frac{m}{100}$, we get $|x-1| = 2 + \frac{m}{100}$, so $x-1 = 2 + \frac{m}{100}$ or $x-1 = -(2 + \frac{m}{100})$.
Simplifying, we get $x = 3 + \frac{m}{100}$ or $x = -1 - \frac{m}{100}$.

Solving $|x-1| -2 = -\frac{m}{100}$, we get $|x-1| = 2 - \frac{m}{100}$, so $x-1 = 2 - \frac{m}{100}$ or $x-1 = -(2 - \frac{m}{100})$.
Simplifying, we get $x = 3 - \frac{m}{100}$ or $x = -1 + \frac{m}{100}$.

The four distinct solutions are $3 + \frac{m}{100}$, $-1 - \frac{m}{100}$, $3 - \frac{m}{100}$, and $-1 + \frac{m}{100}$.

For these four solutions to be distinct, we must have $3 + \frac{m}{100} \neq -1 - \frac{m}{100}$, $3 + \frac{m}{100} \neq 3 - \frac{m}{100}$, $-1 - \frac{m}{100} \neq -1 + \frac{m}{100}$, and $3 - \frac{m}{100} \neq -1 + \frac{m}{100}$.

Simplifying these inequalities, we get $2m \neq -100$, $m \neq 0$, $2m \neq 100$, and $4m \neq 100$.

These simplify to $m \neq -50$, $m \neq 0$, $m \neq 50$, and $m \neq 25$.

Therefore, the only possible positive values of $m$ are $1, 2, \dots, 24, 26, \dots, 49, 51, \dots, 74$.

So there are 24 possible positive integer values of $m$. The answer is: $24$

"For how many positive integers $m$ does the equation \[\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}\] have $4$ distinct solutions?"
Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:


To solve this problem, we need to understand the graph of $f(x) = ||x-1|-2$. The graph of $f(x)$ consists of a number of "pieces", each of which is a "V" shape, and the "width" of each "V" is determined by the value of $m$ in the equation $| |x-1| - 2 | = \frac{m}{100}$.
The equation $| |x-1| - 2 | = \frac{m}{100}$ has 4 distinct solutions if and only if the value of $\frac{m}{100}$ falls into the interval $(0, 2)$. This is because if $\frac{m}{100} \leq 0$, there are no solutions, if $\frac{m}{100} = 2$, there are only 3 solutions (the maximum number of solutions), and if $\frac{m}{100} > 2$, there are only 2 solutions.
So we need to find how many values of $m$ in the interval $(0, 200)$ are of the form $m = 100a$, where $0 < a < 2$.
Since $0 < a < 2$, $a$ is an integer from 1 to 199, but not including 0 and 200. Therefore, the number of positive integers $m$ that satisfy the conditions is 199.
The answer is: $199$

"For how many positive integers $m$ does the equation \[\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}\] have $4$ distinct solutions?"
Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:


The equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has 4 distinct solutions if and only if $\frac{m}{100} = 2$. This is because the expression on the left side of the equation, $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert$, can take on values from 0 to 2 only, and it equals 2 only once. 

If we set $\frac{m}{100} = 2$, we can solve for $m$:
$$m = 2 \times 100 = 200.$$
So, there is only one positive integer $m$ for which the equation has 4 distinct solutions, and that integer is 200.
The answer is: $1$.

Question (hint: positive numerical answer):
"For how many positive integers $m$ does the equation \[\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}\] have $4$ distinct solutions?"
Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:


The equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has 4 distinct solutions,
we want to find the number of positive integers $m$ that satisfy this condition.
First, let's consider the right side of the equation, $\frac{m}{100}$.
For the equation to have 4 distinct solutions, $\frac{m}{100}$ must be less than 2 but greater than or equal to 0.
This means $0 \leq \frac{m}{100} < 2$.
Multiplying all sides by 100, we get $0 \leq m < 200$.
Now, we need to find the number of positive integers $m$ in this range.
The positive integers from 1 to 199 are all the possible values of $m$.
Therefore, there are 199 positive integers $m$ that satisfy the condition.
The value of $m$ that makes $\frac{m}{100}$ exactly equal to 2 is $m=200$.
However, this value does not satisfy the condition of having 4 distinct solutions.
Therefore, we exclude this value from the count.
The number of positive integers $m$ that satisfy the condition is 199. The answer is: 199

Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:


The number of solutions of the equation $| |x-1|-2|=\frac{m}{100}$ is $4$ if and only if $\frac{m}{100}=2$. So we set up the equation $\frac{m}{100}=2$. Solving for $m$ gives $m = 200$. So, the only positive integer $m$ for which the equation $| |x-1|-2|=\frac{m}{100}$ has $4$ distinct solutions is $200$. So the answer is $\boxed{200}$.

"For how many positive integers $m$ does the equation \[\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}\] have $4$ distinct solutions?"
Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:


The equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has $4$ distinct solutions if and only if $\frac{m}{100}$ is strictly between $1$ and $2$. This is because the expression inside the absolute value on the left side of the equation, $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert$, oscillates between $1$ and $3$ (with a step of $1$) as $x$ varies over the real numbers.

Thus, we want to find how many positive values of $m$ exist such that $1<\frac{m}{100}<2$. This is equivalent to finding the number of positive integers $m$ such that $100<m<200$.

There are $100$ such positive integers.
The answer is: $100$

Question (hint: positive numerical answer):
"For how many positive integers $m$ does the equation \[\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}\] have $4$ distinct solutions?"
Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:


The equation $||x-1|-2|=\frac{m}{100}$ has 4 distinct solutions. 

The expression $|x-1|-2$ can take on values of $\frac{m}{100}$ and $-\frac{m}{100}$. 

This gives us two equations:
1. $|x-1|-2 = \frac{m}{100}$ and 
2. $|x-1|-2 = -\frac{m}{100}$.

Solving the first equation $|x-1|-2 = \frac{m}{100}$ gives us $|x-1| = \frac{m}{100} + 2$. This implies two more equations:
a. $x-1 = \frac{m}{100} + 2$ and 
b. $-(x-1) = \frac{m}{100} + 2$.

Solving equation a. $x-1 = \frac{m}{100} + 2$ gives $x = \frac{m}{100} + 3$.
Solving equation b. $-(x-1) = \frac{m}{100} + 2$ gives $x = - \frac{m}{100} + 1$.

Solving the second equation $|x-1|-2 = -\frac{m}{100}$ gives us $|x-1| = 2 - \frac{m}{100}$. This implies two more equations:
c. $x-1 = 2 - \frac{m}{100}$ and 
d. $-(x-1) = 2 - \frac{m}{100}$.

Solving equation c. $x-1 = 2 - \frac{m}{100}$ gives $x = 3 - \frac{m}{100}$.
Solving equation d. $-(x-1) = 2 - \frac{m}{100}$ gives $x = -1 + \frac{m}{100}$.

For these four equations to represent 4 distinct solutions, none of the "boundary" solutions (the ones with $-$ and $+$ mixed up) should coincide with the "inside" solutions (the ones with all $+$ or all $-$). This happens when:

$\frac{m}{100} + 3 = 3 - \frac{m}{100}$ or $\frac{m}{100} + 3 = -1 + \frac{m}{100}$ or $\frac{m}{100} + 3 = 1 + \frac{m}{100}$ or $- \frac{m}{100} + 1 = 1 + \frac{m}{100}$ or $- \frac{m}{100} + 1 = -1 + \frac{m}{100}$ or $- \frac{m}{100} + 1 = 3 - \frac{m}{100}$.

Solving each of these gives $m = 50$.

Therefore, there is only one value of $m$ that makes the equation have 4 distinct solutions. So, the answer is $1$. The value of $m$ is $50$.
The answer is: $1$

"For how many positive integers $m$ does the equation \[\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}\] have $4$ distinct solutions?"
Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:



The equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has four distinct solutions, which means that the right-hand side, $\frac{m}{100}$, must be equal to $2$. Therefore, we have $m = 200$.

This is the only value of $m$ for which the equation has four distinct solutions.

So, the answer is $1$. The value of $m$ is $200$. The answer is: $\boxed{1}$
