Question (hint: positive numerical answer):
"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"
Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:


The product of two numbers is zero if and only if at least one of the numbers is zero. Therefore, the equation $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ is satisfied if either of the following two conditions is satisfied:
1. $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$
2. $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$
For the first condition to be satisfied, we must have $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. These equations represent a square with side length 10, centered at the origin.
For the second condition to be satisfied, we must have $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$. This represents a square with side length 16, centered at the origin.
Therefore, the convex polygon enclosed by the points that satisfy the equation is the intersection of these two squares, which is a square with side length 10.
The area of this square is $10^2 = 100$. The answer is: $100$

Question (hint: positive numerical answer):
"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"
Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:


The expression $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ is true if and only if at least one of the factors is zero.
The first factor is zero if and only if $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ or $\vert x - y \vert = 10$.
The second factor is zero if and only if $\vert x \vert = 8$ or $\vert y \vert = 8$.
So the points that satisfy the equation are the points that satisfy at least one of these conditions.
The points that satisfy $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ are on a square with side length 10 and diagonals of length $10\sqrt{2}$.
The points that satisfy $\vert x - y \vert = 10$ are on a square with side length 10 and diagonals of length $10\sqrt{2}$.
The points that satisfy $\vert x \vert = 8$ are on a square with side length 8 and diagonals of length $8\sqrt{2}$.
The points that satisfy $\vert y \vert = 8$ are on a square with side length 8 and diagonals of length $8\sqrt{2}$.
The convex polygon that is enclosed by these points is the union of these four squares.
The area of the polygon is the sum of the areas of these four squares.
The area of a square with side length $a$ is $a^2$, so the area of the polygon is $10^2 + 10^2 + 8^2 + 8^2 = 100 + 100 + 64 + 64 = 332$. The answer is: $332$

Question (hint: positive numerical answer):
"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"
Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:



The expression $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ is true if and only if at least one of the two factors is zero.

For the first factor to be zero, we must have $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$. This implies $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ or $\vert x - y \vert = 10$.

For the second factor to be zero, we must have $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$, which implies $\vert x \vert = 8$ or $\vert y \vert = 8$.

Combining these results, we find that the points $(x, y)$ satisfying the equation must lie on the square with vertices at $(8, 8)$, $(-8, 8)$, $(-8, -8)$, and $(8, -8)$.

The side length of this square is $16$, so its area is $16^2 = 256$. Therefore, the area of the convex polygon is $256$. The answer is: $256$

Question (hint: positive numerical answer):
"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"
Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:


The equation $AB = 0$ is satisfied if and only if $A = 0$ or $B = 0$. Thus, the given equation is equivalent to the union of the following four equations:

\begin{align*}
|x+y| - 10 &= 0, \\
|x-y| - 10 &= 0, \\
|x| - 8 &= 0, \\
|y| - 8 &= 0.
\end{align*}

From $|x+y| - 10 = 0$ we have $|x+y| = 10$, which gives us two cases: $x+y = 10$ and $x+y = -10$.

From $|x-y| - 10 = 0$ we have $|x-y| = 10$, which gives us two more cases: $x-y = 10$ and $x-y = -10$.

From $|x| - 8 = 0$ we have $|x| = 8$, which gives us two cases: $x = 8$ and $x = -8$.

From $|y| - 8 = 0$ we have $|y| = 8$, which gives us two more cases: $y = 8$ and $y = -8$.

The intersection of these equations gives us the vertices of the polygon:
$(8,8), (8,-8), (-8,8), (-8,-8), (10,0), (-10,0), (0,10), (0,-10)$.

Plotting these points, we can see that the polygon is a square with side length $16$. The area of the square is $16^2 = 256$.
The answer is: $256$

Question (hint: positive numerical answer):
"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"
Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:


The expression $ab = 0$ if and only if $a = 0$ or $b = 0$. So, the given equation is satisfied if and only if either
$$((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2) = 0$$
or
$$((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0.$$
The first equation is satisfied if and only if $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. These two equations describe a square with side length 10. The vertices of the square are $(0,0)$, $(0,10)$, $(10,0)$, and $(10,10)$.
The second equation is satisfied if and only if $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$. These two equations describe a square with side length 8. The vertices of the square are $(8,8)$, $(8,-8)$, $(-8,8)$, and $(-8,-8)$.
Therefore, the points that satisfy the given equation are the vertices of the two squares. The convex polygon formed by these points is a rectangle with length 10 and width 8. The area of this rectangle is $10 \times 8 = 80$.
The answer is: $80$

Question (hint: positive numerical answer):
"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"
Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:


The expression $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ is equal to zero if and only if either $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$.
For the first case, $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$, we must have $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. This means that either $x + y = 10$ and $x - y = 10$ or $x + y = -10$ and $x - y = -10$.
Solving these systems of equations, we find that the solutions are $x = 10, y = 0$ and $x = 0, y = -10$.
For the second case, $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$, we must have $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$. This means that either $x = 8$ and $y = 8$ or $x = -8$ and $y = -8$.
Combining the solutions from both cases, we find that the polygon is a square with side length $10$ and vertices at $(10, 0)$, $(0, -10)$, $(-10, 0)$, and $(0, 10)$.
The area of this square is $10^2 = 100$.
Therefore, the area of the convex polygon is $100$. The answer is: $100$

Question (hint: positive numerical answer):
"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"
Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:


The product of two numbers is zero if and only if at least one of the numbers is zero. So, the equation $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ is true if and only if either
$$(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0 \quad \text{or} \quad (\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0.$$

If $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$, then $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. This means that $x + y = \pm 10$ and $x - y = \pm 10$. Adding these two equations gives $2x = \pm 20$, so $x = \pm 10$. Subtracting the second equation from the first gives $2y = \pm 20$, so $y = \pm 10$. So, the lines $x + y = \pm 10$ and $x - y = \pm 10$ intersect at the points $(10, 0)$, $(-10, 0)$, $(0, 10)$, and $(0, -10)$. These lines form a square with side length 20. The area of this square is $20^2 = 400$.

If $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$, then $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$. This means that $x = \pm 8$ and $y = \pm 8$. So, the lines $x = \pm 8$ and $y = \pm 8$ intersect at the points $(8, 8)$, $(8, -8)$, $(-8, 8)$, and $(-8, -8)$. These lines form a square with side length 16. The area of this square is $16^2 = 256$.

However, the first case describes a square that includes the square described by the second case. Therefore, the area of the convex polygon enclosed by the points $\left(x, y\right)$ is the area of the square described by the first case, which is 400.
The answer is: 400.

Question (hint: positive numerical answer):
"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"
Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:


The product of two numbers is zero if and only if at least one of the numbers is zero. So, for the equation to hold, either
\begin{align*}
((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2) &= 0, \text{ or} \\
((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) &= 0.
\end{align*}
The first equation implies that $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$, which means that $x$ and $y$ are both 5 units from -5 and 5. The second equation implies that $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$, which means that $x$ and $y$ are both 8 units from the origin. 
The points satisfying $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$ form a square with side length 10, centered at the origin, and the points satisfying $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$ form a square with side length 16, centered at the origin. The intersection of these two squares is the convex polygon we are looking for.

The side length of the smaller square is 10, so its area is $10^2 = 100$. The side length of the larger square is 16, so its area is $16^2 = 256$. The intersection of the two squares forms a square itself, centered at the origin, with side length equal to the difference of the side lengths of the two larger squares, which is $16 - 10 = 6$. Therefore, the area of the convex polygon is the area of this smaller square, which is $6^2 = 36$.
The answer is: $36$

Question (hint: positive numerical answer):
"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"
Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:


The expression $ab=0$ is equivalent to $a=0$ or $b=0$. Therefore, the given equation is equivalent to the two equations
$$((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2) = 0$$ or $$((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0.$$ For the first equation, we have $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. The only way this can happen is if $x+y = 10$ and $x-y = 10$ or $x+y = -10$ and $x-y = -10$. These are equivalent to $x=5$ and $y=5$ or $x=-5$ and $y=-5$. These two points are the vertices of a square with side length $10$ and area $100$.
For the second equation, we have $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$. This means $x=8$ or $x=-8$ and $y=8$ or $y=-8$. These four points are the vertices of a square with side length $16$ and area $256$.

However, the two squares share a vertex at $(0,0)$, and so their intersection is just a single point. The square with side length $10$ is completely contained within the square with side length $16$.
Therefore, the convex polygon formed by the points satisfying the equation is the square with side length $10$, and its area is $100$.
The answer is: 100

"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"
Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:



The expression equals zero if either of the factors equals zero. Thus we have two cases:

Case 1: $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2) = 0$. This is true only when $|x + y| = 10$ and $|x - y| = 10$. These are the equations of two pairs of parallel lines, $x + y = \pm 10$ and $x - y = \pm 10$. The intersections of these lines are at $(0, 10)$, $(0, -10)$, $(10, 0)$ and $(-10, 0)$.

Case 2: $((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$. This is true only when $|x| = 8$ and $|y| = 8$. These are the equations of two pairs of parallel lines, $x = \pm 8$ and $y = \pm 8$. The intersections of these lines are at $(8, 8)$, $(8, -8)$, $(-8, 8)$ and $(-8, -8)$.

The four points from case 1 and the four points from case 2 form a rectangle with side lengths $20$ and $16$. The area of this rectangle is $20 \times 16 = 320$. So, the area of the convex polygon is $320$.
The answer is: $\boxed{320}$

Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:


The given equation is $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$. For the product of two numbers to be zero, either one of the numbers must be zero. So, we have two cases:

Case 1: $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$. This is only possible when both $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ and $( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$, which means $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. This results in a square with side length 10 units.

Case 2: $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$. This is only possible when both $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ and $( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$, which means $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$. This results in a square with side length 16 units.

Now, we need to find the area of the convex polygon enclosed by the union of the two squares. The area of a square is given by side length squared. So, the area of the first square is $10^2 = 100$ square units, and the area of the second square is $16^2 = 256$ square units. 

The total area of the convex polygon is the sum of the areas of the two squares, which is $100 + 256 = 356$ square units.

So, the area of the convex polygon is $\boxed{356}$ square units. The answer is: $356$

"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"
Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:


The expression $AB = 0$ is equivalent to $A = 0$ or $B = 0$. Therefore, the given equation is equivalent to \[((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2) = 0\] or \[((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0.\] The first equation implies that $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. This means that the distance from $(x, y)$ to the line $x + y = 10$ is 10 and the distance from $(x, y)$ to the line $x - y = 10$ is also 10. These lines are perpendicular bisectors of the lines $x + y = 0$ and $x - y = 0$, respectively. Thus, the points that satisfy the first equation form a square with side length $20\sqrt{2}$.

The second equation implies that $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$, which means that $x = \pm 8$ and $y = \pm 8$. Thus, the points that satisfy the second equation form a square with side length 16.

The points that satisfy the given equation are the points that satisfy either the first equation or the second equation. Therefore, these points form the union of two squares: one with side length $20\sqrt{2}$ and the other with side length 16.

The area of a square with side length $s$ is $s^2$. Therefore, the area of the larger square is $(20\sqrt{2})^2 = 800$ and the area of the smaller square is $16^2 = 256$. Therefore, the area of the convex polygon is $800 + 256 = 1056$. The answer is: $\boxed{1056}$

For this equation to be true, either $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$.
If $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$, then $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$, which means that $x + y = \pm 10$ and $x - y = \pm 10$. Solving these equations gives us the vertices of a square with side length 10.
If $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$, then $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$, which means that $x = \pm 8$ and $y = \pm 8$. This gives us a square with side length 16.
The vertices of the first square are $(-10, 10)$, $(10, 10)$, $(10, -10)$, and $(-10, -10)$, and the vertices of the second square are $(8, 8)$, $(-8, 8)$, $(-8, -8)$, and $(8, -8)$. The intersection of these two squares is the convex polygon whose area we want to find.
The side length of the smaller square is 10, so its area is $10^2 = 100$. The side length of the larger square is 16, so its area is $16^2 = 256$. The intersection of the two squares forms a smaller square, which is also a square with side length 10.
Therefore, the area of the convex polygon is the area of the smaller square, which is 100 square units. The answer is: 100.
