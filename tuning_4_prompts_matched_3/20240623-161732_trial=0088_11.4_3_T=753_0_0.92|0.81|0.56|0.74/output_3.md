 The expression $AB = 0$ is true if and only if $A = 0$ or $B = 0$. Therefore, the given equation is satisfied if and only if at least one of the following two conditions is true:
1. $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$
2. $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$
From condition 1, we have $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. This implies that $x + y = \pm 10$ and $x - y = \pm 10$. Solving these equations gives us the vertices of the square: $(0, 10)$, $(0, -10)$, $(10, 0)$, and $(-10, 0)$.
From condition 2, we have $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$. This implies that $x = \pm 8$ and $y = \pm 8$. Solving these equations gives us the vertices of the square: $(8, 0)$, $(-8, 0)$, $(0, 8)$, and $(0, -8)$.
The intersection of these two squares is a square with side length 8. The area of this square is $8^2 = 64$. Therefore, the area of the convex polygon is 64 square units.

"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"

The given equation is a product of two terms equal to zero, so either term must be zero for the equation to hold.
The first term is $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)$, which is zero if and only if $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$.
The second term is $((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2)$, which is zero if and only if $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$.
The first set of equations, $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$, represents a square with side length 10.
The second set of equations, $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$, represents a square with side length 16.
The convex polygon enclosed by the points satisfying the given equation is the intersection of these two squares.
The intersection of the two squares is a smaller square with side length 8 (since the side length of the smaller square is the difference between the side lengths of the larger and smaller squares).
The area of a square is given by the square of its side length, so the area of the convex polygon is $8^2 = 64$. The answer is: 64

 The given equation is a product of two terms equal to zero. Therefore, either the first term is zero, or the second term is zero.

If $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$, then $\vert x + y \vert = 10$, which implies $x + y = \pm 10$.
If $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$, then $\vert x - y \vert = 10$, which implies $x - y = \pm 10$.
If $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$, then $\vert x \vert = 8$, which implies $x = \pm 8$.
If $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$, then $\vert y \vert = 8$, which implies $y = \pm 8$.

These conditions define a square with vertices at $(\pm 8, \pm 8)$. The side length of the square is $16$, so the area of the square is $16^2 = 256$. The answer is: $256$

Below is a math problem you are to solve (positive numerical answer!):
"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"

The given equation is $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$.

For this equation to equal zero, either the first term or the second term must be zero.

If the first term is zero, then we have $\vert x + y \vert - 10 = 0$ and $\vert x - y \vert - 10 = 0$, which implies $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. This means that $x + y = \pm 10$ and $x - y = \pm 10$. Solving these equations gives us the vertices of the polygon as $(0, 10)$, $(0, -10)$, $(10, 0)$, $(-10, 0)$, $(8, 8)$, $(8, -8)$, $(-8, 8)$, and $(-8, -8)$.

If the second term is zero, then we have $\vert x \vert - 8 = 0$ and $\vert y \vert - 8 = 0$, which implies $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$. This means that $x = \pm 8$ and $y = \pm 8$. But these points are already included in the vertices we found from the first term.

So, the vertices of the polygon are $(0, 10)$, $(0, -10)$, $(10, 0)$, $(-10, 0)$, $(8, 8)$, $(8, -8)$, $(-8, 8)$, and $(-8, -8)$.

The polygon is a square with side length 10. The area of a square is side length squared, so the area of the polygon is $10^2 = 100$.
The answer is: $100$

Below is a math problem you are to solve (positive numerical answer!):
"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"
Analyze this problem and think step by step to come to a solution with programs. After solving the problem, output the final numerical answer within \boxed{}.

Assistant:


The expression $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2)$ is equal to zero if and only if both of its factors are equal to zero. This gives us the following four conditions:
1. $\vert x + y \vert - 10 = 0$ and $\vert x \vert - 8 = 0$.
2. $\vert x + y \vert - 10 = 0$ and $\vert y \vert - 8 = 0$.
3. $\vert x - y \vert - 10 = 0$ and $\vert x \vert - 8 = 0$.
4. $\vert x - y \vert - 10 = 0$ and $\vert y \vert - 8 = 0$.

From conditions 1 and 2, we have $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x \vert = 8$, which implies $-8 \leq x, y \leq 8$.
From conditions 3 and 4, we have $\vert x - y \vert = 10$, which implies that the points $(x, y)$ lie on a square with side length 10.

Therefore, the points $(x, y)$ that satisfy the given equation are those that lie on the square with vertices at $(-8, -8), (-8, 8), (8, -8),$ and $(8, 8)$. The area of this square is $10 \times 10 = 100$. The answer is: $100$

Below is a math problem you are to solve (positive numerical answer!):
"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"

Assistant:

 The expression $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ is true if and only if at least one of the factors is zero.

If $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$, then $\vert x + y \vert = 10$, which implies that $x + y = \pm 10$.
If $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$, then $\vert x - y \vert = 10$, which implies that $x - y = \pm 10$.
If $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$, then $\vert x \vert = 8$, which implies that $x = \pm 8$.
If $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$, then $\vert y \vert = 8$, which implies that $y = \pm 8$.

The points that satisfy these conditions are the vertices of a square with side length 10, centered at the origin, and vertices at $(\pm 8, \pm 8)$.

The area of this square is $10^2 = 100$.

So the area of the convex polygon is 100.
