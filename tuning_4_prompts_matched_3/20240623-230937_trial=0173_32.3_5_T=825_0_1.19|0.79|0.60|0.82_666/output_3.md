Below is a math problem you are to solve (positive numerical answer!):
"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"
Analyze this problem and think step by step to come to a solution with programs. After solving the problem, output the final numerical answer within \boxed{}.

The given equation is of the form $A \cdot B = 0$, where $A$ and $B$ are both products of two terms. Therefore, either $A = 0$ or $B = 0$. This gives us two sets of equations to solve:

1. $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ and $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$.
2. $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ and $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$.

For the first set of equations, we have $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x \vert = 8$. This implies that $-10 \leq x + y \leq 10$ and $-8 \leq x \leq 8$. Similarly, for the second set of equations, we have $\vert x - y \vert = 10$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$. This implies that $-10 \leq x - y \leq 10$ and $-8 \leq y \leq 8$.

The solutions to these inequalities form a square with side length $16$ (from $-8$ to $8$ in both the $x$ and $y$ directions). Therefore, the area of the square is $16^2 = 256$.

So, the area of the convex polygon is $256$ square units. The answer is: $256$

 The equation $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ implies that $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$, which means $x + y = \pm 10$ and $x - y = \pm 10$. This gives us four lines: $x + y = 10$, $x + y = -10$, $x - y = 10$, and $x - y = -10$.

Similarly, the equation $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ implies that $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$, which means $x = \pm 8$ and $y = \pm 8$. This gives us four lines: $x = 8$, $x = -8$, $y = 8$, and $y = -8$.

These lines form a rectangle with vertices at $(8, 8)$, $(8, -8)$, $(-8, -8)$, and $(-8, 8)$. The side lengths of the rectangle are $16$ and $16$, so its area is $256$. The answer is: $256$

Below is a math problem you are to solve (positive numerical answer!):
"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"

 The given equation is satisfied only when both $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ and $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$, and also both $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ and $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$. This implies that $\vert x + y \vert = 10$, $\vert x - y \vert = 10$, $\vert x \vert = 8$, and $\vert y \vert = 8$.

From $\vert x + y \vert = 10$, we get four equations: $x + y = 10$, $x + y = -10$, $-x - y = 10$, and $-x - y = -10$. These four equations represent the lines $y = 10 - x$, $y = -10 - x$, $y = -10 + x$, and $y = 10 - x$ respectively.

From $\vert x - y \vert = 10$, we get four more equations: $x - y = 10$, $x - y = -10$, $-x + y = 10$, and $-x + y = -10$. These four equations represent the lines $y = x - 10$, $y = -x + 10$, $y = x + 10$, and $y = -x - 10$ respectively.

From $\vert x \vert = 8$, we get two equations: $x = 8$ and $x = -8$. These are the lines $x = 8$ and $x = -8$ respectively.

From $\vert y \vert = 8$, we get two more equations: $y = 8$ and $y = -8$. These are the lines $y = 8$ and $y = -8$ respectively.

The eight lines intersect to form a square with side length 16. The area of this square is $16^2 = 256$.

So, the area of the convex polygon is 256.

Here is a Python function to calculate the area:

```python


INTERMEDIATE OUT :

def area_of_polygon():
    """The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"""
    side_length = 16
    area = side_length ** 2
    return area

result = area_of_polygon()
print(result)
```

CODE RESULTS 256

INTERMEDIATE OUT :
```output
256
```
The area of the convex polygon is $256$. The answer is: $256$.
