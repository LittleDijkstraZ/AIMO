 To find the number of positive integers $m$ for which the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has 4 distinct solutions, we need to analyze the equation.
The expression inside the absolute value, $\vert x-1 \vert -2$, can take on three different values: negative, zero, or positive.
1. If $\vert x-1 \vert -2 < 0$, then $\vert x-1 \vert < 2$, which means $-2 < x-1 < 2$. Adding 1 to all parts of the inequality gives $-1 < x < 3$.
2. If $\vert x-1 \vert -2 = 0$, then $\vert x-1 \vert = 2$, which means $x-1 = 2$ or $x-1 = -2$. So $x = 3$ or $x = -1$.
3. If $\vert x-1 \vert -2 > 0$, then $\vert x-1 \vert > 2$, which means $x-1 > 2$ or $x-1 < -2$. So $x > 3$ or $x < -1$.
The equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has 4 distinct solutions when $\frac{m}{100}$ is equal to the difference between the maximum and minimum values of $\vert x-1 \vert -2$. Since the maximum value is 2 and the minimum value is -2, the difference is 4. So $\frac{m}{100} = 4$, which gives $m = 400$. Therefore, the number of positive integers $m$ for which the equation has 4 distinct solutions is 1, namely $m = 400$. The answer is: 1

 To find the value of $m$ for which the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has four distinct solutions, we can use the property of absolute value and solve the equation step by step.

First, let's analyze the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$. This equation has four distinct solutions if and only if $\frac{m}{100} = 2$. This is because the expression inside the absolute value, $\vert x-1 \vert -2$, can take on three different values: $-2$, $0$, and $2$. The equation has four distinct solutions when $\vert x-1 \vert -2 = 2$.

Now, we can solve the equation $\frac{m}{100} = 2$ for $m$:

```python


INTERMEDIATE OUT :

from sympy import symbols, Eq, solve

def solve_for_m():
    m = symbols('m')
    equation = Eq(m/100, 2)
    solution = solve(equation, m)
    return solution[0]

result = solve_for_m()
print(result)
```

The value of $m$ for which the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has four distinct solutions is $200$. The answer is: $\boxed{200}$

Assistant:

 The equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has $4$ distinct solutions, which means that the right side of the equation must be equal to $2$. This is because the absolute value function $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert$ reaches its maximum value of $2$ and only at that value, the equation has $4$ distinct solutions.

So we set $\frac{m}{100}=2$ and solve for $m$:

```python


INTERMEDIATE OUT :

from sympy import symbols, Eq, solve

def find_m():
    m = symbols('m')
    equation = Eq(m/100, 2)
    solution = solve(equation, m)
    return solution[0]

m = find_m()
print(m)
```

CODE RESULTS 200

INTERMEDIATE OUT :
```output

```
The value of $m$ is $200$. Therefore, there is only one positive integer $m$ for which the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has $4$ distinct solutions. The answer is: $1$

Analyze this problem and think step by step to come to a solution with programs. After solving the problem, output the final numerical answer within \boxed{}.

Assistant:

 The number of distinct solutions of the equation $| |x - 1| - 2 | = \frac{m}{100}$ is equal to 4 if and only if $\frac{m}{100}$ is strictly between 1 and 2. This is because the expression on the left side of the equation, $| |x - 1| - 2 |$, can only take on values between 1 and 2. If $\frac{m}{100}$ is less than or equal to 1, there will be at most 3 distinct solutions, and if $\frac{m}{100}$ is greater than or equal to 2, there will be at least 5 distinct solutions. Therefore, we need to find the number of positive integers $m$ such that $1 < \frac{m}{100} < 2$. Multiplying all sides of the inequalities by 100, we get $100 < m < 200$. The number of positive integers in this range is $200 - 100 - 1 = 99$. So the number of positive integers $m$ for which the equation has 4 distinct solutions is 99. The answer is: $99$

Assistant:

 The number of distinct solutions of the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ is equal to 4 if and only if $\frac{m}{100}=1$.
This is because the expression $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert$ can take on exactly four distinct values: $1,0,3,2$, corresponding to the cases when the absolute value inside is equal to $1$, $2$, $3$, and $0$, respectively.

Therefore, we need to solve the equation $\frac{m}{100}=1$ for $m$, which gives $m=100$.

So, there is only one positive integer $m$ for which the equation has four distinct solutions, and that integer is $100$. The answer is: $100$

Assistant:

 The number of distinct solutions of the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ is equal to 4 if and only if $\frac{m}{100} = 2$.

This is because the function $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert$ is a "hump" function that takes the value of 2 exactly once for each $x$.

Therefore, we need to solve the equation $\frac{m}{100} = 2$ for $m$.

```python


INTERMEDIATE OUT :

from sympy import symbols, Eq, solve

def find_m():
    m = symbols('m')
    equation = Eq(m / 100, 2)
    solution = solve(equation, m)
    return solution[0]

m = find_m()
print(m)
```

CODE RESULTS 200

INTERMEDIATE OUT :
```output
200
```
The solution for $m$ is $200$. However, this value of $m$ makes the right-hand side of the equation equal to 2. The number of distinct solutions of the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ is 4 exactly when $\frac{m}{100} = 2$. Therefore, the value of $m$ that makes the number of distinct solutions equal to 4 is $m = 200$. The answer is: $1$
