Assistant:

 The expression $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2)$ equals to $0$ if and only if either $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$, $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$, $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$, or $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$. 

These equalities hold if and only if $\vert x + y \vert = 10$, $\vert x - y \vert = 10$, $\vert x \vert = 8$, or $\vert y \vert = 8$. 

The equalities $\vert x + y \vert = 10$, $\vert x - y \vert = 10$, $\vert x \vert = 8$, and $\vert y \vert = 8$ describe a square with side length $16$, centered at the origin $(0,0)$. The area of this square is $16^2 = 256$. So, the area of the convex polygon is $256$ square units.

The answer is: $256$.

"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"

The given equation is a product of two expressions, and for the product to be zero, either one of the expressions must be zero. This gives us two separate conditions:

1. $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + (\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$
2. $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + (\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$

For the first condition to be true, both terms must be zero, which means $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. The only way this is possible is if $x = \pm 10$ and $y = \pm 10$. So the points that satisfy this condition are $(\pm 10, 0)$, $(0, \pm 10)$, and $(\pm 10, \pm 10)$.

For the second condition to be true, both terms must be zero, which means $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$. The only way this is possible is if $x = \pm 8$ and $y = \pm 8$. So the points that satisfy this condition are $(\pm 8, 0)$, $(0, \pm 8)$, and $(\pm 8, \pm 8)$.

The points that satisfy both conditions are the points where they intersect, which are $(\pm 8, \pm 8)$ and $(\pm 10, \pm 10)$. These points form a square with side length 16. The area of a square is given by the square of the side length, so the area of the square is $16^2 = 256$. The answer is: $256$

"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"

The equation $ab=0$ is true if and only if $a=0$ or $b=0$. Therefore, the given equation is satisfied if and only if either of the following two conditions is true:
1. $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$
2. $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$
For the first condition to be true, we must have $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. This implies that $x + y = \pm 10$ and $x - y = \pm 10$, which gives us the vertices of a square with side length $10\sqrt{2}$. The area of this square is $(10\sqrt{2})^2 = 200$.
For the second condition to be true, we must have $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$, which implies that $x = \pm 8$ and $y = \pm 8$. This gives us a square with side length $16$. The area of this square is $16^2 = 256$.
Taking the minimum of these two areas, we find that the area of the convex polygon is $200$. Therefore, the answer is $\boxed{200}$.
The answer is $\boxed{200}$.

Below is a math problem you are to solve (positive numerical answer!):
"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"
Analyze this problem and think step by step to come to a solution with programs. After solving the problem, output the final numerical answer within \boxed{}.

Assistant:

 The equation given in the problem is:
\[((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0.\]

The product of two numbers is zero if and only if at least one of the numbers is zero. This gives us two separate conditions:

1. $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$.
2. $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$.

From the first condition, we get $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ or $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. This represents the equation of two squares with side length 10. The vertices of these squares are the points where the absolute values are minimized, i.e., $x + y = \pm 10$ and $x - y = \pm 10$. These give us the vertices of the square as $(0, 10)$, $(0, -10)$, $(10, 0)$, and $(-10, 0)$.

From the second condition, we get $\vert x \vert = 8$ or $\vert y \vert = 8$. This represents the equation of two squares with side length 8. The vertices of these squares are the points where the absolute values are minimized, i.e., $x = \pm 8$ and $y = \pm 8$. These give us the vertices of the square as $(8, 0)$, $(-8, 0)$, $(0, 8)$, and $(0, -8)$.

The intersection of these two squares is a smaller square with side length 6 (since 10 - 8 = 6), centered at the origin. The area of this square is $6^2 = 36$. 

Therefore, the area of the convex polygon is 36 square units.

So, the final numerical answer is 36.
The answer is: $36$

 The expression $AB = 0$ is equivalent to $A = 0$ or $B = 0$. Therefore, the points that satisfy the given equation are those that satisfy either $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$.
The solutions to $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ are $x + y = 10$ or $x + y = -10$.
The solutions to $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ are $x - y = 10$ or $x - y = -10$.
The solutions to $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ are $x = 8$ or $x = -8$.
The solutions to $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ are $y = 8$ or $y = -8$.
These solutions form a square with side length 16. The area of this square is $16^2 = 256$. So the area of the convex polygon is 256 square units. The answer is: $256$

"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"

 The given equation is a product of two terms equal to zero. This means that either the first term is zero or the second term is zero. 

If we set each term equal to zero and solve for the variables $x$ and $y$, we find the following four pairs of solutions: 
- $(x, y) = (8, 8)$, 
- $(x, y) = (8, -8)$, 
- $(x, y) = (-8, 8)$, and 
- $(x, y) = (-8, -8)$.

These points form the vertices of a square with side length 16. To find the area of the square, we can simply square the length of one of its sides. 

Here is a Python program that calculates the area:

```python


INTERMEDIATE OUT :

def square_area():
    side_length = 16
    area = side_length ** 2
    return area

result = square_area()
print(result)
```

CODE RESULTS 256

INTERMEDIATE OUT :
```output
256
```
The area of the convex polygon enclosed by the points is 256 square units. The answer is: $256$
