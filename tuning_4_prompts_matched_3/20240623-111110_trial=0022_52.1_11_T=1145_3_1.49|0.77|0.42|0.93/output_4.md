Approach:



We start by using the second condition of the problem to find the value of $f(100)$. To do this, we first need to find the value of $f(50)$, because $100 = 2 \cdot 50$. According to the second condition, $f(100) = 2f(50) + 1$.

However, to find the value of $f(50)$, we need to find the value of $f(25)$ because $50 = 2 \cdot 25$. Again, using the second condition, $f(50) = 2f(25) + 1$.

Continuing this process, we can keep reducing the numbers until we reach a number for which we can directly apply the first condition of the problem.

By doing this, we can find the value of $f(100)$.

Solution:

Starting with $f(100)$, we first find the value of $f(50)$ using the second condition:
\[f(100) = 2f(50) + 1 \tag{1}\]
To find the value of $f(50)$, we use the second condition again with $n=25$:
\[f(50) = 2f(25) + 1 \tag{2}\]
To find the value of $f(25)$, we use the second condition with $n=12.5$, but $n$ must be an integer, so we can't use this condition directly. However, we can use the first condition with $n=13$:
\[f(f(f(13))) = 8 \cdot 13 - 7 = 99 \implies f(f(13)) = 31 \tag{3}\]
Now, since $f(f(f(13))) = 99$, we can substitute $f(13)$ into equation (3) to find $f(13)$:
\[f(f(13)) = f(2 \cdot 13 - 1) = f(25) = 31 \implies f(13) = 15 \tag{4}\]
From equation (4), we know that $f(13) = 15$. Substituting this into equation (3), we get:
\[f(f(13)) = f(15) = 31 \implies f(15) = 19 \tag{5}\]
Continuing this process, we can find that $f(25) = 31$, and then substitute this into equation (2) to find $f(50)$:
\[f(50) = 2 \cdot 31 + 1 = 63 \tag{6}\]
Finally, substituting equation (6) into equation (1), we get:
\[f(100) = 2 \cdot 63 + 1 = 127\]
Therefore, $f(100) = 127$. The answer is: $127$

Approach:

 We are given two functional equations and we want to find the value of $f(100)$. It is clear that directly plugging $n=100$ into the functional equation is not feasible. So, we need to first manipulate these equations to make progress. Let's start with the second equation $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$ and substitute $n=f(k)$ for some positive integer $k$. We get $f(2f(k))=2f(f(k))+1$. But we are given that $f(f(f(k)))=8k-7$. So, we can replace $2f(f(k))+1$ with $8k-7$ to get $f(2f(k))=8k-7$.

Now, let's substitute $k=f(f(k))$ into the above equation. This gives us $f(2f(f(k)))=8f(f(k))-7$. But we are given that $f(f(f(k)))=8k-7$. So, we can replace $8f(f(k))-7$ with $8k-7$ to get $f(2f(f(k)))=8k-7$. Since $k=f(f(k))$, this simplifies to $f(2k)=8k-7$.

Now we can use the equation $f(2k)=8k-7$ to find the value of $f(100)$. We need to express $100$ in the form of $2k$ for some positive integer $k$. We can write $100=2*50$, so $k=50$. Substituting $k=50$ into the equation $f(2k)=8k-7$, we get $f(100)=8*50-7=400-7=393$. So, $f(100)=393$. The answer is: $393$

Approach:


To find the value of $f(100)$, we need to use the given functional equations. The first step is to simplify the expression $f(f(f(n)))$ using the second given equation.

We know that $f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$. If we substitute $f(n)$ with $2f\left(\frac{n}{2}\right) + 1$ from the second equation, we get $f(2f\left(\frac{n}{2}\right) + 1)$. Now, we can apply the second equation again to simplify this expression:
$$f(2f\left(\frac{n}{2}\right) + 1) = 2f\left(f\left(\frac{n}{2}\right)\right) + 1.$$

Now, we can substitute $f\left(\frac{n}{2}\right)$ with $2f\left(\frac{n}{4}\right) + 1$ using the second equation, which gives:
$$2f\left(2f\left(\frac{n}{4}\right) + 1\right) + 1.$$
Applying the second equation again to simplify $f\left(2f\left(\frac{n}{4}\right) + 1\right)$:
$$2\left(2f\left(f\left(\frac{n}{4}\right)\right) + 1\right) + 1.$$

Continuing this process, we can simplify $f(f(f(n)))$ to a form that we can easily solve for $f(n)$. We will find that $f(n)$ turns out to be $2n - 1$ for all positive integers $n$.

Now, we can find the value of $f(100)$ by substituting $n = 100$ into $f(n) = 2n - 1$:
$$f(100) = 2(100) - 1 = 200 - 1 = 199.$$
The answer is: $199$

Solve the following problem with a Python Script (positive numerical answer):
"A function $f: \mathbb N \to \mathbb N$ satisfies the following two conditions for all positive integers $n$:$f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$ and $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$. Calculate $f(100)$."
Write comments to indicate the steps you take. Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Assistant:

Approach:


We are given the two conditions $f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$ and $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$. Our goal is to find the value of $f(100)$.

Notice that $f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$ implies that $f$ is an injective function. This is because if $f(a) = f(b)$ for some $a, b$, then applying $f$ three times gives $f(f(f(a))) = f(f(f(b)))$, but by the given condition this implies $8a - 7 = 8b - 7$, so $a = b$.

Also, from the second condition $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$, we can deduce that $f$ is an increasing function. This is because for $n > m$, we have $f(2n) = 2f(n) + 1 > 2f(m) + 1 = f(2m)$, so by injectivity we have $f(n) > f(m)$.

We can now use the second condition to compute $f(100)$. Notice that $2 \cdot 50 = 100$, so $f(100) = 2f(50) + 1$. To compute $f(50)$, we use $2 \cdot 25 = 50$, so $f(50) = 2f(25) + 1$. Continuing in this way, we eventually get down to the base case of the recursion, which is $f(1)$.

We are missing the value of $f(1)$, but we can find it using the second condition: since $2 \cdot 1 = 2$, we have $f(2) = 2f(1) + 1$. But we also have $f(2n) = 2f(n) + 1$ for $n = 1$, so $f(2) = 2f(1) + 1$. Combining these equations, we get $f(2) = 2f(1) + 1 = f(2)$, so $f(1)$ must satisfy $2f(1) + 1 = f(2)$. But we also know that $f(2)$ must satisfy $f(2n) = 2f(n) + 1$ for $n = 1$, so $f(2) = 2f(1) + 1$. Combining these two equations, we get $2f(1) + 1 = 2f(1) + 1$, which means $f(1)$ can be any value. However, injectivity of $f$ implies that $f(1)$ must be unique, so we can assume $f(1)$ is a fixed value without loss of generality.

Now that we have $f(1)$, we can compute $f(100)$ step by step using the recursion $f(2n) = 2f(n) + 1$. Once we get to $f(100)$, we stop there. This will give us the value of $f(100)$ without needing to know the full function $f$.

Let's actually do the computation:
$f(1) = x$ (assuming a fixed value for $f(1)$ for simplicity)
$f(2) = 2x + 1$
$f(4) = 2(2x + 1) + 1 = 4x + 3$
$f(8) = 2(4x + 3) + 1 = 8x + 7$
$f(16) = 2(8x + 7) + 1 = 16x + 15$
And so on...
Continuing this process, we find:
$f(32) = 32x + 31$
$f(64) = 64x + 63$
$f(128) = 128x + 127$
Now, we can finally compute $f(100)$:
$f(100) = f(64) + f(36)$ (since $64 + 36 = 100$)
$f(100) = (64x + 63) + f(36)$
To find $f(36)$, we continue the process:
$f(36) = f(16) + f(20)$ (since $16 + 20 = 36$)
$f(36) = (16x + 15) + f(20)$
$f(20) = f(10) + f(10)$ (since $10 + 10 = 20$)
$f(20) = 2f(10)$
And similarly, $f(10) = 2f(5)$. Continuing this way, we can eventually compute $f(100)$ without needing to know the full function $f$. However, this is very tedious and error-prone.

A better approach is to notice that the function $f$ has a specific form that satisfies the given conditions. It turns out that $f(n) = 2n - 1$ for all positive integers $n$ satisfies both conditions. This can be checked by substitution into the given conditions.

Once we have found this form of $f$, we can compute $f(100)$ directly:
$f(100) = 2 \cdot 100 - 1 = 200 - 1 = 199$.

So, the value of $f(100)$ is 199. The answer is: $199$

Solve the following problem with a Python Script (positive numerical answer):

Write comments to indicate the steps you take. Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Assistant:

Approach:


We can find $f(100)$ by using the given conditions in a recursive way. 
First, we can express $f(100)$ in terms of $f(f(50))$.
Then, we can express $f(f(50))$ in terms of $f(f(25))$.
Continuing this process, we can eventually express $f(100)$ in terms of $f(5)$, and then use the second condition to express $f(5)$ in terms of $f(2)$, and so on until we reach a value for which we can directly compute the function value using the first condition.

Steps:
Using the second condition $f(2n) = 2f(n) + 1$, we have:
$f(100) = f(2 \cdot 50) = 2f(50) + 1$.
Similarly, $f(50) = f(2 \cdot 25) = 2f(25) + 1$,
and $f(25) = f(2 \cdot 12.5) = 2f(12.5) + 1$.
Since $12.5$ is not an integer, we cannot proceed further using the second condition.

Now, we look at the first condition $f(f(f(n))) = 8n - 7$.
If we let $n = 1$, we have $f(f(f(1))) = 8 \cdot 1 - 7 = 1$.
So $f(1) = 1$.
Then, we have $f(f(f(2))) = 8 \cdot 2 - 7 = 9$.
If $f(f(f(2))) = 9$, then $f(f(2)) = 3$.
Similarly, $f(f(3)) = 4$, $f(f(4)) = 5$, and so on.
We can find that $f(n) = n + 1$ for all positive integers $n$.

Now, we can use this result to find $f(100)$.
We have $f(100) = 2f(50) + 1 = 2(2f(25) + 1) + 1 = 4(2f(12.5) + 1) + 1$.
Since $f(n) = n + 1$, we have $f(12.5) = 12.5 + 1 = 13.5$.
Thus, $f(100) = 4(2 \cdot 13.5 + 1) + 1 = 4(27 + 1) + 1 = 4 \cdot 28 + 1 = 112 + 1 = 113$.

Solution:
So $f(100) = 113$. The answer is: $\boxed{113}$

Approach:



We can start by using the second equation to express $f(f(f(100)))$ in terms of $f(f(50))$. We can then use the second equation again to express $f(f(50))$ in terms of $f(25)$, and finally, use the second equation one last time to express $f(25)$ in terms of $f(12.5)$.

Now we can use the first equation, $f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$, to solve for $f(12.5)$. Once we have $f(12.5)$, we can substitute it back into the equation to find $f(25)$, and then find $f(50)$ and finally $f(100)$.

The solution:

We know that $f(f(f(100)))=8(100)-7=793$. From the equation $f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$, we have $f(f(50)) = \frac{793}{2}$.

Then, we use the equation $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$ to find $f(50)$, so we have $f(50) = 2f(25)+1$.

Now, we substitute $f(50) = \frac{793}{4}$ into this equation to get $\frac{793}{4} = 2f(25) + 1$. Solving for $f(25)$, we get $f(25) = \frac{793 - 4}{8} = \frac{789}{8}$.

Similarly, we have $f(25) = 2f(12.5) + 1$. Substituting $f(25) = \frac{789}{8}$ into this equation, we get $\frac{789}{8} = 2f(12.5) + 1$. Solving for $f(12.5)$, we get $f(12.5) = \frac{789 - 8}{16} = \frac{781}{16}$.

Finally, substituting $f(12.5) = \frac{781}{16}$ into the equation $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$, we can find $f(100)$:

$$f(100) = 2f(50) + 1 = 2\left(\frac{793}{4}\right) + 1 = \frac{793}{2} + 1 = \frac{795}{2}.$$

So $f(100) = \frac{795}{2}$. However, this does not seem to be a valid solution since $f(100)$ should be an integer. Let's try another approach.

We notice that the second equation, $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$, implies that $f(n)$ is an increasing function. Also, from the first equation, we know that $f(f(f(n)))$ is always an odd number. Therefore, $f(n)$ must also be an odd function.

We can now use the property of odd functions to find that $f(100) = f(-100)$, and $f(50) = f(-50)$.

From the first equation, we have $f(f(f(50))) = 8(50) - 7 = 393$. Since $f(f(f(50))) = f(f(-50)) = f(-f(50)) = f(-f(-50)) = f(f(f(-50))) = 393$, we have $f(f(50)) = 393$.

Then, we use the equation $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$ to find $f(50)$, so we have $f(50) = 2f(25) + 1$. Substituting $f(50) = \frac{393}{2}$ into this equation, we get $\frac{393}{2} = 2f(25) + 1$. Solving for $f(25)$, we get $f(25) = \frac{393 - 4}{8} = \frac{389}{8}$.

Similarly, we have $f(25) = 2f(12.5) + 1$. Substituting $f(25) = \frac{389}{8}$ into this equation, we get $\frac{389}{8} = 2f(12.5) + 1$. Solving for $f(12.5)$, we get $f(12.5) = \frac{389 - 8}{16} = \frac{381}{16}$.

Finally, substituting $f(12.5) = \frac{381}{16}$ into the equation $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$, we can find $f(100)$:

$$f(100) = 2f(50) + 1 = 2\left(\frac{393}{2}\right) + 1 = 393 + 1 = 394.$$

Since $f(100)$ should be an integer, this is a valid solution. Therefore, $f(100) = 394$.
The answer is: $\boxed{394}$

Solve the following problem with a Python Script (positive numerical answer):
"A function $f: \mathbb N \to \mathbb N$ satisfies the following two conditions for all positive integers $n$:$f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$ and $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$. Calculate $f(100)$."
Write comments to indicate the steps you take. Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Assistant:

Approach:


We will use the second condition to reduce $f(100)$ until we can use the first condition to find the value.

Firstly, we see that $f(100)$ is involved in the expression $f(f(f(100)))=8(100)-7=793$. So if we manage to express $f(f(f(100)))$ in the form of $f(2n)$ or $f(f(n))$, we can make use of the second condition.

The key is to find a value $n$ such that $100$ is of the form $2^k \cdot n$ for some nonnegative integer $k$. By trial and error, we see that $100 = 2^2 \cdot 25$. So we can set $n=25$ and $k=2$. Then we can write
\[f(f(f(100))) = f(f(f(2^2 \cdot 25))) = f(f(f(2 \cdot 25))) = f(f(f(50))).\]
Now, we can use the second condition to simplify further:
\[f(f(f(50))) = f(f(2f(25)+1)) = f(f(51)).\]
Now we can apply the second condition again:
\[f(f(51)) = 2f(f(25)) + 1.\]
We can continue to apply the second condition to $f(f(25))$:
\[f(f(25)) = 2f(25) + 1.\]
Then we substitute this back into the equation for $f(f(51))$:
\[f(f(51)) = 2(2f(25) + 1) + 1 = 4f(25) + 3.\]
And finally, substitute this into the equation for $f(f(f(100)))$:
\[f(f(f(100))) = 4f(25) + 3.\]
But we know that $f(f(f(100))) = 793$, so we have the equation
\[4f(25) + 3 = 793.\]
Solving for $f(25)$, we get
\[4f(25) = 790 \Rightarrow f(25) = \frac{790}{4} = 197.5.\]
But the function value must be an integer, so we must have made an error somewhere. Let's go back and check our work.

Upon closer inspection, we realize that we made an error in our substitution into the equation for $f(f(51))$: it should be
\[f(f(51)) = 2f(25) + 1.\]
Now, we can substitute this into the equation for $f(f(f(100)))$:
\[f(f(f(100))) = 2f(25) + 1.\]
But we know that $f(f(f(100))) = 793$, so we have the equation
\[2f(25) + 1 = 793.\]
Solving for $f(25)$, we get
\[2f(25) = 792 \Rightarrow f(25) = \frac{792}{2} = 396.\]
Now, let's go back and check our work with the second condition.

When we apply the second condition $f(f(51)) = 2f(25) + 1$, we should get
\[f(f(51)) = 2(396) + 1 = 793,\]
which is consistent with our earlier work. So the mistake was in our original work.

The error came from not checking our work carefully enough. It turns out that our mistake came from misapplying the second condition. When we applied the second condition to $f(f(51))$, we should have obtained
\[f(f(51)) = f(2f(25)+1),\]
not
\[f(f(51)) = 2f(25) + 1.\]
Let's correct this mistake.

When we apply the second condition $f(f(51)) = f(2f(25)+1)$, we should get
\[f(f(51)) = f(793).\]
Now, let's go back and check our work with the first condition.

When we apply the first condition $f(f(f(100))) = 8(100)-7$, we should get
\[f(f(f(100))) = 793.\]
Now, let's check our work with the second condition.

When we apply the second condition $f(f(51)) = f(2f(25)+1)$, we should get
\[f(f(51)) = f(793).\]
Now, we can substitute this into the equation for $f(f(f(100)))$:
\[f(f(f(100))) = f(f(51)).\]
But we know that $f(f(f(100))) = 793$, so we have the equation
\[f(f(51)) = 793.\]
This is consistent with our earlier work. So, the mistake was in not checking our work carefully enough. It turns out that our mistake came from misapplying the second condition.

To continue solving the problem, we apply the second condition to $f(f(51)) = 793$:
\[f(f(51)) = 2f(25) + 1.\]
Solving for $f(25)$, we get
\[2f(25) = 792 \Rightarrow f(25) = \frac{792}{2} = 396.\]
Now, we apply the second condition to $f(25)$:
\[f(25) = 2f(12.5) + 1.\]
But the function value must be an integer, so we must have made another error.

Upon closer inspection, we realize that we made an error in our substitution into the equation for $f(f(51))$: it should be
\[f(f(51)) = 2f(25) + 1.\]
This is consistent with our earlier work.

The mistake came from misapplying the second condition. When we applied the second condition to $f(f(51))$, we should have obtained
\[f(f(51)) = f(2f(25)+1),\]
not
\[f(f(51)) = 2f(25) + 1.\]
Let's correct this mistake.

When we apply the second condition $f(f(51)) = f(2f(25)+1)$, we should

Approach:


To find $f(100)$, we need to work our way backwards using the second condition in the problem statement.
Since $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$, we have $f(50) = 2f(25) + 1$.
Similarly, we can find $f(25)$ by using $f(50) = 2f(25) + 1$.
Continuing in this way, we can find $f(12)$, $f(6)$, $f(3)$, and finally $f(1)$.
Then we can use the first condition in the problem statement to find $f(f(f(1)))$, which is equal to $8(1) - 7 = 1$.
Therefore, $f(1) = 1$.
Now we can work our way forward to find $f(100)$ using the second condition.
We have $f(50) = 2f(25) + 1$, $f(25) = 2f(12.5) + 1$, but $12.5$ is not an integer, so we need to find another way.
Let's try to find $f(100)$ directly from the first condition $f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$.
If we let $n = 1$, then $f(f(f(1))) = 8(1) - 7 = 1$, so $f(1) = 1$.
Now let's try $n = 2$. We have $f(f(f(2))) = 8(2) - 7 = 9$, and since $f(1) = 1$, we can substitute this into the equation to get $f(f(1)) = 9$, so $f(9) = 1$.
Now let's try $n = 9$. We have $f(f(f(9))) = 8(9) - 7 = 65$, and since $f(9) = 1$, we can substitute this into the equation to get $f(1) = 65$, which is a contradiction because we already found that $f(1) = 1$.
Let's try a different approach.
From the second condition, we have $f(50) = 2f(25) + 1$, $f(25) = 2f(12.5) + 1$, and since $12.5$ is not an integer, we need to find another way.
Let's try the first condition $f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$.
If we let $n = 50$, then $f(f(f(50))) = 8(50) - 7 = 393$.
Since $f(50) = 2f(25) + 1$, we can substitute this into the equation to get $f(f(2f(25) + 1)) = 393$.
Now let's try to find $f(25)$.
From the second condition, we have $f(25) = 2f(12.5) + 1$.
Since $12.5$ is not an integer, we need to find another way.
Let's try the first condition $f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$.
If we let $n = 25$, then $f(f(f(25))) = 8(25) - 7 = 193$.
Since $f(25) = 2f(12.5) + 1$, we can substitute this into the equation to get $f(f(2f(12.5) + 1)) = 193$.
Now let's try to find $f(12.5)$.
From the second condition, we have $f(25) = 2f(12.5) + 1$, so $f(12.5) = \frac{f(25) - 1}{2}$.
Substituting the value of $f(25)$ we found earlier, we get $f(12.5) = \frac{193 - 1}{2} = 96$.
Now we can substitute this back into the equation $f(2f(12.5) + 1) = f(2(96) + 1) = f(193)$.
Since $f(f(f(50))) = 393$, we have $f(f(193)) = 393$, and since $f(f(f(25))) = 193$, we have $f(f(193)) = 193$, which is a contradiction.
Let's try a different approach.
From the second condition, we have $f(50) = 2f(25) + 1$, $f(25) = 2f(12.5) + 1$, and $f(12.5) = \frac{f(25) - 1}{2}$.
Substituting the value of $f(25)$ we found earlier, we get $f(12.5) = \frac{193 - 1}{2} = 96$.
Now let's substitute this back into the equation $f(25) = 2f(12.5) + 1$ to get $f(25) = 2(96) + 1 = 193$.
Now let's substitute the values of $f(25)$ and $f(12.5)$ back into the equation $f(50) = 2f(25) + 1$ to get $f(50) = 2(193) + 1 = 387$.
Since $f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$, if we let $n = 50$, then $f(f(f(50))) = 8(50) - 7 = 393$.
Since $f(50) = 387$, we have $f(f(387)) = 393$.
Now let's try to find $f(100)$.
From the second condition, we have $f(100) = 2f(50) + 1$.
Substituting the value of $f(50)$ we found earlier, we get $f(100) = 2(387) + 1 = 775$.
However, this value doesn't satisfy the first condition $f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$.
Let's try a different approach.
From the second condition, we have $f(100) = 2f(50) + 1$, so $f(50) = \frac{f(100) - 1}{2}$.
Substituting the value of

"A function $f: \mathbb N \to \mathbb N$ satisfies the following two conditions for all positive integers $n$:$f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$ and $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$. Calculate $f(100)$."

Approach:

 We will start by trying to find the value of $f(1)$ using the second condition $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$. By setting $n=1$, we get $f(2) = 2f(1) + 1$. But we don't know the value of $f(2)$ yet, so let's try another way.

Consider the equation $f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$. If we plug in $n=1$, we get $f(f(f(1)))=8(1)-7=1$. Since $f(f(f(1)))=1$, and $f$ is a function from $\mathbb N$ to $\mathbb N$, it follows that $f(1)$ must be an input that gives $1$ as an output when fed into the function $f$ three times. By trial and error, we can find that $f(1)=1$ is a solution because $f(f(f(1)))=f(f(1))=f(1)=1$.

Now that we have $f(1)=1$, we can use the second condition to find $f(2)$. Substituting $n=1$ into the second condition gives $f(2)=2f(1)+1=2(1)+1=3$. 

Next, we can use $f(2)=3$ to find $f(3)$ using the second condition again. Substituting $n=2$ gives $f(4)=2f(2)+1=2(3)+1=7$. 

Continuing this process, we can keep finding values of $f(n)$ for larger $n$. We find that $f(3)=4$, $f(4)=7$, $f(5)=8$, $f(6)=13$, and so on. We observe a pattern: $f(n) = 2n-1$ for all positive integers $n$.

We can verify this pattern using the original two conditions. If $f(n) = 2n-1$ for all positive integers $n$, then $f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$ becomes $f(f(f(n)))=2(2(2n-1)-1)-1=8n-7$. This equation holds true, and $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$ becomes $f(2n)=2(2n-1)+1=4n-1$, which also holds true. So, our pattern $f(n) = 2n-1$ is correct.

Finally, we substitute $n=100$ into the pattern to find $f(100)=2(100)-1=199$. So, $f(100)=199$. The answer is: $199$

"A function $f: \mathbb N \to \mathbb N$ satisfies the following two conditions for all positive integers $n$:$f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$ and $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$. Calculate $f(100)$."

Approach:

 We will use the second given condition to simplify the problem step by step.

Initially, we are asked to find $f(100)$, and according to the second condition, we know that $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$. Thus, we can substitute $n=50$ into this equation to get $f(100)=2f(50)+1$. Now, we need to find $f(50)$.

Again, using the second condition, we know that $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$. So, if we substitute $n=25$, we get $f(50)=2f(25)+1$. Now, we need to find $f(25)$.

Continuing this process, we find that $f(50)=2f(25)+1$, $f(100)=2f(50)+1$, and $f(200)=2f(100)+1$. So, we have the relationship $f(2^kn)=2^kf(n)+2^{k-1}-1$.

Using this relationship, we can find $f(50)$ and $f(100)$.

First, $f(50)=2f(25)+1$, and since $25=2^2\cdot 5$, we can use the first condition to find $f(25)$: $f(25)=f(f(f(5)))=8\cdot 5-7=33$. So, $f(50)=2\cdot 33+1=67$.

Now, $f(100)=2f(50)+1=2\cdot 67+1=135$.

Therefore, the value of $f(100)$ is $135$. The answer is: $\boxed{135}$.

Approach:


To find $f(100)$, we can first set $n=50$ in the equation $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$, and get $f(100)=2f(50)+1$.
Next, we set $n=25$ in the equation $f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$, and get $f(f(f(25)))=8*25-7=203$.
Since $f(f(f(25)))=203$, we have $f(f(25))=25$.
Setting $n=25$ in the equation $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$, we get $f(50)=2f(25)+1=2*25+1=51$.
Finally, setting $n=50$ in the equation $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$, we get $f(100)=2f(50)+1=2*51+1=103$.

Therefore, $f(100)=103$.
The answer is: $103$

Solve the following problem with a Python Script (positive numerical answer):

Approach:


To solve this problem, we will use the second condition $f(2n) = 2f(n) + 1$ to find a general expression for $f(n)$. Then we will substitute $n = 100$ into this expression to find $f(100)$.

From the second condition, we can find that $f(1) = 1$ by setting $n = \frac{1}{2}$. This is because $f(2 \cdot \frac{1}{2}) = 2f(\frac{1}{2}) + 1 \implies f(1) = 2f(\frac{1}{2}) + 1$. Also, $f(1) = f(f(f(1))) = 8 \cdot 1 - 7 = 1$.

Now we can find $f(2)$: $f(2) = 2f(1) + 1 = 2 \cdot 1 + 1 = 3$.

Similarly, $f(3) = f(f(f(3))) = 8 \cdot 3 - 7 = 17$, $f(17) = f(f(f(17))) = 8 \cdot 17 - 7 = 127$, and so on.

From these results, we can observe that $f(n) = 2n - 1$ for all positive integers $n$. This can be proved by induction.

Now we can find $f(100)$ by substituting $n = 100$ into the expression $f(n) = 2n - 1$. So $f(100) = 2 \cdot 100 - 1 = 199$.

Therefore, $f(100) = 199$.
The answer is: $\boxed{199}$.
