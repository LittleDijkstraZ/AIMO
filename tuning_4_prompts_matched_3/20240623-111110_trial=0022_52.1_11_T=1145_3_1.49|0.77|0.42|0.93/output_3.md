Solve the following problem with a Python Script (positive numerical answer):
"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"
Write comments to indicate the steps you take. Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Approach:

 The given equation is equal to zero, which means that at least one of the factors must be zero. So we have two cases to consider:

Case 1: $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$
This implies $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ or $\vert x - y \vert = 10$.
The four lines given by these equations are the sides of a square with side length $20$.

Case 2: $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$
This implies $\vert x \vert = 8$ or $\vert y \vert = 8$.
The four lines given by these equations are the sides of a square with side length $16$.

The intersection of these two squares is a smaller square with side length $8$. Therefore, the area of the convex polygon is the area of the larger square minus the area of the smaller square.

The area of a square is given by side length squared. So the area of the larger square is $20^2 = 400$, and the area of the smaller square is $8^2 = 64$.

Therefore, the area of the convex polygon is $400 - 64 = 336$.
The answer is: $336$

Solve the following problem with a Python Script (positive numerical answer):
"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"

Approach:


The expression $A \cdot B = 0$ means that at least one of the expressions A or B is equal to 0.
Thus, the given equation breaks down into two cases:
Case 1: $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$.
This means that both $\vert x + y \vert - 10 = 0$ and $\vert x - y \vert - 10 = 0$.
Solving these two equations gives $x + y = 10$ and $x - y = 10$ or $x + y = 10$ and $x - y = -10$.
The first set of equations gives $x = 5$ and $y = 5$, and the second set gives $x = 0$ and $y = 10$.
So the points $(x, y)$ that satisfy this case are $(5, 5)$ and $(0, 10)$.

Case 2: $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$.
This means that both $\vert x \vert - 8 = 0$ and $\vert y \vert - 8 = 0$.
Solving these two equations gives $x = \pm 8$ and $y = \pm 8$.
So the points $(x, y)$ that satisfy this case are $(8, 8)$, $(8, -8)$, $(-8, 8)$, and $(-8, -8)$.

To form a polygon with these points, we connect the points $(5, 5)$, $(0, 10)$, $(8, 8)$, $(8, -8)$, $(-8, 8)$, and $(-8, -8)$ in that order. This polygon is a square with side length $10$. Therefore, its area is $10^2 = 100$.
The answer is: $100$

Assistant:

Approach:


The expression equals to zero if any of the two factors equals to zero.
The first factor equals to zero if either $\vert x + y \vert - 10 = 0$ or $\vert x - y \vert - 10 = 0$.
These two equations imply that $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$.
These are lines in the plane.
The second factor equals to zero if either $\vert x \vert - 8 = 0$ or $\vert y \vert - 8 = 0$.
These two equations imply that $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$.
These are lines in the plane.
The intersection of these lines form a square with side length 16.
The area of the square is $16^2 = 256$.
The answer is: $256$

"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"

Approach:

 The equation $AB = 0$ implies that either $A = 0$ or $B = 0$. Hence, the given equation implies that either $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$. 
The first equation implies that $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. This forms a square with side length 10. The second equation implies that $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$, which forms a square with side length 16. Hence, the area of the convex polygon is the sum of the areas of these two squares, which is $10^2 + 16^2 = 100 + 256 = 356$. The answer is: $356$

Approach:


The given equation is equal to zero, which implies that at least one of the factors is zero. Thus, we have two sets of equations:
1) $|x+y| - 10 = 0$ and $|x| - 8 = 0$, $|y| - 8 = 0$.
2) $|x-y| - 10 = 0$ and $|x| - 8 = 0$, $|y| - 8 = 0$.
Solving each set of equations will give us the coordinates of the vertices of the polygon.

For set 1, the equations are $|x+y| = 10$, $|x| = 8$, and $|y| = 8$. This implies that $x = 8$ or $x = -8$, and $y = 8$ or $y = -8$. The possible vertices are therefore $(8,8)$, $(8,-8)$, $(-8,8)$, and $(-8,-8)$.

For set 2, the equations are $|x-y| = 10$, $|x| = 8$, and $|y| = 8$. This implies that $x = 8$ or $x = -8$, and $y = 8$ or $y = -8$. The possible vertices are therefore $(8,8)$, $(8,-8)$, $(-8,8)$, and $(-8,-8)$.

We see that all vertices are the same, so the polygon is a square with side length 16 (since the distance between $(8,8)$ and $(8,-8)$ is 16).

The area of the square is then $16^2 = 256$.

So, the area of the convex polygon is 256. The answer is: $\boxed{256}$

Approach:



A product of two numbers is zero if and only if at least one of the numbers is zero. So we have two cases to consider:

1. $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$. This implies that $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$.
2. $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$. This implies that $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$.

Case 1: $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. This forms a square with side length 10. The area of the square is $10^2 = 100$.

Case 2: $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$. This forms a square with side length 8. The area of the square is $8^2 = 64$.

However, we are interested in the area of the convex polygon formed by the intersection of the two squares. The intersection of the two squares is also a square, but with side length 8 (since the side length of the smaller square is limited by the larger square). The area of this square is $8^2 = 64$.

So, the area of the convex polygon is $64$.

The answer is: $64$

Solve the following problem with a Python Script (positive numerical answer):
"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"

Approach:

 The equation $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + (\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + (\vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ will be equal to zero only when both the terms are zero. This implies that either of the terms should be zero for the entire equation to be zero.

Consider the first term $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + (\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$. This will be zero only when $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. This forms a square with side length 10. The vertices of the square are at points $(0, 10)$, $(10, 0)$, $(0, -10)$ and $(-10, 0)$.

Similarly, the second term $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + (\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$. This will be zero only when $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$. This forms a square with side length 16. The vertices of this square are at points $(8, 8)$, $(8, -8)$, $(-8, 8)$, and $(-8, -8)$.

Now, the area of the convex polygon formed by the intersection of these two squares is the area of the smaller square (with side length 10). The area of this square is $10^2 = 100$.

So, the area of the convex polygon is 100.
The answer is: 100

Solve the following problem with a Python Script (positive numerical answer):
"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"

Assistant:

Approach:


The given equation is $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$. The product of two terms equals zero if and only if one or both of the terms are zero. Therefore, either $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$.
The equation $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ implies $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. This means that $x + y = \pm 10$ and $x - y = \pm 10$. Solving these equations, we get the vertices of the square as $(0, 10)$, $(0, -10)$, $(10, 0)$, and $(-10, 0)$.
The equation $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ implies $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$. This means that $x = \pm 8$ and $y = \pm 8$. So, the vertices of the square are $(8, 8)$, $(8, -8)$, $(-8, 8)$, and $(-8, -8)$.
The convex polygon formed by these vertices is a square with side length $10$. The area of a square is the side length squared, so the area of this square is $10^2 = 100$. The answer is: $100$

The product of two numbers is zero if and only if at least one of the numbers is zero. So, for the equation to hold, we must have either $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$.

The expression $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ implies that $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. These equations represent a square with side length 10 and vertices at $(\pm 10, 0)$ and $(0, \pm 10)$.

The expression $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ implies that $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$. These equations represent a square with side length 16 and vertices at $(\pm 8, 0)$ and $(0, \pm 8)$.

The intersection of these two squares is the square with side length 10. The area of this square is $10^2 = 100$. So the area of the convex polygon is 100. The answer is: $100$
