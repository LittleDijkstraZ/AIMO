Question (hint: positive numerical answer):
"For how many positive integers $m$ does the equation \[\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}\] have $4$ distinct solutions?"
Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:



The equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has 4 distinct solutions, which means the right side of the equation must be a positive number. This is because the absolute value function creates two cases and the absolute value of a number is always non-negative, so in order for the equation to have 4 distinct solutions, the right side must be positive.

Therefore, we have $\frac{m}{100}>0$, which implies $m>0$. This is consistent with the given condition that $m$ is a positive integer.

Now, let's analyze the absolute value function $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert$. This function will be zero at two points where the expression inside the absolute value equals to 2 and -2. Therefore, the function will be equal to a positive number between these two points. 

So, we need to find the range of $x$ where the expression inside the absolute value is between $-2$ and $2$. That is $-2 \leq \vert x-1 \vert -2 \leq 2$.

Adding 2 to all sides gives $0 \leq \vert x-1 \vert \leq 4$.

This means $-4 \leq x-1 \leq 4$.

Adding 1 to all sides gives $-3 \leq x \leq 5$.

So, the solutions to the equation are in the interval $[-3,5]$.

The possible values of $\frac{m}{100}$ in this interval are the differences of the absolute values of the endpoints of this interval and the value 2. 

That is, $\frac{m}{100}=|(5-1)-2|=2$ or $\frac{m}{100}=|(1-(-3))-2|=2$.

So, we have $\frac{m}{100}=2$, which gives $m=200$.

Therefore, there is only one positive integer $m$ that makes the equation have 4 distinct solutions, and that is $m=200$.
The value of unknown variable m is 200. The answer is: $200$

Question (hint: positive numerical answer):
"For how many positive integers $m$ does the equation \[\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}\] have $4$ distinct solutions?"
Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:



For the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ to have 4 distinct solutions, $\frac{m}{100}$ must be equal to $2$. This is because the graph of $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert$ has two "hills" and two "valleys", and for each "hill" or "valley", there is one value of $m$ that gives 4 distinct solutions. Setting $\frac{m}{100}$ equal to $2$ gives us $m=200$. Therefore, the value of $m$ that makes the equation have 4 distinct solutions is 200. The answer is: $1$

Question (hint: positive numerical answer):
"For how many positive integers $m$ does the equation \[\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}\] have $4$ distinct solutions?"
Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:


The equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has 4 distinct solutions.
We know that the absolute value function $\vert x \vert$ is a piecewise function defined as $x$ if $x \geq 0$ and $-x$ if $x < 0$.
So, we can rewrite the equation as $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$.
This equation has 4 distinct solutions, which means the equation inside the absolute value, $\vert x-1 \vert -2$, must change its sign twice.
This happens when the value inside the absolute value is 0 twice.
Let's set $\vert x-1 \vert -2 = 0$ and solve for $x$.
$\vert x-1 \vert = 2$.
This splits into two cases:
Case 1: $x-1 = 2 \implies x = 3$.
Case 2: $x-1 = -2 \implies x = -1$.
Now, let's set $\vert x-1 \vert -2 = -\frac{m}{100}$ and solve for $x$.
$\vert x-1 \vert = 2-\frac{m}{100}$.
This also splits into two cases:
Case 3: $x-1 = 2-\frac{m}{100} \implies x = 3-\frac{m}{100}$.
Case 4: $x-1 = -(2-\frac{m}{100}) \implies x = -1+\frac{m}{100}$.
For these 4 distinct solutions to exist, we need $-1 < -1+\frac{m}{100} < 1 < 3-\frac{m}{100} < 3$.
Simplifying these inequalities, we get:
$0 < \frac{m}{100} < 2 < \frac{m}{100} < 4$.
Multiplying all inequalities by 100, we get:
$0 < m < 200 < m < 400$.
The value of $m$ that satisfies these inequalities is $m = 200$.
Therefore, there is only one positive integer $m$ for which the equation has 4 distinct solutions, and that is $m = 200$.
The value of $m$ is 200. The answer is: $1$

Question (hint: positive numerical answer):
"For how many positive integers $m$ does the equation \[\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}\] have $4$ distinct solutions?"
Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:


The equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has 4 distinct solutions if and only if $\frac{m}{100}$ is between 1 and 2. This is because the graph of $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert$ is a V-shape with a maximum value of 2 and a minimum value of 0, and the equation has 4 distinct solutions when $\frac{m}{100}$ is strictly between 0 and 2.
So, we need to find the number of positive integers $m$ such that $1 < \frac{m}{100} < 2$.
Multiplying all parts of the inequality by 100 gives $100 < m < 200$. The positive integers $m$ that satisfy this inequality are the integers from 101 to 199, inclusive. To find the total number of these integers, we subtract the smallest integer from the largest and add 1: $199 - 101 + 1 = 99$.
Therefore, there are 99 positive integers $m$ for which the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has 4 distinct solutions. The answer is: $99$

Question (hint: positive numerical answer):
"For how many positive integers $m$ does the equation \[\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}\] have $4$ distinct solutions?"
Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:


The equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has 4 distinct solutions.
We know that $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert$ can take values from 0 to 2.
So, $\frac{m}{100}$ must be in the interval (0, 2).
This means $0 < \frac{m}{100} < 2$, which simplifies to $0 < m < 200$.
The positive integers $m$ that satisfy this inequality are 1, 2, ..., 199.
However, we are asked for the number of positive integers $m$ for which the equation has 4 distinct solutions.
From the graph of $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert$, we know that it takes the value of $\frac{m}{100}$ exactly 4 times when $\frac{m}{100}$ is in the interval (0, 2).
This occurs when $\frac{m}{100} = 1$, which gives $m = 100$.
Therefore, the only positive integer $m$ for which the equation has 4 distinct solutions is 100.
The answer is: $1$

Question (hint: positive numerical answer):
"For how many positive integers $m$ does the equation \[\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}\] have $4$ distinct solutions?"
Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:


To have four distinct solutions for the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$, the value of $\frac{m}{100}$ must be equal to either $1$ or $3$. This is because the function $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert$ has a maximum value of $3$ and a minimum value of $1$.

If $\frac{m}{100} = 1$, then $m = 100$.
If $\frac{m}{100} = 3$, then $m = 300$.

Therefore, there are only two possible values for $m$, and thus the number of positive integers $m$ for which the equation has four distinct solutions is $2$. The answer is: 2

Question (hint: positive numerical answer):
"For how many positive integers $m$ does the equation \[\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}\] have $4$ distinct solutions?"
Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:


The equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has 4 distinct solutions if and only if $\frac{m}{100}$ is strictly between 1 and 2. This is because the function $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert$ is a piecewise linear function that takes on the value of 1 at two points and 0 at three points. If $\frac{m}{100}$ is less than or equal to 1, then the equation has at most three solutions. If $\frac{m}{100}$ is greater than or equal to 2, then the equation has at most two solutions. So, $\frac{m}{100}$ must be strictly between 1 and 2 for the equation to have 4 distinct solutions.

Therefore, we have $1 < \frac{m}{100} < 2$, which implies $100 < m < 200$. The positive integers $m$ that satisfy this inequality are the integers from 101 to 199, inclusive. To find the number of these integers, we subtract the smallest integer from the largest and then add 1. So, the number of positive integers $m$ is $199 - 101 + 1 = 99$.
The answer is: 99.

Question (hint: positive numerical answer):
"For how many positive integers $m$ does the equation \[\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}\] have $4$ distinct solutions?"
Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:


The equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has 4 distinct solutions. This means that the expression inside the absolute value, $\vert x-1 \vert -2$, will be equal to $\frac{m}{100}$, $-\frac{m}{100}$, $\frac{m}{100}$ and $-\frac{m}{100}$ four times.
We can rewrite the equation as two separate equations: $\vert x-1 \vert -2 = \frac{m}{100}$ and $\vert x-1 \vert -2 = -\frac{m}{100}$.
For the first equation, we have $\vert x-1 \vert = 2 + \frac{m}{100}$, which gives us two sub-equations: $x-1 = 2 + \frac{m}{100}$ and $-(x-1) = 2 + \frac{m}{100}$, or $x = 3 + \frac{m}{100}$ and $x = -1 + \frac{m}{100}$.
For the second equation, we have $\vert x-1 \vert = 2 - \frac{m}{100}$, which gives us two sub-equations: $x-1 = 2 - \frac{m}{100}$ and $-(x-1) = 2 - \frac{m}{100}$, or $x = 3 - \frac{m}{100}$ and $x = -1 + \frac{m}{100}$.
We can see that the solutions $x = 3 + \frac{m}{100}$ and $x = 3 - \frac{m}{100}$ are the same, as are the solutions $x = -1 + \frac{m}{100}$ and $x = -1 - \frac{m}{100}$. So we only have two distinct solutions: $x = 3 + \frac{m}{100}$ and $x = -1 + \frac{m}{100}$.
For these solutions to be distinct, we need $3 + \frac{m}{100} \neq -1 + \frac{m}{100}$, which simplifies to $4 \neq 0$. This is always true, so the solutions are always distinct.
To have 4 distinct solutions, we need the expression inside the absolute value, $\vert x-1 \vert -2$, to be equal to $\frac{m}{100}$ and $-\frac{m}{100}$ twice each. This means that the absolute value of $\frac{m}{100}$ must be 2, or $\vert \frac{m}{100} \vert = 2$. Solving this equation gives $\frac{m}{100} = 2$ or $\frac{m}{100} = -2$. Multiplying both sides by 100 gives $m = 200$ or $m = -200$. But $m$ must be positive, so $m = 200$. Therefore, there is only one positive integer $m$ that makes the equation have 4 distinct solutions, and that is $m = 200$. The answer is: $1$
