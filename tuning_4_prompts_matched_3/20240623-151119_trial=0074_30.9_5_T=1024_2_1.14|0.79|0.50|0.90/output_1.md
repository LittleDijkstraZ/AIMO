Question (hint: positive numerical answer):
"What is the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ when $x$ and $y$ range over all real numbers such that $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$?"
Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:


First, let's rewrite the equation $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$ using the property $|a| = |-a|$ for all real numbers $a$. We get
\[|x-2y| + |2x-y| = 40.\]
Then, we use the property $|a+b| \leq |a| + |b|$ for all real numbers $a$ and $b$. We get
\[|(x-2y) + (2x-y)| \leq |x-2y| + |2x-y|,\]
which simplifies to
\[|3x-3y| \leq 40.\]
Then, we use the property $|a| = |b|$ if and only if $a = b$ or $a = -b$ for all real numbers $a$ and $b$. We get
\[3x-3y = 40 \text{ or } 3x-3y = -40.\]
Simplifying these equations, we get
\[x-y = \frac{40}{3} \text{ or } x-y = -\frac{40}{3}.\]
Now, let's substitute $x = y + \frac{40}{3}$ or $x = y - \frac{40}{3}$ into the expression $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ and simplify.

Case 1: If $x = y + \frac{40}{3}$, then
\begin{align*}
5x^2+5y^2-8xy &= 5(y + \frac{40}{3})^2 + 5y^2 - 8y(y + \frac{40}{3}) \\
&= 5(y^2 + \frac{80y}{3} + \frac{1600}{9}) + 5y^2 - 8y^2 - \frac{320y}{3} \\
&= 5y^2 + \frac{400y}{3} + \frac{8000}{9} + 5y^2 - 8y^2 - \frac{320y}{3} \\
&= 2y^2 + \frac{80y}{3} + \frac{8000}{9}.
\end{align*}

Case 2: If $x = y - \frac{40}{3}$, then
\begin{align*}
5x^2+5y^2-8xy &= 5(y - \frac{40}{3})^2 + 5y^2 - 8y(y - \frac{40}{3}) \\
&= 5(y^2 - \frac{80y}{3} + \frac{1600}{9}) + 5y^2 - 8y^2 + \frac{320y}{3} \\
&= 5y^2 - \frac{400y}{3} + \frac{8000}{9} + 5y^2 - 8y^2 + \frac{320y}{3} \\
&= 2y^2 - \frac{80y}{3} + \frac{8000}{9}.
\end{align*}

Now, let's find the minimum value of $2y^2 + \frac{80y}{3} + \frac{8000}{9}$ and $2y^2 - \frac{80y}{3} + \frac{8000}{9}$.

Both expressions are quadratic functions of $y$, and their minimum values can be found by completing the square or using calculus. After completing the square or taking the derivative and setting it equal to zero, we find that the minimum value of $2y^2 + \frac{80y}{3} + \frac{8000}{9}$ is $\frac{8000}{9}$, and the minimum value of $2y^2 - \frac{80y}{3} + \frac{8000}{9}$ is also $\frac{8000}{9}$.

Therefore, the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ when $x$ and $y$ range over all real numbers such that $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$ is $\frac{8000}{9}$. The answer is: $\boxed{\frac{8000}{9}}$

Question (hint: positive numerical answer):
"What is the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ when $x$ and $y$ range over all real numbers such that $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$?"
Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:



We first simplify the equation $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$.
Using the property $|a - b| = |b - a|$, we can rewrite the equation as $|x-2y| + |2y-x| = 40$.
Then, using the property $|a| + |b| = |a+b|$ if $a$ and $b$ have the same sign, we can simplify further:
$|x-2y + 2y-x| = 40$, which simplifies to $|0| = 40$. This is a contradiction, so we must have $|x-2y| = |2y-x|$.
This implies that $x-2y = 2y-x$ or $x-2y = -(2y-x)$.
The first case gives $x-2y = 2y-x$, which simplifies to $4y = 2x$, or $y = \frac{x}{2}$.
The second case gives $x-2y = -(2y-x)$, which simplifies to $x-2y = -2y+x$, which is always true.
So we have $y = \frac{x}{2}$.
Now we substitute this into the expression $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$:
\[5x^2+5\left(\frac{x}{2}\right)^2-8x\left(\frac{x}{2}\right) = 5x^2+\frac{5x^2}{4}-4x^2 = \frac{15x^2}{4}.\]
To find the minimum value of this expression, we need to find the minimum value of $x^2$.
Since $x$ and $y$ satisfy $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$, we can substitute $y = \frac{x}{2}$ to get $|x-x| + |x-x| = 40$, which simplifies to $0 = 40$. This is a contradiction, so we must have made an error in our reasoning.
Let's go back and re-examine our steps.
We found that $y = \frac{x}{2}$ from the equation $|x-2y| = |2y-x|$.
However, we made a mistake when we simplified $|x-2y + 2y-x|$ to $|0| = 40$. This is not correct, because $|x-2y + 2y-x|$ simplifies to $|0|$, not $|0| = 40$.
The correct step is $|x-2y + 2y-x| = |0|$, which is always true, not equal to $40$.
So we need to look for another way to simplify the equation $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$.
We know that $|a| + |b| = |a+b|$ if $a$ and $b$ have the same sign.
So we can split the absolute value signs:
$|x-2y| + |y-2x| = (x-2y) + (2x-y) = 3x-3y$.
Setting this equal to $40$, we have $3x-3y = 40$.
Dividing by $3$, we get $x-y = \frac{40}{3}$.
Now we have two equations: $y = \frac{x}{2}$ and $x-y = \frac{40}{3}$.
We can substitute $y = \frac{x}{2}$ into the second equation:
$x - \frac{x}{2} = \frac{40}{3}$.
Multiplying through by $2$, we have $2x - x = \frac{80}{3}$.
Simplifying, we get $x = \frac{80}{3}$.
Substituting this back into $y = \frac{x}{2}$, we have $y = \frac{40}{3}$.
Now we substitute $x = \frac{80}{3}$ and $y = \frac{40}{3}$ into the expression $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$:
\[5\left(\frac{80}{3}\right)^2+5\left(\frac{40}{3}\right)^2-8\left(\frac{80}{3}\right)\left(\frac{40}{3}\right) = \frac{3200}{9}+\frac{800}{9}-\frac{3200}{9} = \frac{800}{9}.\]
Therefore, the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ is $\frac{800}{9}$. The answer is: $\boxed{\frac{800}{9}}$

Question (hint: positive numerical answer):
"What is the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ when $x$ and $y$ range over all real numbers such that $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$?"
Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:



We are given the equation $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$. First, we notice that $|x-2y| = |-(2x-y)| = |2x-y|$ and $|y-2x| = |-(2y-x)| = |2y-x|$. So the equation becomes $|2x-y| + |2y-x| = 40$.

Now, let's consider the expression $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$. We can rewrite it as $5(x^2+y^2) - 8xy = 5[(x-y)^2 + 2xy] - 8xy$.

By the AM-GM inequality, we know that $2xy \geq - (x-y)^2$. So, $5[(x-y)^2 + 2xy] - 8xy \geq 5[(x-y)^2 - (x-y)^2] - 8xy = -8xy$.

Now, let's consider the expression $-8xy$. We know that $|2x-y| + |2y-x| = 40$ implies that $2x-y$ and $2y-x$ have the same absolute value, because if they didn't, we could decrease the sum by moving a small amount of quantity from one to the other, which would contradict the equation.

Therefore, without loss of generality, we can assume that $2x-y = 2y-x$, which implies that $x = y$. Substituting $x = y$ into the equation $2x-y = 2y-x$, we get $x = y$.

So, the expression $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ is minimized when $x = y$. Substituting $x = y$ into the equation $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$, we get $|x-2x| + |x-2x| = 40$, which simplifies to $2|x-2x| = 40$. This implies that $|x-2x| = 20$, which simplifies to $|x| = 20$. Since $x$ can be positive or negative, the minimum value of $x^2$ is achieved when $x = 20$ or $x = -20$.

Substituting $x = 20$ into the equation $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$, we get $5(20^2) + 5y^2 - 8*20*y = 2000 + 5y^2 - 160y$. Taking the derivative with respect to $y$ and setting it to zero, we get $10y - 160 = 0$, which implies that $y = 16$. Substituting $x = 20$ and $y = 16$ into the expression $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$, we get $5(20^2) + 5(16^2) - 8*20*16 = 2000 + 1280 - 2560 = 720$.

Similarly, substituting $x = -20$ into the equation $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$, we get $5(-20^2) + 5y^2 + 8*20*y = -2000 + 5y^2 + 160y$. Taking the derivative with respect to $y$ and setting it to zero, we get $10y + 160 = 0$, which implies that $y = -16$. Substituting $x = -20$ and $y = -16$ into the expression $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$, we also get $720$.

Therefore, the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ is $720$. The answer is: $720$.

Question (hint: positive numerical answer):
"What is the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ when $x$ and $y$ range over all real numbers such that $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$?"
Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:


First, we rewrite the expression $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ as $\frac{1}{2}((5x-4y)^2+(4y-5x)^2)$.
Then, we notice that $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = |x-2y| + |2y-x| = |(x-2y) - (2y-x)| = 2|x-2y|$.
Given that $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$, we have $2|x-2y| = 40$, so $|x-2y| = 20$.
This implies that $x-2y = 20$ or $x-2y = -20$.
If $x-2y = 20$, then $y = \frac{x-20}{2}$.
Substitute this into the expression $\frac{1}{2}((5x-4y)^2+(4y-5x)^2)$, we get
\[\frac{1}{2}((5x-4\cdot \frac{x-20}{2})^2 + (4\cdot \frac{x-20}{2} - 5x)^2) = \frac{1}{2}((5x-2(x-20))^2 + (2(x-20)-5x)^2) = \frac{1}{2}((5x-2x+40)^2 + (2x-40-5x)^2) = \frac{1}{2}((3x+40)^2 + (-3x-40)^2).\]
This expression is minimized when $x = -\frac{40}{3}$, and the minimum value is $\frac{1}{2}((3\cdot -\frac{40}{3} + 40)^2 + (-3\cdot -\frac{40}{3} - 40)^2) = \frac{1}{2}(0^2 + 0^2) = 0$.
If $x-2y = -20$, we can similarly show that the minimum value is also 0.
Therefore, the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ is 0. The answer is: $0$

"What is the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ when $x$ and $y$ range over all real numbers such that $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$?"
Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:



First, let's simplify the equation $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$.

Since $|a| = |-a|$ for all $a$, we can rewrite the equation as $|x-2y| + |-y+2x| = 40$.

Now, let's use the property $|a+b| \leq |a| + |b|$ to expand the absolute values:

$|x-2y| + |-y+2x| = |x-2y| + |2x-y| = 40$.

We can use the property $|a-b|^2 = (a-b)^2$ to expand the squares:

$(x-2y)^2 + (2x-y)^2 = 40^2$.

Expanding the squares gives:

$x^2 - 4xy + 4y^2 + 4x^2 - 4xy + y^2 = 1600$.

Combining like terms gives:

$5x^2 + 5y^2 - 8xy = 1600$.

So, the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ is actually 0 when $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$.

Therefore, the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ is 0. The answer is: $0$

Question (hint: positive numerical answer):
"What is the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ when $x$ and $y$ range over all real numbers such that $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$?"
Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:


We first consider the equation $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$.
By the triangle inequality, we know that $|a| + |b| \geq |a+b|$ for all real numbers $a$ and $b$. So we have
\[|x-2y| + |y-2x| \geq |(x-2y) + (y-2x)| = |-x-y| = |-(x+y)| = |x+y|.\]
Therefore, $|x+y| = 40$.

Now, let $A = x+y$ and $B = x-2y$. Then we have $y = \frac{A-B}{3}$ and $x = \frac{2A+B}{3}$. Substituting these into the expression $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$, we get
\begin{align*}
5x^2+5y^2-8xy &= 5\left(\frac{2A+B}{3}\right)^2 + 5\left(\frac{A-B}{3}\right)^2 - 8\left(\frac{2A+B}{3}\right)\left(\frac{A-B}{3}\right) \\
&= \frac{5}{9}\left(4A^2 + B^2 + 4AB + A^2 + B^2 - 2AB\right) \\
&= \frac{5}{9}\left(5A^2 + 3B^2 + 2AB\right) \\
&= \frac{5}{9}\left(5(A^2 + 2AB + B^2) - 2AB\right) \\
&= \frac{5}{9}\left(5(A+B)^2 - 2AB\right) \\
&= \frac{5}{9}\left(5(40^2) - 2AB\right).
\end{align*}
Since we want to minimize this expression, we need to maximize $AB$. By AM-GM inequality, we have
\[AB \leq \left(\frac{A+B}{2}\right)^2 = \left(\frac{40}{2}\right)^2 = 400.\]
Equality occurs when $A = B = 20$, so the maximum value of $AB$ is $400$.

Therefore, the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ is
\[\frac{5}{9}\left(5(40^2) - 2(400)\right) = \frac{5}{9}(8000 - 800) = \frac{5}{9}(7200) = 4000.\]
The minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ is $4000$. The answer is: $4000$

Question (hint: positive numerical answer):
"What is the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ when $x$ and $y$ range over all real numbers such that $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$?"
Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:


To find the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ under the condition $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$, we first need to understand the condition. The condition $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$ is equivalent to $|x-2y| = |2x-y|$, which implies that $x=2y$ or $y=2x$.

If $x=2y$, we substitute into the expression $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$, and get
\[5(2y)^2 + 5y^2 - 8(2y)(y) = 20y^2 + 5y^2 - 16y^2 = 9y^2.\]
If $y=2x$, we substitute into the expression $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$, and get
\[5x^2 + 5(2x)^2 - 8x(2x) = 5x^2 + 20x^2 - 16x^2 = 19x^2.\]

Since $9y^2$ and $19x^2$ are both non-negative, the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ is $0$, which occurs when $x=2y$ and $y=2x$ simultaneously.

To find when this happens, we set $x=2y$ and $y=2x$, and solve the system of equations:
\[x=2y \Rightarrow x=2(2x) \Rightarrow x=\frac{x}{2} \Rightarrow x=0.\]
Then $y=2x=2*0=0$.

So the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ under the given condition is $0$. The answer is: $0$
