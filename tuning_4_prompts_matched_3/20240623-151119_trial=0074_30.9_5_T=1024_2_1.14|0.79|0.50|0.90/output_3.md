Question (hint: positive numerical answer):
"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"
Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:



First, we observe that the product of two numbers is zero if and only if at least one of the numbers is zero. Therefore, we have two cases to consider:

Case 1: $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$.
This implies that $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$.
The only way this can happen is if $x = 0$ and $y = 0$.

Case 2: $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$.
This implies that $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$.
The only way this can happen is if $-8 \leq x \leq 8$ and $-8 \leq y \leq 8$.

Therefore, the points that satisfy the given equation are the intersection of the conditions $x = 0$ and $y = 0$ and $-8 \leq x \leq 8$ and $-8 \leq y \leq 8$. The intersection is just the single point $(0, 0)$.

However, we are asked to find the area of the convex polygon that these points enclose. But the only point we found is $(0, 0)$, which is not a polygon.

We must have made a mistake in our analysis. Let's reconsider our cases.

Case 1: $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$.
This implies that $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$.
The only way this can happen is if $x + y = \pm 10$ and $x - y = \pm 10$.
Solving these equations, we find that the points are $(5, 5)$, $(5, -5)$, $(-5, 5)$, and $(-5, -5)$.

Case 2: $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$.
This implies that $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$.
The only way this can happen is if $-8 \leq x \leq 8$ and $-8 \leq y \leq 8$.

Now, let's consider the intersection of these points. The points from Case 1 are the vertices of a square with side length 10, and the points from Case 2 are the points within this square.

Therefore, the points that satisfy the given equation enclose a square with side length 10, and the area of this square is $10^2 = 100$.
The answer is: $100$

Question (hint: positive numerical answer):
"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"
Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:


The product of two numbers is zero if and only if at least one of the numbers is zero. So, the equation $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ is satisfied if either $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$.

The equation $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ implies that $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. These two equations represent two lines in the plane, so they enclose a rectangle with side lengths $20$ and $20$, and thus area $400$.

The equation $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ implies that $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$. These two equations represent a square with side length $16$, and thus area $256$.

The area of the convex polygon is the sum of the areas of the two regions, so it is $400 + 256 = 656$. The answer is: $656$

"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"
Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:



The expression equals to zero if and only if at least one of the factors equals to zero.
The factors are $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)$ and $((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2)$.
The first factor equals to zero if and only if $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$.
These are the equations of two squares with side length 10, centered at the origin, one with its sides parallel to the x-axis and the other with its sides parallel to the y-axis.
The second factor equals to zero if and only if $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$.
These are the equations of two squares with side length 16, centered at the origin, one with its sides parallel to the x-axis and the other with its sides parallel to the y-axis.
The intersection of the two squares is a square with side length 8, centered at the origin.
The area of this square is $8^2 = 64$.
So, the area of the convex polygon is 64 square units. The answer is: $64$

"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"
Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:


The product of two numbers is zero if and only if at least one of the numbers is zero. So, the equation $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ is satisfied if either $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$.
If $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$, then $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. This means that $x + y = \pm 10$ and $x - y = \pm 10$. Solving these equations gives us four lines: $x + y = 10$, $x + y = -10$, $x - y = 10$, and $x - y = -10$. These lines form a square with side length $20$.
If $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$, then $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$. This means that $x = \pm 8$ and $y = \pm 8$. These lines form a square with side length $16$.
Therefore, the points $\left(x, y\right)$ that satisfy the equation form the union of two squares: one with side length $20$ and another with side length $16$.
The area of a square is given by the square of the length of its side. So, the area of the larger square is $20^2 = 400$ and the area of the smaller square is $16^2 = 256$. Adding these two areas gives us the total area of the convex polygon: $400 + 256 = 656$.
The answer is: 656

Question (hint: positive numerical answer):
"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"
Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:



The expression $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ is equal to zero if and only if either $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$, $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$, $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$, or $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$.

Each of these equations implies that either $\vert x + y \vert = 10$, $\vert x - y \vert = 10$, $\vert x \vert = 8$, or $\vert y \vert = 8$.

The solutions to $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ are the lines $x + y = 10$ and $x + y = -10$.

The solutions to $\vert x - y \vert = 10$ are the lines $x - y = 10$ and $x - y = -10$.

The solutions to $\vert x \vert = 8$ are the lines $x = 8$ and $x = -8$.

The solutions to $\vert y \vert = 8$ are the lines $y = 8$ and $y = -8$.

These lines form a square with side length 16.

Therefore, the area of the convex polygon is $16^2 = 256$. The answer is: $256$

"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"
Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:


The expression $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2)$ is equal to zero if and only if both factors are equal to zero.
For the first factor to be zero, we must have $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$.
These equations represent a square with side length 10, centered at the origin.
For the second factor to be zero, we must have $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$.
These equations represent a square with side length 16, centered at the origin.
The intersection of these two squares is the convex polygon whose area we are trying to find.
The side length of this polygon is the smaller of the two side lengths, which is 10.
Therefore, the area of the polygon is the square of the side length, or $10^2 = 100$. The answer is: $100$

"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"
Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:


The product of two numbers is zero if and only if at least one of the numbers is zero. Therefore, the equation $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ is satisfied if and only if either $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$.

If $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$, then both $\vert x + y \vert - 10 = 0$ and $\vert x - y \vert - 10 = 0$, which implies $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. This means that $x + y = \pm 10$ and $x - y = \pm 10$. Solving these equations, we get the lines $y = x \pm 10$.

If $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$, then both $\vert x \vert - 8 = 0$ and $\vert y \vert - 8 = 0$, which implies $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$. This means that $x = \pm 8$ and $y = \pm 8$. So we get the lines $x = \pm 8$ and $y = \pm 8$.

These lines form a square with side length $20$. The area of this square is $20^2 = 400$. So the area of the convex polygon is $\boxed{400}$. The answer is: $400$

Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:


The product of two numbers is zero if and only if at least one of the numbers is zero. So, the equation $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ is satisfied if either of the following two conditions is met:

1. $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$.
2. $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$.

For the first condition to be true, both $\vert x + y \vert - 10 = 0$ and $\vert x - y \vert - 10 = 0$, which means $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. This forms a square with side length 10, so the area of this square is $10^2 = 100$.

For the second condition to be true, both $\vert x \vert - 8 = 0$ and $\vert y \vert - 8 = 0$, which means $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$. This forms a square with side length 8, so the area of this square is $8^2 = 64$.

Therefore, the total area of the convex polygon is the sum of the areas of these two squares, which is $100 + 64 = 164$. The answer is: $164$.

Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:


The expression $A \cdot B = 0$ implies that at least one of the expressions $A$ or $B$ is zero. Therefore, the given equation is equivalent to either $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$.

The expression $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ is satisfied only when $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. This means that $x + y = \pm 10$ and $x - y = \pm 10$. Solving these equations gives us the vertices of the square: $(8, 2)$, $(8, -2)$, $(-8, -2)$, and $(-8, 2)$.

The expression $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ is satisfied only when $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$. This means that $x = \pm 8$ and $y = \pm 8$. Solving these equations gives us the vertices of the square: $(8, 8)$, $(8, -8)$, $(-8, -8)$, and $(-8, 8)$.

Therefore, the convex polygon formed by the points satisfying the given equation is a rectangle with side lengths $20$ and $16$. The area of this rectangle is $20 \cdot 16 = 320$. The answer is: $\boxed{320}$

Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:


The product of two numbers is zero if and only if at least one of the numbers is zero. Therefore, the equation
$$((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$$
is satisfied if and only if at least one of the following equations is satisfied:
$$(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$$
or
$$(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0.$$

If $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$, then $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. This means that $x + y = \pm 10$ and $x - y = \pm 10$. Solving these equations gives the vertices of the square: $(8, 2)$, $(8, -2)$, $(-8, 2)$, and $(-8, -2)$.

If $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$, then $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$. This means that $x = \pm 8$ and $y = \pm 8$. Solving these equations gives the vertices of the square: $(8, 8)$, $(8, -8)$, $(-8, 8)$, and $(-8, -8)$.

The union of these two squares is a 4x4 square with side length 8. The area of this square is $8^2 = 64$. Therefore, the area of the convex polygon is 64. The answer is: $64$

Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:


The equation $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + (\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + (\vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ implies that at least one of the factors must be zero. If either $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$, then $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ or $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. These are the equations of two squares with side length 10, one with vertices at $(10,0)$, $(0,10)$, $(-10,0)$, $(0,-10)$, and the other with vertices at $(0,10)$, $(10,0)$, $(0,-10)$, $(-10,0)$.

If either $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$, then $\vert x \vert = 8$ or $\vert y \vert = 8$. This means $x = 8$ or $x = -8$ and $y = 8$ or $y = -8$. This forms a square with side length 16 and vertices at $(8,8)$, $(8,-8)$, $(-8,8)$, $(-8,-8)$.

The intersection of these two squares forms a smaller square with side length 6 and vertices at $(4,4)$, $(4,-4)$, $(-4,4)$, $(-4,-4)$. The area of this square is $6^2 = 36$. The answer is: $36$

Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:


The product of two numbers is zero if and only if at least one of the numbers is zero. Therefore, the equation $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ is satisfied if either
\[(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0 \quad \text{or} \quad (\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0.\]
The equation $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ implies that $|x+y| = 10$ and $|x-y| = 10$. These are the equations of two lines passing through the origin at an angle of $45^\circ$ to the x-axis.
The equation $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ implies that $|x| = 8$ and $|y| = 8$. These are the equations of two circles of radius 8 centered at the origin.
The points that satisfy either of these equations are the intersections of these lines and circles. These intersections form a square with side length 16. Therefore, the area of the convex polygon is $16^2 = 256$. The answer is: $256$

The product of two numbers is zero if and only if at least one of the numbers is zero. This means that either $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2) = 0$ or $((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$.
If $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2) = 0$, then $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. This means that $x + y = \pm 10$ and $x - y = \pm 10$. Solving these equations gives us the vertices of the square $(5,5)$, $(5,-5)$, $(-5,-5)$, and $(-5,5)$.
If $((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$, then $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$. This means that $x = \pm 8$ and $y = \pm 8$. Solving these equations gives us the vertices of the square $(8,8)$, $(8,-8)$, $(-8,-8)$, and $(-8,8)$.
The union of these two squares is the convex polygon that is being described. The side length of each square is $10$, so the area of each square is $10^2 = 100$. Since there are two squares, the total area of the convex polygon is $2 \times 100 = 200$. The answer is: $200$

Question (hint: positive numerical answer):
"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"
Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:


The product of two numbers is zero if and only if at least one of the numbers is zero. So, the equation
\[((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0\]
implies that either $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$.

The equation $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ implies that $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$, which means that $x$ and $y$ are each 10 units away from their average $(x+y)/2$. This is the equation of a square with side length 20.

The equation $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ implies that $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$, which means that $x$ and $y$ are each 8 units away from the origin. This is the equation of a square with side length 16.

The intersection of these two squares is the convex polygon whose area we want to find. The side length of the smaller square is 16, so its area is $16^2 = 256$. The side length of the larger square is 20, so its area is $20^2 = 400$. Therefore, the area of the convex polygon is $400 - 256 = 144$. The answer is: $144$.

"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"
Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:


The product of two numbers is zero if and only if at least one of the numbers is zero. Therefore, the equation $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + (\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + (\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ must be true for any point $(x, y)$ on the boundary of the polygon.
The equation $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + (\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ implies that $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$, which means that $x + y = \pm 10$ and $x - y = \pm 10$. Solving these equations, we find that the vertices of the polygon are $(8, 2)$, $(8, -2)$, $(-8, 2)$, and $(-8, -2)$.
The equation $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + (\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ implies that $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$, which means that $x = \pm 8$ and $y = \pm 8$. Solving these equations, we find that the vertices of the polygon are also $(8, 8)$, $(-8, 8)$, $(-8, -8)$, and $(8, -8)$.
Therefore, the polygon is a square with side length 16. The area of this square is $16^2 = 256$. The answer is: $256$

"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"
Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:


The expression $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ is true if and only if at least one of the factors is zero. This means that either $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$.

For the first factor to be zero, we must have $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. This means that $x + y = \pm 10$ and $x - y = \pm 10$. Solving these equations gives us the vertices of the square: $(8, 2)$, $(8, -2)$, $(-8, 2)$, and $(-8, -2)$.

For the second factor to be zero, we must have $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$. This means that $x = \pm 8$ and $y = \pm 8$. Solving these equations gives us the vertices of the square: $(8, 8)$, $(8, -8)$, $(-8, 8)$, and $(-8, -8)$.

The union of these two squares is a single square with side length 16. The area of this square is $16^2 = 256$.
The answer is: $256$
