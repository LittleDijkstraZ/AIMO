 To solve this problem, we first need to analyze the given equation and understand what it means. The equation is a product of two terms, and it equals to zero. This means that either one of the terms must be zero. 

The two terms are: 
1. $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)$
2. $((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2)$

Setting each term to zero gives us the following equations:
1. $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ and $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$
2. $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ and $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$

From these equations, we get:
1. $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$
2. $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$

Solving these equations, we get the following points:
1. $(x, y)$ such that $x + y = \pm 10$ and $x - y = \pm 10$
2. $(x, y)$ such that $x = \pm 8$ and $y = \pm 8$

By solving these equations, we find that the points are:
1. $(5, 5)$, $(5, -5)$, $(-5, 5)$, $(-5, -5)$
2. $(8, 0)$, $(0, 8)$, $(-8, 0)$, $(0, -8)$

These points form a square with side length 10. The area of the square is $10^2 = 100$.

So, the area of the convex polygon is 100 square units.

The python code to calculate the area is:
```python


INTERMEDIATE OUT :

def polygon_area():
    """The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"""
    # The side length of the square
    side_length = 10

    # Calculate the area of the square
    area = side_length**2

    return area

result = polygon_area()
print(result)
```

CODE RESULTS 100

INTERMEDIATE OUT :
```output
100
```
The area of the convex polygon is $100$ square units.
The answer is: $\boxed{100}$

Assistant:

 The problem is asking for the area of a polygon enclosed by the points that satisfy the given equation. The equation is
\[((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0.\]
The only way for the product of two numbers to be zero is if at least one of the numbers is zero. Therefore, either
\[(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0,\]
or
\[(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0.\]
If the first equation is true, then $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$, which implies that $x + y = \pm 10$ and $x - y = \pm 10$. Solving these equations gives $x = y = \pm 5$.
If the second equation is true, then $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$, which implies that $x = \pm 8$ and $y = \pm 8$.
The points that satisfy either of these conditions form a square with side length 10. The area of this square is $10^2 = 100$.
Therefore, the area of the convex polygon is 100.

The answer is: $100$

Below is a math problem you are to solve (positive numerical answer!):
"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"
Analyze this problem and think step by step to come to a solution with programs. After solving the problem, output the final numerical answer within \boxed{}.

Assistant:

 The problem asks for the area of a polygon that is enclosed by points satisfying a certain equation. First, we need to understand the equation:
$$((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0.$$
This equation equals to zero if and only if at least one of the two factors equals to zero. That is,
$$((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2) = 0 \text{ or } ((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0.$$
From the first equation, we have $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. This means $x + y = \pm 10$ and $x - y = \pm 10$, which simplifies to $x = \pm 5$ and $y = \pm 5$. This gives us a square with side length 10.
From the second equation, we have $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$, which means $x = \pm 8$ and $y = \pm 8$. This gives us a square with side length 16.
The area of the polygon is the sum of the areas of these two squares. The area of a square with side length $a$ is $a^2$, so the area of the polygon is $10^2 + 16^2 = 100 + 256 = 356$.
The answer is: $356$

"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"

The expression $A \cdot B = 0$ implies that at least one of the factors $A$ or $B$ is zero. Therefore, the given equation is equivalent to two separate equations:

1. $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$
2. $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$

For the first equation to be zero, both $\vert x + y \vert - 10 = 0$ and $\vert x - y \vert - 10 = 0$, which implies $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. These conditions are satisfied only when $x = \pm 10$ and $y = \pm 10$.

For the second equation to be zero, both $\vert x \vert - 8 = 0$ and $\vert y \vert - 8 = 0$, which implies $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$. These conditions are satisfied only when $x = \pm 8$ and $y = \pm 8$.

Therefore, the points satisfying the original equation are $(\pm 10, \pm 10)$ and $(\pm 8, \pm 8)$. These points form a square with side length 20. The area of this square is $20^2 = 400$. So, the area of the convex polygon is 400 square units.

The answer is: $400$

Below is a math problem you are to solve (positive numerical answer!):
"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"
Analyze this problem and think step by step to come to a solution with programs. After solving the problem, output the final numerical answer within \boxed{}.

Assistant:

 To find the area of the convex polygon enclosed by the points, we first need to find the points that satisfy the equation. 

The equation $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + (\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + (\vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ is equal to zero if either of the two terms is zero. 

1. The first term is zero when $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ or $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. This gives us the lines $x + y = 10$, $x + y = -10$, $x - y = 10$, and $x - y = -10$.

2. The second term is zero when $\vert x \vert = 8$ or $\vert y \vert = 8$. This gives us the lines $x = 8$, $x = -8$, $y = 8$, and $y = -8$.

The intersection points of these lines are the vertices of the polygon. We can find these points by solving the systems of equations formed by the pairs of lines. There are 9 intersection points: $(8, 2)$, $(8, -2)$, $(-8, 2)$, $(-8, -2)$, $(2, 8)$, $(-2, 8)$, $(2, -8)$, $(-2, -8)$, and $(0, 0)$.

Now we can calculate the area of the polygon. The polygon is a square with side length 8, so its area is $8^2 = 64$. The answer is: $\boxed{64}$.

Assistant:

 The given equation is equal to 0, which means that either the first expression is 0, or the second expression is 0, or both are 0.
The first expression is 0 when $\vert x + y \vert - 10 = 0$ or $\vert x - y \vert - 10 = 0$, which implies $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ or $\vert x - y \vert = 10$.
The second expression is 0 when $\vert x \vert - 8 = 0$ or $\vert y \vert - 8 = 0$, which implies $\vert x \vert = 8$ or $\vert y \vert = 8$.
From $\vert x + y \vert = 10$, we have $x + y = 10$ or $x + y = -10$.
From $\vert x - y \vert = 10$, we have $x - y = 10$ or $x - y = -10$.
From $\vert x \vert = 8$, we have $x = 8$ or $x = -8$.
From $\vert y \vert = 8$, we have $y = 8$ or $y = -8$.
By combining all the possibilities, we find that the points that satisfy the equation are the vertices of a square with side length 10, centered at the origin.
The area of this square is $10^2 = 100$.
The answer is: $100$
