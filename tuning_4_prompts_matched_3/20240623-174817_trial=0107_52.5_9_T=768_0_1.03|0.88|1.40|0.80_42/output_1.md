Assistant:

 The problem is asking for the minimum value of the function $f(x, y) = 5x^2 + 5y^2 - 8xy$ under the condition $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$.

Firstly, let's consider the condition $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$. It can be rewritten as $|2x-y| + |2y-x| = 40$.

This condition represents a square with vertices at $(0, 20)$, $(20, 0)$, $(0, -20)$, and $(-20, 0)$. Therefore, the feasible region for $(x, y)$ is a square with side length $40$.

Now, let's analyze the function $f(x, y) = 5x^2 + 5y^2 - 8xy$. We can rewrite it as $f(x, y) = 5(x^2 + y^2) - 8xy = 5[(x-y)^2 + xy]$.

The minimum value of $f(x, y)$ occurs when $(x-y)^2$ is minimum and $xy$ is maximum. Since $(x-y)^2$ is always non-negative, the minimum value of $(x-y)^2$ is 0, which occurs when $x = y$.

For $xy$ to be maximum, $x$ and $y$ should be as close as possible within the feasible region. Since the feasible region is a square with side length $40$, and $x = y$, the maximum value of $xy$ occurs when $x = y = \pm 10$.

Therefore, the minimum value of $f(x, y)$ occurs when $x = y = 10$ or $x = y = -10$. Substituting $x = y = 10$ into $f(x, y)$, we get $f(10, 10) = 5(10^2 + 10^2) - 8*10*10 = 5(100 + 100) - 800 = 1000 - 800 = 200$.

Similarly, substituting $x = y = -10$ into $f(x, y)$, we get $f(-10, -10) = 5(-10^2 + (-10)^2) - 8*(-10)*(-10) = 5(100 + 100) - 800 = 1000 - 800 = 200$.

So, the minimum value of $f(x, y)$ is $200$.

Assistant:

 The given expression $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ can be rewritten as $5(x^2 - \frac{8}{5}xy + y^2) = 5((x - \frac{4}{5}y)^2 + \frac{1}{5}y^2)$.
Let $u = x - \frac{4}{5}y$ and $v = y$. Then the expression becomes $5(u^2 + \frac{1}{5}v^2)$, which is always non-negative.
The equation $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$ can be rewritten as $|u - \frac{2}{5}v| + |\frac{2}{5}v - u| = 40$.
By the triangle inequality, we know that $|a| + |b| \geq |a + b|$, so $|u - \frac{2}{5}v| + |\frac{2}{5}v - u| \geq |(u - \frac{2}{5}v) + (\frac{2}{5}v - u)| = 0$.
Thus, the equation $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$ has a solution only when both sides are equal, which gives $u = 0$ and $v = \pm 10$.
Therefore, the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ occurs when $x = \frac{4}{5}y$, or equivalently, $u = 0$, and $y = \pm 10$. Substituting $y = 10$ into the equation gives $x = \frac{4}{5} \cdot 10 = 8$, and substituting $y = -10$ gives $x = \frac{4}{5} \cdot -10 = -8$.
So the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ is achieved when $x = 8$ and $y = 10$, or when $x = -8$ and $y = -10$.
Substituting these values into the expression gives $5(8^2) + 5(10^2) - 8(8)(10) = 320$ and $5(-8^2) + 5(-10^2) - 8(-8)(-10) = 320$. Both give the same result, so the minimum value of the expression is 320.
The answer is: $320$

This problem is a bit tricky to solve directly with Python, as it involves understanding the properties of the absolute value function and quadratic expressions. However, we can simplify the problem by recognizing that the expression $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ can be written as $5(x-y)^2$. 

Now, let's analyze the constraint equation $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$. We can rewrite it as $|x-2y| + |2y-x| = 40$, which simplifies to $|x-2y| + |-1*(x-2y)| = 40$. This is equivalent to $2*|x-2y| = 40$, so $|x-2y| = 20$.

This equation implies that $x-2y = 20$ or $x-2y = -20$. We can consider these two cases separately.

Case 1: $x-2y = 20$. From this equation, we can express $x$ in terms of $y$: $x = 2y + 20$. Substituting this into the expression $5(x-y)^2$, we get $5((2y+20)-y)^2 = 5(y+20)^2$.

Case 2: $x-2y = -20$. Similarly, we can express $x$ in terms of $y$: $x = 2y - 20$. Substituting this into the expression $5(x-y)^2$, we get $5((2y-20)-y)^2 = 5(y-20)^2$.

Now, we can compare the two expressions $5(y+20)^2$ and $5(y-20)^2$. The minimum value of these two expressions will be achieved when $y$ equals the value that makes the derivative of each expression with respect to $y$ equal to zero. 

The derivative of $5(y+20)^2$ with respect to $y$ is $10(y+20)$, and setting this equal to zero gives $y = -20$. The derivative of $5(y-20)^2$ with respect to $y$ is $10(y-20)$, and setting this equal to zero gives $y = 20$. 

Comparing the values of the expressions at these points, we find that $5(-20+20)^2 = 0$ and $5(20-20)^2 = 0$. Therefore, the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ under the constraint is 0.

However, this minimum value is achieved when $x = 2y \pm 20$ and $y = \pm 20$. From the constraint equation, we can verify that this is a valid solution. Therefore, the minimum value of the expression $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ is 0.

The numerical answer is: $0$.

Assistant:

 To solve this problem, we can use the method of completing the square and the inequality $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$.
First, let's rewrite the expression $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ as $(x-y)^2 + 4(x+y)^2 - 16xy$.

Now, let's consider the inequality $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$. By the triangle inequality, we have $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = |(x-2y) - (y-2x)| = |x-2y - y+2x| = |3x-3y| = 3|x-y| = 40$, so $|x-y| = \frac{40}{3}$.

Next, we can use the inequality $|x-y| = \frac{40}{3}$ to find a relationship between $x$ and $y$. Since $|x-y| = \frac{40}{3}$, we have $x-y = \pm \frac{40}{3}$. Without loss of generality, let's consider the case $x-y = \frac{40}{3}$. Then $y = x - \frac{40}{3}$.

Now, substitute $y = x - \frac{40}{3}$ into the expression $(x-y)^2 + 4(x+y)^2 - 16xy$, we get
\[
\left(x - \left(x - \frac{40}{3}\right)\right)^2 + 4\left(x + \left(x - \frac{40}{3}\right)\right)^2 - 16x\left(x - \frac{40}{3}\right) = \left(\frac{40}{3}\right)^2 + 4\left(2x - \frac{40}{3}\right)^2 - 16x\left(x - \frac{40}{3}\right).
\]
Let $f(x) = \left(\frac{40}{3}\right)^2 + 4\left(2x - \frac{40}{3}\right)^2 - 16x\left(x - \frac{40}{3}\right)$. To find the minimum of $f(x)$, we can find its derivative and set it to zero. The derivative of $f(x)$ is
\[
f'(x) = 16\left(2x - \frac{40}{3}\right) - 32\left(x - \frac{40}{3}\right) = 0.
\]
Solving this equation, we get $x = \frac{40}{3}$. Substituting $x = \frac{40}{3}$ back into $y = x - \frac{40}{3}$, we get $y = 0$.

Finally, substituting $x = \frac{40}{3}$ and $y = 0$ back into the expression $(x-y)^2 + 4(x+y)^2 - 16xy$, we get
\[
\left(\frac{40}{3}\right)^2 + 4\left(\frac{40}{3}\right)^2 - 16\cdot\frac{40}{3}\cdot 0 = \frac{1600}{9} + \frac{1600}{9} = \frac{3200}{9}.
\]
Therefore, the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ is $\frac{3200}{9}$. The answer is: $\boxed{\frac{3200}{9}}$

 The minimum value of the expression $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ subject to the constraint $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$ can be found by using the method of Lagrange multipliers. The constraint equation can be rewritten as $|2x-y| + |2y-x| = 40$, which simplifies to $3|x-y| = 40$. Dividing by 3 gives $|x-y| = \frac{40}{3}$.
Now, let's define a new variable $z = x - y$, so the constraint equation becomes $|z| = \frac{40}{3}$. This implies that $z = \pm \frac{40}{3}$. 
We substitute $z = x - y$ back into the expression $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ to get $5(x^2+y^2) - 8xy = 5(x^2+y^2-2xy) = 5((x-y)^2) = 5z^2$.
Since $z = \pm \frac{40}{3}$, we substitute this into the expression $5z^2$ to get $5\left(\frac{40}{3}\right)^2 = \frac{8000}{9}$.
Therefore, the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ subject to the constraint is $\frac{8000}{9}$. The answer is: $\frac{8000}{9}$

 To solve this problem, we can use the method of Lagrange multipliers. First, we define the function $F(x, y, \lambda) = 5x^2 + 5y^2 - 8xy + \lambda (|x - 2y| + |y - 2x - 40)$. 

Now we need to find the gradient of $F(x, y, \lambda)$ and set it equal to zero:

$\frac{\partial F}{\partial x} = 10x - 8y + \lambda(-1) \cdot \text{sgn}(x - 2y) - \lambda \cdot \text{sgn}(y - 2x) = 0$,

$\frac{\partial F}{\partial y} = 10y - 8x + \lambda \cdot \text{sgn}(x - 2y) \cdot 2 - \lambda \cdot \text{sgn}(y - 2x) \cdot 2 = 0$,

$\frac{\partial F}{\partial \lambda} = |x - 2y| + |y - 2x - 40 = 0$.

We can solve this system of equations numerically. After solving the system, we can substitute the values of $x$ and $y$ into the expression $5x^2 + 5y^2 - 8xy$ to find the minimum value.

Apologies for the confusion, the `sympy` library is not able to handle the `sign()` function directly. However, we can solve this problem using calculus, specifically the method of Lagrange multipliers. 

Let's go back to the original problem: we want to minimize the function $f(x, y) = 5x^2 + 5y^2 - 8xy$ subject to the constraint $g(x, y) = |x - 2y| + |y - 2x| - 40 = 0$. 

Using the method of Lagrange multipliers, we form the Lagrangian function:
\[
L(x, y, \lambda) = 5x^2 + 5y^2 - 8xy + \lambda(|x - 2y| + |y - 2x| - 40).
\]

Now we need to find the gradient of $L(x, y, \lambda)$ and set it equal to zero:

$\frac{\partial L}{\partial x} = 10x - 8y + \lambda(-1) \cdot \text{sgn}(x - 2y) - \lambda \cdot \text{sgn}(y - 2x) = 0$,

$\frac{\partial L}{\partial y} = 10y - 8x + \lambda \cdot \text{sgn}(x - 2y) \cdot 2 - \lambda \cdot \text{sgn}(y - 2x) \cdot 2 = 0$,

$\frac{\partial L}{\partial \lambda} = |x - 2y| + |y - 2x| - 40 = 0$.

We can solve this system of equations numerically. After solving the system, we can substitute the values of $x$ and $y$ into the expression $5x^2 + 5y^2 - 8xy$ to find the minimum value.

"What is the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ when $x$ and $y$ range over all real numbers such that $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$?"
Analyze this problem and think step by step to come to a solution with programs. After solving the problem, output the final numerical answer within \boxed{}.

Assistant:

 The given equation $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$ can be rewritten as $|x-2y| + |2y-x| = 40$ using the property $|a| = |-a|$. Now we can use the property of absolute value $|a| + |b| \geq |a+b|$ to simplify the equation to $|(x-2y) + (2y-x)| = 40$, which simplifies to $|0| = 40$, which is obviously not possible. This means that our original equation is incorrect. The correct equation should be $|x-2y| + |2y-x| = 40$, and we can use the property of absolute value $|a| + |b| = |a+b|$ to simplify the equation to $|(x-2y) + (2y-x)| = 40$, which simplifies to $|0| = 40$, which is obviously not possible. Therefore, we made a mistake in the transformation of the equation. The correct transformation should be $|x-2y| + |-y+2x| = 40$, and we can use the property of absolute value $|a| + |b| = |a+b|$ to simplify the equation to $|(x-2y) + (-y+2x)| = 40$, which simplifies to $|x-3y+x| = 40$, and further simplifies to $|2x-3y| = 40$.
Now we have $|2x-3y| = 40$, which means $2x-3y = 40$ or $2x-3y = -40$. We can solve these two equations separately. For the first equation $2x-3y = 40$, we can express $y$ in terms of $x$ as $y = \frac{2x-40}{3}$. Substituting this into the expression $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$, we get $5x^2 + 5\left(\frac{2x-40}{3}\right)^2 - 8x\left(\frac{2x-40}{3}\right)$. Simplifying this expression, we get a complicated expression involving $x$. To find the minimum value, we can take the derivative of this expression with respect to $x$ and set it equal to zero. This gives us a complicated equation to solve, but after solving it, we find that the minimum value occurs at $x = \frac{20}{3}$. Substituting this value of $x$ back into the equation $y = \frac{2x-40}{3}$, we find that the corresponding value of $y$ is $-\frac{20}{3}$. Substituting these values of $x$ and $y$ into the expression $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$, we get the minimum value.

Here is a Python code to calculate the minimum value:

Assistant:

 To solve this problem, we first notice that the given equation $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$ can be rewritten as $|2y-x| + |2x-y| = 40$, which is symmetric in $x$ and $y$. This means that the minimum value of the function $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ will occur when $x=y$.

Let $z=x=y$. Then the equation $|2z-z| + |2z-z| = 40$ simplifies to $|z| + |z| = 40$, which implies $|z| = 20$. Thus $z = \pm 20$.

Now we substitute $x=y=z$ into the function $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$, which becomes $10x^2 - 8x^2 = 2x^2$. Since $x = \pm 20$, the minimum value of $2x^2$ is $2(20)^2 = 800$, and the maximum value is $2(-20)^2 = 800$. Therefore, the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ is $800$. The answer is: $800$

 To solve this problem, we can use the method of completing the square.

First, let's rewrite the expression $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ as $(x-2y)^2 + (y-2x)^2$.
Now, let $a = x - 2y$ and $b = y - 2x$. Then, the condition $|a| + |b| = 40$ is equivalent to $|a| + |-2a| = 40$ or $|b| + |-2b| = 40$. This simplifies to $|a| + 2|a| = 40$ or $|b| + 2|b| = 40$, which further simplifies to $3|a| = 40$ or $3|b| = 40$. Solving these equations gives $|a| = \frac{40}{3}$ or $|b| = \frac{40}{3}$.

Since $a = x - 2y$ and $b = y - 2x$, we have $|x - 2y| = \frac{40}{3}$ and $|y - 2x| = \frac{40}{3}$. Squaring these equations, we get $(x - 2y)^2 = \left(\frac{40}{3}\right)^2$ and $(y - 2x)^2 = \left(\frac{40}{3}\right)^2$. Adding these equations, we get $(x - 2y)^2 + (y - 2x)^2 = 2\left(\frac{40}{3}\right)^2$.

Therefore, the expression $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ is equal to $(x-2y)^2 + (y-2x)^2 = 2\left(\frac{40}{3}\right)^2$. Simplifying this gives $2\left(\frac{1600}{9}\right) = \frac{3200}{9}$.

So, the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ is $\frac{3200}{9}$.
The answer is: $\frac{3200}{9}$

Below is a math problem you are to solve (positive numerical answer!):
"What is the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ when $x$ and $y$ range over all real numbers such that $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$?"
Analyze this problem and think step by step to come to a solution with programs. After solving the problem, output the final numerical answer within \boxed{}.

Assistant:

 The given equation $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$ is equivalent to $|x-2y| + |2y-x| = 40$. Since $|a| = |-a|$, the equation simplifies to $2|x-2y| = 40$. Dividing both sides by 2 gives $|x-2y| = 20$. The absolute value equation breaks down into two cases:
Case 1: $x - 2y = 20$.
Case 2: $x - 2y = -20$.
Now we solve each case separately:

For Case 1: $x - 2y = 20$, we can express $x$ as $x = 2y + 20$. Substitute this into the expression $5x^2 + 5y^2 - 8xy$:
\begin{align*}
5(2y + 20)^2 + 5y^2 - 8(2y + 20)y &= 5(4y^2 + 80y + 400) + 5y^2 - 16y^2 - 160y \\
&= 20y^2 + 400y + 2000 + 5y^2 - 16y^2 - 160y \\
&= -y^2 + 240y + 2000.
\end{align*}
For Case 2: $x - 2y = -20$, we can express $x$ as $x = 2y - 20$. Substitute this into the expression $5x^2 + 5y^2 - 8xy$:
\begin{align*}
5(2y - 20)^2 + 5y^2 - 8(2y - 20)y &= 5(4y^2 - 80y + 400) + 5y^2 - 16y^2 + 160y \\
&= 20y^2 - 400y + 2000 + 5y^2 - 16y^2 + 160y \\
&= -y^2 - 240y + 2000.
\end{align*}

We now have two expressions: $-y^2 + 240y + 2000$ and $-y^2 - 240y + 2000$. To find the minimum value, we can take the derivative of each expression and set it to zero.

For the first expression, the derivative is $-2y + 240 = 0$, which gives $y = 120$. Substitute $y = 120$ into the expression to get $-120^2 + 240 \cdot 120 + 2000 = -14400 + 28800 + 2000 = 14400 + 2000 = 16400$.

For the second expression, the derivative is $-2y - 240 = 0$, which gives $y = -120$. Substitute $y = -120$ into the expression to get $-(-120)^2 - 240 \cdot (-120) + 2000 = -14400 + 28800 + 2000 = 14400 + 2000 = 16400$.

Therefore, the minimum value of $5x^2 + 5y^2 - 8xy$ is $16400$.
The answer is: $16400$

Below is a math problem you are to solve (positive numerical answer!):
"What is the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ when $x$ and $y$ range over all real numbers such that $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$?"
Analyze this problem and think step by step to come to a solution with programs. After solving the problem, output the final numerical answer within \boxed{}.

Assistant:

 The given expression is $5x^2 + 5y^2 - 8xy$. We can rewrite this as $(5x^2 - 8xy + 5y^2)$, which is equal to $(5x^2 - 10xy + 5y^2) + 2xy$. This can be further rewritten as $(5(x - y)^2) + 2xy$.

Now let's look at the constraint equation $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$. We can rewrite this as $|x-2y| + |2y-x| = 40$. The absolute value of a difference is always nonnegative, so we have $|x-2y| = |2y-x|$. This implies that $x-2y = 2y-x$, which simplifies to $x=2y$.

Substituting $x=2y$ into the expression $(5(x - y)^2) + 2xy$, we get $(5(2y - y)^2) + 2(2y)(y) = (5y^2) + 4y^2 = 9y^2$.

To minimize this expression, we need to minimize $y^2$ since the coefficient is positive. The minimum value of $y^2$ is 0, which occurs when $y = 0$. Substituting $y = 0$ into $x = 2y$, we get $x = 0$.

So the minimum value of the expression $5x^2 + 5y^2 - 8xy$ subject to the constraint $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$ is $9(0)^2 = 0$. The answer is: $0$

 To solve this problem, we can use the Cauchy-Schwarz inequality. The given condition is $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$, which can be rewritten as $|x-2y| + |2y-x| = 40$. By the triangle inequality, $|a| + |b| \geq |a+b|$, so we have $|x-2y| + |2y-x| \geq |(x-2y) + (2y-x)| = |0| = 0$. The equality holds if and only if $(x-2y)(2y-x) \geq 0$. Simplifying this gives $3x^2 - 4xy + 3y^2 \geq 0$, or $(3x-2y)^2 + (x-y)^2 \geq 0$. This is always true, so the equality condition $(x-2y)(2y-x) \geq 0$ must hold. This gives us the equation $3x^2 - 4xy + 3y^2 = 0$, or $(3x-2y)^2 + (x-y)^2 = 0$. The only way this can happen is if $3x-2y = 0$ and $x-y = 0$, which implies $x=y$. Substituting $x=y$ into the given condition $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$ gives $|x-2x| + |x-2x| = 40$, or $|-x| + |-x| = 40$. This simplifies to $2|-x| = 40$, or $|-x| = 20$, which implies $x = \pm 20$.
Now, we substitute $x=y$ into the expression $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ to get $5x^2+5x^2-8x^2 = 2x^2$. Since $x = \pm 20$, the minimum value of $2x^2$ is achieved when $x = -20$, and it is equal to $2(-20)^2 = 800$. So, the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ is 800. The answer is: $800$.

Analyze this problem and think step by step to come to a solution with programs. After solving the problem, output the final numerical answer within \boxed{}.

Assistant:

 To solve this problem, we can first simplify the expression $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ using the identity $a^2 + b^2 - 2ab = (a - b)^2$. Here, $a = x - 4y$ and $b = y - 4x$. So,
\[5x^2+5y^2-8xy = 5(x - 4y)^2 + 5(y - 4x)^2.\]
Now, we can use the condition $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$. This can be rewritten as $|x - 4y| + |y - 4x| = 40$.

This condition tells us that the difference between $x$ and $4y$, and the difference between $y$ and $4x$, is always $40$. Thus, $x - 4y = y - 4x = 20$, or $x - 4y = y - 4x = -20$.

However, since $x - 4y$ and $y - 4x$ are both squared in the expression $5(x - 4y)^2 + 5(y - 4x)^2$, we only need to consider the case $x - 4y = y - 4x = 20$ (or the case $x - 4y = y - 4x = -20$ will give us the same minimum value).

So we have $x - 4y = 20$ and $y - 4x = 20$. Solving this system of equations gives $x = 10$ and $y = 5$.

Substituting these values into $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$, we get
\[5(10)^2+5(5)^2-8(10)(5) = 500 + 125 - 400 = 325.\]
So the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ under the given condition is $325$. The answer is: $325$

Assistant:

 To solve this problem, we can use the fact that $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$ implies that $x=2y$ or $y=2x$. We can then substitute these into the expression $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ to find its minimum value.

If $x=2y$, we substitute into the expression to get:
$$5(2y)^2 + 5y^2 - 8(2y)y = 20y^2 + 5y^2 - 16y^2 = 9y^2.$$

If $y=2x$, we substitute into the expression to get:
$$5x^2 + 5(2x)^2 - 8x(2x) = 5x^2 + 20x^2 - 16x^2 = 19x^2.$$

Now we need to find the minimum value of $9y^2$ and $19x^2$. Since both expressions are non-negative, their minimum value is 0. However, this would only happen if $x=y=0$, but this does not satisfy the condition $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$. 

By trying different values of $x$ and $y$ that satisfy the condition, we find that the minimum value occurs when $x=4$ and $y=2$. Substituting these values into the expression $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$, we get:
$$5(4)^2 + 5(2)^2 - 8(4)(2) = 80 + 20 - 64 = 36.$$
So the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ is 36.
The answer is: $36$

Analyze this problem and think step by step to come to a solution with programs. After solving the problem, output the final numerical answer within \boxed{}.

Assistant:

 To solve this problem, we first notice that the given equation $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$ can be rewritten as $|x-2y| + |2y-x| = 40$, which simplifies to $|x-2y| + |x-2y| = 40$, or $2|x-2y| = 40$. This further simplifies to $|x-2y| = 20$.

Next, we substitute $u = x - 2y$ and $v = 2x - y$ into the expression $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$. After simplification, we get
\[5(x^2 + y^2) - 8xy = 5\left(\frac{u^2 + v^2}{5}\right) + 4uv = u^2 + v^2 + 4uv = (u + 2v)^2 - 4v^2.\]

Since $|u| = 20$, we have $u^2 = 400$, and $|v| \leq \frac{u}{2} = 10$ (by the Triangle Inequality), so $v^2 \leq 100$. Thus, $(u + 2v)^2 - 4v^2 \geq 400 + 400 - 400 = 400$.

Therefore, the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ is 400. The answer is: $400$

 To solve this problem, we can use the method of completing the square.
First, let's rewrite the given equation as $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$.
By the triangular inequality, we have $|x-2y| + |y-2x| \geq |(x-2y) - (y-2x)| = |x-2y-y+2x| = |x-3y+2x| = |3x-3y| = 3|x-y| = 40$.
Therefore, we have $|x-y| = \frac{40}{3}$.
Now, let's rewrite the expression $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ as $\frac{1}{2}(10x^2+10y^2-16xy) = \frac{1}{2}[(5x^2-8xy+4y^2) + (5y^2-8xy+4x^2)] = \frac{1}{2}[(5(x-y)^2 + 4(x-y)^2)] = \frac{9}{2}(x-y)^2$.
Substituting $|x-y| = \frac{40}{3}$, we get $\frac{9}{2} \left(\frac{40}{3}\right)^2 = \frac{9}{2} \cdot \frac{1600}{9} = 800$.
Therefore, the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ is 800.
