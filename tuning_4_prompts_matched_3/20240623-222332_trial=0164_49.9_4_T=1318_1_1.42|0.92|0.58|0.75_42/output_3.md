- Outline the steps using sympy to solve the problem:
  * Identify the sympy functions required for each step.
  * Implement these functions step-by-step, commenting each line for clarity.
- Calculate the final answer and verify it's a positive integer.
- Output the result within \boxed{}.

Interesting, let's analyze step by step:



Let's denote:
f(x, y) = (|x + y| - 10)^2 + (|x - y| - 10)^2
g(x, y) = (|x| - 8)^2 + (|y| - 8)^2

The original problem states that f(x, y) * g(x, y) = 0. 
In mathematics, for a product of two numbers to be zero, at least one of the numbers must be zero. 
This translates to either f(x, y) = 0 or g(x, y) = 0.

Now, let's analyze each separately:

1) For f(x, y) = 0:
(|x + y| - 10)^2 = 0 => |x + y| = 10
(|x - y| - 10)^2 = 0 => |x - y| = 10

2) For g(x, y) = 0:
(|x| - 8)^2 = 0 => |x| = 8
(|y| - 8)^2 = 0 => |y| = 8

This means the points (x, y) that satisfy the original equation are on a square with side length of 16 units (from -8 to 8 on both x and y axes).

Therefore, the area of the polygon is simply the area of this square. 

In python, calculating the area is straightforward:

```python


INTERMEDIATE OUT :

def polygon_area():
    side_length = 16
    area = side_length ** 2
    return area

result = polygon_area()
print(result)
```

CODE RESULTS 256

INTERMEDIATE OUT :
```output
256
```
The area of the polygon is 256 square units. Since 256 is a positive integer, our solution is correct. The answer is $\boxed{256}$.

1. The given problem equates a product of two factors to zero, so either the first factor or the second factor must be zero.
2. Hence the points that are solutions of the problem are either the set of points that satisfy $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ or the set of points that satisfy $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$.
3. The set of points that satisfy $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ form a square of side length $20$, centered at the origin $(0,0)$ with vertices at $(\pm10, \pm10)$.
4. The set of points that satisfy $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ form a square of side length $16$, centered at the origin $(0,0)$ with vertices at $(\pm8, \pm8)$.
5. The convex polygon that encloses all such points is the union of these two squares.
6. The area of the union of two squares with side lengths $a$ and $b$ (where $a$ and $b$ are not equal) is the sum of the areas of the two squares, since they do not overlap. Therefore, the area of the convex polygon is $10^2 + 8^2 = 100 + 64 = 164$. This is a positive integer, as required.

Therefore, the area of the convex polygon is $164$. The answer is: $\boxed{164}$

Interesting, let's analyze step by step:



From the equation, we can see that $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + (\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + (\vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$.
For this product to be zero, either $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + (\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + (\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$.
In both cases, the only possibility for these sums to be zero is that each term individually becomes zero. In other words, $\vert x + y \vert - 10 = 0$, $\vert x - y \vert - 10 = 0$, $\vert x \vert - 8 = 0$, and $\vert y \vert - 8 = 0$.
Solving these equations, we get the points that make up the polygon: (8,8), (8,-8), (-8,8) and (-8,-8).
This polygon is actually a square with side length 16, so its area is $16*16 = 256$.

So, the area of the convex polygon is 256.

Therefore, the answer is: $256$

Interesting, let's analyze step by step:



The equation $f(x,y) = (\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ implies that the points in the plane that make f(x,y) = 0 are precisely those that lie on the vertices of our polygon. Thus these points are exactly the points in the polygon, and hence the entire polygon is enclosed by these points. It follows that the area of the polygon is 0 if the polygon degenerates into a single point or is a polygon of area 0, e.g., a line segment. In the first case we find that either $|x+y|=10$ and $|x-y|=10$ or $|x|=8$ and $|y|=8$. It follows that the only possible vertices of the polygon are at the points (0, 10), (0, -10), (8, 0) and (-8, 0). It follows that the only possible vertices of the polygon are at the points (0, 10), (0, -10), (8, 0) and (-8, 0). Hence our polygon is a square with side length 10 and therefore has area 100. For completeness, observe that at every other point in the plane, at least one of the factors of f(x,y) was not equal to 0. We conclude that the area of our polygon is 100.




The value of the area of the square is 100. The result is a positive integer, as required. The answer is $\boxed{100}$.

Interesting, let's analyze step by step:



(1) As per the given information, we have the equation $$((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$$

(2) The equation is equal to zero if either of the terms is equal to zero. This implies either:
   (a) $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$
   
     - or -
   
   (b) $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$

(3) Each of these absolute value terms will be zero only when the value inside the absolute value is zero:
   (a) $\vert x + y \vert = 10$, $\vert x - y \vert = 10$
   
     - or -
   
    (b) $\vert x \vert = 8$, $\vert y \vert = 8$

(4) The solutions for the absolute value equations give:
   (a) $x + y = 10$ and $x - y = 10$ or $x + y = -10$ and $x - y = -10$.
      Solving these gives the four lines: $y = 0, x = 10, y = x, y = -x$
   
     - or -
   
    (b) $x = 8$ or $x = -8$, and $y = 8$ or $y = -8$.
      This gives the four lines: $y = 8, y = -8, x = 8, x = -8$

(5) The intersection of these lines form a square with side length of 10, the vertices of which are $(8,8), (8,-8), (-8,8)$ and $(-8,-8)$.

Now, let's find the area of the square:
area = side_length^2 = 10^2 = 100
The answer is $\boxed{100}$.

Interesting, let's analyze step by step:


The product of two numbers is zero if and only if at least one of the numbers is zero. So we must have one of the following:
1. $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$
2. $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$

From $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ and $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$, we get $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. This means $-10 \leq x + y \leq 10$ and $-10 \leq x - y \leq 10$.

From $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ and $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$, we get $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$. This means $-8 \leq x \leq 8$ and $-8 \leq y \leq 8$.

Combining the two sets of inequalities, we find the vertices of the polygon:
$(-8, 18), (-8, -2), (8, -2), (8, 18), (-8, 2), (-8, -18), (8, -18), (8, 2)$.

We can now plot these points to get a square with side length $20$. The area of the square is $20^2 = 400$. The value $400$ is a positive integer.
The answer is: $400$

Interesting, let's analyze step by step:


$(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ implies that $\vert x + y \vert = \vert x - y \vert = 10$. That means $x + y = \pm10$ and $x - y = \pm10$, so $x = y$ or $x = -y$.
Similarly, we get that $x = \pm8$ and $y = \pm8$, so $x = \pm8$ and $y = \pm8$. That is, $(x, y)$ satisfies the following system:
$$
\begin{cases}
x = y, & |x| = 8, \\
x = -y, & |x| = 8.
\end{cases}
$$
So we can conclude that the points $(x, y)$ enclose a square with side length $16$ in the $x$-$y$ plane. Thus, the area of this square is $16^2 = 256$.

Let's prove that the square is indeed defined by the system above. From $x + y = \pm10$ and $x - y = \pm10$, we obtain by adding or subtracting these equations that $x = \pm\frac{10}{2} = \pm5$ and $y = \pm\frac{10}{2} = \pm5$. However, from $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + (\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$, we must also have $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$. It is not possible that both $x$ and $y$ equal $\pm5$ while satisfying this condition. So the only possibility left is that $(x, y)$ lies on the lines $x = y$ and $x = -y$. In other words, the square is defined by $x = y$ and $x = -y$.

Hence the area of the convex polygon is 256.  This square can be visualized as in the following figure:

[asy]
draw((-8,8)--(8,8)--(8,-8)--(-8,-8)--cycle);
label("$x$",(10,0),E);
label("$y$",(0,10),N);
[/asy]
The area of the square is 256, as calculated above. The answer is: $256$.
