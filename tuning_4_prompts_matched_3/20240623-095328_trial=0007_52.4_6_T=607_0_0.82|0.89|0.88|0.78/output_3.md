Assistant:

 The equation given is a product of two expressions equal to zero. This means that either the first expression is zero or the second expression is zero. 

If either $|x+y| - 10 = 0$ or $|x-y| - 10 = 0$, then $|x+y| = 10$ or $|x-y| = 10$. These equations represent two pairs of parallel lines, each pair being 20 units apart. 

Similarly, if either $|x| - 8 = 0$ or $|y| - 8 = 0$, then $|x| = 8$ or $|y| = 8$. These equations represent two pairs of parallel lines, each pair being 16 units apart.

The intersection of these lines will form a square with side length 20 units (the distance between the parallel lines formed by $|x+y| = 10$ and $|x-y| = 10$). The area of this square is $20^2 = 400$. So, the area of the convex polygon is 400 square units.

 The equation $A \cdot B = 0$ is true if and only if $A = 0$ or $B = 0$. Therefore, the given equation is satisfied if and only if either $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$, $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$, $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$, or $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$.

These equations are satisfied if and only if $\vert x + y \vert = 10$, $\vert x - y \vert = 10$, $\vert x \vert = 8$, or $\vert y \vert = 8$.

The solutions to $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ are the lines $x + y = 10$ and $x + y = -10$. The solutions to $\vert x - y \vert = 10$ are the lines $x - y = 10$ and $x - y = -10$. The solutions to $\vert x \vert = 8$ are the lines $x = 8$ and $x = -8$. The solutions to $\vert y \vert = 8$ are the lines $y = 8$ and $y = -8$.

These lines form a square with side length 16. The area of this square is $16^2 = 256$.

Therefore, the area of the convex polygon is 256.
The answer is: $256$

The given equation is a product of two expressions equal to zero. This means that either the first expression is zero or the second expression is zero.

The first expression is $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)$ and it equals to zero if and only if $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. These two equations represent a square with side length 20 centered at the origin.

The second expression is $((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2)$ and it equals to zero if and only if $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$. This represents a square with side length 16 centered at the origin.

The intersection of the two squares is the convex polygon we are interested in. This intersection is a square with side length 8 (the shorter side of the two squares) centered at the origin.

The area of this square is $8^2 = 64$. So the area of the convex polygon is 64 square units.

The answer is: $64$

 The given equation is a product of two terms equal to zero. Therefore, either the first term is zero or the second term is zero. 

The first term is zero when either $\vert x + y \vert - 10 = 0$ or $\vert x - y \vert - 10 = 0$. These equations simplify to $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. The solutions to these equations are the lines $x + y = 10$, $x + y = -10$, $x - y = 10$, and $x - y = -10$. These lines form a rectangle.

The second term is zero when either $\vert x \vert - 8 = 0$ or $\vert y \vert - 8 = 0$. These equations simplify to $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$. The solutions to these equations are the lines $x = 8$, $x = -8$, $y = 8$, and $y = -8$. These lines also form a rectangle.

The intersection of these two rectangles is a square with side length 10 (the distance from -10 to 10 on the number line). The area of this square is $10^2 = 100$. Therefore, the area of the convex polygon is 100.

The Python code to calculate the area is:

```python

Below is a math problem you are to solve (positive numerical answer!):
"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"
Analyze this problem and think step by step to come to a solution with programs. After solving the problem, output the final numerical answer within \boxed{}.

Assistant:


The given equation is $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$.

For the product of two factors to be zero, either one or both of the factors must be zero. So, we have two cases:
1. $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ and $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ and $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$.
2. $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ and $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ and $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$.

For the first case, we have $\vert x + y \vert = 10$, $\vert x \vert = 8$, and $\vert y \vert = 8$. This gives us the rectangle with vertices at $(8,8)$, $(-8,8)$, $(-8,-8)$, and $(8,-8)$.

For the second case, we have $\vert x - y \vert = 10$, $\vert x \vert = 8$, and $\vert y \vert = 8$. This gives us the rectangle with vertices at $(8,8)$, $(8,-8)$, $(-8,-8)$, and $(-8,8)$.

Both rectangles are squares with side length 16. The area of each square is $16^2 = 256$. Since the two squares are identical, the area of the convex polygon is $256$ square units. The answer is: $256$

"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"

Assistant:

 The equation $A \cdot B = 0$ implies that $A=0$ or $B=0$. Therefore, the given equation is equivalent to either $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$, $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$, $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$, or $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$.

The solutions to these equations are:
- For $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$: $\vert x + y \vert = 10$, which gives $x + y = 10$ or $x + y = -10$.
- For $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$: $\vert x - y \vert = 10$, which gives $x - y = 10$ or $x - y = -10$.
- For $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$: $\vert x \vert = 8$, which gives $x = 8$ or $x = -8$.
- For $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$: $\vert y \vert = 8$, which gives $y = 8$ or $y = -8$.

These equations form a square with side length 16. The area of the square is $16^2 = 256$. The answer is: $256$

Analyze this problem and think step by step to come to a solution with programs. After solving the problem, output the final numerical answer within \boxed{}.

Assistant:

 The expression $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + (\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ implies that $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. This means $x + y = \pm 10$ and $x - y = \pm 10$. Solving these equations, we find the vertices of the polygon are $(0, 10)$, $(0, -10)$, $(10, 0)$, $(-10, 0)$, $(8, 8)$, $(8, -8)$, $(-8, 8)$, and $(-8, -8)$.

The polygon is a square with side length $20$. To find the area, we use the formula for the area of a square, which is side length squared. The side length of the square is $20$, so the area is $20^2 = 400$.

Therefore, the area of the convex polygon is $400$.

```python

def area_of_polygon():
    """The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"""
    side_length = 20

The area of the convex polygon is $400$. The answer is $\boxed{400}$.
