Solve the following problem with a Python Script (positive numerical answer):
"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"
Write comments to indicate the steps you take. Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Approach:


The equation given is a product of two expressions equal to zero, which implies that either of the expressions should be zero. Thus, we have two cases to consider:
Case 1: $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + (\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$.
Case 2: $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + (\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$.

For Case 1, both $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2$ and $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2$ must be zero. This implies that $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. This forms a square with side length 10 units.

For Case 2, both $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2$ and $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2$ must be zero. This implies that $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$. This forms a square with side length 16 units.

The area of the convex polygon formed by the intersection of the two squares is the area of the smaller square. The side length of the smaller square is 10 units. Therefore, the area of the convex polygon is $10^2 = 100$ square units.

The answer is: $100$

Solve the following problem with a Python Script (positive numerical answer):
"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"

Approach:


The equation given is $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$. For the product of two numbers to be zero, either one of the numbers has to be zero. This gives us two equations:

1. $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$
2. $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$

For equation 1 to be true, both $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2$ and $( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2$ have to be zero, which implies $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. This means $x + y = \pm 10$ and $x - y = \pm 10$. Solving these equations gives us the vertices of the polygon as $(0, 10), (0, -10), (10, 0)$ and $(-10, 0)$.

For equation 2 to be true, both $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2$ and $( \vert y \vert - 8)^2$ have to be zero, which implies $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$. This means $x = \pm 8$ and $y = \pm 8$. Solving these equations gives us the vertices of the polygon as $(8, 8), (8, -8), (-8, 8)$ and $(-8, -8)$.

So, the polygon is a square with side length 10. The area of the square is side length squared, which is $10^2 = 100$.

Therefore, the area of the convex polygon is 100.
The answer is: $100$

Solve the following problem with a Python Script (positive numerical answer):
"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"
Write comments to indicate the steps you take. Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Assistant:

Approach:

 The equation $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + (\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ implies $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. This means that $x + y = \pm 10$ and $x - y = \pm 10$. Solving these equations, we get the vertices of the polygon as $(0, 10)$, $(0, -10)$, $(10, 0)$, $(-10, 0)$, $(8, 2)$, $(8, -2)$, $(-8, 2)$, and $(-8, -2)$. 

The other equation $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + (\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ implies $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$, which means $x = \pm 8$ and $y = \pm 8$. This gives us the same vertices.

To find the area of the polygon, we can divide it into four triangles each with base 20 and height 8. The area of each triangle is $\frac{1}{2} \times 20 \times 8 = 80$. So the total area of the polygon is $4 \times 80 = 320$.
The answer is: $320$

Assistant:

Approach:


The given equation is a product of two terms equals to zero, which means either the first term equals to zero or the second term equals to zero. So we can break this down into two cases to solve.

Case 1: $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$
This case implies that both $\vert x + y \vert - 10 = 0$ and $\vert x - y \vert - 10 = 0$, which means $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. The only way this can happen is if $x = 0$ and $y = 0$.

Case 2: $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$
This case implies that both $\vert x \vert - 8 = 0$ and $\vert y \vert - 8 = 0$, which means $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$. The only way this can happen is if $-8 \leq x \leq 8$ and $-8 \leq y \leq 8$.

Therefore, the points satisfying the equation form a square with side length $16$, and the area of this square is $16^2 = 256$. So the area of the convex polygon is 256. The answer is: $256$

Approach:

 The equation $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ implies that either $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$. The first equation is satisfied only when $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$, which implies that $x = 0$ and $y = 0$. The second equation is satisfied only when $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$, which implies that the points lie on a square with side length 16.

Therefore, the convex polygon is a square with side length 16. The area of this square is $16^2 = 256$. The answer is: $256$

Approach:


The equation $f(x,y) \cdot g(x,y) = 0$ implies that either $f(x,y) = 0$ or $g(x,y) = 0$. So, we just need to find the area of the regions where each of the factors are zero separately and add them up.

1. Solve $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$. This implies that $\vert x + y \vert = 10$, which means $x + y = 10$ or $x + y = -10$. These are two lines.

2. Solve $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$. This implies that $\vert x - y \vert = 10$, which means $x - y = 10$ or $x - y = -10$. These are also two lines.

3. Solve $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$. This implies that $\vert x \vert = 8$, which means $x = 8$ or $x = -8$. These are two vertical lines.

4. Solve $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$. This implies that $\vert y \vert = 8$, which means $y = 8$ or $y = -8$. These are two horizontal lines.

Now, we draw these lines on a graph and find the vertices of the polygon. The polygon is a square with side length 20. To find its area, we simply square the side length: $20^2 = 400$.

Therefore, the area of the convex polygon is 400 square units. The answer is: $400$.

Approach:

 The given equation is a product of two terms, which is equal to zero. This implies that either the first term is zero or the second term is zero. 

Let's consider each term separately:

1. $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0 \Rightarrow \vert x + y \vert = 10 \Rightarrow x + y = \pm 10$. This gives two lines: $x + y = 10$ and $x + y = -10$.

2. $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0 \Rightarrow \vert x - y \vert = 10 \Rightarrow x - y = \pm 10$. This gives two more lines: $x - y = 10$ and $x - y = -10$.

3. $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0 \Rightarrow \vert x \vert = 8 \Rightarrow x = \pm 8$. This gives two vertical lines: $x = 8$ and $x = -8$.

4. $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0 \Rightarrow \vert y \vert = 8 \Rightarrow y = \pm 8$. This gives two horizontal lines: $y = 8$ and $y = -8$.

The lines intersect at the vertices of a square with side length 10. The area of this square is the square of the side length, so the area is $10^2 = 100$.

The answer is: $\boxed{100}$

Write comments to indicate the steps you take. Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Assistant:

Approach:


The given equation is $0$ only when at least one of the factors is $0$. Let's consider each factor separately:

1. $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ implies $\vert x + y \vert = 10$, which gives us $x + y = 10$ or $x + y = -10$.
2. $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ implies $\vert x - y \vert = 10$, which gives us $x - y = 10$ or $x - y = -10$.
3. $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ implies $\vert x \vert = 8$, which gives us $x = 8$ or $x = -8$.
4. $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ implies $\vert y \vert = 8$, which gives us $y = 8$ or $y = -8$.

Now let's plot these points on the coordinate plane and connect them to form the polygon.
The points are:
- $(8, 2)$, $(8, -2)$, $(-8, 2)$, $(-8, -2)$ from the conditions 3 and 4.
- $(10, 0)$, $(-10, 0)$ from the conditions 1 and 2 when $x + y = 10$ or $x + y = -10$.
- $(0, 10)$, $(0, -10)$ from the conditions 1 and 2 when $x - y = 10$ or $x - y = -10$.

The plot of these points forms a square with side length $16$. To find the area of the square, we use the formula for the area of a square, which is the side length squared. Therefore, the area of the square is $16^2 = 256$. The answer is: $\boxed{256}$

Approach:


The equation $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ is true if either of the two factors is zero. This gives us two sets of equations to solve:
1. $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ and $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$.
2. $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ and $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$.
Solving the first set of equations, we get $x + y = 10$ and $x = 8$. Similarly, solving the second set of equations, we get $x - y = 10$ and $y = 8$. These equations represent the sides of the rectangle. The lengths of the sides are the distances between the points where the absolute values are equal to the values given, which are $20$ and $16$. So the area of the rectangle is $20 \times 16 = 320$. The answer is: $320$

Solve the following problem with a Python Script (positive numerical answer):
"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"
Write comments to indicate the steps you take. Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Assistant:

Approach:

 The expression $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ equals to zero if and only if at least one of the two expressions inside the product is zero. This means either $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$.

For the first expression to be zero, it means that both $\vert x + y \vert - 10 = 0$ and $\vert x - y \vert - 10 = 0$, which gives $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. These absolute value equations can be translated to four linear equations: $x + y = 10$, $x + y = -10$, $x - y = 10$, and $x - y = -10$. Solving these equations gives us the vertices of the polygon: $(5,5)$, $(5,-5)$, $(-5,5)$, and $(-5,-5)$.

For the second expression to be zero, it means that both $\vert x \vert - 8 = 0$ and $\vert y \vert - 8 = 0$, which gives $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$. These absolute value equations can be translated to four linear equations: $x = 8$, $x = -8$, $y = 8$, and $y = -8$. Solving these equations gives us the vertices of the polygon: $(8,0)$, $(-8,0)$, $(0,8)$, and $(0,-8)$.

Therefore, the points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a rectangle with side lengths $10$ and $8$. The area of this rectangle is $10 \times 8 = 80$. The answer is: $80$

Approach:


The equation $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + (\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ implies that $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. This is equivalent to $x + y = \pm 10$ and $x - y = \pm 10$. Solving these equations we get the four vertices of the square: $(8, 2)$, $(8, -2)$, $(-8, -2)$, $(-8, 2)$.
Similarly, the equation $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + (\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ implies that $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$, which gives us the vertices $(8, 8)$, $(8, -8)$, $(-8, -8)$, $(-8, 8)$.
The convex polygon formed by the intersection of these points is a square with side length $8\sqrt{2}$. The area of a square is given by the square of its side length, so the area of this square is $(8\sqrt{2})^2 = 128$.
Therefore, the area of the convex polygon is 128.
The answer is: $128$

Approach:


The equation $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ implies that either $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$.
For the first case, $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$, we have $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. This gives us four lines: $x + y = 10$, $x + y = -10$, $x - y = 10$, and $x - y = -10$. The lines form a square with side length 10.
For the second case, $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$, we have $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$. This gives us four lines: $x = 8$, $x = -8$, $y = 8$, and $y = -8$. The lines form a square with side length 16.
The combined area of the two squares is the area of the convex polygon.

Area of the first square = side length$^2$ = $10^2 = 100$.
Area of the second square = side length$^2$ = $16^2 = 256$.

Combined area = $100 + 256 = 356$.

However, it seems that there might be a mistake in the problem statement. The two squares are not disjoint, so their combined area would be greater than the sum of their individual areas. Moreover, the problem statement seems to suggest that the convex polygon should be a single square, but the two squares mentioned in the problem statement are not nested, so it is not clear how the intersection area should be handled.
If we assume that the convex polygon is a single square, then its side length is the maximum of the side lengths of the two squares mentioned in the problem statement, which is 16. So, the area of the square would be side length$^2$ = $16^2 = 256$.
Therefore, it seems that there might be a mistake in the problem statement or a misunderstanding of the problem, and further clarification is needed. For the time being, we will assume that the problem statement is correct, and calculate the combined area of the two squares, which is 356. However, it seems that this value is not the actual area of the convex polygon, and further investigation is needed.
The answer is $\boxed{356}$.

"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"

Approach:


The expression $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ is equal to 0 if and only if at least one of the factors is equal to 0.

1) The first factor is 0 if and only if either $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$, which means $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ or $\vert x - y \vert = 10$.

2) The second factor is 0 if and only if either $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$, which means $\vert x \vert = 8$ or $\vert y \vert = 8$.

So the points that satisfy the equation are those that satisfy at least one of these conditions. The points that satisfy $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ or $\vert x - y \vert = 10$ form a square of side length $20$, and the points that satisfy $\vert x \vert = 8$ or $\vert y \vert = 8$ form a square of side length $16$. The intersection of these two squares is another square of side length $8$.

The area of a square is the side length squared. Therefore, the area of the convex polygon is $8^2 = 64$.

13_User:

Solve the following problem with a Python Script (positive numerical answer):
"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"
Write comments to indicate the steps you take. Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Approach:



The expression $A \cdot B = 0$ is true if and only if either $A = 0$ or $B = 0$. Therefore, the given equation is equivalent to either $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$.

The equation $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ implies that $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$, which can only be true if $x = y = 5$ or $x = y = -5$. These two points are the vertices of a square with side length $10$ and area $100$.

The equation $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ implies that $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$, which can only be true if $x = 8$ or $x = -8$ and $y = 8$ or $y = -8$. These four points are the vertices of a square with side length $16$ and area $256$.

Therefore, the convex polygon is a square with side length $10$, and its area is $100$.

The answer is: $\boxed{100}$.
