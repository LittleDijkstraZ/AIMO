Approach:


We first note that the given equation $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$ can be rewritten as $|x-2y| + |2y-x| = 40$.
This equation is always true because $|a| = |-a|$ for any real number $a$.

Now we look at the expression $5x^2+5y^2-8xy = (5x^2-8xy+4y^2) + (y^2-8xy+4x^2) = (x-2y)^2 + (y-2x)^2$.
We want to minimize this expression.

By the Triangle Inequality, we have $|a+b| \leq |a| + |b|$ for all real numbers $a$ and $b$. Applying this inequality to our equation, we get
\[|x-2y| + |y-2x| \geq |(x-2y) + (y-2x)| = |x-2y-y+2x| = |x-3x+2y-2y| = |0| = 0.\]
Since $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$, this implies that $|x-2y| = 20$ and $|y-2x| = 20$.

Now we can use the substitution $u = x-2y$ and $v = y-2x$. Then we have $|u| = 20$ and $|v| = 20$. Solving for $x$ and $y$ in terms of $u$ and $v$, we get $x = \frac{u+v}{3}$ and $y = \frac{v-u}{3}$.

Substituting these values into our expression $(x-2y)^2 + (y-2x)^2$, we get
\[\left(\frac{u+v}{3}-2\frac{v-u}{3}\right)^2 + \left(\frac{v-u}{3}-2\frac{u+v}{3}\right)^2 = \frac{1}{9}(u^2+v^2) = \frac{1}{9}(20^2+20^2) = \frac{1}{9}(800) = \frac{800}{9}.\]
So the minimum value of the expression $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ is $\frac{800}{9}$.

Therefore, the minimum value of the expression $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ is $\frac{800}{9}$. The answer is: $\frac{800}{9}$

Approach:


To minimize the expression $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$, we can use the fact that $(x-y)^2 \geq 0$. Applying this to the given equation $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$, we can simplify it as follows:

First, note that $|x - 2y| + |y - 2x| = |2x - y| + |-2x + y| = |2x - y| + |2x - y| = 2|2x - y|$. So we have $2|2x - y| = 40$, which simplifies to $|2x - y| = 20$.

Then, $(2x - y)^2 \geq 0$, which gives $4x^2 - 4xy + y^2 \geq 0$. Rearranging, we have $4x^2 + y^2 \geq 4xy$, or $4x^2 + y^2 - 4xy \geq 0$.

Multiplying by 5, we get $20x^2 + 5y^2 - 20xy \geq 0$. We are given that $5x^2 + 5y^2 - 8xy$ is to be minimized. Comparing with the previous equation, it is clear that the expression $5x^2 + 5y^2 - 8xy$ will be minimized when $20x^2 + 5y^2 - 20xy = 0$, or $4x^2 + y^2 - 4xy = 0$.

This means that $4x^2 + y^2 - 4xy = 0$, so $4x^2 + y^2 = 4xy$. Subtracting $4xy$ from both sides gives $4x^2 - 3xy + y^2 = 0$, or $(4x - y)(x - y) = 0$. Thus, $4x - y = 0$ or $x - y = 0$.

If $4x - y = 0$, then $y = 4x$. Substituting into $|2x - y| = 20$ gives $|2x - 4x| = 20$, which simplifies to $|-2x| = 20$, or $2x = \pm 20$, so $x = \pm 10$. The corresponding values of $y$ are $y = 4 \times 10 = 40$ and $y = 4 \times (-10) = -40$.

If $x - y = 0$, then $x = y$. Substituting into $|2x - y| = 20$ gives $|2x - x| = 20$, which simplifies to $|x| = 20$. However, this is not possible as $x$ and $y$ are real numbers and $|x|$ cannot be greater than 20.

Therefore, the only valid solution is $x = 10$ and $y = 40$. Now we can substitute these values into the expression $5x^2 + 5y^2 - 8xy$ to find its minimum value:

$5x^2 + 5y^2 - 8xy = 5(10)^2 + 5(40)^2 - 8(10)(40) = 500 + 8000 - 3200 = 5800$.

Therefore, the minimum value of $5x^2 + 5y^2 - 8xy$ is 5800.
The answer is: $5800$

Solve the following problem with a Python Script (positive numerical answer):

Approach:



First, let's denote $A = 5x^2 + 5y^2 - 8xy$. We want to minimize $A$ subject to the constraint $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$. 

We can simplify the constraint equation as follows:
$|x-2y| + |y-2x| = |x-2y| + |2y-x| = |x-2y| - |x-2y| = 0$. This implies that $x = 2y$ or $y = 2x$. 

Now, let's substitute $x = 2y$ into $A$:
$A = 5(2y)^2 + 5y^2 - 8(2y)y = 20y^2 + 5y^2 - 16y^2 = 9y^2$.

Similarly, if we substitute $y = 2x$ into $A$, we get:
$A = 5x^2 + 5(2x)^2 - 8x(2x) = 5x^2 + 20x^2 - 16x^2 = 9x^2$.

In both cases, $A = 9x^2 = 9y^2$. Since $x$ and $y$ cannot be zero simultaneously, we can see that the minimum value of $A$ occurs when $x = y = 0$. 

Substitute $x = y = 0$ into $A$, we get:
$A = 5(0)^2 + 5(0)^2 - 8(0)(0) = 0$.

Therefore, the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ when $x$ and $y$ range over all real numbers such that $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$ is $0$.
The answer is: $\boxed{0}$

Approach:

 The function $f(x, y) = 5x^2 + 5y^2 - 8xy$ represents an ellipse with its minimum value at its center. The condition $|x - 2y| + |y - 2x| = 40$ represents the set of all points $(x, y)$ that are equidistant from the lines $x - 2y = 0$ and $y - 2x = 0$. This set of points forms a rhombus. The center of this rhombus is also the center of the ellipse.

To find the coordinates of the center of the ellipse, we set the partial derivatives of $f(x, y)$ with respect to $x$ and $y$ equal to zero:

$\frac{\partial f}{\partial x} = 10x - 8y = 0$ and $\frac{\partial f}{\partial y} = 10y - 8x = 0$.

Solving these equations, we find that the center of the ellipse is at the point $(x, y) = \left(\frac{4}{3}y, \frac{4}{3}x\right)$.

Substituting this into the constraint equation $|x - 2y| + |y - 2x| = 40$, we get:

$| \frac{4}{3}y - 2y | + | \frac{4}{3}x - 2x | = 40$.

Simplifying, we have:

$| -\frac{2}{3}y | + | -\frac{2}{3}x | = 40$.

Dividing both sides by $-\frac{2}{3}$, we get:

$|x| + |y| = 60$.

Since the absolute values of $x$ and $y$ sum to a constant, the center of the rhombus (and the ellipse) is at the point where $|x| = |y| = 30$. Thus, the center of the ellipse is at $\left(\frac{4}{3}(30), \frac{4}{3}(30)\right) = (40, 40)$.

Finally, we substitute the coordinates $(x, y) = (40, 40)$ into the function $f(x, y)$:

$f(40, 40) = 5(40)^2 + 5(40)^2 - 8(40)(40) = 5(1600) + 5(1600) - 8(1600) = 8000 + 8000 - 12800 = 3200$.

Therefore, the minimum value of $5x^2 + 5y^2 - 8xy$ subject to the constraint $|x - 2y| + |y - 2x| = 40$ is 3200. The answer is: $3200$

We are given the condition $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$. This condition is actually a bit difficult to handle directly. Instead, let's rewrite it as $|x-2y| + |-(x-2y)| = 40$. This simplifies to $2|x-2y| = 40$, and further to $|x-2y| = 20$. Now, let's denote $z = x-2y$. We know that $|z| = 20$, which means that $z = \pm 20$. Then we can solve for $x$ and $y$ from $x-2y = z$.

Now, let's focus on the expression $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$. We can rewrite it as $5(x^2+y^2) - 8xy$. Now we need to find the minimum of this expression subject to the constraint $x-2y = \pm 20$. 

Using the constraint equation $x = 2y \pm 20$, substitute this into the expression to get $5( (2y \pm 20)^2 + y^2 ) - 8y(2y \pm 20)$. Then we differentiate this expression with respect to $y$, set the derivative to zero, and solve for $y$.

The minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ under the given condition is then substituted into the original expression.

Solution:

First, from $x - 2y = z$, we can express $x = 2y + z$. Substituting this into the expression $5x^2 + 5y^2 - 8xy$, we get
\[5(2y+z)^2 + 5y^2 - 8y(2y+z).\]
Simplifying this gives
\[20y^2 + 20yz + 5z^2 + 5y^2 - 16y^2 - 8yz = 5z^2 + 12y^2 + 12yz.\]
Now we substitute $z = \pm 20$, so the expression becomes
\[5(\pm 20)^2 + 12y^2 \pm 240y = 2000 \pm 12y^2 \pm 240y.\]
Differentiating this expression with respect to $y$ and setting it equal to zero, we get
\[\pm 24y + 240 = 0.\]
Solving for $y$, we find
\[y = \pm 10.\]
Substitute $y = 10$ into the expression $5z^2 + 12y^2 + 12yz$, we get
\[5z^2 + 12(10)^2 + 12z(10) = 5z^2 + 1200 + 120z.\]
Substitute $z = 20$, we get
\[5(20)^2 + 1200 + 120(20) = 2000 + 1200 + 2400 = 5600.\]
Substitute $y = -10$ into the expression $5z^2 + 12y^2 + 12yz$, we get
\[5z^2 + 12(-10)^2 - 12z(10) = 5z^2 + 1200 - 120z.\]
Substitute $z = -20$, we get
\[5(-20)^2 + 1200 - 120(-20) = 2000 + 1200 + 2400 = 5600.\]
Therefore, the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ is $5600$.
The answer is: $\boxed{5600}$

This problem is an application of the inequality $|a| + |b| \geq |a+b|$, which states that the sum of the absolute values of two real numbers is always greater than or equal to the absolute value of their sum. 

We can apply this inequality to the equation $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$. 

Let's denote $a = x - 2y$ and $b = y - 2x$, then we have $|a| + |b| = 40$. According to the inequality, $|a+b| \leq |a| + |b|$, so we have $|(x-2y) + (y-2x)| \leq |x-2y| + |y-2x|$. Simplifying the left side gives $| -x - y| = |x+y| \leq 40$.

Now let's express the function $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ in terms of $x+y$ and $x-2y$. 

We have $5x^2+5y^2-8xy = \frac{5}{2} [(x-2y)^2 + (y-2x)^2] = \frac{5}{2} [(x-2y)^2 + (2x-y)^2] = \frac{5}{2} [a^2 + b^2]$.

Using the inequality $a^2 + b^2 \geq \frac{1}{2} (a+b)^2$, we have $\frac{5}{2} [a^2 + b^2] \geq \frac{5}{2} \cdot \frac{1}{2} (a+b)^2 = \frac{5}{4} (x+y)^2$.

Since we know that $|x+y| \leq 40$, the minimum value of $\frac{5}{4} (x+y)^2$ is achieved when $|x+y|$ is minimized, which is 0. Therefore, the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ is $\frac{5}{4} \cdot 0^2 = 0$.

So the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ when $x$ and $y$ range over all real numbers such that $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$ is 0. The answer is: $0$.

Write comments to indicate the steps you take. Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Assistant:

Approach:

 We first notice that the given condition $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$ implies $x = 2y$. This is because the only way the sum of two absolute values can be a constant is if the expressions inside the absolute values are the same up to a constant multiple. Hence, we can substitute $x = 2y$ into the expression $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$, and then find the minimum value of this expression.

Substitute $x = 2y$ into the expression $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ to get
\[5(2y)^2 + 5y^2 - 8(2y)(y) = 20y^2 + 5y^2 - 16y^2 = 9y^2.\]
Now we need to minimize $9y^2$. Since $y^2$ is always nonnegative, the minimum value of $9y^2$ is 0, which occurs when $y = 0$. 

Since $x = 2y$, when $y = 0$, we have $x = 0$. Therefore, the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ is $9 \cdot 0^2 = 0$, when $x = 0$ and $y = 0$.
The answer is: $0$.

Approach:

 This problem can be solved by using the concept of AM-GM inequality (Arithmetic Mean-Geometric Mean inequality) and completing the square.

Step 1: Rearrange the equation $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$ into $|x-2y| = |2x-y| = 20$.

Step 2: Apply the AM-GM inequality on the terms $x-2y$ and $2x-y$, we have $\sqrt{(x-2y)(2x-y)} \leq \frac{(x-2y) + (2x-y)}{2} = \frac{3x-3y}{2} = \frac{3}{2}(x-y)$.

Step 3: From step 1, we know that $|x-2y| = |2x-y| = 20$, so we can write the inequality as $\sqrt{20*20} \leq \frac{3}{2}(x-y)$, which simplifies to $20 \leq \frac{3}{2}(x-y)$.

Step 4: Multiply both sides by 2 to get rid of the fraction, we have $40 \leq 3(x-y)$.

Step 5: Apply the AM-GM inequality on the terms $5x^2$ and $5y^2$, we have $\sqrt{5x^2*5y^2} \leq \frac{5x^2 + 5y^2}{2}$.

Step 6: Simplify the left side of the inequality to get $\sqrt{25x^2y^2} = 5|xy| \leq \frac{5x^2 + 5y^2}{2}$.

Step 7: Multiply both sides by 2 to get $10|xy| \leq 5x^2 + 5y^2$.

Step 8: We know from step 4 that $40 \leq 3(x-y)$, so we can rewrite it as $3(x-y) \geq 40$, and then divide both sides by 3 to get $x-y \geq \frac{40}{3}$.

Step 9: Multiply both sides by -1 to get $y-x \leq -\frac{40}{3}$.

Step 10: Add the inequalities $x-y \geq \frac{40}{3}$ and $y-x \leq -\frac{40}{3}$, we get $0 \geq \frac{40}{3} - \frac{40}{3}$, which is always true.

Step 11: This means that $x-y = \frac{40}{3}$ or $y-x = -\frac{40}{3}$.

Step 12: If $x-y = \frac{40}{3}$, then $y = x - \frac{40}{3}$. Substitute this into $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$, we have $5x^2+5(x-\frac{40}{3})^2-8x(x-\frac{40}{3})$.

Step 13: If $y-x = -\frac{40}{3}$, then $y = x + \frac{40}{3}$. Substitute this into $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$, we have $5x^2+5(x+\frac{40}{3})^2-8x(x+\frac{40}{3})$.

Step 14: We can simplify both expressions and find that they are equal. So, we only need to calculate one of them.

Step 15: Let's calculate $5x^2+5(x-\frac{40}{3})^2-8x(x-\frac{40}{3})$:
$$5x^2+5(x-\frac{40}{3})^2-8x(x-\frac{40}{3})$$
$$=5x^2+5(x^2-2*\frac{40}{3}x+\frac{1600}{9})-8x(x-\frac{40}{3})$$
$$=5x^2+5x^2-\frac{400}{3}x+\frac{1600}{9}-8x^2+\frac{320}{3}x$$
$$=2x^2+\frac{320}{3}x+\frac{1600}{9}.$$

Step 16: Now, we complete the square for the quadratic expression $2x^2+\frac{320}{3}x+\frac{1600}{9}$:
$$2x^2+\frac{320}{3}x+\frac{1600}{9} = 2(x^2+\frac{160}{3}x) + \frac{1600}{9}.$$

Step 17: To complete the square, we need to add and subtract $( \frac{160}{3*2})^2 = \frac{6400}{9}$ inside the parenthesis:
$$2(x^2+\frac{160}{3}x + \frac{6400}{9} - \frac{6400}{9}) + \frac{1600}{9}.$$

Step 18: Simplify the expression inside the parenthesis:
$$2((x+\frac{80}{3})^2 - \frac{6400}{9}) + \frac{1600}{9}.$$

Step 19: Expand the parenthesis and simplify:
$$2(x+\frac{80}{3})^2 - 2*\frac{6400}{9} + \frac{1600}{9},$$
$$2(x+\frac{80}{3})^2 - \frac{12800}{9} + \frac{1600}{9},$$
$$2(x+\frac{80}{3})^2 - \frac{11200}{9}.$$

Step 20: The minimum value of $2(x+\frac{80}{3})^2$ is 0 (when $x = -\frac{80}{3}$), so the minimum value of $2(x+\frac{80}{3})^2 - \frac{11200}{9}$ is $-\frac{11200}{9}$.

Step 21: Therefore, the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ is $-\frac{11200}{9}$.

The answer is: $-\frac{11200}{9}$

This is a constrained optimization problem. To solve it, we will first express the constraint in terms of a single variable, then substitute this expression into the function to be minimized, and finally find the minimum value of the resulting expression.

Step 1: Express the constraint in terms of a single variable.
The constraint is $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$. Without loss of generality, let's assume $x \geq 2y$. Then, the constraint becomes:
$$x - 2y + 2x - y = 40 \Rightarrow 3x - 3y = 40 \Rightarrow x - y = \frac{40}{3}.$$

Step 2: Substitute the expression of the constraint into the function to be minimized.
We now substitute $y = x - \frac{40}{3}$ into the function $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$:
\begin{align*}
5x^2 + 5\left(x - \frac{40}{3}\right)^2 - 8x\left(x - \frac{40}{3}\right) &= 5x^2 + 5\left(x^2 - \frac{80}{3}x + \frac{1600}{9}\right) - 8x^2 + \frac{320}{3}x \\
&= 5x^2 + 5x^2 - \frac{400}{3}x + \frac{1600}{9} - 8x^2 + \frac{320}{3}x \\
&= -3x^2 + \frac{40}{3}x + \frac{1600}{9}.
\end{align*}

Step 3: Find the minimum value of the resulting expression.
We now want to find the minimum value of the function $f(x) = -3x^2 + \frac{40}{3}x + \frac{1600}{9}$. To do this, we take the derivative of $f(x)$ with respect to $x$ and set it equal to zero:
\begin{align*}
f'(x) &= -6x + \frac{40}{3} = 0 \Rightarrow x = \frac{20}{9}.
\end{align*}

Now, we check that this value of $x$ indeed gives a minimum. The second derivative of $f(x)$ is $f''(x) = -6$, which is negative, indicating that $f(x)$ is concave down and thus $x = \frac{20}{9}$ gives a minimum.

Finally, we substitute $x = \frac{20}{9}$ back into the expression for $y$:
$$y = x - \frac{40}{3} = \frac{20}{9} - \frac{40}{3} = -\frac{40}{9}.$$

Now, we substitute $x = \frac{20}{9}$ and $y = -\frac{40}{9}$ into the function $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$:
\begin{align*}
5\left(\frac{20}{9}\right)^2 + 5\left(-\frac{40}{9}\right)^2 - 8\left(\frac{20}{9}\right)\left(-\frac{40}{9}\right) &= \frac{200}{9} + \frac{800}{9} + \frac{6400}{81} \\
&= \frac{200 + 800 + 6400}{9} = \frac{7400}{9}.
\end{align*}

Thus, the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ subject to the constraint $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$ is $\frac{7400}{9}$. The answer is: $\frac{7400}{9}$

Approach:

 We know that $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$ is the given condition, and we want to minimize the function $f(x, y) = 5x^2+5y^2-8xy$.

To minimize $f(x, y)$, we can substitute the condition into the function and then apply the AM-GM inequality (Arithmetic Mean - Geometric Mean inequality).

Let's start with the given condition:

\[|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40.\]

We can rewrite this as:

\[|(x-2y) + (y-2x)| = 40,\]

which simplifies to:

\[|x - 2y + y - 2x| = 40,\]

and further simplifies to:

\[|-x - y| = 40.\]

Since the absolute value of a quantity is always non-negative, we have $-x - y = \pm 40$. 

We can rewrite this as:

\[x + y = \mp 40.\]

Now let's substitute this into the function we want to minimize:

\[f(x, y) = 5x^2+5y^2-8xy = 5(x^2 + y^2) - 8xy.\]

Now substitute $x = -y \mp 40$:

\[f(x, y) = 5((-y \mp 40)^2 + y^2) - 8(-y \mp 40)y.\]

Simplify the expression:

\[f(x, y) = 5((y^2 \pm 80y + 1600) + y^2) + 8y^2 \pm 320y,\]

which simplifies to:

\[f(x, y) = 10y^2 \pm 80y + 800.\]

Now we can apply the AM-GM inequality to the quadratic expression $10y^2 \pm 80y + 800$. The AM-GM inequality states that for any non-negative real numbers $a$ and $b$, we have $\sqrt{ab} \leq \frac{a+b}{2}$. Equality occurs if and only if $a = b$.

In this case, we can apply the AM-GM inequality to the terms $10y^2$ and $800$:

\[\sqrt{10y^2 \cdot 800} \leq \frac{10y^2 + 800}{2},\]

which simplifies to:

\[20y \leq \frac{10y^2 + 800}{2}.\]

Multiplying both sides by 2 gives:

\[40y \leq 10y^2 + 800.\]

Rearranging terms gives:

\[10y^2 - 40y + 800 \geq 0.\]

Factoring the left side gives:

\[10(y^2 - 4y + 80) \geq 0.\]

This inequality is always true, so the minimum value of $f(x, y)$ is achieved when $y^2 - 4y + 80 = 0$.

Solving this quadratic equation gives:

\[y = 2 \pm 2\sqrt{15}.\]

Substituting these values back into the equation $x + y = \mp 40$, we get:

\[x = -40 - (2 \pm 2\sqrt{15}) = -42 \mp 2\sqrt{15}.\]

Finally, substituting these values of $x$ and $y$ back into the function $f(x, y)$, we get:

\[f(x, y) = 5(-42 \mp 2\sqrt{15})^2 + 5(2 \pm 2\sqrt{15})^2 - 8(-42 \mp 2\sqrt{15})(2 \pm 2\sqrt{15}).\]

After simplifying, we get:

\[f(x, y) = -800.\]

So the minimum value of the function $f(x, y)$ is $-800$. The answer is: $$-800$$

Approach:


To minimize $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$, we can use the fact that $(x-2y)^2 + (y-2x)^2 = 40^2$ to eliminate one of the variables. From this equation, we can solve for $y$ in terms of $x$ (or vice versa) and substitute into the expression to minimize. 

However, a more elegant way is to use the fact that $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ can be expressed as $\frac{1}{2}((x-2y)^2 + (y-2x)^2)$ after expanding and simplifying. Thus, the expression is always greater than or equal to 0, with equality when $x = 2y$ and $y = 2x$. By substitution into the equation $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$, we can solve for $x$ and $y$.

Then, substitute these values into the expression $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$.

Solution:
From the equation $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$, we have that $x = 2y$ and $y = 2x$. Solving these equations, we get $x = \frac{40}{6} = \frac{20}{3}$ and $y = \frac{80}{6} = \frac{40}{3}$.

Substituting these values into the expression $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$, we get:
$$5\left(\frac{20}{3}\right)^2 + 5\left(\frac{40}{3}\right)^2 - 8\left(\frac{20}{3}\right)\left(\frac{40}{3}\right) = 0.$$

Thus, the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ is 0 when $x = \frac{20}{3}$ and $y = \frac{40}{3}$. The answer is: $0$
