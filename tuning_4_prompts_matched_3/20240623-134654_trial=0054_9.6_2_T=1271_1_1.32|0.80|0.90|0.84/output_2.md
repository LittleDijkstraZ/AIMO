Interesting, let's analyze step by step:



The equation \[\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}\] has $4$ distinct solutions. The expression $\frac{m}{100}$ must be less than $2$, since otherwise the absolute value expression would have only one or two solutions. So $0 < \frac{m}{100} < 2$, which implies $0 < m < 200$. Also note that $m$ must be an integer. Thus the possible values for $m$ are $1, 2, ..., 199$.

Now, we need to check how many of these values of $m$ would make the equation have exactly four distinct solutions. This could be done manually or programmatically. To reduce the computation time, we can leverage the fact that $\frac{m}{100}$ affects the "width" of the piecewise function we are solving, and the number of solutions changes at the points where the width of the function changes (i.e., at $m/100 = 1$ and $m/100 = 2$). So we only need to check the values of $m$ in the intervals $(0, 100), (100, 200)$.

It turns out that the values of $m$ in the interval $(100, 200)$ make the equation have four distinct solutions. So the number of positive integers $m$ that satisfy the equation is $100$. Since $100$ is a positive integer, the answer is:

$$100$$

The answer is: $100$

Interesting, let's analyze step by step:



The problem is to find the number of positive integers $m$ for which the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has 4 distinct solutions.

Step 1:
First, let's try to find the number of solutions for a specific $m$, then try to find for how many values of $m$ it has 4 distinct solutions.

Step 2:
The equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has a number of solutions equal to the number of times the graph of $y=\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert$ intersects the horizontal line $y=\frac{m}{100}$. 

The graph of $y=\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert$ is a "V" shape with the vertex at $(1, 2)$. For each $x$, $y=\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert$ takes on integer values in the range $0 \leq y \leq 4$. 

Therefore, $\frac{m}{100}$ must be in the range $0 \leq \frac{m}{100} \leq 4$, or equivalently $0 \leq m \leq 400$.

Step 3:
For a given $m$, the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has 4 distinct solutions when $\frac{m}{100}$ is an integer in the range $1 \leq \frac{m}{100} \leq 3$, or equivalently $100 \leq m \leq 300$.

Step 4:
Now we need to count the number of integers in this range. It is $300 - 100 + 1 = 200$.

Step 5:
But the problem asks for the number of positive integers $m$, and we have counted all the negative integers and zero too. So we need to subtract these from our total. The negative integers and zero make a total of $101$.

Step 6:
Subtracting these from our total, we get the number of positive integers $m$ for which the equation has 4 distinct solutions: $200 - 101 = 99$.

However, we made a mistake in step 3. The equation has 4 distinct solutions when $\frac{m}{100}$ is an integer in the range $0 < \frac{m}{100} < 4$, or equivalently $0 < m < 400$. This range includes the values of $m$ for which the equation has 2 distinct solutions. So we need to subtract those values of $m$.

Step 7:
For a given $m$, the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has 2 distinct solutions when $\frac{m}{100}$ is an integer equal to either 0 or 4. There are 2 such values of $m$: $m=0$ and $m=400$.

Step 8:
Subtracting these from our previous total of 99, we get the number of positive integers $m$ for which the equation has 4 distinct solutions: $99 - 2 = 97$.

So, there are 97 positive integers $m$ for which the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has 4 distinct solutions.

The answer is: 97

Interesting, let's analyze step by step:



The equation $|\vert x-1 \vert -2|=\frac{m}{100}$ has 4 distinct solutions. This equation can be split into two cases based on the absolute value:

**Case 1:** $|\vert x-1 \vert -2|=\frac{m}{100}$

In this case, $|\vert x-1 \vert -2|=\frac{m}{100} \ge 0$. Therefore, we have two sub-cases:

**Sub-case 1.1:** $\vert x-1 \vert -2=\frac{m}{100}$

**Sub-case 1.2:** $-\vert x-1 \vert +2=\frac{m}{100}$

**Case 2:** $|\vert x-1 \vert -2|=-\frac{m}{100}$

However, we have already covered all possible cases because $|\frac{m}{100}|=\frac{m}{100}$ if $\frac{m}{100} \ge 0$, and $|\frac{m}{100}|= -\frac{m}{100}$ otherwise. But if $\frac{m}{100} < 0$, the left hand side of the original equation is non-negative, while the right hand side is negative, so there is no solution in this case.

So, we only need to solve the two sub-cases in Case 1.

**Sub-case 1.1:** $\vert x-1 \vert -2=\frac{m}{100}$

This is equivalent to $\vert x-1 \vert =\frac{m}{100}+2$. We split this into two more sub-cases:

**Sub-case 1.1.1:** $x-1=\frac{m}{100}+2$, which simplifies to $x=1+\frac{m}{100}+2=\frac{m}{100}+3$.

**Sub-case 1.1.2:** $-(x-1)=\frac{m}{100}+2$, which simplifies to $x=1-\frac{m}{100}-2=-\frac{m}{100}-1$.

Similarly, for the **Sub-case 1.2:** $-\vert x-1 \vert +2=\frac{m}{100}$, it is equivalent to $\vert x-1 \vert =2-\frac{m}{100}$, which has two sub-cases:

**Sub-case 1.2.1:** $x-1=2-\frac{m}{100}$, which simplifies to $x=1+2-\frac{m}{100}=3-\frac{m}{100}$.

**Sub-case 1.2.2:** $-(x-1)=2-\frac{m}{100}$, which simplifies to $x=1-2+\frac{m}{100}=\frac{m}{100}-1$.

Now we need to find the value of $m$ such that the four solutions from the above sub-cases are distinct. That is, the values of $m$ such that the following four equations have different solutions:

$$x=\frac{m}{100}+3, -\frac{m}{100}-1, 3-\frac{m}{100}, \frac{m}{100}-1.$$

Solving these equations gives:

$$x=\frac{m}{100}+3 \Rightarrow m=(x-3)*100.$$
$$x=-\frac{m}{100}-1 \Rightarrow m=-100(x+1).$$
$$x=3-\frac{m}{100} \Rightarrow m=100(3-x).$$
$$x=\frac{m}{100}-1 \Rightarrow m=100(x+1).$$

For these equations to have different solutions, the values of $m$ from each equation must be different. Let's check:

$$m_1=(x-3)*100, m_2=-100(x+1),$$
$$m_3=100(3-x), m_4=100(x+1).$$

It is easy to see that $m_1 \neq m_2$, $m_3 \neq m_4$, and $m_1 \neq m_3$. So we only need to check $m_1$ and $m_4$.

$$m_1=(x-3)*100, m_4=100(x+1).$$

Setting $m_1=m_4$ gives $(x-3)*100=100(x+1)$, which simplifies to $x-3=x+1$, a contradiction. So $m_1 \neq m_4$.

Therefore, the four equations have different solutions, and the values of $m$ that make the four solutions distinct are:

$$m=(x-3)*100, -100(x+1), 100(3-x), 100(x+1).$$

To find the positive integer $m$ that makes the equation have 4 distinct solutions, we can simply substitute $x=4$ into the above equations and calculate the values of $m$:

$$m_1=(4-3)*100=100,$$
$$m_2=-100(4+1)=-500,$$
$$m_3=100(3-4)=-100,$$
$$m_4=100(4+1)=500.$$

The values of $m$ that make the equation have 4 distinct solutions are $100$, $-100$, $500$, and $-500$. However, we only consider positive integers, so the only positive integer value of $m$ is $100$.
The answer is: $1$

First, let's find the values of m for which the equation has four distinct solutions. The equation \[\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}\] can have at most four solutions. It turns out that this equation has four distinct solutions exactly when $\frac{m}{100} = 1$. So $m = 100$. Therefore, the number of positive integers $m$ for which the equation has four distinct solutions is 1.

Interesting, let's analyze step by step:



Given an equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ with 4 distinct solutions. This equation involves absolute values, which can make it a bit tricky to solve algebraically. But we can make it easier by considering the properties of absolute values. The equation will have four distinct solutions when the right hand side $\frac{m}{100}$ falls into a specific range of values.

Step 1: Simplify the problem
Let's rewrite the equation as $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=0.01m$.
We know that the absolute value of a quantity is equal to zero if and only if the quantity itself is zero. Therefore, we have three cases to consider:
Case 1: $\vert x-1 \vert -2 = 0.01m$
Case 2: $\vert x-1 \vert -2 = -0.01m$
Case 3: $-\vert x-1 \vert +2 = 0.01m$
Case 4: $-\vert x-1 \vert +2 = -0.01m$

Step 2: Solve each case
Now, we solve each case separately. For each case, we will first solve the equation inside the absolute value, and then solve the resulting absolute value equation.

Case 1: $\vert x-1 \vert -2 = 0.01m$
$\Rightarrow \vert x-1 \vert = 2 + 0.01m$
$\Rightarrow x-1 = 2 + 0.01m$ or $x-1 = -(2 + 0.01m)$

Case 2: $\vert x-1 \vert -2 = -0.01m$
$\Rightarrow \vert x-1 \vert = 2 - 0.01m$
$\Rightarrow x-1 = 2 - 0.01m$ or $x-1 = -(2 - 0.01m)$

Case 3: $-\vert x-1 \vert +2 = 0.01m$
$\Rightarrow -\vert x-1 \vert = 0.01m - 2$
$\Rightarrow \vert x-1 \vert = -(0.01m - 2)$
Since the right side of the equation is always negative, there are no solutions for this case.

Case 4: $-\vert x-1 \vert +2 = -0.01m$
$\Rightarrow -\vert x-1 \vert = -0.01m - 2$
$\Rightarrow \vert x-1 \vert = 0.01m + 2$
$\Rightarrow x-1 = 0.01m + 2$ or $x-1 = -(0.01m + 2)$

Step 3: Analyze the solutions
Now, we need to find the values of $m$ for which the equations in each case have 4 distinct solutions. After solving the equations in each case, we have:

Case 1: $x = 3 + 0.01m$ or $x = 0.01m - 1$
Case 2: $x = 2 - 0.01m$ or $x = 0.01m + 1$
Case 4: $x = 0.01m + 3$ or $x = 1 - 0.01m$

Comparing these solutions, we can see that for Case 1 and Case 4 to have distinct solutions, $0.01m - 1 < 2 - 0.01m$ and $3 + 0.01m < 1 - 0.01m$. Solving these inequalities, we find that $1.5 < m < 300$. Therefore, the possible values of $m$ are integers from 2 to 299. The number of such integers is $298$. Since $298$ is a positive integer, the value of $m$ that satisfies the equation is indeed a positive integer.

Step 4: Output the result
The number of positive integers $m$ for which the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has $4$ distinct solutions is $298$. Therefore, the value of the unknown variable $m$ is $298$. The answer is: $298$

Interesting, let's analyze step by step:



For the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ to have four distinct solutions, $\frac{m}{100}$ must be equal to $1$. Therefore, we have $m=100$. So the value of $m$ for which the equation has four distinct solutions is $100$. As $100$ is a positive integer, it is the required value of $m$. So the output is: $100$. The answer is: $100$.

So, the only positive integer $m$ for which the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has four distinct solutions is $100$. Therefore, the answer is: $100$. The answer is: $100$. The answer is: $\boxed{100}$

Interesting, let's analyze step by step:



The equation $| |x-1| -2|=\frac{m}{100}$ has four distinct solutions. The function $| |x-1| -2|$ is an "Owl" function, which has a V-shape and two slopes of $-1$ and $1$ on the two "wings". Therefore, the value of $\frac{m}{100}$ must be between $1$ and $2$, because otherwise, it wouldn't have four solutions. So, we have $1 \leq \frac{m}{100} < 2$, which gives $100 \leq m < 200$.

Now, we want to find out how many positive integer values of $m$ are in this range. The smallest integer in the range is $100$, and the largest integer less than $200$ is $199$. So, the number of positive integers $m$ that satisfy the equation is $199 - 100 + 1 = 100$.
