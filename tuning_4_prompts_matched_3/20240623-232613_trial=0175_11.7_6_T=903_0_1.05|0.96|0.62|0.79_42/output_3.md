The given equation is $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$.
This equation is equal to zero if either of the factors is equal to zero.
The first factor is equal to zero when $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$.
These equations represent the equations of two squares with side length 10 units, centered at the origin, with their sides parallel to the coordinate axes.
The second factor is equal to zero when $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$.
These equations represent two squares with side length 16 units, centered at the origin, with their sides parallel to the coordinate axes.
The points that satisfy both factors are the vertices of the intersection of these squares.
The area of the intersection of these two squares is the area of a square with side length 8 units.
Therefore, the area of the convex polygon is $8^2 = 64$.
The answer is: $64$

Below is a math problem you are to solve (positive numerical answer!):
"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"
Analyze this problem and think step by step to come to a solution with programs. After solving the problem, output the final numerical answer within \boxed{}.

Assistant:

 The equation is satisfied only when both $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ and $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ or both $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ and $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$.
The first pair of equations is satisfied when $|x + y| = 10$ and $|x - y| = 10$. This forms a square with side length 10, and the area of this square is $10^2 = 100$.
The second pair of equations is satisfied when $|x| = 8$ and $|y| = 8$. This forms a square with side length 8, and the area of this square is $8^2 = 64$.
The convex polygon formed by the points that satisfy the equation is the union of these two squares. Therefore, the area of the convex polygon is the sum of the areas of the two squares, which is $100 + 64 = 164$. The answer is: $164$

 The given equation is $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$.
For this equation to be equal to zero, one of the two products must be zero. This means that either $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$.
For the first product to be zero, both $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ and $( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$, which implies that $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$.
These are the equations of two lines, $x + y = 10$ and $x - y = 10$, forming a rhombus with side length 10.
For the second product to be zero, both $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ and $( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$, which implies that $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$.
These are the equations of two lines, $x = 8$ and $y = 8$, forming a square with side length 16.
The convex polygon enclosed by these lines is a square with side length 16.
The area of this square is $16^2 = 256$.
So the area of the convex polygon is 256. The answer is $\boxed{256}$.

 This problem requires a deep understanding of absolute value functions and how they interact with multiplication and equations. It also requires knowledge of how to calculate the area of a polygon given its vertices.

The equation $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ is satisfied when either of the two factors are equal to zero. This means that one of the following conditions must be met:

1. $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$
2. $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$

From condition 1, we have $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$, which means that $x + y = \pm 10$ and $x - y = \pm 10$. This gives us four lines in the coordinate plane: $x + y = 10$, $x + y = -10$, $x - y = 10$, and $x - y = -10$. The intersection points of these lines are the vertices of the polygon.

From condition 2, we have $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$, which means that $x = \pm 8$ and $y = \pm 8$. This gives us four more lines in the coordinate plane: $x = 8$, $x = -8$, $y = 8$, and $y = -8$. The intersection points of these lines with the previous ones are the vertices of the polygon.

By calculating the intersection points, we find that the polygon is a square with side length $20$. The area of a square is the side length squared, so the area of this polygon is $20^2 = 400$.
The answer is: $400$.

Below is a math problem you are to solve (positive numerical answer!):
"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"

Assistant:

 The problem is asking for the area of a polygon enclosed by the points that satisfy a specific equation. The equation is $ ((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0 $.

For the product of two numbers to be zero, either one of the numbers must be zero. So we have two cases to consider:

Case 1: $ ((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2) = 0 $
This means that $ \vert x + y \vert - 10 = 0 $ and $ \vert x - y \vert - 10 = 0 $, so $ \vert x + y \vert = 10 $ and $ \vert x - y \vert = 10 $. This results in a square with side length 20.

Case 2: $ ((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0 $
This means that $ \vert x \vert - 8 = 0 $ and $ \vert y \vert - 8 = 0 $, so $ \vert x \vert = 8 $ and $ \vert y \vert = 8 $. This results in a square with side length 16.

However, the two cases cannot both be true at the same time, because the first case implies that the point lies on a square with side length 20, while the second case implies that the point lies on a square with side length 16.

Therefore, the points satisfying the equation form the intersection of the two squares, which is a square with side length 16. The area of this square is $ 16^2 = 256 $.

So the area of the convex polygon is 256. The answer is $\boxed{256}$.

To solve this problem, we need to analyze the given equation and understand when it equals zero.

The equation is:

$$((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$$

This equation equals zero when either of the two factors equals zero:
1. $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ or
2. $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$

For the first factor to be zero, both $\vert x + y \vert - 10 = 0$ and $\vert x - y \vert - 10 = 0$, which implies $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. This forms a square with side length 20.

For the second factor to be zero, both $\vert x \vert - 8 = 0$ and $\vert y \vert - 8 = 0$, which implies $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$. This forms a square with side length 16.

The points that satisfy either condition form a larger square that contains the smaller square. The area of the larger square is $20^2 = 400$ and the area of the smaller square is $16^2 = 256$. Therefore, the area of the convex polygon is the difference between the areas of the two squares, which is $400 - 256 = 144$.

The answer is: $144$.

2. $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$. In this case, both $\vert x \vert - 8$ and $\vert y \vert - 8$ must be zero, which means $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$. This forms a square with side length 16, so the area is $16^2 = 256$.

However, the second case doesn't actually satisfy the original equation, because when we set $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$, the left side of the equation is not zero. The first case does satisfy the original equation and forms a square with side length 20, so the area of the convex polygon is 400 square units. The answer is: $400$

This problem involves understanding the behavior of the absolute value function and the properties of the square function. The key insight is that the expression inside each pair of absolute value brackets must equal zero for the whole expression to equal zero.

The equation $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ implies $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. This gives us four equations: $x + y = 10$, $x + y = -10$, $x - y = 10$, and $x - y = -10$. These equations represent four lines in the plane.

Similarly, the equation $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ implies $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$. This gives us four more equations: $x = 8$, $x = -8$, $y = 8$, and $y = -8$. These equations represent four more lines in the plane.

The intersection points of these eight lines are the vertices of the convex polygon. By plotting these lines or by solving the system of equations, we can find these vertices and compute the area of the polygon.

The area of the polygon is the sum of the areas of the four right triangles formed by the vertices. The sides of each triangle are determined by the intersections of the lines.

The area of a right triangle is given by $\frac{1}{2} \times \text{base} \times \text{height}$. The base and height of each triangle can be determined by the distances between the intersections of the lines.

By calculating the areas of the four triangles and summing them up, we get the area of the convex polygon.

However, solving this problem analytically can be quite tedious and time-consuming. It would be more efficient to use a computer program to plot the lines and find the vertices, then calculate the areas of the triangles and sum them up.

For this problem, we will not provide a full python program to compute the area of the polygon because it would be too complex and time-consuming to implement. Instead, we can use the properties of absolute value and the geometry of the problem to find the answer directly.

The equation $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ implies that the distance between the points $(x, y)$ and $(-x, -y)$, $(x, -y)$ and $(-x, y)$, $(x, y)$ and $(-x, y)$, and $(x, -y)$ and $(-x, -y)$ is always 10. These are the side lengths of the squares with vertices at $(8, 8)$, $(-8, 8)$, $(-8, -8)$, and $(8, -8)$.

Similarly, the equation $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ implies that the distance between the points $(x, y)$ and $(x, -y)$, $(x, y)$ and $(-x, y)$, $(x, y)$ and $(-x, -y)$, and $(x, -y)$ and $(-x, y)$ is always 8. These are the side lengths of the squares with vertices at $(0, 8)$, $(8, 0)$, $(0, -8)$, and $(-8, 0)$.

The intersection of these squares forms a square with side length 8, which is the convex polygon we are looking for.

The area of this square is $8^2 = 64$. Therefore, the area of the convex polygon is 64 square units. The answer is: $64$

 The given equation is equal to zero if and only if both factors are equal to zero. This gives us two systems of equations:

1. $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ and $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ and $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$.
2. $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ and $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ and $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$.

From the first system, we have $\vert x + y \vert = 10$, $\vert x \vert = 8$, and $\vert y \vert = 8$. This implies $-8 \leq x, y \leq 8$. From the second system, we have $\vert x - y \vert = 10$, $\vert x \vert = 8$, and $\vert y \vert = 8$. This implies that the polygon is a square with side length 16 (since the distance between the points $(8,8)$ and $(-8,8)$ or $(8,-8)$ is 16 by the distance formula). The area of a square with side length 16 is $16^2 = 256$. Therefore, the area of the convex polygon is 256 square units. The answer is: $256$

Assistant:

 The given equation is a product of two expressions equal to zero. This means that either the first expression is zero, or the second expression is zero, or both are zero.

The first expression is:
$$((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)$$
Setting this equal to zero, we have:
$$\vert x + y \vert = 10 \text{ and } \vert x - y \vert = 10$$
This means that the points $(x, y)$ must lie on the lines $x + y = \pm 10$ and $x - y = \pm 10$.

The second expression is:
$$((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2)$$
Setting this equal to zero, we have:
$$\vert x \vert = 8 \text{ and } \vert y \vert = 8$$
This means that the points $(x, y)$ must lie on the lines $x = \pm 8$ and $y = \pm 8$.

The intersection of these lines form a square with side length 16. The area of this square is $16^2 = 256$. So the area of the convex polygon is 256 square units. The answer is: $256$
