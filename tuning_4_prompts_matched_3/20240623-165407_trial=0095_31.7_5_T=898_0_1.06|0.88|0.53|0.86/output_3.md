The given equation is a product of two expressions equal to zero. This means that either the first expression is zero or the second expression is zero. 

The first expression is $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)$. This expression is zero if and only if both $\vert x + y \vert - 10 = 0$ and $\vert x - y \vert - 10 = 0$, which implies $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. This results in a square with side length 20.

The second expression is $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$. This expression is zero if and only if both $\vert x \vert - 8 = 0$ and $\vert y \vert - 8 = 0$, which implies $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$. This results in a square with side length 16.

The intersection of these two squares is the convex polygon whose area we need to find. This intersection is a square with side length 8.

Therefore, the area of the convex polygon is $8^2 = 64$.

The equation $A \cdot B = 0$ implies that either $A = 0$ or $B = 0$. Therefore, the given equation is satisfied if either $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$.
From the first two equations, we get $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. This means that the points $(x, y)$ lie on the lines $x + y = 10$ and $x - y = 10$ or their parallel lines. Similarly, from the last two equations, we get $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$, which means that the points $(x, y)$ lie on the lines $x = 8$ and $y = 8$ or their parallel lines. The intersection of these lines form a square with side length $10$ (since the distance between the lines $x + y = 10$ and $x - y = 10$ is $10$ when $x = 0$). Therefore, the area of the convex polygon is the area of this square, which is $10^2 = 100$. The answer is: $100$

Below is a math problem you are to solve (positive numerical answer!):
"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"
Analyze this problem and think step by step to come to a solution with programs. After solving the problem, output the final numerical answer within \boxed{}.

Assistant:

 The expression $A \cdot B = 0$ is true if and only if at least one of $A = 0$ or $B = 0$. Therefore, the given equation is equivalent to either $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$, $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$, $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$, or $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$.

Solving these equations gives us the vertices of the polygon:
- For $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$, we have $|x + y| = 10$, which gives us the lines $x + y = 10$ and $x + y = -10$.
- For $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$, we have $|x - y| = 10$, which gives us the lines $x - y = 10$ and $x - y = -10$.
- For $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$, we have $|x| = 8$, which gives us the lines $x = 8$ and $x = -8$.
- For $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$, we have $|y| = 8$, which gives us the lines $y = 8$ and $y = -8$.

The intersection points of these lines are the vertices of the polygon:
- Intersection of $x + y = 10$ and $x - y = 10$ gives $(x, y) = (5, 5)$.
- Intersection of $x + y = 10$ and $x - y = -10$ gives $(x, y) = (-5, -5)$.
- Intersection of $x + y = 10$ and $x = 8$ gives $(x, y) = (8, 2)$.
- Intersection of $x + y = 10$ and $x = -8$ gives $(x, y) = (-8, 18)$.
- Intersection of $x + y = -10$ and $x - y = 10$ gives $(x, y) = (-5, -5)$.
- Intersection of $x + y = -10$ and $x - y = -10$ gives $(x, y) = (5, -5)$.
- Intersection of $x + y = -10$ and $x = 8$ gives $(x, y) = (8, -18)$.
- Intersection of $x + y = -10$ and $x = -8$ gives $(x, y) = (-8, 2)$.
- Intersection of $x - y = 10$ and $x = 8$ gives $(x, y) = (8, -2)$.
- Intersection of $x - y = 10$ and $x = -8$ gives $(x, y) = (-8, 18)$.
- Intersection of $x - y = -10$ and $x = 8$ gives $(x, y) = (8, 2)$.
- Intersection of $x - y = -10$ and $x = -8$ gives $(x, y) = (-8, -18)$.
- Intersection of $x = 8$ and $y = 8$ gives $(x, y) = (8, 8)$.
- Intersection of $x = 8$ and $y = -8$ gives $(x, y) = (8, -8)$.
- Intersection of $x = -8$ and $y = 8$ gives $(x, y) = (-8, 8)$.
- Intersection of $x = -8$ and $y = -8$ gives $(x, y) = (-8, -8)$.

The polygon is a square with side length 16 (the distance between the lines $x = 8$ and $x = -8$). The area of this square is $16^2 = 256$. Therefore, the area of the convex polygon is 256.

Below is a math problem you are to solve (positive numerical answer!):
"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"
Analyze this problem and think step by step to come to a solution with programs. After solving the problem, output the final numerical answer within \boxed{}.

Assistant:

 The given equation is equal to zero if either of the following conditions are met:
1. $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$
2. $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$

For the first condition to be true, we must have $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. This implies that $x + y = \pm 10$ and $x - y = \pm 10$. Solving these equations gives us four lines: $x + y = 10$, $x + y = -10$, $x - y = 10$, and $x - y = -10$.

For the second condition to be true, we must have $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$. This implies that $x = \pm 8$ and $y = \pm 8$. Solving these equations gives us four lines: $x = 8$, $x = -8$, $y = 8$, and $y = -8$.

These eight lines enclose a rectangle with side lengths 16 and 20. The area of this rectangle is $16 \times 20 = 320$. Therefore, the area of the convex polygon is 320 square units.

The answer is: $320$

Below is a math problem you are to solve (positive numerical answer!):
"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"
Analyze this problem and think step by step to come to a solution with programs. After solving the problem, output the final numerical answer within \boxed{}.

Assistant:

 The given equation is equivalent to the product of two terms being zero, i.e.,
$$((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0.$$
This means that either the first term is zero, or the second term is zero.
If the first term is zero, we have
$$(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0.$$
This can only happen if $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$.
These equations describe a square with side length 10, so the area of the square is $10^2 = 100$.
If the second term is zero, we have
$$(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0.$$
This can only happen if $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$, which describes a square with side length 16, so the area of this square is $16^2 = 256$.
However, this solution is not valid because it does not satisfy the first term being zero.
Therefore, the only valid solution is the square with side length 10, and its area is 100. The answer is: 100

"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"
Analyze this problem and think step by step to come to a solution with programs. After solving the problem, output the final numerical answer within \boxed{}.

Assistant:

 The given equation is $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$.
For the product of two factors to be zero, either one or both of the factors must be zero.
So, either $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$.
If $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$, then $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$, which implies $x + y = \pm 10$ and $x - y = \pm 10$.
Solving these equations, we get the vertices of the polygon as $(0, 10)$, $(0, -10)$, $(10, 0)$, $(-10, 0)$, $(8, 8)$, $(8, -8)$, $(-8, 8)$, and $(-8, -8)$.
If $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$, then $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$, which implies $x = \pm 8$ and $y = \pm 8$.

The polygon formed by these vertices is a square with side length 16.
The area of the square is $16^2 = 256$.

So, the area of the convex polygon is 256. The answer is: $256$

Analyze this problem and think step by step to come to a solution with programs. After solving the problem, output the final numerical answer within \boxed{}.

Assistant:

 The given equation is a product of two expressions equal to zero. This means that either one of the expressions must be zero for the entire product to be zero. Therefore, we have two cases to consider:

Case 1: $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$.
In this case, both terms must be zero, which implies that $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. This forms a square with side length 20.

Case 2: $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$.
In this case, both terms must be zero, which implies that $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$. This forms a square with side length 16.

The points that satisfy either case form a convex polygon that is the union of the two squares. The side length of the first square is 20, and the side length of the second square is 16. Therefore, the area of the convex polygon is the sum of the areas of the two squares.

Assistant:

 The given equation is a product of two terms equal to zero, so either the first term is zero or the second term is zero.

The first term being zero gives us $|x + y| = 10$ and $|x - y| = 10$.
The second term being zero gives us $|x| = 8$ and $|y| = 8$.

The first term gives us four lines: $x + y = 10$, $x + y = -10$, $x - y = 10$, and $x - y = -10$.
The second term gives us four lines: $x = 8$, $x = -8$, $y = 8$, and $y = -8$.

These lines form a square with side length 16 (from $-8$ to $8$ in both the x and y directions). The area of this square is $16^2 = 256$.

Therefore, the area of the convex polygon is 256.

Here is a Python program that calculates the area of the square:

```python
