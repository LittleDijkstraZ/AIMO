Below is a math problem you are to solve (positive numerical answer!):
"For how many positive integers $m$ does the equation \[\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}\] have $4$ distinct solutions?"
Analyze this problem and think step by step to come to a solution with programs. After solving the problem, output the final numerical answer within \boxed{}.

Assistant:

 The equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has $4$ distinct solutions if and only if $\frac{m}{100}$ is equal to $2$ (which gives $2$ solutions), $1$ (which gives $4$ solutions), or $0$ (which gives $2$ solutions). 

Therefore, the only value of $m$ that makes the equation have $4$ distinct solutions is $m=100$. So the answer is $1$.
```python


INTERMEDIATE OUT :

def number_of_values_m():
    """For how many positive integers $m$ does the equation \[\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}\] have $4$ distinct solutions?"""
    # The only value of m that makes the equation have 4 distinct solutions is m=100
    return 1

result = number_of_values_m()
print(result)
```

CODE RESULTS 1

INTERMEDIATE OUT :
```output
1
```
The number of positive integers $m$ for which the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has $4$ distinct solutions is $1$. Therefore, the answer is $\boxed{1}$.

Assistant:

 We know that the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has 4 distinct solutions, which means that the right hand side must be equal to 2. This is because the function $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert$ oscillates between 0 and 4, and only when $\frac{m}{100}=2$ will it have 4 distinct solutions.

So we have $\frac{m}{100}=2$, which gives $m=200$. Therefore, there is only one positive integer $m$ that makes the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ have 4 distinct solutions, and that integer is 200.
The answer is: $1$

To find the number of positive integers $m$ for which the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has 4 distinct solutions, we need to analyze the equation and consider the possible values of $m$.

The equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has 4 distinct solutions when $\frac{m}{100}$ is equal to the distance between the two vertical lines in the expression $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert$.

This distance is 2, so we need to find the value of $m$ that makes $\frac{m}{100}=2$. Solving this equation gives $m=200$.

So, there is only one positive integer $m$ that makes the equation have 4 distinct solutions, and that is $m=200$. Therefore, the answer is $1$.
The answer is: $1$
