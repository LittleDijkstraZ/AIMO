The given equation is a product of two expressions equal to zero. This means that either the first expression is zero or the second expression is zero. 

For the first expression, $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + (\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$, this is only possible if $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. This implies that $x + y = \pm 10$ and $x - y = \pm 10$. Solving these equations, we get the four lines $x + y = 10$, $x + y = -10$, $x - y = 10$, and $x - y = -10$. These lines form a square with side length 10.

For the second expression, $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + (\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$, this is only possible if $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$. This implies that $x = \pm 8$ and $y = \pm 8$. So the points $(x, y)$ lie on a square with side length 16.

The area of the convex polygon formed by the intersection of these two squares is the area of the smaller square, which has side length 10 (since the side length of the smaller square is the distance between the lines $x + y = 10$ and $x + y = -10$, which is 10). The area of a square is the square of the side length, so the area of the convex polygon is $10^2 = 100$. The answer is: $100$

 The given equation is a product of two terms equal to zero. Therefore, either the first term is zero or the second term is zero. 

If the first term is zero, we have $\vert x + y \vert - 10 = 0$ and $\vert x - y \vert - 10 = 0$, which implies $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. These are the equations of two lines in the plane, forming a square with side length 20.

If the second term is zero, we have $\vert x \vert - 8 = 0$ and $\vert y \vert - 8 = 0$, which implies $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$. These are the equations of two lines in the plane, forming a square with side length 16.

Therefore, the points satisfying the given equation enclose a square with side length 20. The area of this square is $20^2 = 400$. The answer is: $400$

"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"

The given equation is a product of two expressions equal to zero. This means that either the first expression is zero or the second expression is zero.

The first expression is $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)$ and the second expression is $((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2)$.

If the first expression is zero, then both $\vert x + y \vert - 10 = 0$ and $\vert x - y \vert - 10 = 0$. This implies that $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. The only way this can happen is if $x = y = 5$ or $x = -y = -5$.

If the second expression is zero, then both $\vert x \vert - 8 = 0$ and $\vert y \vert - 8 = 0$. This implies that $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$. The only way this can happen is if $x = 8$ or $x = -8$, and $y = 8$ or $y = -8$.

Therefore, the points that satisfy the equation are $(5, 5)$, $(5, -5)$, $(8, 8)$, $(-8, 8)$, $(8, -8)$, and $(-8, -8)$. These points form a square with side length 10. The area of this square is $10 \times 10 = 100$. So, the area of the convex polygon is 100 square units.

Here is a Python function that calculates the area of the polygon:
```python


INTERMEDIATE OUT :

def polygon_area():
    """The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"""
    side_length = 10
    area = side_length ** 2
    return area

result = polygon_area()
print(result)
```

CODE RESULTS 100

INTERMEDIATE OUT :
```output
100
```
The area of the convex polygon is 100 square units. The answer is $\boxed{100}$.

The given equation is a product of two expressions equal to zero. Therefore, either of the expressions must be zero for the equation to hold true. 

The first expression is $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)$. This expression equals zero if and only if both $|x+y| = 10$ and $|x-y| = 10$. These are the equations of two lines passing through the origin with slopes of $+1$ and $-1$.

The second expression is $((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2)$. This expression equals zero if and only if both $|x| = 8$ and $|y| = 8$. These are the equations of two circles centered at the origin with radius $8$.

The intersection of these lines and circles will form a square with side length $16$ (since the distance from the origin to each of the lines is $10$ and to each of the circles is $8$, and the square is formed by the line segments connecting the points of intersection). The area of this square is $16^2 = 256$.

So the area of the convex polygon is $256$.

The Python code to calculate the area of the square is as follows:
```python


INTERMEDIATE OUT :

def square_area():
    side_length = 16
    area = side_length ** 2
    return area

result = square_area()
print(result)
```

INTERMEDIATE OUT :
```output
256
```
The area of the convex polygon is $256$. The answer is: $256$

 The given equation is equal to zero if and only if both $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ and $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ or both $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ and $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$. This means that either $|x+y| = 10$ and $|x| = 8$ or $|x-y| = 10$ and $|y| = 8$.

The solutions to $|x+y| = 10$ and $|x| = 8$ are the lines $x+y = 10$, $x+y = -10$, $x = 8$, and $x = -8$.

The solutions to $|x-y| = 10$ and $|y| = 8$ are the lines $x-y = 10$, $x-y = -10$, $y = 8$, and $y = -8$.

The eight lines form a rectangle with sides of length 16 and 20. Therefore, the area of the convex polygon is $16 \times 20 = 320$. The answer is: $320$

Assistant:

 The given equation is a product of two terms equal to zero, so either the first term is zero or the second term is zero. This gives us four absolute value equations to solve:

1. $|x + y| - 10 = 0 \implies |x + y| = 10$
2. $|x - y| - 10 = 0 \implies |x - y| = 10$
3. $|x| - 8 = 0 \implies |x| = 8$
4. $|y| - 8 = 0 \implies |y| = 8$

Solving these absolute value equations gives us the vertices of the polygon:

1. $x + y = \pm 10$
2. $x - y = \pm 10$
3. $x = \pm 8$
4. $y = \pm 8$

Solving these equations gives us the vertices of the polygon:

1. $(5, 5), (5, -5), (-5, 5), (-5, -5)$
2. $(10, 0), (-10, 0), (0, 10), (0, -10)$
3. $(8, 0), (-8, 0)$
4. $(0, 8), (0, -8)$

The intersection points of these lines are the vertices of the polygon:

1. $(8, 8), (8, -8), (-8, 8), (-8, -8)$
2. $(8, 2), (8, -2), (-8, 2), (-8, -2)$
3. $(4, 8), (4, -8), (-4, 8), (-4, -8)$
4. $(8, 4), (8, -4), (-8, 4), (-8, -4)$

The polygon is a square with side length 16. The area of the square is $16^2 = 256$. The answer is: $256$

 The given equation is a product of two terms equal to zero. Therefore, either the first term is zero or the second term is zero.

The first term is zero when $\vert x + y \vert - 10 = 0$ and $\vert x - y \vert - 10 = 0$. These two equations imply that $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. This means that $x + y = \pm 10$ and $x - y = \pm 10$. Solving these four equations, we get the vertices of the polygon as $(0, 10), (0, -10), (10, 0), (-10, 0)$.

The second term is zero when $\vert x \vert - 8 = 0$ and $\vert y \vert - 8 = 0$. This means that $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$. So, $x = \pm 8$ and $y = \pm 8$. This gives us the vertices of the polygon as $(8, 8), (8, -8), (-8, 8), (-8, -8)$.

Now, we have the vertices of the polygon: $(0, 10), (0, -10), (10, 0), (-10, 0), (8, 8), (8, -8), (-8, 8), (-8, -8)$. Plotting these points on a graph, we can see that the polygon is a square with side length $10$. The area of a square is side length squared, so the area of this square is $10^2 = 100$.

So, the area of the convex polygon is $100$. The answer is: $100$
