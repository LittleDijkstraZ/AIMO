This problem involves understanding the graph of the absolute value function and how it changes when we have multiple absolute value functions. The equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ will have 4 distinct solutions if the right side $\frac{m}{100}$ is equal to the height of the "bump" in the graph of the absolute value function, which is 2. Therefore, we have $\frac{m}{100}=2$, and solving for $m$ gives $m=200$.

However, we need to check if there are other values of $m$ that would result in 4 distinct solutions. Since the "bump" in the graph of the absolute value function is symmetric around its center, if $\frac{m}{100}$ is less than 2, there will be no solutions; if $\frac{m}{100}$ is equal to 2, there will be 4 distinct solutions; and if $\frac{m}{100}$ is greater than 2, there will be more than 4 distinct solutions.

Therefore, the only value of $m$ that results in 4 distinct solutions is $m=200$. So the answer is $1$.

However, the problem asks for the number of positive integers $m$, not the value of $m$. We have already found that the only value of $m$ that results in 4 distinct solutions is $m=200$, but we are asked for the number of positive integers $m$. Since there is only one positive integer value of $m$ that results in 4 distinct solutions, the answer is $1$.

In conclusion, the number of positive integers $m$ for which the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has 4 distinct solutions is 1.

So the final numerical answer is $1$.
The answer is: $1$

 To solve this problem, we need to analyze the equation and find the value of $m$ for which it has four distinct solutions. The equation is given as $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$, and we want to find the number of positive integer values of $m$ for which this equation has four distinct solutions.

First, let's consider the equation inside the absolute value, i.e., $\vert x-1 \vert -2 = y$, where $y = \pm \frac{m}{100}$. This can be rewritten as $\vert x-1 \vert = y+2$. Now, we have two cases:

1. If $y \geq 0$, then $x-1 = y+2$ or $x-1 = -(y+2)$.
2. If $y < 0$, then $x-1 = y+2$ or $x-1 = -(y+2)$ is not possible, as the absolute value of a quantity cannot be negative.

For the first case, we have $x = y+3$ or $x = -y+1$. For the second case, we only have $x = y+3$.

Now, we need to solve the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert = y$ for each of these cases.

For the first case ($x = y+3$), we have $\vert \vert y+2 \vert -2 \vert = y$. This simplifies to $\vert y \vert = y$, which means $y \geq 0$.

For the second case ($x = -y+1$), we have $\vert \vert -2y+2 \vert -2 \vert = y$. This simplifies to $\vert -2y+2 \vert = y+2$, which leads to two sub-cases:

- If $-2y+2 \geq 0$, we have $-2y+2 = y+2$, which gives $y = 0$. But this doesn't satisfy the condition $-2y+2 \geq 0$.
- If $-2y+2 < 0$, we have $2y-2 = y+2$, which gives $y = 4$. This satisfies the condition $-2y+2 < 0$.

So, we have two possible values for $y$: $0$ and $4$. For $y = 4$, we have $m = 400$.

Therefore, there is only one positive integer value of $m$ for which the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has four distinct solutions. The value of $m$ is $400$. The answer is: $1$

The equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has 4 distinct solutions if and only if $\frac{m}{100} = 1$. This is because the expression inside the absolute value, $\vert x-1 \vert -2$, can take on three different values: $-1, 0, 1$. The value of 1 gives us 4 distinct solutions.

Therefore, we can set up the equation $\frac{m}{100} = 1$ and solve for $m$:

```python


INTERMEDIATE OUT :

from sympy import symbols, Eq, solve

def find_m():
    m = symbols('m')
    equation = Eq(m / 100, 1)
    solution = solve(equation, m)
    return solution[0]

m = find_m()
print(m)
```

CODE RESULTS 100

INTERMEDIATE OUT :
```output
100
```
The value of $m$ that makes the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ have 4 distinct solutions is 100. Therefore, there is only 1 positive integer $m$ that satisfies this condition. The answer is: $\boxed{1}$

 The problem asks for the number of positive integers $m$ such that the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has 4 distinct solutions.

The equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ can be solved graphically by plotting the graphs of $y = \vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert$ and $y = \frac{m}{100}$. The number of intersection points of these two graphs is equal to the number of distinct solutions of the equation.

From the graph of $y = \vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert$, we can see that it has a "V" shape with the "valley" being a distance of $\frac{m}{100}$ units deep. The width of the "valley" (i.e., the number of $x$ values that satisfy the equation) is determined by the value of $\frac{m}{100}$.

To have 4 distinct solutions, the "valley" of the graph of $y = \vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert$ must be deep enough to intersect the horizontal line $y = \frac{m}{100}$ in 4 distinct points.

This occurs when $\frac{m}{100} = 2$, so $m = 200$.

Therefore, there is only one positive integer $m$ that makes the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ have 4 distinct solutions, and that value is $m = 200$. The answer is: $1$
