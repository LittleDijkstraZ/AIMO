Below is a math problem you are to solve (positive numerical answer!):
"What is the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ when $x$ and $y$ range over all real numbers such that $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$?"
Analyze this problem and think step by step to come to a solution with programs. After solving the problem, output the final numerical answer within \boxed{}.

 To solve this problem, we can use the following steps:

1. First, we can rewrite the given equation $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$ as $|2y-x| + |2x-y| = 40$.
2. By the triangle inequality, we know that $|a| + |b| \geq |a+b|$, so $|2y-x| + |2x-y| \geq |(2y-x) + (2x-y)| = |y| = |y-0|$.
3. Therefore, we have $|x-2y| + |y-2x| \geq |y|$ and hence $|y| = 20$.
4. From $|y| = 20$, we know that $y = \pm 20$.
5. Substitute $y = 20$ into the given equation, we get $|x-40| + |40-2x| = 40$.
6. Solving this equation, we find that $x = 20$.
7. Substitute $y = -20$ into the given equation, we get $|x+40| + |-40-2x| = 40$.
8. Solving this equation, we find that $x = -20$.
9. Therefore, the possible pairs of $(x, y)$ are $(20, 20)$ and $(-20, -20)$.
10. Substitute these pairs into the expression $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$, we can calculate the values:
   - For $(x, y) = (20, 20)$, the value is $5*20^2 + 5*20^2 - 8*20*20 = 2000$.
   - For $(x, y) = (-20, -20)$, the value is $5*(-20)^2 + 5*(-20)^2 - 8*(-20)*(-20) = 2000$.
11. Therefore, the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ is 2000.

The answer is: $2000$.

 To solve this problem, we can use the inequality $|a| + |b| \geq |a+b|$, which is known as the triangle inequality. Applying this inequality to the given equation $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$, we get:

$|x-2y| + |y-2x| \geq |(x-2y) + (y-2x)| = |-x - y| = |-(x+y)| = |x+y|$.

So, $|x+y| = 40$.

Now, let's find the minimum value of the expression $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$. We can rewrite this expression as:

$5x^2+5y^2-8xy = \frac{1}{2}((x-2y)^2 + (y-2x)^2) = \frac{1}{2}(|x-2y|^2 + |y-2x|^2)$.

By the triangle inequality, we know that $|x-2y|^2 + |y-2x|^2 \geq (|x-2y| + |y-2x|)^2 = 40^2 = 1600$.

So, $5x^2+5y^2-8xy \geq \frac{1}{2} \cdot 1600 = 800$.

Therefore, the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ is 800. The answer is: $800$

This problem is a bit complex, and a complete solution using Python might be difficult to write in a short space. However, we can use some mathematical insights to simplify the problem and find the minimum value.

The given equation $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$ can be rewritten as $|2y-x| + |2x-y| = 40$.
By the triangle inequality, $|a| + |b| \geq |a+b|$, so $|2y-x| + |2x-y| \geq |(2y-x) + (2x-y)| = |y| = |2y/2| = |2y - x + x - y| = |y - x|$.
Thus, we have $|y - x| = 40$.

Now, let's consider the expression $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$. We can rewrite this as $5(x^2 + y^2) - 8xy = 5[(x-y)^2 + 2xy] - 8xy = 5(x-y)^2 + 2xy$.
By the Cauchy-Schwarz inequality, $(a^2 + b^2)(c^2 + d^2) \geq (ac + bd)^2$, so $(1^2 + 1^2)(x^2 + y^2) \geq (x+y)^2$, or $2(x^2 + y^2) \geq (x+y)^2$.
Since $|x - y| = 40$, we have $(x+y)^2 = (2y - x + 2x - y)^2 = (x - y)^2 = 40^2 = 1600$.
Thus, $2(x^2 + y^2) \geq 1600$, or $x^2 + y^2 \geq 800$.

Substituting this into the expression $5(x^2 + y^2) - 8xy$, we get $5(x^2 + y^2) - 8xy \geq 5*800 - 8xy = 4000 - 8xy$.
To minimize this expression, we need to maximize $8xy$.
By the AM-GM inequality, $a + b \geq 2\sqrt{ab}$, so $x + y \geq 2\sqrt{xy}$, or $(x+y)^2 \geq 4xy$.
Since $(x+y)^2 = 1600$, we have $4xy \leq 1600$, or $xy \leq 400$.

Thus, $8xy \leq 3200$, and the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ is $4000 - 3200 = 800$.
The answer is: $800$

 To solve this problem, we first need to analyze the equation $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$. This equation is equivalent to $|x-2y| = |2x-y| = 20$. This implies that $x-2y = \pm 20$ and $2x-y = \pm 20$. We can solve these two equations to find the possible values of $x$ and $y$. After solving, we find that $x = 10$ and $y = 0$ or $x = 0$ and $y = 10$. 

Now, we substitute these values into the expression $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ to find the minimum value. 

```python

from sympy import symbols

def find_minimum_value():
    x, y = symbols('x y')

    # Define the expression
    expr = 5*x**2 + 5*y**2 - 8*x*y

    # Substitute x = 10, y = 0
    value1 = expr.subs({x: 10, y: 0})

    # Substitute x = 0, y = 10
    value2 = expr.subs({x: 0, y: 10})

    # Find the minimum value
    min_value = min(value1, value2)

    return min_value

result = find_minimum_value()

    x, y = symbols('x y')

    # Define the expression and the constraint
    expr = 5*x**2 + 5*y**2 - 8*x*y
    constraint = Abs(x - 2*y) + Abs(y - 2*x) - 40

    # Solve the constraint for y
    y_expr = solve(constraint, y)[0]

    # Substitute y in the expression
    expr_subs = expr.subs(y, y_expr)

    # Find the derivative of the expression
    diff_expr = diff(expr_subs, x)

    # Find the critical points
    critical_points = solve(diff_expr, x)

    # Evaluate the expression at the critical points
    values = [expr_subs.subs(x, cp) for cp in critical_points]

    # Return the minimum value
