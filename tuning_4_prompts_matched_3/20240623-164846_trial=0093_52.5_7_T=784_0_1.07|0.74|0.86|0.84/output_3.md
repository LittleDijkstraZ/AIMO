The equation given is a product of two expressions equal to zero. This means that either the first expression is zero or the second expression is zero.

Let's analyze the two expressions separately:

1. $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$: This expression is zero if and only if $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. This means that $x + y = \pm 10$ and $x - y = \pm 10$. Solving these equations gives us four lines: $x + y = 10$, $x + y = -10$, $x - y = 10$, and $x - y = -10$. These lines form a square with side length 10.

2. $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$: This expression is zero if and only if $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$. This means that $x = \pm 8$ and $y = \pm 8$. This forms a square with side length 16.

The convex polygon formed by the intersection of these two sets of lines is a smaller square that is contained within the larger square. The side length of the smaller square is the distance between the points where the lines $x + y = 10$ and $x - y = 10$ intersect. Solving these equations simultaneously gives us $x = 5$ and $y = 5$. The distance between $(5, 5)$ and $(5, -5)$ is 10, so the side length of the smaller square is 10.

The area of a square with side length $s$ is $s^2$. Therefore, the area of the convex polygon is $(10)^2 = 100$. The answer is: $100$

The given equation is a product of two expressions equal to zero, which means either the first expression is zero or the second expression is zero. 

Let's consider the first expression:
$$((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2) = 0.$$

This expression is equal to zero if and only if both terms are zero, i.e., $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. These are the equations of two lines in the plane: $x + y = \pm 10$ and $x - y = \pm 10$. These lines divide the plane into four regions.

Now let's consider the second expression:
$$((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0.$$

This expression is equal to zero if and only if both terms are zero, i.e., $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$. These are the equations of two circles in the plane with radius 8 centered at the origin.

The intersection of the regions defined by the lines and the regions defined by the circles is the convex polygon we are interested in. This polygon is a square with side length 16 (since the square is formed by the intersections of the lines $x + y = \pm 10$ and $x - y = \pm 10$ with the circles $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$).

The area of a square is given by the square of the length of its side, so the area of the convex polygon is $16^2 = 256$.

Therefore, the area of the convex polygon is 256 square units. The answer is: $256$

"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"

 The given equation is $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$.
This equation is equal to zero if either of the two factors is zero.

The first factor is zero if $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ or $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. These are the equations of two squares in the coordinate plane, centered at the origin with side length 20.

The second factor is zero if $\vert x \vert = 8$ or $\vert y \vert = 8$. These are the equations of two squares in the coordinate plane, centered at the origin with side length 16.

The intersection of these squares forms a convex polygon. The area of this polygon is the sum of the areas of the two smaller squares minus the area of the larger square.

The side length of the larger square is 20, so its area is $20^2 = 400$. The side length of the smaller squares is 16, so their area is $16^2 = 256$. There are two of them, so their total area is $2*256 = 512$.

Therefore, the area of the convex polygon is $512 - 400 = 112$. The answer is: $112$

"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"

This problem involves understanding the properties of absolute value and the concept of multiplication.

The expression $AB = 0$ means that either $A = 0$ or $B = 0$. Therefore, the given equation is satisfied if either of the following two conditions holds:

1. $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$
2. $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$

For the first condition to be true, both $\vert x + y \vert - 10 = 0$ and $\vert x - y \vert - 10 = 0$, which means $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. This implies that the points lie on the lines $x + y = 10$ and $x - y = 10$ or their opposites.

For the second condition to be true, both $\vert x \vert - 8 = 0$ and $\vert y \vert - 8 = 0$, which means $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$. This implies that the points lie on the lines $x = 8$ and $y = 8$ or their opposites.

Therefore, the points that satisfy the equation are the intersections of these lines. By plotting these lines, we find that they form a square with side length 10 (the square is formed by the lines $x + y = 10$, $x - y = 10$, $x = 8$, and $y = 8$).

The area of a square is given by the square of the length of its side. Therefore, the area of the square is $10^2 = 100$.

So the area of the convex polygon is 100. The answer is: $100$

"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"

This problem involves the properties of absolute value and how it interacts with multiplication and squares.

The expression $A \cdot B = 0$ means that either $A = 0$ or $B = 0$. Therefore, the given equation is equivalent to the system of equations:

1. $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$,
2. $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$,
3. $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$, and
4. $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$.

Each of these equations implies that the absolute value of the corresponding expression is equal to 10 or 8. This results in the following system of inequalities:

1. $|x + y| = 10$,
2. $|x - y| = 10$,
3. $|x| = 8$, and
4. $|y| = 8$.

The solutions to these equations and inequalities are the vertices of the polygon.

For $|x + y| = 10$, the solutions are $(x, y) = (0, 10)$, $(0, -10)$, $(10, 0)$, and $(-10, 0)$.
For $|x - y| = 10$, the solutions are $(x, y) = (10, 0)$, $(0, 10)$, $(-10, 0)$, and $(0, -10)$.
For $|x| = 8$, the solutions are $(x, y) = (8, y)$ and $(-8, y)$ for any $y$.
For $|y| = 8$, the solutions are $(x, y) = (x, 8)$ and $(x, -8)$ for any $x$.

The polygon is a square with side length 16, so its area is $16^2 = 256$.

Therefore, the area of the convex polygon is 256. The answer is: $256$

 The given equation is a product of two expressions equal to zero, which means either of the expressions must be zero for the entire product to be zero. So we have two sets of equations to solve:

1. $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ and $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$
2. $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ and $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$

From the first set of equations, we get $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. This means $x + y = \pm 10$ and $x - y = \pm 10$. Solving these equations, we get the vertices of the first set of lines as $(0, 10)$, $(0, -10)$, $(10, 0)$, and $(-10, 0)$.

From the second set of equations, we get $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$. This means $x = \pm 8$ and $y = \pm 8$. Solving these equations, we get the vertices of the second set of lines as $(8, 0)$, $(-8, 0)$, $(0, 8)$, and $(0, -8)$.

The convex polygon formed by these vertices is a square with side length 10. The area of this square is $10^2 = 100$. So the area of the convex polygon is 100 square units.
