Below is a math problem you are to solve (positive numerical answer!):
"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"
Analyze this problem and think step by step to come to a solution with programs. After solving the problem, output the final numerical answer within \boxed{}.

Assistant:

 The given equation is equal to zero if and only if both of the factors are equal to zero. Therefore, we have two sets of equations to solve:

1. $|x + y| - 10 = 0$ and $|x - y| - 10 = 0$
2. $|x| - 8 = 0$ and $|y| - 8 = 0$

For the first set of equations, we have:

1. $|x + y| = 10$
2. $|x - y| = 10$

This implies that $x + y = \pm 10$ and $x - y = \pm 10$. Solving these equations, we get the vertices of the polygon: $(0, 10), (0, -10), (10, 0), (-10, 0), (8, 8), (8, -8), (-8, 8), (-8, -8)$.

For the second set of equations, we have:

1. $|x| = 8$ which implies $x = \pm 8$
2. $|y| = 8$ which implies $y = \pm 8$

So the vertices of the polygon are also $(8, 8), (8, -8), (-8, 8), (-8, -8)$.

The polygon is a square with side length 16. The area of a square is side length squared, so the area of the polygon is $16^2 = 256$. The answer is: $256$

Below is a math problem you are to solve (positive numerical answer!):
"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"

Assistant:

 The equation given in the problem is a product of two expressions equal to zero. This means that either the first expression is zero or the second expression is zero. 

The first expression is $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)$. This expression is zero if and only if both $\vert x + y \vert - 10 = 0$ and $\vert x - y \vert - 10 = 0$. This implies that $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. The solutions to these equations are the lines $x + y = 10$, $x + y = -10$, $x - y = 10$, and $x - y = -10$. These lines form a rectangle with vertices at $(0, 10)$, $(10, 0)$, $(0, -10)$, and $(-10, 0)$.

The second expression is $((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2)$. This expression is zero if and only if both $\vert x \vert - 8 = 0$ and $\vert y \vert - 8 = 0$. This implies that $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$. The solutions to these equations are the lines $x = 8$, $x = -8$, $y = 8$, and $y = -8$. These lines form a square with vertices at $(8, 8)$, $(8, -8)$, $(-8, 8)$, and $(-8, -8)$.

The intersection of the rectangle and the square is the convex polygon that encloses the points satisfying the given equation. The convex polygon is a smaller square with side length 10 and vertices at $(0, 0)$, $(0, 10)$, $(10, 0)$, and $(0, -10)$.

The area of this square is $10^2 = 100$.

So, the area of the convex polygon is 100. The answer is: $100$

 The equation $A \cdot B = 0$ implies that either $A = 0$ or $B = 0$. Therefore, the given equation is equivalent to either $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$, $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$, $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$, or $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$.

From $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$, we have $\vert x + y \vert = 10$, which gives us two lines: $x + y = 10$ and $x + y = -10$.

From $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$, we have $\vert x - y \vert = 10$, which gives us two lines: $x - y = 10$ and $x - y = -10$.

From $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$, we have $\vert x \vert = 8$, which gives us two lines: $x = 8$ and $x = -8$.

From $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$, we have $\vert y \vert = 8$, which gives us two lines: $y = 8$ and $y = -8$.

These lines form a square with side length 16. The area of this square is $16^2 = 256$.
The answer is: $256$

Assistant:

 The given equation is a product of two expressions equal to zero, so it is equal to zero when either of the expressions is zero. This means that the points that satisfy the equation are the union of the points that satisfy each of the two expressions being zero.

The expression $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ implies that $\vert x + y \vert = 10$, which means $x + y = \pm 10$. Similarly, the expression $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ implies that $\vert x - y \vert = 10$, which means $x - y = \pm 10$. These four lines form a rectangle with vertices at $(10,0)$, $(-10,0)$, $(0,10)$, and $(0,-10)$.

The expression $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ implies that $\vert x \vert = 8$, which means $x = \pm 8$. Similarly, the expression $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ implies that $\vert y \vert = 8$, which means $y = \pm 8$. These four lines form a square with vertices at $(8,8)$, $(8,-8)$, $(-8,8)$, and $(-8,-8)$.

The convex polygon formed by the union of the points that satisfy either of the expressions being zero is the intersection of the rectangle and the square, which is a smaller square with side length 10. The area of this square is $10^2 = 100$.

So, the area of the convex polygon is 100. The answer is: $100$

 The given equation is a product of two expressions equal to zero, which means either the first expression is zero or the second expression is zero. 

For the first expression, we have $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$. This implies that $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. This means that the points $(x, y)$ lie on the lines $x + y = 10$ and $x - y = 10$. These lines intersect at $(5, 5)$.

For the second expression, we have $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$. This implies that $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$. This means that the points $(x, y)$ lie on the lines $x = 8$ and $y = 8$. These lines intersect at $(8, 8)$.

The four lines $x + y = 10$, $x - y = 10$, $x = 8$, and $y = 8$ enclose a rectangle with vertices at $(5, 5)$, $(8, 8)$, $(8, 5)$, and $(5, 8)$. The side lengths of the rectangle are 3 units (from $x = 8$ to $x = 5$) and 3 units (from $y = 8$ to $y = 5$), so the area of the rectangle is $3 \times 3 = 9$ square units.
The answer is: $9$

 The given equation is a product of two terms equal to zero, which means that either one of the terms is zero or both are zero.
The first term, $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)$, is zero if and only if $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$.
The second term, $((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2)$, is zero if and only if $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$.
The solutions to these equations are the vertices of the convex polygon.
The vertices of the polygon are the intersections of the lines $\vert x + y \vert = 10$, $\vert x - y \vert = 10$, $\vert x \vert = 8$, and $\vert y \vert = 8$.
The lines $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$ form a square with side length 10, and the lines $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$ form a square with side length 16.
The intersection of these two squares is a smaller square with side length 8.
Therefore, the area of the convex polygon is the area of the smaller square, which is $8^2 = 64$.
The answer is: $64$

 The given equation is a product of two terms equal to zero, so either the first term is zero or the second term is zero.

The first term is zero when either $|x + y| - 10 = 0$ or $|x - y| - 10 = 0$. These equations simplify to $|x + y| = 10$ and $|x - y| = 10$. The solutions to these equations are the lines $x + y = 10$, $x + y = -10$, $x - y = 10$, and $x - y = -10$. These lines form a rectangle with vertices at $(0, 10)$, $(10, 0)$, $(-10, 0)$, and $(0, -10)$.

The second term is zero when either $|x| - 8 = 0$ or $|y| - 8 = 0$. These equations simplify to $|x| = 8$ and $|y| = 8$. The solutions to these equations are the lines $x = 8$, $x = -8$, $y = 8$, and $y = -8$. These lines form a rectangle with vertices at $(8, 0)$, $(0, 8)$, $(0, -8)$, and $(-8, 0)$.

The intersection of the two rectangles is a square with side length 10, so its area is $10^2 = 100$. The answer is: $100$

"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"

 The equation given in the problem is a product of two expressions equal to zero. This means that either the first expression is zero or the second expression is zero.

The first expression is $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)$ and the second expression is $((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2)$.

If the first expression is zero, then $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. This means that $x + y = \pm 10$ and $x - y = \pm 10$. Solving these equations gives us the vertices of the polygon.

If the second expression is zero, then $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$. This means that $x = \pm 8$ and $y = \pm 8$. Solving these equations gives us the vertices of the polygon.

By analyzing the solutions, we find that the polygon is a square with side length 16. The area of a square is given by the square of the length of its side. Therefore, the area of the polygon is $16^2 = 256$. The answer is: $256$

Assistant:

 The equation $AB=0$ is true if and only if $A=0$ or $B=0$. So the given equation is equivalent to either $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$, $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$, $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$, or $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$.

The equation $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ implies $\vert x + y \vert = 10$, which means $x + y = \pm 10$. Similarly, $\vert x - y \vert = 10$ implies $x - y = \pm 10$, $\vert x \vert = 8$ implies $x = \pm 8$, and $\vert y \vert = 8$ implies $y = \pm 8$.

These equations represent 8 lines in the coordinate plane: $x + y = 10$, $x + y = -10$, $x - y = 10$, $x - y = -10$, $x = 8$, $x = -8$, $y = 8$, and $y = -8$. The intersections of these lines form a square with side length 16. The area of this square is $16^2 = 256$.

So the area of the convex polygon is 256. The answer is: $256$
