Below is a math problem you are to solve (positive numerical answer!):
"For how many positive integers $m$ does the equation \[\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}\] have $4$ distinct solutions?"
Analyze this problem and think step by step to come to a solution with programs. After solving the problem, output the final numerical answer within \boxed{}.

Assistant:

 The equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has four distinct solutions when $\frac{m}{100}$ is equal to $2$. This is because the expression inside the absolute value, $\vert x-1 \vert -2$, will be equal to $2$ or $-2$ four times when solving the equation.

Therefore, we need to find the value of $m$ such that $\frac{m}{100} = 2$.

```python


INTERMEDIATE OUT :

def find_m():
    m = 2 * 100
    return m

result = find_m()
print(result)
```

```
The value of $m$ that makes the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ have four distinct solutions is $200$.
The answer is: $1$

Below is a math problem you are to solve (positive numerical answer!):
"For how many positive integers $m$ does the equation \[\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}\] have $4$ distinct solutions?"
Analyze this problem and think step by step to come to a solution with programs. After solving the problem, output the final numerical answer within \boxed{}.

Assistant:

 The problem asks for how many positive integers $m$ the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has $4$ distinct solutions.

The equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ is a piecewise function with $4$ cases to consider. The number of solutions to this equation will be the number of times the right side of the equation intersects the piecewise function on the left side.

By analyzing the piecewise function, we find that the equation has $4$ distinct solutions when $\frac{m}{100} = 2$. This gives $m = 200$.

Therefore, the only positive integer $m$ for which the equation has $4$ distinct solutions is $200$. So the answer is $1$.

```python


INTERMEDIATE OUT :

def number_of_m():
    """For how many positive integers $m$ does the equation \[\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}\] have $4$ distinct solutions?"""
    m = 200
    return 1

result = number_of_m()
print(result)
```

The number of positive integers $m$ for which the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has $4$ distinct solutions is $1$. The answer is: $1$.

Assistant:

 The equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has 4 distinct solutions if and only if $\frac{m}{100}$ is equal to 2. This is because the function $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert$ has 4 distinct roots when it equals 2. Therefore, we can set up the equation $\frac{m}{100}=2$ and solve for $m$.

```python


INTERMEDIATE OUT :

from sympy import symbols, Eq, solve

def find_m():
    m = symbols('m')
    equation = Eq(m / 100, 2)
    solution = solve(equation, m)
    return solution[0]

result = find_m()
print(result)
```

CODE RESULTS 200

INTERMEDIATE OUT :
```output
200
```
The value of $m$ that makes the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ have 4 distinct solutions is 200. Therefore, the number of positive integers $m$ that satisfy this condition is 1. The answer is: $1$
