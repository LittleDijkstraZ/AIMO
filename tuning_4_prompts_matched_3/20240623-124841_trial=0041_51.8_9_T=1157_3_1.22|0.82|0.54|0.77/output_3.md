Approach:



The given equation is a product of two expressions, and for the product to be zero, either one of the expressions has to be zero. Therefore, we can set each of the expressions to zero and solve for the possible values of $x$ and $y$.

1. $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ implies $\vert x + y \vert = 10$. This gives us two equations: $x + y = 10$ and $x + y = -10$.
2. $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ implies $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. This gives us two more equations: $x - y = 10$ and $x - y = -10$.
3. $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ implies $\vert x \vert = 8$. This gives us two more equations: $x = 8$ and $x = -8$.
4. $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ implies $\vert y \vert = 8$. This gives us two more equations: $y = 8$ and $y = -8$.

Solving these equations, we find the vertices of the polygon to be: $(8,8), (8,-8), (-8,8), (-8,-8)$.

These points form a square with side length 16. The area of a square is given by the square of the length of its side. Therefore, the area of the convex polygon is $16^2 = 256$.

The answer is: $\boxed{256}$

The equation $AB=0$ implies that either $A=0$ or $B=0$. So, we can solve the equation $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$.

The equations $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ and $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ imply that $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$.
The equations $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ and $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ imply that $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$.

Solving these equations, we get the points:
For $\vert x + y \vert = 10$, the points are $(8,2)$ , $(-8,18)$ , $(18,-8)$ , and $(-18,8)$.
For $\vert x - y \vert = 10$, the points are $(8,-2)$ , $(-8,-18)$ , $(18,8)$ , and $(-18,-8)$.
For $\vert x \vert = 8$, the points are $(8,y)$ for $-8 \leq y \leq 8$.
For $\vert y \vert = 8$, the points are $(x,8)$ for $-8 \leq x \leq 8$.

Plotting these points on a graph, we can see that they form a square with side length 16.

The area of the square is $16^2 = 256$.
The answer is: $256$.

Approach:


The equation $A \cdot B = 0$ is equivalent to $A = 0$ or $B = 0$. Therefore, the given equation is equivalent to either $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$. 

The equation $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ implies that $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. This means that the points $(x, y)$ lie on the lines $x + y = 10$ and $x - y = 10$, which intersect at $(5, 5)$.

The equation $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ implies that $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$, which means that $x = \pm 8$ and $y = \pm 8$. This forms a square with side length 16.

Therefore, the points satisfying the given equation form a square with side length 10, and the area of this square is $10^2 = 100$. The answer is: $100$

Solve the following problem with a Python Script (positive numerical answer):
"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"

Approach:


The equation is $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$. According to the zero product rule, this equation will be true if either of the two factors is equal to zero. Therefore, we can solve the equation $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$, $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$, $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$, or $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$.

Solving each of these equations:

1. $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0 \implies \vert x + y \vert = 10$. This gives us two lines $x + y = 10$ and $x + y = -10$.

2. $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0 \implies \vert x - y \vert = 10$. This gives us two lines $x - y = 10$ and $x - y = -10$.

3. $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0 \implies \vert x \vert = 8$. This gives us two lines $x = 8$ and $x = -8$.

4. $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0 \implies \vert y \vert = 8$. This gives us two lines $y = 8$ and $y = -8$.

The four lines from (1), (2), (3), and (4) enclose a rectangle with sides 16 units long (from $x = 8$ to $x = -8$ or $y = 8$ to $y = -8$). The area of this rectangle is $16 \times 16 = 256$. So the area of the convex polygon is 256 square units. The answer is: $256$

Solve the following problem with a Python Script (positive numerical answer):
"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"

Assistant:

Approach:


The equation $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ is satisfied if either of the two factors is zero. This gives us two conditions:

1. $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$
2. $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$

For the first condition to be true, both $\vert x + y \vert - 10 = 0$ and $\vert x - y \vert - 10 = 0$, which means $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. This forms a square with side length 10.

For the second condition to be true, both $\vert x \vert - 8 = 0$ and $\vert y \vert - 8 = 0$, which means $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$. This forms a square with side length 16.

However, the first square is inside the second square, so the area of the convex polygon is the area of the outer square minus the area of the inner square.

The area of a square with side length $s$ is $s^2$. So, the area of the outer square is $16^2 = 256$ and the area of the inner square is $10^2 = 100$.

Therefore, the area of the convex polygon is $256 - 100 = 156$.
The answer is $\boxed{156}$.

Approach:

 The equation $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ implies that $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. The equations $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$ imply that $-8 \leq x, y \leq 8$. Combining these equations gives a square with side length 16. Therefore, the area of the square is $16^2 = 256$.
The answer is: $256$
