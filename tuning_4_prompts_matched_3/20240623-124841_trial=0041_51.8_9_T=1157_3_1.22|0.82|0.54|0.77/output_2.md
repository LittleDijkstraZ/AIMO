Approach:

 The equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has $4$ distinct solutions if and only if $\frac{m}{100}$ is a positive number less than $2$. This is because the expression inside the absolute value, $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert$, ranges from $0$ to $4$, and only the interval $(0,2)$ will produce $4$ distinct solutions. Therefore, we want to find how many positive integers $m$ satisfy $\frac{m}{100} < 2$.

Solving the inequality $\frac{m}{100} < 2$ gives $m < 200$. The positive integers $m$ that satisfy this inequality are all the integers from $1$ to $199$. Therefore, there are $199$ positive integers $m$ for which the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has $4$ distinct solutions. The answer is: $199$.

Approach:

 The equation $ \vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100} $ has four distinct solutions if and only if $ \frac{m}{100} $ is strictly between $1$ and $2$, because the expression on the left can take on the values $0$, $1$, $2$, and $3$ only. This is equivalent to $1 < \frac{m}{100} < 2$, or $100 < m < 200$. Since $m$ is a positive integer, the number of such $m$ is $100$. The answer is: $100$

Approach:

 The equation $| |x-1|-2|=\frac{m}{100}$ has 4 distinct solutions. Let's consider the number of solutions to the equation $|y-2|=\frac{m}{100}$.

1. If $y>2$, then the equation becomes $y-2=\frac{m}{100}$, and we have $y=2+\frac{m}{100}$.
2. If $y<2$, then the equation becomes $2-y=\frac{m}{100}$, and we have $y=2-\frac{m}{100}$.

The original equation $| |x-1|-2|=\frac{m}{100}$ has 4 distinct solutions, which means the equation $|y-2|=\frac{m}{100}$ has 4 distinct solutions. 

This can happen in two ways:

1. $2-\frac{m}{100}<2<\frac{m}{100}+2$, which simplifies to $0<\frac{m}{100}<2$, and thus $0<m<200$.
2. $\frac{m}{100}+2<2<2-\frac{m}{100}$, which simplifies to $\frac{m}{100}<0$, and thus $m<0$. But $m$ is a positive integer, so there are no solutions in this case.

Therefore, the positive integers $m$ for which the equation has 4 distinct solutions are the integers from 1 to 199. The number of such integers is 199. The answer is: $199$

Solve the following problem with a Python Script (positive numerical answer):
"For how many positive integers $m$ does the equation \[\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}\] have $4$ distinct solutions?"
Write comments to indicate the steps you take. Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Approach:


To solve this problem, we need to count the number of positive integers $m$ for which the equation \[\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}\] has exactly 4 distinct solutions.

Step 1: Analyze the equation.
The equation \[\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}\] is a combination of absolute value functions. The solutions to this equation can be determined by considering the different cases for the absolute value functions.

Step 2: Identify the possible values of $m$.
For the equation to have exactly 4 distinct solutions, the value of $\frac{m}{100}$ must be chosen such that the graph of the left-hand side has exactly 4 intersections with the graph of the right-hand side.

After analyzing the different cases and graphing the left-hand side for different values of $m$, we find that the only value of $m$ that gives 4 distinct solutions is $m=200$.

Step 3: Count the number of positive integers $m$.
There is only one positive integer, $200$, that satisfies the condition of having 4 distinct solutions.

So, the number of positive integers $m$ for which the equation \[\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}\] has 4 distinct solutions is 1.
The answer is: $\boxed{1}$

Approach:



This problem involves understanding the absolute value function and finding the number of distinct solutions to the equation. We need to find the value of $m$ for which the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has 4 distinct solutions.

1. First, let's simplify the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$.

2. For the equation to have 4 distinct solutions, the value of $\frac{m}{100}$ must be a number such that the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=k$ (where $k=\frac{m}{100}$) has 4 distinct solutions.

3. The equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=k$ can be solved as a pair of absolute value equations: $\vert x-1 \vert -2 = k$ and $\vert x-1 \vert -2 = -k$.

4. Solving these equations gives us four cases to consider:
   a. $\vert x-1 \vert = k+2$
   b. $\vert x-1 \vert = 2-k$
   c. $\vert x-1 \vert = -k+2$
   d. $\vert x-1 \vert = -2+k$

5. For each of these cases, we need to find the values of $k$ (or $m$) for which there are 4 distinct solutions.

6. After finding these values, we count the number of such $k$ (or $m$) values.

Python Script:

Please provide a Python script to find the solution.

Solution:

The solution to this problem involves complex mathematical analysis and is beyond the scope of a simple Python script. However, it can be solved using a systematic approach involving the properties of absolute value functions and the number of solutions to equations. The solution to this problem is $1$. The value of $m$ for which the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has 4 distinct solutions is $m=100$.
The answer is: $1$

Assistant:

Approach:



The equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has 4 distinct solutions when $\frac{m}{100}$ is less than 2 but greater than 0. This is because the function $| |x-1|-2|$ has a maximum value of 2 and a minimum value of 0. So, for the equation to have 4 distinct solutions, $\frac{m}{100}$ must be in the interval $(0,2)$. This gives us the inequality $0<\frac{m}{100}<2$.

Solving this inequality, we get $0*100 < m < 2*100$, or $0 < m < 200$.

The positive integers $m$ that satisfy this inequality are the integers from 1 to 199. However, since we want the number of positive integers $m$ such that the equation has 4 distinct solutions, we must count the number of positive integers from 1 to 199.

The number of positive integers from 1 to 199 is simply 199.

Therefore, the number of positive integers $m$ such that the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has 4 distinct solutions is 199.
The answer is: $199$

Assistant:

Approach:

 To solve the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ with $4$ distinct solutions, we first need to understand the behavior of the function $f(x) = \vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert$. The function has four distinct solutions when $\frac{m}{100}$ is the distance between any two successive peaks of the function $f(x)$.

The function $f(x)$ is a "two-peaked" function, with each peak at a distance of $2$ from its neighboring valleys. Therefore, the distance between any two successive peaks is $4$. This means that $\frac{m}{100} = 4$, or $m = 400$.

So, there is only one value of $m$ for which the equation has $4$ distinct solutions, and that value is $m = 400$.
The answer is: $1$

"For how many positive integers $m$ does the equation \[\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}\] have $4$ distinct solutions?"
Write comments to indicate the steps you take. Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Assistant:

Approach:

 The equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has $4$ distinct solutions if and only if the number $\frac{m}{100}$ is between $1$ and $2$ (inclusive). This is because the expression on the left-hand side of the equation, $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert$, can only take on integer values between $1$ and $2$ inclusive. The only integer value that it can take on is the number of "jumps" it makes from one vertical line to the next in the graph of $y = \vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert$.

So we need to find how many values of $m$ there are such that $1 \leq \frac{m}{100} \leq 2$. Multiplying all parts of the inequality by $100$ gives $100 \leq m \leq 200$. So the number of positive integer values of $m$ is the number of integers from $100$ to $200$, inclusive. This can be found by subtracting the smallest integer from the largest and then adding $1$: $200 - 100 + 1 = 101$.

So there are $101$ positive integers $m$ such that the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has $4$ distinct solutions.
The answer is: $101$

Assistant:

Approach:


We can start by considering the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$.
We know that the expression inside the absolute value on the left-hand side, $\vert x-1 \vert -2$, can take on three different forms depending on the value of $x$:

1. If $x < 1$, then $\vert x-1 \vert -2 = -(x-1) -2 = -x + 1 -2 = -x -1$.
2. If $1 \leq x \leq 3$, then $\vert x-1 \vert -2 = x - 1 -2 = x - 3$.
3. If $x > 3$, then $\vert x-1 \vert -2 = x - 1 -2 = x - 3$.

So the equation becomes:

1. If $x < 1$, then $\vert -x -1 \vert = \frac{m}{100}$, which simplifies to $\vert x + 1 \vert = \frac{m}{100}$. This has two solutions: $x = \frac{m}{100} - 1$ and $x = -\frac{m}{100} - 1$. But since $x < 1$, we only keep the solution $x = \frac{m}{100} - 1$.
2. If $1 \leq x \leq 3$, then $\vert x - 3 \vert = \frac{m}{100}$. This simplifies to two equations: $x - 3 = \frac{m}{100}$ and $3 - x = \frac{m}{100}$. The solutions are $x = \frac{m}{100} + 3$ and $x = 3 - \frac{m}{100}$.
3. If $x > 3$, then $\vert x - 3 \vert = \frac{m}{100}$, which simplifies to $x - 3 = \frac{m}{100}$. The solution is $x = \frac{m}{100} + 3$.

For the equation to have four distinct solutions, we need two of the solutions from case 1, one from case 2, and one from case 3 to be distinct. This gives us the following inequalities:

$\frac{m}{100} - 1 < 1$, which simplifies to $m > 100$.
$\frac{m}{100} + 3 > 3$, which simplifies to $m > 0$.
$\frac{m}{100} + 3 > 1$, which simplifies to $m > -200$.
$\frac{m}{100} + 3 < 3 + \frac{m}{100}$, which simplifies to $m < \infty$.
$3 - \frac{m}{100} < 3$, which simplifies to $m > 0$.
$3 - \frac{m}{100} > 1$, which simplifies to $m < 200$.

The common range of $m$ that satisfies all these inequalities is $100 < m < 200$. The positive integers $m$ in this range are the integers from 101 to 199, inclusive. To count the number of these integers, we subtract the smallest value from the largest value and add 1: $199 - 101 + 1 = 99$.
So there are 99 positive integers $m$ such that the equation has four distinct solutions.

The answer is: $99$

Assistant:

Approach:



The number of distinct solutions of the equation \[\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}\] is determined by the value of $m/100$.

When $m/100 = 2$, the equation has four distinct solutions. This is because the expression inside the absolute value on the left-hand side of the equation becomes zero, which gives two solutions, and then the absolute value on the left-hand side makes the two solutions symmetric about the number 1, giving four distinct solutions in total.

Therefore, the number of positive integers $m$ such that the equation has four distinct solutions is 1.
The answer is: $\boxed{1}$.
