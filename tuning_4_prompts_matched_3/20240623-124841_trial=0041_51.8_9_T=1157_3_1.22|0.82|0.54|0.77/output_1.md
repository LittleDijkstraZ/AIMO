Approach:


To find the minimum value of the expression $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ subject to the constraint $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$, we can use the method of Lagrange multipliers. This involves introducing a new variable $\lambda$ and considering the expression $5x^2+5y^2-8xy - \lambda(|x-2y| + |y-2x|)$.

First, we need to find the critical points of this expression by setting its partial derivatives with respect to $x$, $y$, and $\lambda$ to zero. This gives us three equations:

1. $\frac{\partial}{\partial x} (5x^2+5y^2-8xy - \lambda(|x-2y| + |y-2x|)) = 10x - 8y + 2\lambda(2y - x) = 0$
2. $\frac{\partial}{\partial y} (5x^2+5y^2-8xy - \lambda(|x-2y| + |y-2x|)) = 10y - 8x + 2\lambda(2x - y) = 0$
3. $\frac{\partial}{\partial \lambda} (5x^2+5y^2-8xy - \lambda(|x-2y| + |y-2x|)) = |x-2y| + |y-2x| - 40 = 0$

These equations are quite complicated, and solving them analytically is not straightforward. However, we can simplify the problem by noting that the expression $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ can be rewritten as $(x-2y)^2 + (y-2x)^2$. This is the square of the distance between the points $(x,y)$ and $(2y,2x)$ in the plane. Therefore, the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ occurs when $(x,y)$ is the midpoint of the line segment connecting $(x,y)$ and $(2y,2x)$. In other words, the minimum occurs when $x = \frac{x+2y}{2}$ and $y = \frac{y+2x}{2}$. Solving these equations gives $x = y = \frac{40}{6} = \frac{20}{3}$.

Substituting these values into the expression $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ gives:
\[5\left(\frac{20}{3}\right)^2 + 5\left(\frac{20}{3}\right)^2 - 8\left(\frac{20}{3}\right)\left(\frac{20}{3}\right) = -\frac{400}{9}.\]

Therefore, the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ is $-\frac{400}{9}$.
The answer is: $-\frac{400}{9}$

"What is the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ when $x$ and $y$ range over all real numbers such that $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$?"

Approach:


We can start by simplifying the equation $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$.
By the absolute value definition, we have $|x-2y| = |2x-y|$ and $|y-2x| = |2y-x|$. So we can rewrite the equation as $|x-2y| + |2x-y| = 40$.
By the triangle inequality, we have $|a+b| \leq |a| + |b|$ for all real numbers $a$ and $b$. Therefore, $|x-2y| + |2x-y| \geq |x-2y + 2x-y| = |3x-3y| = 3|x-y|$.
Setting this equal to 40, we have $3|x-y| = 40$, so $|x-y| = \frac{40}{3}$.
Now, let's consider the expression $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$. We can rewrite this as $\frac{5}{2}[(x-y)^2 + (x+y)^2] - 8xy$.
By the previous result, we know that $(x-y)^2 = \left(\frac{40}{3}\right)^2 = \frac{1600}{9}$.
Now we need to find an expression for $(x+y)^2$. Since $|x-y| = \frac{40}{3}$, we have $x-y = \pm \frac{40}{3}$. Adding these two equations gives $2x = y \pm \frac{40}{3}$, so $x+y = \pm \frac{40}{3}$.
Substituting this into the expression for $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$, we have $\frac{5}{2}\left[\frac{1600}{9} + \left(\pm \frac{40}{3}\right)^2\right] - 8xy$.
Simplifying this expression gives $\frac{5}{2}\left[\frac{1600}{9} + \frac{1600}{9}\right] - 8xy = \frac{1600}{3} - 8xy$.
To minimize this expression, we need to maximize $8xy$.
Since $x$ and $y$ are related by $x \pm y = \frac{40}{3}$, we can express $y$ in terms of $x$ as $y = \frac{40}{3} - x$.
Substituting this into the expression $8xy$, we have $8x\left(\frac{40}{3} - x\right) = \frac{320x}{3} - 8x^2$.
To maximize this expression, we can take the derivative with respect to $x$ and set it equal to 0. The derivative is $\frac{320}{3} - 16x$, so setting this equal to 0 gives $x = \frac{20}{3}$.
Substituting this back into the equation $y = \frac{40}{3} - x$ gives $y = \frac{20}{3}$.
Substituting these values of $x$ and $y$ into the expression $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ gives $5\left(\frac{20}{3}\right)^2 + 5\left(\frac{20}{3}\right)^2 - 8\left(\frac{20}{3}\right)\left(\frac{20}{3}\right) = \frac{800}{9}$.
Therefore, the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ is $\frac{800}{9}$. The answer is: $\boxed{\frac{800}{9}}$

Approach:


This problem involves finding the minimum value of a quadratic function under a constraint. We can use the method of Lagrange multipliers to solve this problem. The constraint equation is $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$. We first simplify the constraint equation:
$$|x-2y| + |y-2x| = (x-2y) + (y-2x) \text{ if } x \ge 2y \text{ and } y \le 2x,$$
$$|x-2y| + |y-2x| = -(x-2y) - (y-2x) \text{ if } x \le 2y \text{ and } y \ge 2x.$$
Simplifying further, we get:
$$(x-2y) + (y-2x) = -y - x = -40,$$
$$-(x-2y) - (y-2x) = -3(x-y) = 40.$$
From these equations, we have $x-y = -\frac{40}{3}$.

Now, we substitute this into the constraint equation to eliminate one variable:
$$x = y - \frac{40}{3}.$$
Substitute this into the function to minimize:
$$f(x, y) = 5x^2 + 5y^2 - 8xy = 5\left(y - \frac{40}{3}\right)^2 + 5y^2 - 8y\left(y - \frac{40}{3}\right)$$
Simplify the function:
$$f(x, y) = 5\left(y^2 - \frac{80y}{3} + \frac{1600}{9}\right) + 5y^2 - 8y^2 + \frac{320y}{3}$$
$$f(x, y) = 10y^2 - \frac{400y}{3} + \frac{1600}{9}.$$
To find the minimum of this function, we take the derivative with respect to $y$ and set it equal to zero:
$$\frac{df}{dy} = 20y - \frac{400}{3} = 0.$$
Solving for $y$, we get $y = \frac{20}{3}$.
Substitute this value back into the equation $x = y - \frac{40}{3}$:
$$x = \frac{20}{3} - \frac{40}{3} = -\frac{20}{3}.$$
Now, we substitute these values of $x$ and $y$ into the function to minimize:
$$f(x, y) = 5\left(-\frac{20}{3}\right)^2 + 5\left(\frac{20}{3}\right)^2 - 8\left(-\frac{20}{3}\right)\left(\frac{20}{3}\right)$$
$$f(x, y) = 5\left(\frac{400}{9}\right) + 5\left(\frac{400}{9}\right) + \frac{3200}{9}$$
$$f(x, y) = \frac{4000}{9}.$$
Therefore, the minimum value of the function $5x^2 + 5y^2 - 8xy$ is $\frac{4000}{9}$ when $x = -\frac{20}{3}$ and $y = \frac{20}{3}$. The answer is: $\boxed{\frac{4000}{9}}$

Assistant:

Approach:


We can solve this problem by first simplifying the expression $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ and then use the given condition $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$ to find the minimum value.

First, we can rewrite the expression $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ as $5(x^2+y^2) - 8xy$. Now, we can complete the square for the expression $x^2 - 8xy + y^2$. We have
\[x^2 - 8xy + y^2 = (x - 4y)^2 - 16y^2.\]
Thus,
\[5(x^2+y^2) - 8xy = 5[(x - 4y)^2 - 16y^2] + 20y^2 = 5(x - 4y)^2 - 80y^2 + 20y^2 = 5(x - 4y)^2 - 60y^2.\]
This expression reaches its minimum when $(x - 4y)^2 = 0$ and $y^2 = 0$, which gives us $x = 4y$ and $y = 0$. Therefore, $x = 0$.

Now, we need to find the value of the expression $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ when $x = 0$ and $y = 0$. This gives us $0$.

However, we also need to consider the condition $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$. Substituting $x = 0$ and $y = 0$, we get $0 + 0 = 40$, which is not true. Therefore, we need to find another solution for $x$ and $y$.

From the condition $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$, we can rewrite it as $|x-2y| + |2y-x| = 40$. This gives us two cases:

1. $x - 2y + 2y - x = 40$, which simplifies to $0 = 40$, which is not true.
2. $x - 2y - (2y - x) = 40$, which simplifies to $2x - 4y = 40$, or $x - 2y = 20$.

Solving the system of equations $x - 4y = 0$ and $x - 2y = 20$, we get $x = 40$ and $y = 10$.

Now, we can calculate the value of the expression $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ when $x = 40$ and $y = 10$:
\[5(40)^2 + 5(10)^2 - 8(40)(10) = 8000 + 500 - 3200 = 5300.\]

So, the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ when $x$ and $y$ range over all real numbers such that $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$ is $5300$. The answer is: $5300$

Approach:



1. To solve this problem, we can use the inequality $|a| + |b| \geq |a+b|$.
2. Substitute $a = x - 2y$ and $b = y - 2x$ into the inequality, we get $|x - 2y| + |y - 2x| \geq |(x - 2y) + (y - 2x)| = |-x - y| = |-(x+y)| = |x+y|$.
3. Given that $|x - 2y| + |y - 2x| = 40$, we have $|x+y| = 40$.
4. Now we can express the original function $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ as $5(x^2+y^2) - 8xy = 5[(x+y)^2 - 2xy] - 8xy = 5(40^2 - 2xy) - 8xy = 5(1600 - 2xy) - 8xy = 8000 - 10xy - 8xy = 8000 - 18xy$.
5. To minimize this function, we need to maximize $18xy$. By the AM-GM inequality, $18xy \leq \frac{(18x+18y)^2}{72} = \frac{(18(x+y))^2}{72} = \frac{(18*40)^2}{72} = 2400$.
6. Therefore, the maximum value of $18xy$ is 2400, which occurs when $x=y$.
7. Substituting $x=y$ into the equation $|x+y|=40$, we get $2x=40$, so $x=y=20$.
8. Substituting $x=y=20$ into the function $8000 - 18xy$, we get $8000 - 18*20*20 = 8000 - 7200 = 800$.

The minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ when $x$ and $y$ range over all real numbers such that $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$ is 800.

So the answer is $\boxed{800}$.

Approach:

 To solve this problem, we first observe that the expression $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ can be rewritten as $5(x^2+y^2)-8xy = (x^2+y^2) - 3xy$. This form suggests that we can use the identity $a^2 + b^2 - 2ab = (a - b)^2$ to rewrite the expression further. Applying this identity with $a = x + y$ and $b = 2x + 2y$, we get
\[(x^2+y^2) - 3xy = \left(\frac{x+y}{2}\right)^2 - \left(\frac{2x+2y}{2}\right)^2 - \left(\frac{x+y}{2}\right)\left(\frac{2x+2y}{2}\right) = \left(\frac{x+y}{2}\right)^2 - \left(\frac{x+y}{2}\right)^2 - \left(\frac{x+y}{2}\right)\left(\frac{2x+2y}{2}\right).\]
This simplifies to $\left(\frac{x+y}{2}\right)^2 - \left(\frac{x+y}{2}\right)\left(\frac{2x+2y}{2}\right) = \left(\frac{x+y}{2}\right)^2 - \left(\frac{x+y}{2}\right)(x+y) = -\frac{(x+y)^2}{4}$.

Now we need to find the relationship between $x$ and $y$ from the condition $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$. By the triangle inequality, we know that $|a| + |b| \geq |a+b|$, so we have $|x-2y| + |y-2x| \geq |(x-2y) + (y-2x)| = |x-2y-y+2x| = |3x-3y| = 3|x-y|$. Thus, $3|x-y| = 40$, and $|x-y| = \frac{40}{3}$.

Now, let $t = \frac{x+y}{2}$, then $x - y = 2t$, so $|x-y| = 2|t|$. From $|x-y| = \frac{40}{3}$, we have $2|t| = \frac{40}{3}$, so $|t| = \frac{20}{3}$. Therefore, the minimum value of $-\frac{(x+y)^2}{4}$ is achieved when $|t| = \frac{20}{3}$, and it is $-\left(\frac{20}{3}\right)^2 = -\frac{400}{9}$.

So the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ is $-\frac{400}{9}$.

Assistant:

Approach:

 To find the minimum value of the expression $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ under the condition $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$, we can first express the condition in terms of $x$ and $y$ and then use calculus to find the critical points of the expression.

Step 1: Express the condition in terms of $x$ and $y$. We have $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$. Using the property $|a| + |b| = |a+b| + |a-b|$, we can rewrite the condition as $|x-2y - (y-2x)| = 40$, which simplifies to $|3x-3y| = 40$. This further simplifies to $|x-y| = \frac{40}{3}$.

Step 2: Now we need to minimize the expression $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$. Notice that this expression can be rewritten as $5(x^2+y^2) - 8xy = 5[(x-y)^2 + 2xy] - 8xy$. Let $t = x-y$. Then the expression becomes $5[t^2 + 2(x-t)] - 8(x-t)t = 5t^2 + 10t - 8t^2 + 8t^2 = 5t^2 + 10t$. 

Step 3: We know that $|x-y| = \frac{40}{3}$, so $t = \pm \frac{40}{3}$. Since we want to minimize the expression, we choose the negative value, $t = -\frac{40}{3}$. 

Step 4: Substituting $t = -\frac{40}{3}$ into the expression $5t^2 + 10t$, we get $5\left(-\frac{40}{3}\right)^2 + 10\left(-\frac{40}{3}\right) = \frac{8000}{9} - \frac{400}{3} = \frac{8000-1200}{9} = \frac{6800}{9}$.

So the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ is $\frac{6800}{9}$. The answer is: $\boxed{\frac{6800}{9}}$

Approach:


This problem is an optimization problem with a constraint. To solve it, we will use the method of Lagrange multipliers. We first introduce a new variable $\lambda$ and form the Lagrangian function:
\[L(x, y, \lambda) = 5x^2 + 5y^2 - 8xy - \lambda(|x - 2y| + |y - 2x - 40).\]
We then take the partial derivatives of $L$ with respect to $x$, $y$, and $\lambda$, and set them equal to zero:
\[\begin{cases}
\frac{\partial L}{\partial x} = 10x - 8y - 2\lambda(-1) = 0 \\
\frac{\partial L}{\partial y} = 10y - 8x - 2\lambda(-1) = 0 \\
\frac{\partial L}{\partial \lambda} = |x - 2y| + |y - 2x| - 40 = 0
\end{cases}.\]
From the first two equations, we have $10x - 8y + 2\lambda = 0$ and $10y - 8x + 2\lambda = 0$. Solving these two equations simultaneously, we get $x = y$. Substituting $x = y$ into the third equation, we have $|x - 2x| + |x - 2x| = 40$, which simplifies to $|x| + |-x| = 40$. This implies $2|x| = 40$, so $|x| = 20$. Since $x$ and $y$ are interchangeable, we also have $|y| = 20$. Thus, the minimum occurs at $(x, y) = (20, 20)$ or $(x, y) = (-20, -20)$.

Now we evaluate the original function $5x^2 + 5y^2 - 8xy$ at these two points:
\[5(20)^2 + 5(20)^2 - 8(20)(20) = 2000,\]
\[5(-20)^2 + 5(-20)^2 - 8(-20)(-20) = 2000.\]
So the minimum value of $5x^2 + 5y^2 - 8xy$ is 2000. The answer is: $2000$

This problem involves finding the minimum value of a function subject to a constraint. We can use the method of Lagrange multipliers to solve this problem. Define the function $f(x, y) = 5x^2 + 5y^2 - 8xy$ and the constraint function $g(x, y) = |x - 2y| + |y - 2x| - 40$. Then we form the Lagrangian function $\mathcal{L}(x, y, \lambda) = f(x, y) - \lambda g(x, y)$.

To find the critical points, we take the partial derivatives of $\mathcal{L}$ with respect to $x$, $y$, and $\lambda$ and set them equal to zero. This gives us a system of three equations:

1. $\frac{\partial \mathcal{L}}{\partial x} = 10x - 8y + 2\lambda(-1 + 2\text{sgn}(x - 2y)) = 0$
2. $\frac{\partial \mathcal{L}}{\partial y} = 10y - 8x + 2\lambda(1 - 2\text{sgn}(y - 2x)) = 0$
3. $\frac{\partial \mathcal{L}}{\partial \lambda} = |x - 2y| + |y - 2x| - 40 = 0$

Solving this system of equations is quite involved and requires careful consideration of the different cases that arise from the signs of $x - 2y$ and $y - 2x$. After solving this system, we find that the minimum value of $f(x, y)$ subject to the constraint is achieved at the point $(x, y) = (4, 6)$.

Substituting these values into the function $f(x, y)$ gives $f(4, 6) = 5(4)^2 + 5(6)^2 - 8(4)(6) = 80 - 96 = -16$.

So the minimum value of $5x^2 + 5y^2 - 8xy$ subject to the constraint $|x - 2y| + |y - 2x| = 40$ is $-16$.
The answer is: -16

We can use the Cauchy-Schwarz inequality to solve this problem. The Cauchy-Schwarz inequality states that for any real numbers $a_1, a_2, ..., a_n$ and $b_1, b_2, ..., b_n$, we have:
$$(a_1^2 + a_2^2 + ... + a_n^2)(b_1^2 + b_2^2 + ... + b_n^2) \geq (a_1b_1 + a_2b_2 + ... + a_nb_n)^2.$$

Setting $a_1 = x$, $a_2 = y$, $b_1 = 2y$, and $b_2 = 2x$, we have:
$$(x^2 + y^2)((2y)^2 + (2x)^2) \geq (x \cdot 2y + y \cdot 2x)^2.$$
Simplifying, we get:
$$(x^2 + y^2)(4x^2 + 4y^2) \geq (2xy + 2xy)^2,$$
$$(x^2 + y^2)(4x^2 + 4y^2) \geq (4xy)^2.$$
$$4x^4 + 4y^4 + 4x^2y^2 \geq 16x^2y^2.$$
$$4x^4 + 4y^4 - 12x^2y^2 \geq 0.$$
Dividing both sides by 4, we get:
$$x^4 + y^4 - 3x^2y^2 \geq 0.$$
Now, let's rewrite the expression $5x^2 + 5y^2 - 8xy$ as $5(x^2 + y^2) - 8xy$.
Using the inequality we derived, we can bound this expression:
$$5(x^2 + y^2) - 8xy \leq 5(x^2 + y^2) - 2(x^2 + y^2) = 3(x^2 + y^2).$$
Now, we need to minimize $3(x^2 + y^2)$.
From the given condition $|x - 2y| + |y - 2x| = 40$, we know that $x$ and $y$ are real numbers.
By the triangle inequality, we have:
$$|x - 2y| + |y - 2x| \geq |(x - 2y) - (y - 2x)| = |x - 2y - y + 2x| = |3x - 3y| = 3|x - y| = 40.$$
Hence, $|x - y| = \frac{40}{3}$.
By the Cauchy-Schwarz inequality, we have:
$$(x^2 + y^2)(1^2 + 1^2) \geq (x \cdot 1 + y \cdot 1)^2,$$
$$(x^2 + y^2)(2) \geq (x + y)^2.$$
$$2(x^2 + y^2) \geq (x + y)^2.$$
From the equation $|x - y| = \frac{40}{3}$, we can square both sides to get:
$$(x - y)^2 = \left(\frac{40}{3}\right)^2.$$
$$x^2 - 2xy + y^2 = \frac{1600}{9}.$$
$$x^2 + y^2 = \frac{1600}{9} + 2xy.$$
Substituting into the inequality $2(x^2 + y^2) \geq (x + y)^2$, we get:
$$2\left(\frac{1600}{9} + 2xy\right) \geq (x + y)^2.$$
$$\frac{3200}{9} + 4xy \geq x^2 + 2xy + y^2.$$
$$\frac{3200}{9} + 4xy \geq \frac{1600}{9} + 3xy.$$
$$\frac{1600}{9} + xy \geq 0.$$
$$xy \geq -\frac{1600}{9}.$$
Thus, the minimum value of $5x^2 + 5y^2 - 8xy$ is $3(x^2 + y^2)$ and is achieved when $xy = -\frac{1600}{9}$.

Substituting $xy = -\frac{1600}{9}$ into the equation $x^2 + y^2 = \frac{1600}{9} + 2xy$, we get:
$$x^2 + y^2 = \frac{1600}{9} + 2\left(-\frac{1600}{9}\right),$$
$$x^2 + y^2 = \frac{1600}{9} - \frac{3200}{9},$$
$$x^2 + y^2 = -\frac{1600}{9}.$$
However, this is a contradiction since $x^2 + y^2$ cannot be negative.

To find the minimum value, we need to find the value of $3(x^2 + y^2)$ when $xy = -\frac{1600}{9}$.
Substituting $xy = -\frac{1600}{9}$ into the equation $x^2 + y^2 = \frac{1600}{9} + 2xy$, we get:
$$x^2 + y^2 = \frac{1600}{9} + 2\left(-\frac{1600}{9}\right),$$
$$x^2 + y^2 = \frac{1600}{9} - \frac{3200}{9},$$
$$x^2 + y^2 = -\frac{1600}{9}.$$
However, this is a contradiction since $x^2 + y^2$ cannot be negative.

To find the minimum value, we need to find the value of $3(x^2 + y^2)$ when $xy = -\frac{1600}{9}$.
Since $x$ and $y$ are real numbers, we know that $x^2 + y^2$ is non-negative.
Therefore, to minimize $3(x^2 + y^2)$, we need to minimize $x^2 + y^2$.
By the equation $x^2 + y^2 = \frac{1600}{9} + 2xy$, the minimum value of $x^2 + y^2$ is achieved when $xy = -\frac{1600}{9}$.
Thus, we can substitute $xy = -\frac{1600}{9}$ into the equation $x^2 + y^2 = \frac{1600}{9} + 2xy$ to find the minimum value of $x^2 + y^2$.

Approach:



To minimize the function $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$, we can use the method of completing the square. We rewrite the function as $5(x^2 - \frac{8}{5}y x) + 5(y^2 - \frac{8}{5}x y)$. Completing the square in each term, we get $5[(x-\frac{4}{5}y)^2 - \frac{16}{25}y^2] + 5[(y-\frac{4}{5}x)^2 - \frac{16}{25}x^2] = 5(x-\frac{4}{5}y)^2 + 5(y-\frac{4}{5}x)^2 - \frac{128}{25}(x^2 + y^2)$. 

Since $(x-\frac{4}{5}y)^2$ and $(y-\frac{4}{5}x)^2$ are both non-negative, the minimum value of the function $5(x-\frac{4}{5}y)^2 + 5(y-\frac{4}{5}x)^2$ is 0, which occurs when $x=\frac{4}{5}y$ and $y=\frac{4}{5}x$. Substituting these values into the equation $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$, we get $|x-2(\frac{4}{5}x)| + |\frac{4}{5}x - 2x| = 40$, which simplifies to $|\frac{x}{5}| + |\frac{-6x}{5}| = 40$, and further simplifies to $\frac{7x}{5} = 40$. Solving for $x$, we get $x = \frac{200}{7}$. Substituting this value back into $x=\frac{4}{5}y$, we get $y = \frac{50}{7}$.

Substituting these values of $x$ and $y$ back into the function $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$, we get $5(\frac{200}{7})^2 + 5(\frac{50}{7})^2 - 8(\frac{200}{7})(\frac{50}{7}) = -\frac{4000}{7}$. Thus, the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ is $-\frac{4000}{7}$.

However, we made a mistake in our calculations. The correct way to proceed is as follows:

We start with the equation $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$. This equation is symmetric in $x$ and $y$, so without loss of generality, we can assume that $x \geq y$. Then the equation becomes $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40 \Rightarrow (x-2y) + (2x-y) = 40 \Rightarrow 3x - 3y = 40 \Rightarrow x - y = \frac{40}{3}$. Now we substitute $x = y + \frac{40}{3}$ into the function $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ to get $5(y + \frac{40}{3})^2 + 5y^2 - 8y(y + \frac{40}{3}) = 5y^2 + 400y + \frac{8000}{9} + 5y^2 - 8y^2 - \frac{320}{3}y = 10y^2 + \frac{480}{3}y + \frac{8000}{9}$. Now we complete the square to get $10(y + \frac{80}{18})^2 + \frac{8000}{9} - \frac{6400}{9} = 10(y + \frac{80}{18})^2 - \frac{4000}{9}$. The minimum value of this function occurs when $y = -\frac{80}{18} = -\frac{40}{9}$, and substituting this value back into $x = y + \frac{40}{3}$, we get $x = -\frac{40}{9} + \frac{40}{3} = \frac{80}{9}$. Substituting these values of $x$ and $y$ back into the function $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$, we get $5(\frac{80}{9})^2 + 5(-\frac{40}{9})^2 - 8(\frac{80}{9})(-\frac{40}{9}) = -\frac{4000}{9}$. Thus, the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ is $-\frac{4000}{9}$.

However, we made another mistake. The correct way to proceed is as follows:

We start with the equation $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$. This equation is symmetric in $x$ and $y$, so without loss of generality, we can assume that $x \geq y$. Then the equation becomes $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40 \Rightarrow (x-2y) - (2x-y) = 40 \Rightarrow -x + y = 40 \Rightarrow y = x + 40$. Now we substitute $y = x + 40$ into the function $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ to get $5x^2 + 5(x + 40)^2 - 8x(x + 40) = 5x^2 + 5x^2 + 400x + 8000 - 8x^2 - 320x = -3x^2 + 80x + 8000$. Now we complete the square to get $-3(x - \frac{40}{3})^2 + \frac{4000}{3} + 8000 = -3(x - \frac{40}{3})^2 + \frac{28000}{3}$. The minimum value of this function occurs when $x = \frac{40}{3}$, and substituting this value back into $y = x + 40$, we get $y = \frac{40}{3} + 40 = \frac{160}{3}$. Substituting these values of $x$ and $y$ back into the function $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$, we get $5(\frac{40}{3})^2 + 5(\frac{160}{3})^2 - 8(\frac{40}{3})(\frac{160}{3}) = \frac{4000}{9}$. Thus, the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ is $\frac{4000}{9}$.

Approach:


We first notice that the function $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ can be rewritten as $\frac{5}{2}((x-y)^2 + (x+y)^2)$, which is always non-negative. So the minimum value of this function will be achieved when $(x-y)^2 + (x+y)^2 = 0$, which implies $x=y$.

Similarly, the constraint $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$ can be rewritten as $|x-y| + |x+y| = 40$. When $x=y$, the constraint becomes $|x-x| + |x+x| = 40$, which simplifies to $2|x| = 40$. So $|x| = 20$, which gives $x = \pm 20$.

Substituting $x = 20$ into the function $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$, we get $5*20^2 + 5y^2 - 8*20*y = 2000 + 5y^2 - 160y$. To minimize this, we take the derivative with respect to $y$ and set it to zero: $10y - 160 = 0$, which gives $y = 16$. Substituting $y = 16$ into the function gives $2000 + 5*16^2 - 160*16 = 2000 + 1280 - 2560 = 720$.

Substituting $x = -20$ into the function $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$, we get $5*(-20)^2 + 5y^2 + 8*20*y = 2000 + 5y^2 + 160y$. To minimize this, we take the derivative with respect to $y$ and set it to zero: $10y + 160 = 0$, which gives $y = -16$. Substituting $y = -16$ into the function gives $2000 + 5*(-16)^2 + 160*(-16) = 2000 + 1280 - 2560 = 720$.

Therefore, the minimum value of the function $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ under the constraint $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$ is 720. The answer is: $\boxed{720}$.

Approach:



The given expression is $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$, which can be rewritten as $5(x^2+y^2) - 8xy$. This expression can be thought of as a quadratic in terms of $x$ and $y$. We know that for a quadratic in the form $ax^2 + bxy + cy^2$, the minimum or maximum value occurs when $x = -\frac{b}{2a}$. Here, $a = 5$, $b = -8$, and $c = 5$. So, the minimum value of the given expression occurs when $x = \frac{8}{10} = \frac{4}{5}$ and $y = \frac{8}{10} = \frac{4}{5}$.

Substituting these values back into the expression, we get:
\[5\left(\frac{4}{5}\right)^2 + 5\left(\frac{4}{5}\right)^2 - 8\left(\frac{4}{5}\right)\left(\frac{4}{5}\right) = 5\left(\frac{16}{25}\right) + 5\left(\frac{16}{25}\right) - 8\left(\frac{16}{25}\right) = \frac{80}{25} + \frac{80}{25} - \frac{128}{25} = \frac{32}{25}.\]

But we also have the constraint $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$. Let's see if the point $\left(\frac{4}{5}, \frac{4}{5}\right)$ satisfies this constraint:
\[| \frac{4}{5} - 2\cdot\frac{4}{5} | + | \frac{4}{5} - 2\cdot\frac{4}{5} | = |\frac{-4}{5}| + |\frac{-4}{5}| = \frac{8}{5} + \frac{8}{5} = \frac{16}{5}.\]

However, this does not equal 40. This indicates that the point $\left(\frac{4}{5}, \frac{4}{5}\right)$ does not satisfy the constraint, and we need to find another method to solve this problem.

Notice that the given expression is a quadratic form and the constraint defines a region in the plane. The minimum value of the quadratic form over a region is achieved at the boundary of the region or at the stationary points (points where the gradient of the quadratic form is zero) inside the region.

To find the stationary points, we take the partial derivatives of the quadratic form with respect to $x$ and $y$ and set them equal to zero:
\[\frac{\partial}{\partial x} (5x^2 + 5y^2 - 8xy) = 10x - 8y = 0,\]
\[\frac{\partial}{\partial y} (5x^2 + 5y^2 - 8xy) = 10y - 8x = 0.\]

Solving these equations, we get $x = y$. Substituting $x = y$ into the constraint equation, we get:
\[|x - 2x| + |x - 2x| = | -x | + | -x | = 2|x| = 40.\]

This implies $|x| = 20$, which means $x = \pm 20$. However, since $x = y$, we must have $x = y = 20$ or $x = y = -20$.

Now, we evaluate the quadratic form at these points:
\[5(20)^2 + 5(20)^2 - 8(20)(20) = 2000 + 2000 - 3200 = 800,\]
\[5(-20)^2 + 5(-20)^2 - 8(-20)(-20) = 2000 + 2000 - 3200 = 800.\]

So, the minimum value of the given expression is 800. However, this does not satisfy the constraint equation. This indicates that the minimum value must be achieved on the boundary of the region defined by the constraint.

We can parameterize the boundary of the region defined by the constraint:
\[x = 2y + t(y - 2x),\]
where $t$ is a parameter that varies from 0 to 1.

Substituting this into the constraint equation, we get:
\[|2y + t(y - 2x) - 2y| + |y - 2x - t(2y + t(y - 2x))| = 40.\]

Solving this equation for $y$ as a function of $x$ and $t$, we can substitute this back into the quadratic form to find the minimum value. After some algebra, we find that the minimum value is achieved when $t = \frac{1}{2}$, and this gives us $x = \frac{20}{3}$ and $y = \frac{40}{3}$.

Substituting these values into the quadratic form, we get:
\[5\left(\frac{20}{3}\right)^2 + 5\left(\frac{40}{3}\right)^2 - 8\left(\frac{20}{3}\right)\left(\frac{40}{3}\right) = \frac{2000}{9} + \frac{8000}{9} - \frac{6400}{9} = \frac{3600}{9} = 400.\]

So, the minimum value of the given expression when $x$ and $y$ satisfy the constraint is 400.
The answer is: $400$

Approach:

 This problem is a bit tricky to solve directly since it involves both a quadratic function and an equation with absolute values. However, by cleverly transforming the given equation, we can find a way to use the Cauchy-Schwarz Inequality to find the minimum value of the quadratic function.

First, let's rewrite the equation $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$ as $|2x-y| + |2y-x| = 40$. Now, notice that by the Cauchy-Schwarz Inequality, we have:
\[(1 + 4)( (2x-y)^2 + (2y-x)^2 ) \geq (1*(2x-y) + 2*(2y-x))^2 = (0)^2 = 0.\]
This gives us:
\[5( (2x-y)^2 + (2y-x)^2 ) \geq 0.\]
Since the left side is non-negative, we must have $(2x-y)^2 + (2y-x)^2 = 0$. This implies that $2x-y = 0$ and $2y-x = 0$, which means $x = y$.

Now, substituting $x = y$ into the equation $|2x-x| + |2x-x| = 40$, we get $|x| + |-x| = 40$, which simplifies to $2|x| = 40$. Thus, $|x| = 20$, and since $x = y$, we also have $|y| = 20$.

Now we can substitute $x = y$ into the quadratic function $5x^2 + 5y^2 - 8xy$, which becomes $5x^2 + 5x^2 - 8x^2 = 2x^2$. Since $|x| = 20$, we have $x^2 = 400$, so the minimum value of $2x^2$ is $2*400 = 800$.

Therefore, the minimum value of $5x^2 + 5y^2 - 8xy$ is 800 when $x$ and $y$ range over all real numbers such that $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$. The answer is: $800$

Approach:



First, we observe that the expression $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ can be rewritten as $\frac{1}{2}((5x-4y)^2 + (4x-5y)^2)$. This is a sum of two squares, which is always non-negative. So the minimum value of the expression is achieved when both $(5x-4y)^2 = 0$ and $(4x-5y)^2 = 0$, which implies $5x-4y = 0$ and $4x-5y = 0$. Solving this system of equations, we find $x = y = 0$.

Then we substitute $x = y = 0$ into the equation $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$, and we get $|0-0| + |0-0| = 0 \neq 40$, which contradicts the given condition. Therefore, we need to consider the condition $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$ more carefully.

By the triangle inequality, we have $|x-2y| + |y-2x| \geq |(x-2y) + (y-2x)| = |x-2y + y-2x| = |-x-y| = |-(x+y)| = |x+y|$. So we have $|x+y| = 40$.

Now we substitute $x = y = 0$ into $|x+y| = 40$, and we get $|0+0| = 0 \neq 40$, which again contradicts the given condition.

However, we notice that we made a mistake in applying the triangle inequality. The correct application should be $|x-2y| + |y-2x| \geq ||x-2y| - |y-2x||$. So we have $|x-2y| + |y-2x| \geq |x-2y - (y-2x)| = |x-2y - y+2x| = |3x-3y| = 3|x-y|$.

Substituting this into the given condition, we get $3|x-y| = 40$, or $|x-y| = \frac{40}{3}$.

Now we can rewrite the expression $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ as $\frac{1}{2}((5x-4y)^2 + (4x-5y)^2) = \frac{1}{2}(9(x-y)^2) = \frac{9}{2}(x-y)^2$.

Substituting $|x-y| = \frac{40}{3}$ into the above expression, we get $\frac{9}{2} \cdot \left(\frac{40}{3}\right)^2 = \frac{9}{2} \cdot \frac{1600}{9} = 800$.

So the minimum value of the expression $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ is $800$. The answer is: $\boxed{800}$

Approach:


This problem requires a bit of algebraic manipulation and some knowledge of inequalities. The first step is to use the given equation $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$ to simplify the expression $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$. 

Let's start by observing that $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$ is equivalent to $|x-2y| = 40 - |y-2x|$. Now, let's consider two cases:

Case 1: If $x - 2y \ge 0$ and $y - 2x \ge 0$, then $x - 2y = 40 - (y - 2x)$. This simplifies to $3x - 3y = 40$, or $x - y = \frac{40}{3}$. 

Case 2: If $x - 2y < 0$ and $y - 2x < 0$, then $-(x - 2y) = 40 - -(y - 2x)$. This simplifies to $x - y = -\frac{40}{3}$, which is a contradiction as both $x - 2y < 0$ and $y - 2x < 0$ would imply that $x - y < 0$.

Therefore, we must be in Case 1, and $x - y = \frac{40}{3}$. From this, we can express $x$ in terms of $y$ as $x = y + \frac{40}{3}$.

Now, substitute $x = y + \frac{40}{3}$ into the expression $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$:
\begin{align*}
5\left(y + \frac{40}{3}\right)^2 + 5y^2 - 8y\left(y + \frac{40}{3}\right) &= 5\left(y^2 + \frac{80y}{3} + \frac{1600}{9}\right) + 5y^2 - 8y^2 - \frac{320y}{3}\\
&= 5y^2 + \frac{400y}{3} + \frac{800}{3} + 5y^2 - 8y^2 - \frac{320y}{3}\\
&= 2y^2 - \frac{80y}{3} + \frac{800}{3}.
\end{align*}
Now, let's complete the square for $2y^2 - \frac{80y}{3} + \frac{800}{3}$:
\begin{align*}
2\left(y^2 - \frac{40y}{3}\right) + \frac{800}{3} &= 2\left(\left(y - \frac{20}{3}\right)^2 - \frac{400}{9}\right) + \frac{800}{3}\\
&= 2\left(y - \frac{20}{3}\right)^2 - \frac{800}{9} + \frac{800}{3}\\
&= 2\left(y - \frac{20}{3}\right)^2 + \frac{800}{9}.
\end{align*}

We see that $2\left(y - \frac{20}{3}\right)^2 + \frac{800}{9}$ is always greater than or equal to $\frac{800}{9}$, and it is equal to $\frac{800}{9}$ when $y = \frac{20}{3}$. 

Therefore, the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ when $x$ and $y$ range over all real numbers such that $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$ is $\frac{800}{9}$. The answer is: $\boxed{\frac{800}{9}}$
