The given equation is a product of two terms equal to zero, so either the first term is zero or the second term is zero. 

The first term is zero when $|x+y| = 10$ or $|x-y| = 10$. These are the equations of two lines in the plane, forming a square with side length 20.

The second term is zero when $|x| = 8$ or $|y| = 8$. These are the equations of two lines in the plane, forming a square with side length 16.

The intersection of these two squares is the convex polygon we are looking for. The area of this convex polygon is the area of the smaller square, which is $16^2 = 256$.

"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"

The given equation is a product of two expressions equal to zero. Therefore, either of the expressions must be zero for the product to be zero. This gives us two systems of equations to solve:

1. $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ and $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$
2. $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ and $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$

For the first system, we have $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x \vert = 8$. The solutions to these equations are the lines $x + y = 10$, $x + y = -10$, $x = 8$, and $x = -8$. Similarly, for the second system, we have $\vert x - y \vert = 10$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$. The solutions to these equations are the lines $x - y = 10$, $x - y = -10$, $y = 8$, and $y = -8$. These lines form a square with side length 10, so the area of the square is $10^2 = 100$. The answer is: $100$

The given equation is a product of two expressions equal to zero. This means that either the first expression is zero or the second expression is zero. 

The first expression is $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)$. This expression is zero if and only if both $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. These are the equations of two squares in the $xy$-plane, centered at the origin with side length 20.

The second expression is $((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2)$. This expression is zero if and only if both $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$, which are the equations of two squares in the $xy$-plane, centered at the origin with side length 16.

The intersection of these two squares is a square with side length 8. Therefore, the area of the convex polygon enclosed by the points satisfying the given equation is the area of this square, which is $8^2 = 64$. The answer is: $64$

The given equation is a product of two terms equal to zero. This means that either the first term is zero or the second term is zero. 

The first term is zero when either $|x + y| - 10 = 0$ or $|x - y| - 10 = 0$. This gives us the equations $|x + y| = 10$ and $|x - y| = 10$. These are the equations of two lines in the plane.

The second term is zero when either $|x| - 8 = 0$ or $|y| - 8 = 0$. This gives us the equations $|x| = 8$ and $|y| = 8$. These are the equations of two lines in the plane.

The intersection of these lines form a square with side length 16. The area of this square is $16^2 = 256$.

So, the area of the convex polygon is 256 square units. The answer is: $256$

"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"

Assistant:

 The equation $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ implies that $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$, which means $x + y = \pm 10$ and $x - y = \pm 10$. These four equations can be solved to give the vertices of the polygon as $(0, 10)$, $(0, -10)$, $(10, 0)$, and $(-10, 0)$.

Similarly, the equation $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ implies that $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$, which means $x = \pm 8$ and $y = \pm 8$. These four equations can be solved to give the vertices of the polygon as $(8, 0)$, $(-8, 0)$, $(0, 8)$, and $(0, -8)$.

The polygon is a square with side length $10$. The area of a square is the side length squared, so the area of the polygon is $10^2 = 100$.

The answer is: $100$.

Below is a math problem you are to solve (positive numerical answer!):
"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"
Analyze this problem and think step by step to come to a solution with programs. After solving the problem, output the final numerical answer within \boxed{}.

The equation is given as:

$$((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0.$$

For the product of two factors to be zero, either one of the factors must be zero. Therefore, we have two cases:

1. $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$
2. $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$

For the first case, we have:

$$\vert x + y \vert = 10$$ and $$\vert x - y \vert = 10.$$

This implies that $x + y = \pm 10$ and $x - y = \pm 10$. Solving these equations, we get the vertices of the square as $(0, 10)$, $(0, -10)$, $(10, 0)$, and $(-10, 0)$.

For the second case, we have:

$$\vert x \vert = 8$$ and $$\vert y \vert = 8.$$

This implies that $x = \pm 8$ and $y = \pm 8$. Solving these equations, we get the vertices of the square as $(8, 8)$, $(8, -8)$, $(-8, 8)$, and $(-8, -8)$.

The vertices of the convex polygon are the intersections of these two squares. Therefore, the convex polygon is a 8x8 square.

The area of the square is given by $8 \times 8 = 64$.

Therefore, the area of the convex polygon is 64 square units. The answer is: $64$

 The given equation is equivalent to the product of two expressions being zero, which means each expression must be zero individually. This gives us the following four conditions:
1. $\vert x + y \vert - 10 = 0 \implies \vert x + y \vert = 10$.
2. $\vert x - y \vert - 10 = 0 \implies \vert x - y \vert = 10$.
3. $\vert x \vert - 8 = 0 \implies \vert x \vert = 8$.
4. $\vert y \vert - 8 = 0 \implies \vert y \vert = 8$.
From conditions 3 and 4, we get that $-8 \leq x, y \leq 8$. From conditions 1 and 2, we get that the points must lie on the lines $x + y = \pm 10$ and $x - y = \pm 10$.
Plotting these lines on the coordinate plane, we find that they form a square with side length 16. The area of this square is $16^2 = 256$. So, the area of the convex polygon is 256.

Here is a Python program that calculates the area of the square:
```python


INTERMEDIATE OUT :

def square_area():
    side_length = 16
    area = side_length ** 2
    return area

result = square_area()
print(result)
```

CODE RESULTS 256

INTERMEDIATE OUT :
```output
256
```
The area of the convex polygon is $256$. The answer is: $256$
