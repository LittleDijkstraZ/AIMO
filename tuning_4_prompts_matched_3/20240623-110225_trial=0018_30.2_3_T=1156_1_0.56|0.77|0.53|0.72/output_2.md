Below is a math problem you are to solve (positive numerical answer):
"For how many positive integers $m$ does the equation \[\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}\] have $4$ distinct solutions?"

To accomplish this:
- List the variables and known values from the problem.
- Outline the steps using sympy to solve the problem:
  * Identify the sympy functions required for each step.
  * Implement these functions step-by-step, commenting each line for clarity.
- Calculate the final answer and verify it's a positive integer.
- Output the result within \boxed{}.

Interesting, let's analyze step by step:



The equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has 4 distinct solutions. This means that the right side of the equation, $\frac{m}{100}$, is the distance between the two "islands" of the absolute value function on the left side.

The left side of the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert$ has two "islands" at $x=1\pm2$, which are at $x=3$ and $x=-1$. The distance between these two islands is 4. So, for the equation to have 4 distinct solutions, $\frac{m}{100}$ must be equal to 2. This gives $m=200$.

Now let's verify that $m=200$ is indeed a positive integer:

```python


INTERMEDIATE OUT :

def verify_m():
    m = 200
    return m > 0 and m.is_integer()

result = verify_m()
print(result)
```

CODE RESULTS Traceback: line 7, in verify_m
    return m > 0 and m.is_integer()
AttributeError: 'int' object has no attribute 'is_integer'

FAIL


INTERMEDIATE OUT :
```output
Traceback: line 7, in verify_m
    return m > 0 and m.is_integer()
AttributeError: 'int' object has no attribute 'is_integer'

FAIL

```

The `is_integer` method is not available for integers in Python. Let's modify the function to check if $m$ is a positive integer directly:

```python


INTERMEDIATE OUT :

def verify_m():
    m = 200
    return m > 0 and isinstance(m, int)

result = verify_m()
print(result)
```

CODE RESULTS True

INTERMEDIATE OUT :
```output
True
```

The value of $m$ is indeed a positive integer.

Therefore, the number of positive integers $m$ for which the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has 4 distinct solutions is 1. The answer is: $1$

Interesting, let's analyze step by step:



The equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has 4 distinct solutions. This means that the right side of the equation, $\frac{m}{100}$, must be equal to 2. This is because the absolute value function $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert$ can take on the value of 2 only when it equals $\frac{m}{100}$.

So we have $\frac{m}{100} = 2$, which gives us $m = 200$.

Now we need to check if $m = 200$ is a positive integer. It is, so the number of positive integers $m$ for which the equation has 4 distinct solutions is 1.

The answer is: $1$

Interesting, let's analyze step by step:



The equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has 4 distinct solutions. We know that $\frac{m}{100}$ must be a positive number, so $m$ must be a positive integer.

Let's denote $\frac{m}{100}$ as $k$, then we have $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=k$. The number of solutions of this equation depends on the value of $k$.

For $k \leq 2$, the equation has at most 2 solutions.
For $k > 2$, the equation has 4 solutions.

So, we need to find the value of $m$ such that $k = \frac{m}{100} > 2$. This gives us $m > 200$.

Now we need to find the number of positive integers $m$ that satisfy this condition and also make the equation have 4 distinct solutions.

To do this, we can start by finding the maximum value of $m$ that still results in 4 solutions. This occurs when $k = 2$, which gives $m = 200$.

Therefore, the possible values of $m$ are the integers from 201 to some maximum value. To find this maximum value, we need to find the smallest value of $k$ for which the equation still has 4 solutions. This occurs when $k = 2 + \epsilon$ for some very small positive $\epsilon$. In this case, the equation becomes $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=2+\epsilon$, and this equation has 2 solutions.

So the maximum value of $m$ is when $k = 2$, which gives $m = 200$.

Therefore, the only possible value of $m$ is 200.

Since 200 is a positive integer, the number of positive integers $m$ that satisfy the condition is 1.

The answer is: $1$
