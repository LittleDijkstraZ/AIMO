Interesting, let's analyze step by step:



The equation given is a product of two terms equal to zero, so either the first term is zero or the second term is zero. This gives us two systems of equations to solve:

1. $|x + y| - 10 = 0$ and $|x - y| - 10 = 0$.
2. $|x| - 8 = 0$ and $|y| - 8 = 0$.

For the first system, we have $|x + y| = 10$ and $|x - y| = 10$. This implies that $x + y = \pm 10$ and $x - y = \pm 10$. Solving these equations, we get the vertices of the first system as $(5, 5), (5, -5), (-5, 5),$ and $(-5, -5)$.

For the second system, we have $|x| = 8$ and $|y| = 8$. This implies that $x = \pm 8$ and $y = \pm 8$. Solving these equations, we get the vertices of the second system as $(8, 8), (8, -8), (-8, 8),$ and $(-8, -8)$.

The convex polygon formed by the union of these two sets of vertices is a square with side length 10. The area of this square is $10^2 = 100$.

So the area of the convex polygon is 100. The answer is: $100$

Interesting, let's analyze step by step:



The equation given is $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$.

This equation is equal to zero if either of the two factors is zero. This gives us two sets of equations to solve:

1. $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ and $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$.
2. $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ and $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$.

From the first set of equations, we have $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$. This gives us the vertices of the square: $(8, 0), (0, 8), (-8, 0), (0, -8)$.

From the second set of equations, we have $\vert x - y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$. This gives us the vertices of the square: $(0, 8), (8, 0), (0, -8), (-8, 0)$.

So the points satisfying the equation are the vertices of a square with side length 8. The area of this square is $8^2 = 64$.

Therefore, the area of the convex polygon is 64.
The answer is: $64$

Interesting, let's analyze step by step:



The expression $A = ((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2)$ equals to zero if and only if at least one of the factors equals to zero. This gives us four conditions:

1. $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$, which implies $\vert x + y \vert = 10$.
2. $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$, which implies $\vert x - y \vert = 10$.
3. $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$, which implies $\vert x \vert = 8$.
4. $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$, which implies $\vert y \vert = 8$.

From conditions 3 and 4, we have $-8 \leq x, y \leq 8$.

From conditions 1 and 2, we have:

1. $x + y = \pm 10$.
2. $x - y = \pm 10$.

Solving these four systems of equations, we get the vertices of the polygon:

$(0, 10)$, $(0, -10)$, $(10, 0)$, $(-10, 0)$, $(8, 2)$, $(8, -2)$, $(-8, 2)$, $(-8, -2)$.

Now, we can calculate the area of the polygon. The polygon is a square with side length $10$, so its area is $10^2 = 100$.

The answer is: $100$

Interesting, let's analyze step by step:



The equation is given as:
$$((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$$

This equation is equal to zero if either of the two terms is equal to zero. This gives us two sets of equations:

1. $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ and $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$
2. $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ and $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$

From the first set of equations, we have:

1. $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$
2. $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$

From the second set of equations, we have:

1. $\vert x - y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$
2. $\vert x - y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$

These equations represent four lines in the coordinate plane. The intersection points of these lines form a square with side length 16 (since $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$ implies that the square is centered at the origin and has side length 16).

The area of this square is $16^2 = 256$.

So the area of the convex polygon is 256. The answer is: $256$

The equation is a product of two terms equal to zero, so either the first term is zero or the second term is zero. This gives us two systems of equations to solve:

1. $\vert x + y \vert - 10 = 0$ and $\vert x - y \vert - 10 = 0$
2. $\vert x \vert - 8 = 0$ and $\vert y \vert - 8 = 0$

For the first system, we have $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. This implies that $x + y = \pm 10$ and $x - y = \pm 10$. Solving these equations gives us the vertices of the polygon: $(0, 10), (0, -10), (10, 0), (-10, 0)$.

For the second system, we have $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$. This implies that $x = \pm 8$ and $y = \pm 8$. Solving these equations gives us the vertices of the polygon: $(8, 8), (8, -8), (-8, 8), (-8, -8)$.

Now we have all the vertices of the polygon: $(0, 10), (0, -10), (10, 0), (-10, 0), (8, 8), (8, -8), (-8, 8), (-8, -8)$.

To find the area of the polygon, we can use the Shoelace formula. The Shoelace formula states that if the vertices of a polygon are $(x_1, y_1), (x_2, y_2), ..., (x_n, y_n)$, then the area of the polygon is given by:

$$\frac{1}{2} \vert (x_1y_2 + x_2y_3 + ... + x_ny_1) - (y_1x_2 + y_2x_3 + ... + y_nx_1) \vert$$

Applying the Shoelace formula to the vertices $(0, 10), (0, -10), (10, 0), (-10, 0), (8, 8), (8, -8), (-8, 8), (-8, -8)$, we get:

$$x_1 = 0, y_1 = 10$$
$$x_2 = 0, y_2 = -10$$
$$x_3 = 10, y_3 = 0$$
$$x_4 = -10, y_4 = 0$$
$$x_5 = 8, y_5 = 8$$
$$x_6 = 8, y_6 = -8$$
$$x_7 = -8, y_7 = 8$$
$$x_8 = -8, y_8 = -8$$

Plugging these values into the Shoelace formula, we get:

$$\frac{1}{2} \vert (0 \cdot -10 + 0 \cdot 0 + 10 \cdot 0 + -10 \cdot 0 + 8 \cdot -8 + 8 \cdot 8 + -8 \cdot 8 + -8 \cdot -8) - (10 \cdot 0 + -10 \cdot 0 + 0 \cdot 8 + 0 \cdot -8 + 8 \cdot 0 + -8 \cdot 0 + 8 \cdot 0 + -8 \cdot 0) \vert$$

$$\frac{1}{2} \vert (0 + 0 + 0 + 0 - 64 + 64 - 64 + 64) - (0 + 0 + 0 + 0 + 0 + 0 + 0 + 0) \vert$$

$$\frac{1}{2} \vert 0 \vert = 0$$

However, this result doesn't make sense as the area of a polygon cannot be zero. Let's check our calculations:

We made a mistake in the second system of equations. The correct equations should be $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$, not $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$. Solving these equations gives us the vertices of the polygon: $(8, 8), (8, -8), (-8, 8), (-8, -8)$.

Now let's recalculate the area using the correct vertices:

$$x_1 = 0, y_1 = 10$$
$$x_2 = 0, y_2 = -10$$
$$x_3 = 10, y_3 = 0$$
$$x_4 = -10, y_4 = 0$$
$$x_5 = 8, y_5 = 8$$
$$x_6 = 8, y_6 = -8$$
$$x_7 = -8, y_7 = 8$$
$$x_8 = -8, y_8 = -8$$

Plugging these values into the Shoelace formula, we get:

$$\frac{1}{2} \vert (0 \cdot -10 + 0 \cdot 0 + 10 \cdot 0 + -10 \cdot 0 + 8 \cdot 8 + 8 \cdot -8 + -8 \cdot 8 + -8 \cdot -8) - (10 \cdot 0 + -10 \cdot 0 + 0 \cdot 8 + 0 \cdot -8 + 8 \cdot 0 + -8 \cdot 0 + 8 \cdot 0 + -8 \cdot 0) \vert$$

$$\frac{1}{2} \vert (0 + 0 + 0 + 0 + 64 - 64 - 64 + 64) - (0 + 0 + 0 + 0 + 0 + 0 + 0 + 0) \vert$$

$$\frac{1}{2} \vert 0 \vert = 0$$

Again, we got the area as zero. This is because the vertices of the polygon are not in the correct order. Let's reorder the vertices:

$$x_1 = 0, y_1 = 10$$
$$x_2 = 0, y_2 = -10$$
$$x_3 = 10, y_3 = 0$$
$$x_4 = -10, y_4 = 0$$
$$x_5 = 8, y_5 = 8$$
$$x_6 = -8, y_6 = 8$$
$$x_7 = -8, y_7 = -8$$
$$x_8 = 8, y_8 = -8$$

Plugging these values into the Shoelace formula, we get

Interesting, let's analyze step by step:



The equation given is a product of two terms equal to zero. This means that either the first term is zero or the second term is zero. 

Let's consider the first term:
$$((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2) = 0$$
This equation is satisfied if and only if $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. This means that the points $(x, y)$ must lie on the lines $x + y = 10$ and $x - y = 10$. These lines intersect at $(5,5)$ and form a square with side length $10$.

Now let's consider the second term:
$$((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$$
This equation is satisfied if and only if $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$. This means that the points $(x, y)$ must lie on the lines $x = 8$ and $y = 8$. These lines also intersect at $(8,8)$ and form a square with side length $16$.

The intersection of the two squares is a smaller square with side length $10$, which is the convex polygon we are looking for. The area of this square is $10^2 = 100$.

So the area of the convex polygon is $100$. The answer is: $100$

The equation given is $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$. This equation is satisfied if either of the two factors is zero. This gives us two cases:

1. $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$. This implies that $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. This means that $x + y = \pm 10$ and $x - y = \pm 10$. Solving these equations gives us the vertices of the square: $(8, 2)$, $(8, -2)$, $(-8, -2)$, and $(-8, 2)$.

2. $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$. This implies that $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$. This means that $x = \pm 8$ and $y = \pm 8$. Solving these equations gives us the vertices of the square: $(8, 8)$, $(8, -8)$, $(-8, -8)$, and $(-8, 8)$.

Now, we have four squares with side length 16. The area of each square is $16^2 = 256$. Since there are four squares, the total area of the polygon is $4 \times 256 = 1024$.

The answer is: $1024$

Interesting, let's analyze step by step:



The equation is $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + (\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + (\vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$.

This equation equals zero if and only if both $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ and $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ or both $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ and $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$.

From the first case, we have $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. This means that $x + y = \pm 10$ and $x - y = \pm 10$. Solving these equations gives us four lines: $x + y = 10$, $x + y = -10$, $x - y = 10$, and $x - y = -10$.

From the second case, we have $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$. This means that $x = \pm 8$ and $y = \pm 8$. This gives us four lines: $x = 8$, $x = -8$, $y = 8$, and $y = -8$.

These eight lines enclose a rectangle with side lengths 16 and 20. The area of this rectangle is $16 \times 20 = 320$.

Therefore, the area of the convex polygon is 320. The answer is: $320$

Interesting, let's analyze step by step:



The equation given is a product of two terms equal to zero. This means that either the first term is zero or the second term is zero.

The first term is $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)$, and it equals zero if and only if both $\vert x + y \vert - 10 = 0$ and $\vert x - y \vert - 10 = 0$. This implies that $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$.

The second term is $((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2)$, and it equals zero if and only if both $\vert x \vert - 8 = 0$ and $\vert y \vert - 8 = 0$. This implies that $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$.

From the first term, we have $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. This implies that $x + y = \pm 10$ and $x - y = \pm 10$. Solving these equations, we get the four points $(5, 5)$, $(5, -5)$, $(-5, 5)$, and $(-5, -5)$.

From the second term, we have $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$. This implies that $x = \pm 8$ and $y = \pm 8$. Solving these equations, we get the four points $(8, 8)$, $(8, -8)$, $(-8, 8)$, and $(-8, -8)$.

The eight points $(5, 5)$, $(5, -5)$, $(-5, 5)$, $(-5, -5)$, $(8, 8)$, $(8, -8)$, $(-8, 8)$, and $(-8, -8)$ form a square with side length $10$. The area of this square is $10^2 = 100$.

So, the area of the convex polygon is $100$. The answer is: $100$
