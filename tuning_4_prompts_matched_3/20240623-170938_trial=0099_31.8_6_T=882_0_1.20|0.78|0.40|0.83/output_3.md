Below is a math problem you are to solve (positive numerical answer!):
"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"
Analyze this problem and think step by step to come to a solution with programs. After solving the problem, output the final numerical answer within \boxed{}.

Assistant:

 The equation given in the problem is a product of two expressions equal to zero. Therefore, one of the expressions must be zero for the entire equation to be zero.

This gives us two separate cases to consider:

1. $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$
2. $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$

In the first case, for the sum of two squares to be zero, both squares must be zero:

$\vert x + y \vert - 10 = 0 \implies \vert x + y \vert = 10$
$\vert x - y \vert - 10 = 0 \implies \vert x - y \vert = 10$

This gives us the rectangle with vertices at $(8, 10), (8, -10), (-8, -10), (-8, 10)$.

In the second case, for the sum of two squares to be zero, both squares must be zero:

$\vert x \vert - 8 = 0 \implies \vert x \vert = 8 \implies x = 8 \text{ or } x = -8$
$\vert y \vert - 8 = 0 \implies \vert y \vert = 8 \implies y = 8 \text{ or } y = -8$

This gives us the square with vertices at $(8, 8), (8, -8), (-8, -8), (-8, 8)$.

The intersection of these two regions is the square with vertices at $(8, 8), (8, -8), (-8, -8), (-8, 8)$, which is the area enclosed by the convex polygon. The area of this square can be found by multiplying the length of one side by itself: $8 \times 8 = 64$.

Therefore, the area of the convex polygon is 64 square units. The answer is: $64$

The equation $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + (\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ implies that $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. These equations represent two squares of side length 10 centered at the origin. The intersection of these two squares forms a square with side length 10 and area $10^2 = 100$.

The equation $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + (\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ implies that $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$, which represent two squares of side length 8 centered at the origin. The intersection of these two squares forms a square with side length 8 and area $8^2 = 64$.

The intersection of the two regions is the area enclosed by the convex polygon. Therefore, the area of the convex polygon is the area of the smaller square, which is 64. The answer is: $64$

Below is a math problem you are to solve (positive numerical answer!):
"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"
Analyze this problem and think step by step to come to a solution with programs. After solving the problem, output the final numerical answer within \boxed{}.

Assistant:



First, let's analyze the given equation:
$$((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0.$$
For this product to be zero, one of the factors must be zero. So we have two cases:

1. $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ and $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 \neq 0$, or
2. $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ and $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 \neq 0$.

In the first case, $\vert x + y \vert = 10$, which implies that $x + y = \pm 10$ or $x + y = 0$. In the second case, $\vert x - y \vert = 10$, which implies that $x - y = \pm 10$ or $x - y = 0$. These equations define lines in the coordinate plane. The intersection of these lines form a square with side length 16 (the distance from the origin to the lines $x + y = \pm 10$ or $x - y = \pm 10$). The area of this square is $16^2 = 256$. So, the area of the convex polygon is 256. The answer is: $256$

Below is a math problem you are to solve (positive numerical answer!):
"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"

Assistant:

 The given equation is equal to zero if either of the factors is zero. This means that either $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$, $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$, $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$, or $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$.

Each of these equations is satisfied if and only if the absolute value of the corresponding expression is equal to 10 or 8. This gives us the following four sets of equations:

1. $x + y = 10$ or $x + y = -10$
2. $x - y = 10$ or $x - y = -10$
3. $x = 8$ or $x = -8$
4. $y = 8$ or $y = -8$

These equations represent the sides of the polygon. The polygon is a square with side length 16. The area of a square is given by the square of the length of its side, so the area of the polygon is $16^2 = 256$. The answer is: $256$

"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"

Assistant:


The equation given is a product of two terms equal to zero. This means that either the first term is zero or the second term is zero. 

The first term is $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)$. This term equals to zero if and only if $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. These two equations represent two squares with side length 10 centered at the origin. The intersection of these two squares is a square with side length 10 and area $10^2 = 100$.

The second term is $((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2)$. This term equals to zero if and only if $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$. These two equations represent two squares with side length 16 centered at the origin. The intersection of these two squares is a square with side length 8 and area $8^2 = 64$.

Therefore, the points that satisfy the original equation are the union of the points that satisfy each of the two terms being zero. The union of two squares is another square whose side length is the maximum of the side lengths of the two squares. So the side length of the larger square is 10, and its area is $10^2 = 100$.

So the area of the convex polygon is 100. The answer is: $100$

 The equation $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ is equal to zero if and only if at least one of the factors is equal to zero. 

The factor $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)$ is equal to zero if and only if $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. These two equations define a square with side length 10, centered at the origin.

The factor $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ is equal to zero if and only if $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$. These two equations define a square with side length 16, centered at the origin.

The intersection of the two squares is a square with side length 8, centered at the origin. Therefore, the area of the convex polygon is $8^2 = 64$. The answer is: $64$

Assistant:

 The given equation is a product of two terms equal to zero, which means that either the first term is zero or the second term is zero. 

Let's consider each term separately:
1. $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ implies $\vert x + y \vert = 10$, which means $x + y = \pm 10$.
2. $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ implies $\vert x - y \vert = 10$, which means $x - y = \pm 10$.
3. $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ implies $\vert x \vert = 8$, which means $x = \pm 8$.
4. $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ implies $\vert y \vert = 8$, which means $y = \pm 8$.

By solving these equations, we find that the points $(x, y)$ that satisfy the given equation are the vertices of a square with side length 10 (the distance between the lines $x + y = \pm 10$ and $x - y = \pm 10$, or the distance between the lines $x = \pm 8$ and $y = \pm 8$).

The area of a square is given by the square of the length of its side, so the area of this square is $10^2 = 100$.
The answer is: $100$

The expression $AB = 0$ is true if and only if $A = 0$ or $B = 0$. Therefore, the given equation is satisfied if either $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$.
The solutions to $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ are $x + y = \pm 10$.
The solutions to $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ are $x - y = \pm 10$.
The solutions to $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ are $x = \pm 8$.
The solutions to $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ are $y = \pm 8$.
These lines form a square with side length $16$. The area of the square is $16^2 = 256$. Therefore, the area of the convex polygon is $256$. The answer is: $256$
