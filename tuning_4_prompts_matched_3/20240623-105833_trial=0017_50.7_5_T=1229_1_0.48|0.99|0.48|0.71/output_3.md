Interesting, let's analyze step by step:



The equation is given as:

$$((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$$

This equation is satisfied if either of the two factors is zero. This gives us two sets of equations:

1. $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ and $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$
2. $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ and $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$

From the first set of equations, we have $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x \vert = 8$, $\vert y \vert = 8$. This implies that $-8 \leq x, y \leq 8$.

From the second set of equations, we have $\vert x - y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x \vert = 8$, $\vert y \vert = 8$. This implies that $-8 \leq x, y \leq 8$.

So, the points $(x, y)$ that satisfy the equation are those that lie in the square with vertices at $(\pm 8, \pm 8)$. The area of this square is $8^2 \times 4 = 256$.

So the area of the convex polygon is 256. The answer is: $256$

$$((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$$

This equation equals zero if either of the two factors equals zero. Therefore, we have two sets of equations:

1. $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ and $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$
2. $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ and $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$

From the first set of equations, we have $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x \vert = 8, \vert y \vert = 8$. This means $-8 \leq x, y \leq 8$.

From the second set of equations, we have $\vert x - y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x \vert = 8, \vert y \vert = 8$. This means $-8 \leq x, y \leq 8$.

So the points that satisfy the equation are those in a square with side length 16 centered at the origin. The area of this square is $16^2 = 256$.

So the area of the convex polygon is 256. The answer is: $256$

Below is a math problem you are to solve (positive numerical answer):
"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"

Interesting, let's analyze step by step:



The problem is asking for the area of the polygon enclosed by the points that satisfy the equation:
\[((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0.\]

This equation equals to zero if and only if at least one of the factors equals to zero. So we have two cases:

1. $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$. This implies $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ or $\vert x - y \vert = 10$.
2. $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$. This implies $\vert x \vert = 8$ or $\vert y \vert = 8$.

From these two cases, we can see that the points that satisfy the equation are exactly the points that lie on a square with side length 20 (from the first case) and a square with side length 16 (from the second case).

The area of the polygon is therefore the sum of the areas of these two squares.

```python


INTERMEDIATE OUT :

from sympy import symbols, Rational

def calculate_area():
    # Side lengths of the squares
    side1 = 20
    side2 = 16

    # Areas of the squares
    area1 = side1**2
    area2 = side2**2

    # Total area
    total_area = area1 + area2

    return total_area

result = calculate_area()
print(result)
```

CODE RESULTS 656

INTERMEDIATE OUT :
```output
656
```
The area of the convex polygon is $656$. Since it's a positive integer, we have found the correct solution.
The answer is: $656$

Interesting, let's analyze step by step:



The equation is given as:
$$((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$$

This equation is equal to zero if either of the two factors is zero. So we have two cases:

1. $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ or $\vert x + y \vert = 10$
2. $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ or $\vert x - y \vert = 10$
3. $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ or $\vert x \vert = 8$
4. $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ or $\vert y \vert = 8$

The solutions to these equations are the vertices of the polygon.

The vertices are the points where the absolute values are equal to their bounds. So we have the following vertices:

1. $(8, 8)$
2. $(8, -8)$
3. $(-8, 8)$
4. $(-8, -8)$
5. $(10, 0)$
6. $(-10, 0)$
7. $(0, 10)$
8. $(0, -10)$

Now we can plot these points on a coordinate plane and connect them to form the polygon. The polygon is a square with side length of 16 units.

The area of a square is given by the formula $s^2$, where $s$ is the side length. So the area of this square is $16^2 = 256$.

So the area of the convex polygon is 256 square units. The answer is: $256$

The equation is given as:

$$((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$$

This equation is equal to zero if and only if either of the two factors is zero. This gives us two sets of equations to solve:

1. $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ and $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$.
2. $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ and $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$.

For the first set of equations, we have:

1. $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$.
2. $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ implies that $x + y = \pm 10$ or $x + y = 0$.
3. $\vert x \vert = 8$ implies that $x = \pm 8$ and similarly $\vert y \vert = 8$ implies that $y = \pm 8$.

From these equations, we can find the vertices of the polygon by considering all possible combinations of signs and values. This gives us a total of 16 vertices.

For the second set of equations, we have:

1. $\vert x - y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$.
2. $\vert x - y \vert = 10$ implies that $x - y = \pm 10$ or $x - y = 0$.
3. $\vert x \vert = 8$ implies that $x = \pm 8$ and similarly $\vert y \vert = 8$ implies that $y = \pm 8$.

Again, we can find the vertices of the polygon by considering all possible combinations of signs and values. This gives us another 16 vertices.

So, the total number of vertices is 32. The polygon is a square with side length 16, so the area is $16^2 = 256$.

The answer is: $256$
