Solve the following problem with a Python Script (positive numerical answer):
"A function $f: \mathbb N \to \mathbb N$ satisfies the following two conditions for all positive integers $n$:$f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$ and $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$. Calculate $f(100)$."
Write comments to indicate the steps you take. Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Assistant:

Approach:


We can start by using the second condition $f(2n) = 2f(n) + 1$ to find $f(100)$. We know that $100 = 2 \cdot 50$, so we can substitute $n = 50$ into the second condition to get $f(100) = 2f(50) + 1$. 

Next, we can substitute $n = 50$ into the first condition $f(f(f(n))) = 8n - 7$ to get $f(f(f(50))) = 8 \cdot 50 - 7 = 393$. 

We know that $f(f(f(50))) = f(f(100))$, so $f(f(100)) = 393$.

Again, we can use the second condition to find $f(f(100))$: $f(f(100)) = 2f(f(50)) + 1 = 393$.

Solving this equation for $f(f(50))$, we get $f(f(50)) = \frac{393 - 1}{2} = 196$.

Finally, we can substitute $n = 50$ into the second condition $f(2n) = 2f(n) + 1$ to get $f(100) = 2f(50) + 1$. 

Substituting $f(50) = 196$ into this equation, we get $f(100) = 2 \cdot 196 + 1 = 393$.

But this is the value of $f(f(100))$, not $f(100)$ itself. So we need to find $f(100)$ using the first condition $f(f(f(n))) = 8n - 7$. 

Substituting $n = 50$ into this equation, we get $f(f(f(50))) = 8 \cdot 50 - 7 = 393$.

And we know that $f(f(f(50))) = f(100)$, so $f(100) = 393$.

So the value of $f(100)$ is 393. The answer is: $393$

Solve the following problem with a Python Script (positive numerical answer):
"A function $f: \mathbb N \to \mathbb N$ satisfies the following two conditions for all positive integers $n$:$f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$ and $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$. Calculate $f(100)$."

Approach:


To calculate $f(100)$, we need to find a pattern in the function $f$. From the given conditions, we can use $f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$ to find $f(f(1))$ and $f(1)$. Then, we can use $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$ to find $f(100)$.

1. First, let's find $f(f(1))$ using the equation $f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$ with $n=1$. This gives us $f(f(1)) = 8*1 - 7 = 1$.
2. Next, we know that $f(f(1)) = f(1)$, so $f(1) = 1$.
3. Now, let's use the equation $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$ to find $f(100)$. We can write $100 = 2*50$, so $f(100) = 2f(50)+1$.
4. But we don't know $f(50)$ yet, so we need to find it. We can write $50 = 2*25$, so $f(50) = 2f(25)+1$.
5. Similarly, $25 = 2*12.5$, but 12.5 is not a positive integer, so we cannot use this equation to find $f(50)$. Instead, we can use the fact that $f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$ to find $f(25)$. With $n=25$, this equation gives us $f(f(25)) = 8*25 - 7 = 193$.
6. Since $f(f(25)) = f(25)$, we now have $f(25) = 193$.
7. Substituting this into our equation for $f(50)$, we get $f(50) = 2*193 + 1 = 387$.
8. Finally, substituting this into our equation for $f(100)$, we get $f(100) = 2*387 + 1 = 775$.

So, $f(100) = 775$. The answer is: $775$

Approach:


We can start by plugging in $n=100$ into the second condition: $f(200)=2f(100)+1$.
We also know from the first condition that $f(f(f(100)))=8(100)-7=793$.
Let's set $f(100)=x$, then we have $f(f(f(100)))=f(f(x))=f(2x)=2f(x)+1$.
Now we have the system of equations:
$2f(x)+1=793$
$f(2x)=2f(x)+1$
From the first equation, we can solve for $f(x)$:
$2f(x)=792$
$f(x)=396$
Now we can substitute $x=100$ into this result to find $f(100)$:
$f(100)=396$
So, $f(100)=396$. The answer is: $396$

Approach:


We can start by calculating $f(100)$ using the second given equation in the problem. The second equation is $f(2n) = 2f(n) + 1$. This means we can find $f(100)$ by first calculating $f(50)$ and then using that to find $f(25)$, and so on.

By applying the second equation, we get $f(100) = 2f(50) + 1$. We can't directly find $f(50)$ from this equation without knowing another value of $f$. However, we can apply the second equation again to find $f(50)$ in terms of $f(25)$: $f(50) = 2f(25) + 1$. 

We can keep doing this, each time halving $n$ and expressing $f(n)$ in terms of $f(n/2)$. 

After several steps, we will reach $f(1)$, which we can find using the first given equation in the problem. The first equation is $f(f(f(n))) = 8n - 7$. If we set $n = 1$, we get $f(f(f(1))) = 8*1 - 7 = -1$. Since all values of $f$ are natural numbers, we know that $f(f(f(1))) = 1$. Therefore, $f(1) = 1$.

Now that we know $f(1)$, we can use the second equation repeatedly to find $f(2), f(4), f(8), f(16), \ldots, f(50), f(100)$.

Let's calculate $f(2)$: $f(2) = 2f(1) + 1 = 2*1 + 1 = 3$.

Then, $f(4) = 2f(2) + 1 = 2*3 + 1 = 7$.

Next, $f(8) = 2f(4) + 1 = 2*7 + 1 = 15$.

And $f(16) = 2f(8) + 1 = 2*15 + 1 = 31$.

Continuing in this way, we find $f(32) = 63$, $f(64) = 127$, and so on, until we reach $f(50)$. 

Finally, we can use the values of $f(50)$ and $f(25)$ to find $f(100)$: $f(100) = 2f(50) + 1 = 2*127 + 1 = 255$.

So, $f(100) = 255$. The answer is: $255$.

Approach:



To solve $f(100)$, we need to use the given functional equations.

We start with $f(100)$ and apply the second equation: $f(2*50)=2f(50)+1$.

Next, we apply the second equation again: $f(2*25)=2f(25)+1$.

And again: $f(2*12.5)=2f(12.5)+1$.

But we can't continue applying the second equation since $12.5$ is not a natural number. So, we must use the first equation.

From $f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$, when $n=12.5$, we get $f(f(f(12.5)))=8*12.5-7=97$.

If we set $f(12.5)=k$, then we have $f(k)=97$. We need to find $k$ first.

From the first equation, when $n=k$, we get $f(f(k))=8k-7$.

But we know $f(k)=97$, so we substitute it into the equation: $f(97)=8k-7$.

From the second equation, when $n=k/2$, we get $f(k)=2f(k/2)+1$.

Substitute $f(k)=97$ into the equation: $97=2f(k/2)+1$, so $f(k/2)=(97-1)/2=48$.

Again, substitute $k/2=48$ into the equation: $k=2*48=96$.

Now, we know $k=96$, and substitute it into the equation $f(k)=8k-7$: $f(96)=8*96-7=767$.

Finally, substitute $k=96$ into the equation $f(2*50)=2f(50)+1$: $f(100)=2f(50)+1$.

But we know $f(50)=f(2*25)=2f(25)+1$.

And $f(25)=f(2*12.5)=2f(12.5)+1=2f(25)+1$, so $f(25)=48$.

Substitute $f(25)=48$ into the equation $f(50)=2f(25)+1$: $f(50)=2*48+1=97$.

Substitute $f(50)=97$ into the equation $f(100)=2f(50)+1$: $f(100)=2*97+1=195$.

So, $f(100)=195$.
The answer is: $195$

Approach:


We are given two equations: $f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$ and $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$. To find $f(100)$, we can try to find a pattern or relationship between $n$ and $f(n)$.

We can start by substituting $n=1$ into the second equation: $f(2)=2f(1)+1$.

Then, substitute $n=f(1)$ into the first equation: $f(f(f(f(1))))=8f(1)-7$. But we know that $f(f(f(1)))=f(2)$ from the second equation, so we get $f(f(2))=8f(1)-7$.

We can use the second equation again to replace $f(f(2))$: $f(2f(1)+1)=8f(1)-7$.

We also know from the first equation that $f(f(f(1)))=8(1)-7=1$, so $f(f(2))=1$.

Now we have the equation $f(2f(1)+1)=1$.

From this equation, we can see that if $2f(1)+1=2$, then $f(2)=1$. Solving this equation gives $f(1)=1/2$, which is not possible as $f(n)$ is a function of natural numbers. So we must have made a mistake.

Let's go back and try another approach.

We know that $f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$. If we let $n=f(1)$, we get $f(f(f(f(1))))=8f(1)-7$, or $f(f(2))=8f(1)-7$.

We also know that $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$. If we let $n=1$, we get $f(2)=2f(1)+1$.

Now we have two equations: $f(f(2))=8f(1)-7$ and $f(2)=2f(1)+1$.

Let's substitute $f(2)=2f(1)+1$ into the first equation: $f(8f(1)-6)=8f(1)-7$.

If we let $n=f(1)$ in the first equation again, we get $f(f(f(f(1))))=8f(1)-7$, or $f(f(2))=8f(1)-7$.

Comparing this with $f(8f(1)-6)=8f(1)-7$, we see that $f(2)=8f(1)-6$.

Now we can substitute this into $f(2)=2f(1)+1$: $8f(1)-6=2f(1)+1$.

Solving this equation gives $f(1)=1$.

Now we can substitute $f(1)=1$ into $f(2)=2f(1)+1$ to find $f(2)=3$.

Then we can substitute $f(1)=1$ and $f(2)=3$ into $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$ to find $f(4)=7$.

We can continue this process to find more values of $f(n)$. We find that $f(n)=2n-1$.

Now we can substitute $n=100$ into $f(n)=2n-1$ to find $f(100)=2*100-1=199$.

Therefore, $f(100)=199$. The answer is: $\boxed{199}$

Approach:

 We will first apply the second given condition to find $f(100)$ in terms of $f(50)$. Then we will apply the second condition again to find $f(50)$ in terms of $f(25)$. This process will be repeated until we can find the value of $f(1)$ or $f(2)$, for which we can use the first given condition.

First, we use the second given condition: $f(2n) = 2f(n) + 1$. We can find $f(100)$ as follows:
$$f(100) = 2f(50) + 1.$$

Next, we find $f(50)$:
$$f(50) = 2f(25) + 1.$$

Then, $f(25) = 2f(12.5)$, but $f$ is only defined for positive integers, so we stop here. Now we need to find $f(1)$ or $f(2)$. We use the first given condition: $f(f(f(n))) = 8n - 7$.

For $n = 1$, we have $f(f(f(1))) = 8*1 - 7 = 1$. Thus, $f(f(1)) = 1$, so $f(1) = 1$.

Finally, we can substitute $f(1)$ into the equations we found above to find $f(25)$, $f(50)$, and $f(100)$.

From $f(50) = 2f(25) + 1$, substituting $f(25) = 2f(12.5)$ with $f(1) = 1$, we have $f(50) = 2(2*1 + 1) + 1 = 7$.

From $f(100) = 2f(50) + 1$, substituting $f(50) = 7$, we have $f(100) = 2*7 + 1 = 15$.

Therefore, $f(100) = 15$.
The value of $f(100)$ is 15. The answer is: $\boxed{15}$

Solve the following problem with a Python Script (positive numerical answer):

Assistant:

Approach:


To find $f(100)$, we can use the second condition of the function $f$ given in the problem statement. We know that $f(2n) = 2f(n) + 1$. This means we can find $f(100)$ by first finding $f(50)$ and then using this value to find $f(25)$, $f(12.5)$, etc. until we reach a value for which we know the value of $f$ directly.

Let's start with $f(50)$:
Using the second condition, $f(50) = 2f(25) + 1$.

But we don't know $f(25)$ yet. So let's find that:
Using the second condition again, $f(25) = 2f(12.5) + 1$.

Again, we don't know $f(12.5)$. So let's find that:
Using the first condition given in the problem statement, $f(f(f(12.5))) = 8(12.5) - 7 = 80 - 7 = 73$.

Since $f(f(f(12.5))) = 73$, and we know that $f(f(f(n))) = n$ (from the first condition), so $f(12.5) = 73$.

Now we can find $f(25)$:
$f(25) = 2f(12.5) + 1 = 2(73) + 1 = 146 + 1 = 147$.

Now we can find $f(50)$:
$f(50) = 2f(25) + 1 = 2(147) + 1 = 294 + 1 = 295$.

Finally, we can find $f(100)$:
$f(100) = 2f(50) + 1 = 2(295) + 1 = 590 + 1 = 591$.

So the value of $f(100)$ is 591.

However, there is a mistake in the logic used here. The second condition $f(2n) = 2f(n) + 1$ is not applicable to the problem as it requires $n$ to be an integer, but here we are dealing with a non-integer value of $12.5$. The first condition $f(f(f(n))) = 8n - 7$ seems to be more appropriate for this problem. Let's reconsider the problem using this condition.

First, let's find $f(50)$:
Using the first condition, $f(f(f(50))) = 8(50) - 7 = 400 - 7 = 393$.

Since $f(f(f(50))) = 393$, and we know that $f(f(f(n))) = n$ (from the first condition), so $f(50) = 393$.

Now let's find $f(100)$:
Using the first condition again, $f(f(f(100))) = 8(100) - 7 = 800 - 7 = 793$.

Since $f(f(f(100))) = 793$, and we know that $f(f(f(n))) = n$, so $f(100) = 793$.

However, this result is not matching with the previous result $f(100) = 591$. It seems that the function $f$ might not have a simple mathematical expression that can be easily evaluated using basic algebraic operations. This kind of functions are usually solved using numerical methods or through programming.

Let's solve the problem using Python:

```python


INTERMEDIATE OUT :

def find_f_of_100():
    def f(n):
        return 8 * n - 7

    return f(f(f(100)))

result = find_f_of_100()
print(result)
```

CODE RESULTS 50689

INTERMEDIATE OUT :
```output
50689
```
The result is $50689$. This doesn't seem to be correct either as it's much larger than the previous results. This is because we are using a function $f(n) = 8n - 7$ directly without considering the constraints given in the problem. This function does not satisfy the given conditions.

However, the solution is quite evident from the problem itself. The function $f$ is applied three times to $n$ to get the value $8n - 7$. This means that applying the function just once would give us a value closer to the desired result. So, let's define a new function $g(n) = \frac{n + 7}{8}$ and apply it to $n$ to get $f(n)$:

```python


INTERMEDIATE OUT :

def f(n):
    return (n + 7) / 8

result = f(f(f(100)))
print(result)
```

CODE RESULTS 1.193359375

INTERMEDIATE OUT :
```output
1.193359375
```
The result is a decimal number, which doesn't make sense in this context. This is because we are applying the function $f$ three times to $100$ instead of once. So, let's correct this and apply the function just once:

```python


INTERMEDIATE OUT :

def find_f_of_100():
    n = 100
    result = f(n)
    return result

result = find_f_of_100()
print(result)
``````output

CODE RESULTS 13.375

INTERMEDIATE OUT :

13.375
```
Again, the result is a decimal number, which doesn't make sense in this context. This is because we are applying the function $f$ incorrectly. Let's reevaluate the function $f(n)$ given in the problem statement: $f(n) = 2n + 1$ when $n$ is even and $f(n) = 3n + 1$ when $n$ is odd. However, applying this function to $n = 100$ would give $f(100) = 201$, which is not correct either. This is because we are not considering the condition $f(f(f(n))) = 8n - 7$ correctly.

Let's reconsider the problem using a numerical approach. We know that $f(f(f(n))) = 8n - 7$. So, let's define a function that calculates $f(n)$ by iteratively applying the function until we get $f(f(f(n)))$:

```python


INTERMEDIATE OUT :

def find_f_of_n(n):
    while True:
        n = 8 * n - 7
        if n < 0:

Solve the following problem with a Python Script (positive numerical answer):
"A function $f: \mathbb N \to \mathbb N$ satisfies the following two conditions for all positive integers $n$:$f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$ and $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$. Calculate $f(100)$."
Write comments to indicate the steps you take. Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Assistant:

Approach:


We can start by applying the second condition of the function $f$ to $n=50$:
\[f(f(f(50)))=f(f(100))=f(2f(50)+1)=f(2\cdot25+1)=f(51).\]
But we know from the first condition that $f(f(f(50)))=8\cdot50-7=393$. So we have
\[f(51)=393.\]
Now, let's substitute $n=25$ into the second condition:
\[f(f(f(25)))=f(f(50))=f(2f(25)+1)=f(2\cdot12+1)=f(25).\]
From the first condition, we have
\[f(f(f(25)))=8\cdot25-7=193.\]
So we have
\[f(50)=193.\]
Now, let's substitute $n=12$ into the second condition:
\[f(f(f(12)))=f(f(24))=f(2f(12)+1)=f(2\cdot6+1)=f(13).\]
From the first condition, we have
\[f(f(f(12)))=8\cdot12-7=89.\]
So we have

Solve the following problem with a Python Script (positive numerical answer):
"A function $f: \mathbb N \to \mathbb N$ satisfies the following two conditions for all positive integers $n$:$f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$ and $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$. Calculate $f(100)$."
Write comments to indicate the steps you take. Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Assistant:

Approach:

 We will try to find a value for $f(1)$ first, then we can use the function rule $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$ to find $f(100)$.

Since we want to find $f(100)$, we should start from $f(1)$ first. From the function rule $f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$, when $n=1$, we get $f(f(f(1)))=8*1-7=1$, so $f(f(1))=1$. Then $f(1)$ must be the value that when substituted into the function rule $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$, the result is 1. 

Let's test a few values of $f(1)$:
- If $f(1)=1$, then $f(2)=2*1+1=3$, and $f(4)=2*3+1=7$. Then $f(f(f(1)))=f(f(1))=f(3)=2f(1)+1=2*1+1=3$, which is not equal to 1.
- If $f(1)=2$, then $f(2)=2*2+1=5$, and $f(4)=2*5+1=11$. Then $f(f(f(1)))=f(f(1))=f(5)=2f(2)+1=2*5+1=11$, which is not equal to 1.
- If $f(1)=3$, then $f(2)=2*3+1=7$, and $f(4)=2*7+1=15$. Then $f(f(f(1)))=f(f(1))=f(7)=2f(3)+1=2*3+1=7$, which is not equal to 1.
- If $f(1)=4$, then $f(2)=2*4+1=9$, and $f(4)=2*9+1=19$. Then $f(f(f(1)))=f(f(1))=f(9)=2f(4)+1=2*19+1=39$, which is not equal to 1.
- If $f(1)=5$, then $f(2)=2*5+1=11$, and $f(4)=2*11+1=23$. Then $f(f(f(1)))=f(f(1))=f(11)=2f(5)+1=2*5+1=11$, which is not equal to 1.
- If $f(1)=6$, then $f(2)=2*6+1=13$, and $f(4)=2*13+1=27$. Then $f(f(f(1)))=f(f(1))=f(13)=2f(6)+1=2*6+1=13$, which is not equal to 1.
- If $f(1)=7$, then $f(2)=2*7+1=15$, and $f(4)=2*15+1=31$. Then $f(f(f(1)))=f(f(1))=f(15)=2f(7)+1=2*7+1=15$, which is not equal to 1.
- If $f(1)=8$, then $f(2)=2*8+1=17$, and $f(4)=2*17+1=35$. Then $f(f(f(1)))=f(f(1))=f(17)=2f(8)+1=2*8+1=17$, which is not equal to 1.
- If $f(1)=9$, then $f(2)=2*9+1=19$, and $f(4)=2*19+1=39$. Then $f(f(f(1)))=f(f(1))=f(19)=2f(9)+1=2*9+1=19$, which is not equal to 1.
- If $f(1)=10$, then $f(2)=2*10+1=21$, and $f(4)=2*21+1=43$. Then $f(f(f(1)))=f(f(1))=f(21)=2f(10)+1=2*10+1=21$, which is not equal to 1.
- If $f(1)=11$, then $f(2)=2*11+1=23$, and $f(4)=2*23+1=47$. Then $f(f(f(1)))=f(f(1))=f(23)=2f(11)+1=2*11+1=23$, which is equal to 1.

Therefore, we have found that $f(1)=11$. Now we can use the function rule $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$ to find $f(100)$. Since $100 = 2*50$, we have $f(100) = 2f(50) + 1$. Similarly, $50 = 2*25$, so $f(50) = 2f(25) + 1$. Continuing in this way, we find that $f(100) = 2*(2*(2*f(12.5)+1)+1)+1 = 2*(2*(2*(2*f(6.25)+1)+1)+1)+1 = 2*(2*(2*(2*(2*f(3.125)+1)+1)+1)+1)+1 = 2*(2*(2*(2*(2*(2*f(1.5625)+1)+1)+1)+1)+1)+1 = 2*(2*(2*(2*(2*(2*11+1)+1)+1)+1)+1)+1 = 2*(2*(2*(2*(23)+1)+1)+1)+1 = 2*(2*(2*(47)+1)+1)+1 = 2*(2*95+1)+1 = 2*191+1 = 383$.

Therefore, $f(100) = 383$. The answer is: $\boxed{383}$

Approach:


We can start by applying the second condition of the function $f$ to find a value for $f(f(100))$. We know that $f(2n) = 2f(n) + 1$, so we can substitute $n = 50$ to get $f(100) = 2f(50) + 1$.

Now, we need to find a value for $f(50)$. We can use the second condition again, but we need to find a value for $f(25)$. We can apply the first condition of the function $f$, which is $f(f(f(n))) = 8n - 7$. Letting $n = 12.5$, we get $f(f(f(12.5))) = 8(12.5) - 7 = 100$. But $f(f(f(12.5))) = f(f(25))$, and we know that $f(f(f(n))) = 8n - 7$. So we have $f(f(25)) = 8(25) - 7 = 193$.

Now we can solve for $f(25)$: $f(25) = f(f(f(12.5))) = 100$.

Now we can substitute this value into the equation for $f(50)$: $f(50) = 2f(25) + 1 = 2(100) + 1 = 201$.

Finally, we can substitute this value into the equation for $f(100)$: $f(100) = 2f(50) + 1 = 2(201) + 1 = 403$.

Therefore, the value of $f(100)$ is 403.
The answer is: $403$

Approach:


We can start by substituting $n=1$ into the second equation to find $f(2)$.
$f(2) = 2f(1) + 1$.

Then, substitute $f(2)$ into the first equation in the first condition:
$f(f(f(1))) = 8(1) - 7$,
$f(f(2)) = 1$.

Again, substitute $f(2)$ into this equation:
$f(2) = 1$.

Substitute $f(2)$ into the equation $f(2) = 2f(1) + 1$ to solve for $f(1)$:
$1 = 2f(1) + 1$,
$f(1) = 0$.

Now we have $f(1) = 0$ and $f(2) = 1$. We can substitute $n=2$ into the second equation to find $f(4)$:
$f(4) = 2f(2) + 1 = 2(1) + 1 = 3$.

Substitute $f(4)$ into the first equation in the first condition:
$f(f(f(2))) = 8(2) - 7$,
$f(f(4)) = 9$.

Again, substitute $f(4)$ into this equation:
$f(4) = 9$.

Substitute $f(4)$ into the equation $f(4) = 2f(2) + 1$ to solve for $f(2)$:
$9 = 2f(2) + 1$,
$f(2) = 4$.

Now we have $f(1) = 0$, $f(2) = 1$, $f(4) = 3$, and $f(2) = 4$.
We can see that $f(n)$ is a one-to-one function.
From the second equation, we can deduce that $f(2n) = 2f(n) + 1$.
So, $f(100) = 2f(50) + 1$.
Again, from the second equation, we can deduce that $f(50) = 2f(25) + 1$.
Continuing this process, we can find that $f(100) = 2(2(2(f(25) + 1) + 1) + 1) + 1$.

Since we know that $f(25) = 2f(12.5)$, but $f(n)$ is defined only for natural numbers, so $f(25) = 0$.
Substituting this value back into the equation, we have:
$f(100) = 2(2(2(0 + 1) + 1) + 1) + 1 = 2(2(3) + 1) + 1 = 2(7) + 1 = 15$.

So, the value of $f(100)$ is 15. The answer is: $15$

We will solve the problem by substituting $n = 100$ into the second equation to find $f(200)$, then substituting $f(200)$ into the second equation to find $f(f(200))$, and finally substituting $f(f(200))$ into the first equation to find $f(100)$.

1. First, we substitute $n = 100$ into the second equation to get $f(200) = 2f(100) + 1$.
2. Next, we substitute $f(200)$ into the second equation to get $f(f(200)) = 2f(f(100)) + 1$.
3. Finally, we substitute $f(f(200))$ into the first equation to get $f(f(f(100))) = 8(100) - 7 = 793$.

Now, we need to find the values of $f(100)$ and $f(f(100))$ that satisfy these equations.

We start by substituting $n = 50$ into the second equation to get $f(100) = 2f(50) + 1$.
We then substitute $f(100)$ into the second equation again to get $f(f(100)) = 2f(f(50)) + 1$.
And finally, we substitute $f(f(100))$ into the first equation to get $f(f(f(50))) = 793$.

Now, we need to find the values of $f(50)$ and $f(f(50))$ that satisfy these equations.

We continue this process until we reach $n = 1$, for which we know that $f(1) = 1$.

By iterating through this process, we find that $f(100) = 151$ and $f(f(100)) = 301$.
And substituting these values into the first equation gives $f(f(f(100))) = 793$.

Therefore, $f(100) = 151$. The answer is: $151$

Approach:



We are given two equations for the function $f$. We can use these equations to find a pattern and eventually calculate $f(100)$.

Step 1:

We are given the equation $f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$. If we substitute $n=f(f(n))$ into this equation, we get $f(f(f(f(f(n)))))=8f(f(n))-7$. But we are also given that $f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$, so we can substitute this into the equation to get $f(f(8n-7))=8f(f(n))-7$.

Step 2:

Now we want to find $f(100)$, and we know that $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$. If we let $n=50$, then we have $f(100)=2f(50)+1$. But we don't know $f(50)$ yet.

Step 3:

We can use the equation $f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$ to find $f(50)$. If we substitute $n=25$, we get $f(f(f(25)))=8*25-7=193$. And we know that $f(f(f(25)))=f(100)$, so we have $f(100)=193$.

Step 4:

Now we can substitute $n=50$ into the equation $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$ to get $f(100)=2f(50)+1$. Since we know that $f(100)=193$, we can solve for $f(50)$ to get $f(50)=\frac{193-1}{2}=96$.

Step 5:

Finally, we substitute $n=96$ into the equation $f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$ to find $f(100)$. We get $f(f(f(96)))=8*96-7=765$. And we know that $f(f(f(96)))=f(100)$, so we have $f(100)=765$.

But this doesn't match our previous result $f(100)=193$. There must be an error somewhere, but we can't find it in our calculations. The only other equation we haven't used is $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$.

Step 6:

Let's try using this equation to find $f(50)$. If we substitute $n=25$, we get $f(50)=2f(25)+1$. But we don't know $f(25)$ yet.

Step 7:

We can use the equation $f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$ to find $f(25)$. If we substitute $n=12.5$, we get $f(f(f(12.5)))=8*12.5-7=93$. But $12.5$ isn't a positive integer, so we made a mistake.

Let's go back and check our work. It seems we made an error in step 6. We should have used the equation $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$ to find $f(50)$, but we made a mistake when we substituted $n=25$. Let's correct this.

Correcting the mistake:

We were given the equation $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$. If we substitute $n=25$, we get $f(50)=2f(25)+1$. But we don't know $f(25)$ yet.

Step 8:

We can use the equation $f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$ to find $f(25)$. If we substitute $n=12.5$, we get $f(f(f(12.5)))=8*12.5-7=93$. But $12.5$ isn't a positive integer, so we made a mistake again.

Let's go back and check our work again. It seems we made an error in step 8. We should have used the equation $f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$ to find $f(25)$, but we made a mistake when we substituted $n=12.5$. Let's correct this.

Correcting the mistake:

We were given the equation $f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$. If we substitute $n=12.5$, we get $f(f(f(12.5)))=8*12.5-7=93$. And we know that $f(f(f(12.5)))=f(50)$, so we have $f(50)=93$.

Now we can substitute $n=50$ into the equation $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$ to get $f(100)=2f(50)+1$. Since we know that $f(50)=93$, we can solve for $f(100)$ to get $f(100)=2*93+1=187$.

But this still doesn't match our previous results. Let's try another approach.

Another approach:

Instead of using the equation $f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$, let's try using the equation $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$ to find $f(100)$. If we let $n=50$, we get $f(100)=2f(50)+1$. But we don't know $f(50)$ yet.

Step 9:

We can use the equation $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$ to find $f(50)$. If we substitute $n=25$, we get $f(50)=2f(25)+1$. But we don't know $f(25)$ yet.

Step 10:

We can use the equation $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$ to find $f(25)$. If we substitute $n=12.5$, we get $f(25)=2f(12.5)+1$. But we don't know $f(12.5)$ yet.

Step 11:

We can use the equation $f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$ to find $f(12.5)$. If we substitute $n=6.25$, we get $f(f(f(6.25)))=8*6.25-7=45$. But $6.2

We will start by applying the second condition to find $f(100)$.
We know that $f(2n) = 2f(n) + 1$. Therefore, if we let $n = 50$, we get $f(100) = 2f(50) + 1$. Now, we need to find $f(50)$.
Using the same formula, if we let $n = 25$, we get $f(50) = 2f(25) + 1$. We need to find $f(25)$ next.
If we let $n = 12.5$, this doesn't work because $n$ must be a positive integer. So, let's try another approach.

We know that $f(f(f(n))) = 8n - 7$. Let's let $n = 1$ and find $f(f(f(1)))$.
We have $f(f(f(1))) = 8(1) - 7 = 1$. Therefore, $f(1) = 1$.
Now, we can find $f(2)$:
We know that $f(2n) = 2f(n) + 1$. Letting $n = 1$, we get $f(2) = 2f(1) + 1 = 2(1) + 1 = 3$.
Next, we can find $f(4)$:
Using the same formula, if we let $n = 2$, we get $f(4) = 2f(2) + 1 = 2(3) + 1 = 7$.
And we can find $f(8)$:
If we let $n = 4$, we get $f(8) = 2f(4) + 1 = 2(7) + 1 = 15$.
Continuing in this way, we can find that $f(16) = 31$, $f(32) = 63$, and $f(64) = 127$.
Now, we can see a pattern that $f(2^n) = 2^n - 1$ for all positive integers $n$.

Now, we can use this pattern to find $f(50)$ and $f(100)$.
We have $50 = 2^1 + 2^3 + 2^4 = 2 + 8 + 16$. Therefore, $f(50) = f(2 + 8 + 16) = f(2) + f(8) + f(16) = 3 + 15 + 31 = 49$.
Similarly, $100 = 2^2 + 2^4 + 2^5 = 4 + 16 + 32$. Therefore, $f(100) = f(4 + 16 + 32) = f(4) + f(16) + f(32) = 7 + 31 + 63 = 101$.

So, the value of $f(100)$ is $101$. The answer is: $101$

Approach:



We are given two equations and need to find the value of $f(100)$. To do this, we need to try and simplify the problem using the given equations.

Let's start by applying the second equation to $f(100)$:

$f(100) = 2f(50) + 1$. 

We don't know $f(50)$, but we can apply the second equation again to find its value:

$f(50) = 2f(25) + 1$. 

Again, we don't know $f(25)$, but we can apply the second equation once more to find its value:

$f(25) = 2f(12.5) + 1$.

We are now stuck, because $f$ only operates on integers, so $12.5$ doesn't make sense. Let's go back and try the first equation:

The first equation is $f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$. 

Let's set $n=1$:

$f(f(f(1)))=8*1-7=1$, so $f(f(f(1)))=1$. 

Now let's set $n=2$:

$f(f(f(2)))=8*2-7=9$, so $f(f(f(2)))=9$. 

Since $f(f(f(1)))=1$, and $f(f(f(2)))=9$, and we know that $f(1) = 1$, we can try to find a pattern. 

Let's set $n=3$:

$f(f(f(3)))=8*3-7=17$, so $f(f(f(3)))=17$. 

Since $f(f(f(2)))=9$, and $f(f(f(3)))=17$, and we know that $f(2) = 3$, we can try to find a pattern. 

By this point, it seems that $f(n) = 2n - 1$. 

Let's test this for $n=100$:

$f(100) = 2*100 - 1 = 199$.

Therefore, $f(100) = 199$.

The answer is: $199$
