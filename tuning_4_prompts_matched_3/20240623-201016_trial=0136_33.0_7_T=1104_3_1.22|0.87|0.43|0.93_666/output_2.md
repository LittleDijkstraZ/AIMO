Approach:


The equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has $4$ distinct solutions when $\frac{m}{100}$ is less than $2$ but greater than or equal to $0$. This is because the function $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert$ oscillates between $0$ and $4$ as shown below:

[asy]
unitsize(1cm);
draw((-1,0)--(5,0),Arrow);
draw((0,-1)--(0,5),Arrow);
for(int i=-1;i<6;++i)
{
draw((i,.1)--(i,-.1));
}
for(int i=-1;i<5;++i)
{
draw((.1,i)--(-.1,i));
}
real f(real x)
{
return abs(abs(x-1)-2);
}
import graph;
size(7cm,7cm,IgnoreAspect);
real min = -1, max = 5;
draw(graph(f,min,max),red);
[/asy]

So we need to find how many positive values of $m$ exist such that $0 \le \frac{m}{100} < 2$. 
This simplifies to $0 \le m < 200$. 

The number of positive integers $m$ in this range is the same as the number of integers from $1$ to $199$, inclusive. 

To find this number, we can simply subtract the smallest integer from the largest and add $1$. 
So the number of positive integers $m$ is $199 - 1 + 1 = 199$.

So the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has $4$ distinct solutions for $199$ different values of $m$.

Solution: $199$
The value of $m$ is $199$.
The answer is: $199$

Approach:


The equation $| |x - 1| - 2| = \frac{m}{100}$ has 4 distinct solutions if and only if $\frac{m}{100} = 1$. This is because the expression $| |x - 1| - 2|$ can be at most 2 (when $|x - 1| = 2$), and if it is equal to 1, there will be 4 distinct solutions. 

So we need to solve the equation $| |x - 1| - 2| = 1$. This equation can be solved by breaking it into two cases:

Case 1: $|x - 1| - 2 = 1$, which simplifies to $|x - 1| = 3$. The solutions to this equation are $x = 4$ and $x = -2$.

Case 2: $|x - 1| - 2 = -1$, which simplifies to $|x - 1| = 1$. The solutions to this equation are $x = 2$ and $x = 0$.

So the values of $x$ that satisfy the original equation are $-2, 0, 2,$ and $4$. 

For these values of $x$, we have $| |x - 1| - 2| = 1$. This means that the right side of the original equation is equal to 1. Therefore, $m = 100$.

Therefore, the value of $m$ such that the equation $| |x - 1| - 2| = \frac{m}{100}$ has 4 distinct solutions is 100. The answer is: $1$

Approach:



The equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has four distinct solutions, it means that the expression inside the absolute value $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert$ must be equal to $\frac{m}{100}$ twice. That is, we have the two equations:

1. $\vert x-1 \vert -2 = \frac{m}{100}$
2. $\vert x-1 \vert -2 = -\frac{m}{100}$

We can solve these two equations separately.

For the first equation, we have:
$\vert x-1 \vert = 2 + \frac{m}{100}$
This equation has two cases:
Case 1: $x-1 = 2 + \frac{m}{100}$, so $x = 3 + \frac{m}{100}$.
Case 2: $-(x-1) = 2 + \frac{m}{100}$, so $x = -1 + \frac{m}{100}$.

For the second equation, we have:
$\vert x-1 \vert = 2 - \frac{m}{100}$
This equation also has two cases:
Case 3: $x-1 = 2 - \frac{m}{100}$, so $x = 3 - \frac{m}{100}$.
Case 4: $-(x-1) = 2 - \frac{m}{100}$, so $x = -1 - \frac{m}{100}$.

For the four solutions to be distinct, none of the four solutions can be the same. This implies that:
1. $3 + \frac{m}{100} \neq -1 + \frac{m}{100}$, so $4 \neq 0$, which is true.
2. $3 + \frac{m}{100} \neq 3 - \frac{m}{100}$, so $\frac{m}{100} \neq -\frac{m}{100}$, this is also true because $m$ is a positive integer.
3. $3 + \frac{m}{100} \neq -1 - \frac{m}{100}$, so $4 \neq -2$, this is true.
4. $-1 + \frac{m}{100} \neq -1 - \frac{m}{100}$, so $\frac{m}{100} \neq -\frac{m}{100}$, this is also true because $m$ is a positive integer.

Therefore, the four solutions are all distinct.

The value of $m$ must be such that $0 < \frac{m}{100} < 2$, which gives $0 < m < 200$. The number of positive integer solutions for $m$ in this interval is $199$.

But we must exclude the values of $m$ that make any of the four cases have the same solution. This happens when:
1. $3 + \frac{m}{100} = 3 - \frac{m}{100}$, so $\frac{m}{100} = 0$, this is impossible because $m$ is a positive integer.
2. $3 + \frac{m}{100} = -1 - \frac{m}{100}$, so $4 = -\frac{2m}{100}$, this is impossible because $m$ is a positive integer.
3. $-1 + \frac{m}{100} = -1 - \frac{m}{100}$, so $\frac{m}{100} = 0$, this is impossible because $m$ is a positive integer.

None of the above conditions are met, so all the 199 values of $m$ are valid.

So, there are 199 positive integers $m$ for which the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has $4$ distinct solutions.
The answer is: $199$

Approach:


The given equation is $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$.
We know that the function $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert$ is piecewise linear and it takes the value of $0$ at $x=3$ and $x=-1$.
The function is equal to $\frac{m}{100}$ at four distinct values of $x$ if and only if the value of $\frac{m}{100}$ is less than $2$.
This is because the maximum value of $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert$ is $2$.
So we need to find how many values of $m$ such that $0 < \frac{m}{100} < 2$.

Solving for $m$:
$0 < \frac{m}{100} < 2$.
Multiplying all sides by $100$ gives $0 < m < 200$.
So the values of $m$ that satisfy the inequality are the positive integers from $1$ to $199$.

Counting the number of these integers:
There are $199$ positive integers from $1$ to $199$.

Therefore, there are $199$ positive integers $m$ such that the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has $4$ distinct solutions. The answer is: 199

Approach:



For the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ to have $4$ distinct solutions, the value of $\frac{m}{100}$ must lie strictly between $0$ and $2$. This is because the graph of $y=\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert$ is a "V" shape with the "valleys" at $y=0$ and $y=2$. The value $\frac{m}{100}$ must fit into this gap between these two valleys so that there are $4$ intersections.

Mathematically, this means that $0<\frac{m}{100}<2$, or equivalently, $0<m<200$. 

Now, we need to find the number of positive integers $m$ that satisfy this inequality. This is simply the number of positive integers from $1$ to $199$.

To find this, we subtract the smallest value (which is $1$) from the largest value (which is $199$) and then add $1$:

\[199 - 1 + 1 = 199.\]

So the number of positive integers $m$ for which the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has $4$ distinct solutions is $199$.
The answer is: $199$
