Solve the following problem with a Python Script (positive numerical answer):
"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"
Write comments to indicate the steps you take. Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Approach:

 The given equation is zero when either of the terms inside the product is zero. This means we need to solve the following two equations:
1. $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$
2. $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$

For the first equation, $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$, this is only possible when both terms are zero individually. This gives us $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$.

For the second equation, $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$, this is only possible when both terms are zero individually. This gives us $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$.

From $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x \vert = 8$, we can deduce that $y = \pm 6$ or $y = 0$. Similarly, from $\vert x - y \vert = 10$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$, we can deduce that $x = \pm 6$ or $x = 0$.

So the four vertices of the polygon are $(0, 8)$, $(0, -8)$, $(6, 0)$, and $(-6, 0)$. This is a square with side length 12. The area of this square is $12^2 = 144$.
The answer is: $\boxed{144}$

Solve the following problem with a Python Script (positive numerical answer):
"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"

Approach:



The expression equals zero if either $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$, $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$, $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$, or $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$.

The first two equations are satisfied if $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. The last two equations are satisfied if $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$.

For $\vert x + y \vert = 10$, the points lie on a square with side length 10, centered at the origin.

For $\vert x - y \vert = 10$, the points lie on a square with side length 10, centered at the origin and rotated 45 degrees.

For $\vert x \vert = 8$, the points lie on a square with side length 16, centered at the origin and parallel to the x and y axes.

For $\vert y \vert = 8$, the points lie on a square with side length 16, centered at the origin and parallel to the x and y axes.

The intersection of these four squares forms a regular octagon with side length 8 (the smaller square). To find the area of this octagon, we can first find the area of the square with side length 10 and subtract the areas of the four triangles that make up the corners of the octagon.

The area of the square with side length 10 is $10^2 = 100$. Each of the four triangles is a right triangle with legs of length 8 and 6 (half the side length of the smaller square), so the area of each triangle is $(8*6)/2 = 24$. The total area of the four triangles is $4*24 = 96$.

Therefore, the area of the regular octagon is $100 - 96 = 4$.

The answer is: $4$

"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"

Assistant:

Approach:

 The expression $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ implies that $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. The expression $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ implies that $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$.

These conditions imply that the polygon is a square with side length 16 (since the absolute values of x and y are both 8, and the absolute values of x+y and x-y are both 10, meaning the diagonals of the square are of length 10).

The area of a square is side length squared, so the area of the polygon is $16^2 = 256$. The answer is: 256

Assistant:

Approach:



This problem requires understanding the properties of absolute values and how they affect the values of the functions. The first function, $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)$, is equal to zero if and only if both $\vert x + y \vert - 10 = 0$ and $\vert x - y \vert - 10 = 0$, which implies $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$.
The second function, $((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2)$, is equal to zero if and only if both $\vert x \vert - 8 = 0$ and $\vert y \vert - 8 = 0$, which implies $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$.
This means that the points $(x, y)$ that satisfy the equation are those that are at a distance of 10 from the points $(0, 0)$ and $(0, 0)$ in the $x + y$ and $x - y$ directions, and at a distance of 8 from the origin in the $x$ and $y$ directions. These form a square with side length 16.

Therefore, the area of the convex polygon is the area of the square, which can be calculated as the square of the side length, or $16^2$.

Solution:

The area of the convex polygon is $256$.

The answer is: $256$

Write comments to indicate the steps you take. Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Assistant:

Approach:

 The equation is a product of two quadratic expressions equal to zero, so either one of them must be zero for the whole expression to be zero. That means we can solve $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ and $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ and $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ and $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ separately. 

From $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$, we get $\vert x + y \vert = 10$. This implies that $x + y = \pm 10$.

From $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$, we get $\vert x \vert = 8$, which implies that $x = \pm 8$.

From $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$, we get $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. This implies that $x - y = \pm 10$.

From $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$, we get $\vert y \vert = 8$, which implies that $y = \pm 8$.

Now, we need to find the intersection points of these lines. We have four cases to consider:

1. $x = 8$ and $y = 8$: From $x + y = 10$, we get $8 + 8 = 16 \neq 10$, so this case is not possible.
2. $x = 8$ and $y = -8$: From $x + y = 10$, we get $8 - 8 = 0 \neq 10$, so this case is not possible.
3. $x = -8$ and $y = 8$: From $x + y = 10$, we get $-8 + 8 = 0 \neq 10$, so this case is not possible.
4. $x = -8$ and $y = -8$: From $x + y = 10$, we get $-8 - 8 = -16 \neq 10$, so this case is not possible.

So, the only possible intersection points are when $x = 8$ and $x - y = 10$, which gives $y = -2$. Similarly, we can find the other three intersection points: $x = -8$ and $x + y = 10$ gives $y = -18$, $x = 8$ and $x - y = -10$ gives $y = 18$, and $x = -8$ and $x + y = -10$ gives $y = 2$.

The points are $(8, -2)$, $(-8, -18)$, $(8, 18)$, and $(-8, 2)$. This forms a rectangle with side lengths 20 and 16. The area of the rectangle is $20 \times 16 = 320$.

The answer is: 320

Approach:

 The equation $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + (\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ implies that $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. This gives us four lines: $x + y = 10$, $x + y = -10$, $x - y = 10$, and $x - y = -10$. These lines form a square with side length 10.

Similarly, the equation $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + (\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ implies that $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$, which gives us four lines: $x = 8$, $x = -8$, $y = 8$, and $y = -8$. These lines form a square with side length 16.

The area of the intersection of these two squares is the area of the smaller square, which has side length 10. So the area of the convex polygon is $10^2 = 100$.

The answer is: $100$

Approach:

 The equation given is a product of two terms equal to zero, so either the first term is zero or the second term is zero.
The first term is zero when $|x+y| = 10$ and $|x-y| = 10$. These are two pairs of parallel lines, each 20 units apart. The convex polygon they enclose is a square with side length 20.
The second term is zero when $|x| = 8$ and $|y| = 8$. These are four pairs of parallel lines, two horizontal lines at y = 8 and y = -8, and two vertical lines at x = 8 and x = -8. The convex polygon they enclose is a square with side length 16.
The area of the convex polygon formed by the intersection of these two squares is the area of the smaller square. The side length of the smaller square is 16, so its area is $16^2 = 256$.
The answer is: $256$.

Approach:


The given equation is $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$. This equation is equal to zero when either of the two factors is zero. This gives us two sets of equations to solve for $(x, y)$:
1. $\vert x + y \vert - 10 = 0$ and $\vert x - y \vert - 10 = 0$
2. $\vert x \vert - 8 = 0$ and $\vert y \vert - 8 = 0$

Solving the first set of equations gives $x + y = 10$ and $x - y = 10$ or $x + y = -10$ and $x - y = -10$. Solving these gives the vertices of the polygon as $(5,5), (5,-5), (-5,5),$ and $(-5,-5)$.

Solving the second set of equations gives $x = 8$ and $y = 8$ or $x = -8$ and $y = -8$. These are also vertices of the polygon.

The polygon formed by these vertices is a square with side length 10. The area of a square is given by side length squared, so the area of the polygon is $10^2 = 100$.

Therefore, the area of the convex polygon is 100.
The answer is: $100$

Write comments to indicate the steps you take. Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Assistant:

Approach:


The equation given in the problem is a product of two expressions equal to zero. Therefore, either the first expression is zero or the second expression is zero.

We can analyze each expression separately:

1. $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2) = 0$
This implies that both $\vert x + y \vert - 10 = 0$ and $\vert x - y \vert - 10 = 0$.
So, $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$.
This means that $x + y = 10$ or $x + y = -10$, and $x - y = 10$ or $x - y = -10$.
Solving these four equations, we get the coordinates of the vertices of the polygon:
$(5,5), (5,-5), (-5,5), (-5,-5)$.

2. $((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$
This implies that both $\vert x \vert - 8 = 0$ and $\vert y \vert - 8 = 0$.
So, $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$.
This means that $x = 8$ or $x = -8$, and $y = 8$ or $y = -8$.
However, this gives the same vertices as the first expression, so this expression doesn't add any new information.

Now, we can find the area of the polygon formed by these vertices.

The polygon is a square with side length of $10$ units (from the distance between any two opposite vertices).
The area of a square is given by side length squared, so the area is $10^2 = 100$.

Therefore, the area of the convex polygon is 100 square units.
The answer is: $100$

Assistant:

Approach:


The equation given is a product of two expressions equal to zero, so either the first expression is zero or the second expression is zero.
If we solve each expression separately and then find the intersection of the solutions, we can find the vertices of the polygon. Then we can calculate the area of the polygon.

Step 1: Solve the first expression $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + (\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$.
This expression is zero if and only if both $\vert x + y \vert - 10 = 0$ and $\vert x - y \vert - 10 = 0$.
So we have $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$.

Step 2: Solve the second expression $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + (\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$.
This expression is zero if and only if both $\vert x \vert - 8 = 0$ and $\vert y \vert - 8 = 0$.
So we have $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$.

Step 3: Find the intersection of the solutions from step 1 and step 2.
From $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x \vert = 8$, we get $y = \pm 2$.
From $\vert x - y \vert = 10$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$, we get $x = \pm 2$.
So the vertices of the polygon are $(\pm 2, 2)$, $(\pm 2, -2)$, $(8, \pm 2)$, and $(-8, \pm 2)$.

Step 4: Calculate the area of the polygon.
The polygon is a square with side length $4$ (distance between $(\pm 2, 2)$ and $(\pm 2, -2)$), so the area is $4^2 = 16$.

So the area of the convex polygon is $16$. The answer is: $16$

Approach:

 The given equation is $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$.
For the product of two numbers to be zero, either one of them must be zero. This means that either $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2) = 0$ or $((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$.
For the first case, $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$, we have $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. This gives us four lines: $x + y = 10$, $x + y = -10$, $x - y = 10$, and $x - y = -10$. These lines enclose a square with side length 10, so the area is $10^2 = 100$.
For the second case, $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$, we have $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$. This gives us four lines: $x = 8$, $x = -8$, $y = 8$, and $y = -8$. These lines also enclose a square with side length 16, so the area is $16^2 = 256$.
The area of the convex polygon formed by the union of the two squares is the sum of their areas: $100 + 256 = 356$. However, this result doesn't make sense, as the area of a polygon cannot be negative.
To find the correct solution, we must revisit the original equation and check our work. The second case, $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$, actually leads to a circle with radius 8, not a square. Therefore, the area of the convex polygon is the sum of the areas of the square and the circle.
The side length of the square is 10, so its area is $10^2 = 100$. The radius of the circle is 8, so its area is $\pi * 8^2 = 64\pi$. Therefore, the area of the convex polygon is $100 + 64\pi$.

However, this is not an integer, which means we must have made a mistake somewhere. Let's reevaluate the problem step by step:

Step 1: The equation $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ can be separated into two cases. In the first case, $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2) = 0$. This leads to the lines $x + y = \pm10$ and $x - y = \pm10$, which form a square with side length 10.

Step 2: In the second case, $((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$. This leads to the circle $x^2 + y^2 = 64$.

Step 3: The intersection of the square and the circle is the convex polygon we are interested in. The area of the convex polygon is the sum of the areas of the square and the circle.

Step 4: The side length of the square is 10, so its area is $10^2 = 100$. The radius of the circle is 8, so its area is $\pi * 8^2 = 64\pi$. Therefore, the area of the convex polygon is $100 + 64\pi$.

The answer is: $100 + 64\pi$.

The equation in the problem can be rewritten as the product of two functions equaling zero:
$$((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$$
For the product of two factors to be zero, either one of the factors must be zero. So we have two cases:

Case 1: $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$
This implies that $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. These are the equations of two perpendicular lines passing through the points $(10,0)$ and $(-10,0)$ and the points $(0,10)$ and $(0,-10)$ in the coordinate plane. The intersection of these lines form a square with side length 20.

Case 2: $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$
This implies that $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$. These are the equations of two perpendicular lines passing through the points $(8,0)$ and $(-8,0)$ and the points $(0,8)$ and $(0,-8)$ in the coordinate plane. The intersection of these lines form a square with side length 16.

Now we can calculate the area of the convex polygon. The first square has side length 20, so its area is $20^2 = 400$. The second square has side length 16, so its area is $16^2 = 256$. The area of the convex polygon is the sum of the areas of these two squares, which is $400 + 256 = 656$.

So the area of the convex polygon is $\boxed{656}$.

Note: The problem asks for a positive numerical answer, so the area of the convex polygon is 656.
The answer is: $656$.

Approach:


The given equation is $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + (\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + (\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$. For the product of two numbers to be zero, either one of them must be zero. Hence, either of the two terms inside the brackets must be zero.

1. $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + (\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ implies that $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. These equations describe a square with side length 10 units. The vertices of the square are at $(0,0)$, $(10,0)$, $(0,10)$, and $(10,10)$.

2. $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + (\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ implies that $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$. These equations describe a square with side length 16 units centered at the origin. The vertices of this square are at $(-8,-8)$, $(-8,8)$, $(8,-8)$, and $(8,8)$.

The intersection of the two squares forms a square with side length 8 units, centered at the origin. The area of this square is $8^2 = 64$ square units. The answer is: $\boxed{64}$.

Approach:

 The given equation is a product of two expressions equal to zero. This means that either the first expression is zero or the second expression is zero. Let's consider these two cases separately.

Case 1: $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$. This implies that both $\vert x + y \vert - 10 = 0$ and $\vert x - y \vert - 10 = 0$, which simplifies to $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. The solutions to these two equations are:

1. $x + y = 10$ and $x - y = 10$, which gives $x = 10$ and $y = 0$.
2. $x + y = 10$ and $x - y = -10$, which gives $x = 0$ and $y = 10$.
3. $x + y = -10$ and $x - y = 10$, which gives $x = -10$ and $y = 0$.
4. $x + y = -10$ and $x - y = -10$, which gives $x = 0$ and $y = -10$.

So the vertices of the polygon are $(10, 0)$, $(0, 10)$, $(-10, 0)$, and $(0, -10)$.

Case 2: $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$. This implies that both $\vert x \vert - 8 = 0$ and $\vert y \vert - 8 = 0$, which simplifies to $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$. The solutions to these two equations are:

1. $x = 8$ and $y = 8$.
2. $x = 8$ and $y = -8$.
3. $x = -8$ and $y = 8$.
4. $x = -8$ and $y = -8$.

So these points also lie on the polygon.

The polygon formed is a square with side length $10$ units. Therefore, its area is $10^2 = 100$ square units.

So the area of the convex polygon is $100$.
The answer is: $100$.
