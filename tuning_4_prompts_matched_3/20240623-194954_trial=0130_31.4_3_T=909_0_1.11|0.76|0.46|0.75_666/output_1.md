 To solve this problem, we first need to find a relationship between $x$ and $y$ from the given equation $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$.

Let's consider the two cases for each absolute value:

Case 1: $x - 2y \geq 0$ and $y - 2x \geq 0$. Then, the equation becomes $x - 2y + y - 2x = 40$, which simplifies to $-x - y = 40$, or $x + y = -40$.

Case 2: $x - 2y < 0$ and $y - 2x < 0$. Then, the equation becomes $-(x - 2y) - (y - 2x) = 40$, which simplifies to $-x + 2y - y + 2x = 40$, or $x + y = 40$.

Now, we need to analyze these two cases further. We can rewrite the expression $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ as $(5x^2 - 8xy + 5y^2) = 5(x^2 - \frac{8}{5}xy + y^2) = 5[(x - \frac{4}{5}y)^2 - \frac{16}{25}y^2 + y^2] = 5[(x - \frac{4}{5}y)^2 + \frac{9}{25}y^2]$.

For the first case ($x + y = -40$), let $t = x + y$. Then, $x = -y - 40$, and we can substitute this into the expression:

$5[(x - \frac{4}{5}y)^2 + \frac{9}{25}y^2] = 5[((-y - 40) - \frac{4}{5}y)^2 + \frac{9}{25}y^2] = 5[((-9/5)y - 40)^2 + \frac{9}{25}y^2]$.

Taking the derivative with respect to $y$ and setting it to zero, we find that the minimum value occurs at $y = 0$. Substituting $y = 0$ into the equation $x + y = -40$, we find that $x = -40$. Thus, the minimum value of the expression in the first case is $5[(-40)^2 + 0] = 8000$.

For the second case ($x + y = 40$), let $t = x + y$. Then, $x = -y + 40$, and we can substitute this into the expression:

$5[(x - \frac{4}{5}y)^2 + \frac{9}{25}y^2] = 5[((-y + 40) - \frac{4}{5}y)^2 + \frac{9}{25}y^2] = 5[((-9/5)y + 40)^2 + \frac{9}{25}y^2]$.

Taking the derivative with respect to $y$ and setting it to zero, we find that the minimum value occurs at $y = 0$. Substituting $y = 0$ into the equation $x + y = 40$, we find that $x = 40$. Thus, the minimum value of the expression in the second case is $5[40^2 + 0] = 8000$.

Comparing the minimum values from both cases, we find that the minimum value of the expression $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ is $8000$.

Therefore, the minimum value of the expression $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ when $x$ and $y$ range over all real numbers such that $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$ is $8000$.

The answer is: $8000$.

"What is the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ when $x$ and $y$ range over all real numbers such that $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$?"

 To solve this problem, we can use the method of completing the square.
First, let's rewrite the expression $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ as follows:
$$5x^2+5y^2-8xy = (x^2 - 4xy + 4y^2) + (y^2 - 4xy + 4x^2) = (x - 2y)^2 + (y - 2x)^2.$$
Now, let's consider the equation $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$. By the triangle inequality, we know that $|x-2y| + |y-2x| \geq |(x-2y) - (y-2x)| = |x-2y - y + 2x| = |x - 3y + 2x| = |3x - 3y| = 3|x - y|$. Therefore, we have $3|x - y| = 40$, so $|x - y| = \frac{40}{3}$.
Now, let's consider the expression $(x - 2y)^2 + (y - 2x)^2$. By the triangle inequality, we have
$$(x - 2y)^2 + (y - 2x)^2 \geq (|x - 2y| - |y - 2x|)^2 = \left(\frac{40}{3} - |y - 2x|\right)^2.$$
By the equation $|x - 2y| + |y - 2x| = 40$, we know that $|y - 2x| = \frac{40}{3} - |x - 2y|$. Substituting this into the expression $(x - 2y)^2 + (y - 2x)^2$, we get
$$(x - 2y)^2 + (y - 2x)^2 = \left(\frac{40}{3} - |x - 2y|\right)^2 = \left(\frac{40}{3} - \frac{40}{3} + |x - 2y|\right)^2 = (|x - 2y|)^2.$$
Therefore, the minimum value of $(x - 2y)^2 + (y - 2x)^2$ is achieved when $|x - 2y| = |y - 2x| = \frac{40}{3}$. In this case, we have $|x - 2y| = |y - 2x| = \frac{40}{3}$, so $x - 2y = \pm (y - 2x)$. Solving this equation, we get $x = 2y$ or $x = y$. If $x = 2y$, we have $|x - 2y| = |y - 2x| = 0$, which does not satisfy the equation $|x - 2y| + |y - 2x| = 40$. If $x = y$, we have $|x - 2y| + |y - 2x| = |x - 2x| + |x - 2x| = |-x| + |-x| = 2|x| = 40$, so $|x| = 20$. Therefore, the minimum value of $(x - 2y)^2 + (y - 2x)^2$ is achieved when $x = 20$ and $y = 10$. In this case, the minimum value is $(x - 2y)^2 + (y - 2x)^2 = (20 - 20)^2 + (10 - 40)^2 = 0 + 900 = 900$. Therefore, the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ is 900 when $x = 20$ and $y = 10$.

The minimum value of the expression $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ when $x$ and $y$ range over all real numbers such that $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$ is 900.
The answer is: 900

"What is the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ when $x$ and $y$ range over all real numbers such that $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$?"

 To solve this problem, we can use the inequality $|a| + |b| \geq |a + b|$ which is true for all real numbers $a$ and $b$. Applying this inequality to the given equation $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$, we have:
\[|x-2y| + |y-2x| \geq |(x-2y) + (y-2x)| = |-x - y| = |-(x+y)| = |x+y|.\]
So, $|x+y| = 40$.
Now, let's express $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ in terms of $x+y$ and $x-2y$. We have:
\[5x^2+5y^2-8xy = 5(x^2+y^2) - 8xy = 5[(x+y)^2 - 2xy] - 8xy = 5(x+y)^2 - 18xy.\]
We know that $x+y = 40$, so we can substitute this into the equation:
\[5x^2+5y^2-8xy = 5(40)^2 - 18xy = 8000 - 18xy.\]
To minimize $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$, we need to maximize $xy$. From the equation $|x+y| = 40$, we have $x+y = \pm 40$. Without loss of generality, let's assume $x+y = 40$. Then, from the equation $x-2y + y-2x = 0$, we have $x-2y = -y+2x$. Solving this equation, we get $x = 2y$. Substituting $x = 2y$ into $x+y = 40$, we get $3y = 40$, so $y = \frac{40}{3}$ and $x = \frac{80}{3}$. Therefore, $xy = \frac{40}{3} \cdot \frac{80}{3} = \frac{3200}{9}$.
Substituting $xy = \frac{3200}{9}$ into $8000 - 18xy$, we get:
\[8000 - 18 \cdot \frac{3200}{9} = 8000 - 6400 = 1600.\]
Therefore, the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ is $1600$. The answer is: $1600$

To solve this problem, we can use the Cauchy-Schwarz inequality and the method of Lagrange multipliers.

First, we can rewrite the given equation $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$ as $|x-2y| + |2y-x| = 40$. Then by the triangle inequality, we have $|x-2y| + |2y-x| \geq |(x-2y) + (2y-x)| = |0| = 0$. Therefore, the only way for this equation to hold is when $|x-2y| = |2y-x| = 20$. This implies that $x-2y = \pm 20$ and $2y-x = \pm 20$. Solving these equations, we get $x = 10 \pm 10\sqrt{2}$ and $y = 5 \pm 5\sqrt{2}$.

Now, we substitute these values of $x$ and $y$ into the expression $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$. After simplification, we get $5(10 \pm 10\sqrt{2})^2 + 5(5 \pm 5\sqrt{2})^2 - 8(10 \pm 10\sqrt{2})(5 \pm 5\sqrt{2})$. Calculating this expression, we find that its minimum value is $-200$. Therefore, the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ is $-200$. The answer is: $\boxed{-200}$

 To solve this problem, we can use the inequality $|a| + |b| \geq |a + b|$ for all real numbers $a$ and $b$.
Applying this inequality to the given equation $|x - 2y| + |y - 2x| = 40$, we get:
\[|x - 2y| + |y - 2x| \geq |(x - 2y) + (y - 2x)| = |-x - y| = |-(x + y)| = |x + y|.\]
Therefore, $|x + y| = 40$.
Now, let's substitute $u = x + y$ and $v = x - y$ into the expression $5x^2 + 5y^2 - 8xy$.
We have $x = \frac{u+v}{2}$ and $y = \frac{u-v}{2}$, so
\begin{align*}
5x^2 + 5y^2 - 8xy &= 5\left(\frac{u+v}{2}\right)^2 + 5\left(\frac{u-v}{2}\right)^2 - 8\left(\frac{u+v}{2}\right)\left(\frac{u-v}{2}\right) \\
&= \frac{5}{4}(u^2 + 2uv + v^2) + \frac{5}{4}(u^2 - 2uv + v^2) - 2(u^2 - v^2) \\
&= \frac{5}{4}(2u^2 + 2v^2) - 2(u^2 - v^2) \\
&= \frac{5}{2}(u^2 + v^2) - 2(u^2 - v^2) \\
&= \frac{5}{2}u^2 + \frac{5}{2}v^2 - 2u^2 + 2v^2 \\
&= -\frac{1}{2}u^2 + \frac{9}{2}v^2.
\end{align*}
Since $|u| = |x + y| = 40$, we know that $u^2 = 1600$.
Therefore, the expression becomes $-\frac{1}{2}(1600) + \frac{9}{2}v^2 = -800 + \frac{9}{2}v^2$.
To minimize this expression, we need to minimize $\frac{9}{2}v^2$.
Since $v^2$ is always nonnegative, the minimum value of $\frac{9}{2}v^2$ is $0$.
Therefore, the minimum value of $5x^2 + 5y^2 - 8xy$ is $-800 + 0 = -800$.
However, this result doesn't make sense in the context of the problem, as the expression $5x^2 + 5y^2 - 8xy$ should be minimized while keeping the constraint $|x - 2y| + |y - 2x| = 40$.
The mistake in our solution is that we didn't consider the constraint.
Let's go back to the original problem and consider the constraint $|x - 2y| + |y - 2x| = 40$.
From $|x + y| = 40$, we have $u = x + y = 40$.
Now, let's substitute $x = \frac{u+v}{2}$ and $y = \frac{u-v}{2}$ into the constraint:
\[|(u+v)/2 - 2(u-v)/2| + |(u-v)/2 - 2(u+v)/2| = 40.\]
This simplifies to $|v| + |-3v| = 40$, which further simplifies to $4|v| = 40$.
So, $|v| = 10$, and $v^2 = 100$.
Now, substitute $v^2 = 100$ into $-\frac{1}{2}u^2 + \frac{9}{2}v^2$, we get $-\frac{1}{2}(1600) + \frac{9}{2}(100) = -800 + 450 = -350$.
Therefore, the minimum value of $5x^2 + 5y^2 - 8xy$ is $-350$ when $x$ and $y$ satisfy the constraint $|x - 2y| + |y - 2x| = 40$.
The answer is: $-350$.

 The given equation $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$ is a condition that must hold true for all real numbers $x$ and $y$. This equation simplifies to $|x-2y| + |2y-x| = 40$, which further simplifies to $|x-2y| = |2y-x| = 20$. This implies that $x-2y = 20$ or $x-2y = -20$, and $2y-x = 20$ or $2y-x = -20$. Solving these systems of equations, we find that the possible solutions are $(x, y) = (20, 0)$ or $(x, y) = (-20, 0)$ or $(x, y) = (0, 20)$ or $(x, y) = (0, -20)$.

Now we need to find the minimum value of the function $f(x, y) = 5x^2 + 5y^2 - 8xy$ subject to the constraint $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$. We can substitute the possible solutions into the function:

- For $(x, y) = (20, 0)$, $f(20, 0) = 5(20)^2 + 5(0)^2 - 8(20)(0) = 2000$.
- For $(x, y) = (-20, 0)$, $f(-20, 0) = 5(-20)^2 + 5(0)^2 - 8(-20)(0) = 2000$.
- For $(x, y) = (0, 20)$, $f(0, 20) = 5(0)^2 + 5(20)^2 - 8(0)(20) = 2000$.
- For $(x, y) = (0, -20)$, $f(0, -20) = 5(0)^2 + 5(-20)^2 - 8(0)(-20) = 2000$.

All the possible solutions give the same minimum value of 2000. Therefore, the minimum value of the function $5x^2 + 5y^2 - 8xy$ subject to the constraint $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$ is 2000. The answer is: $2000$

This problem involves solving a system of equations, which is beyond the scope of a simple Python function. However, we can use the inequality $|a| + |b| \geq |a + b|$ to simplify the given condition. We have:

$|x - 2y| + |y - 2x| = |x - 2y| + |2x - y| \geq |(x - 2y) + (2x - y)| = |3x - 3y| = 3|x - y|$.

So, we have $3|x - y| = 40$, which implies $|x - y| = \frac{40}{3}$.

Now, let's consider the expression $5x^2 + 5y^2 - 8xy$. We can rewrite it as:

$5x^2 + 5y^2 - 8xy = \frac{1}{2}((5x - 4y)^2 + (5y - 4x)^2)$.

By the Cauchy-Schwarz inequality, we have:

$(a^2 + b^2)(c^2 + d^2) \geq (ac + bd)^2$,

where $a = \sqrt{5}x$, $b = -\sqrt{5}y$, $c = -\sqrt{5}x$, and $d = \sqrt{5}y$. Then $ac + bd = -\sqrt{5}x(-\sqrt{5}x) + (-\sqrt{5}y)(\sqrt{5}y) = 5x^2 - 5y^2$. So we have:

$(5x^2 + 5y^2)((-\sqrt{5}x)^2 + (\sqrt{5}y)^2) \geq (5x^2 - 5y^2)^2$,

which simplifies to:

$10(x^2 + y^2) \geq (5x^2 - 5y^2)^2$.

Dividing both sides by 10, we get:

$x^2 + y^2 \geq \frac{1}{10}(5x^2 - 5y^2)^2$.

Now, we know that $|x - y| = \frac{40}{3}$, so $(x - y)^2 = \frac{1600}{9}$. Expanding, we get:

$x^2 - 2xy + y^2 = \frac{1600}{9}$,

which implies:

$x^2 + y^2 = 2xy + \frac{1600}{9}$.

Substituting this into the inequality we derived earlier, we get:

$2xy + \frac{1600}{9} \geq \frac{1}{10}(5x^2 - 5y^2)^2$.

This inequality holds for all $x$ and $y$ satisfying $|x - 2y| + |y - 2x| = 40$. To find the minimum value of $5x^2 + 5y^2 - 8xy$, we can minimize $2xy$ while keeping $x^2 + y^2$ as large as possible. By the Cauchy-Schwarz inequality, the maximum value of $2xy$ is achieved when $x = y$, and the maximum value of $x^2 + y^2$ is achieved when $x = -y$. So, we set $x = y$, and substitute into the equation $|x - 2y| + |y - 2x| = 40$:

$|x - 2x| + |x - 2x| = 40$,

which simplifies to:

$2|x| = 40$,

so $|x| = 20$. Therefore, the minimum value of $5x^2 + 5y^2 - 8xy$ is achieved when $x = y = 20$, and is equal to:

$5(20)^2 + 5(20)^2 - 8(20)(20) = 2000$.
The answer is: $2000$

 The problem seems to be a bit tricky to solve directly. However, by the Cauchy-Schwarz inequality, we have
\[(x^2 + y^2)^2 \geq (x^2 + y^2)(2xy)^2.\]
Rearranging terms, we get
\[(x^2 + y^2)^2 - 4(xy)^2 \geq 0.\]
This simplifies to
\[(x^2 + y^2)^2 - 4(xy)^2 \geq 0,\]
which is equivalent to
\[(x^2 + y^2 - 2xy)^2 \geq 0.\]
Taking the square root of both sides, we get
\[(x - y)^2 \geq 0.\]
This means that $x - y = 0$, or $x = y$.
Now, we substitute $x = y$ into the equation $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$, we get
\[|x-2x| + |x-2x| = 40,\]
which simplifies to
\[| -x | + | -x | = 40,\]
or
\[2|x| = 40.\]
Solving for $x$, we get
\[|x| = 20.\]
So $x = \pm 20$. Since $x = y$, we also have $y = \pm 20$.
Now, we substitute $x = y = 20$ into the expression $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$, we get
\[5(20)^2 + 5(20)^2 - 8(20)(20) = 2000.\]
Similarly, when $x = y = -20$, we get
\[5(-20)^2 + 5(-20)^2 - 8(-20)(-20) = 2000.\]
Therefore, the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ when $x$ and $y$ range over all real numbers such that $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$ is 2000.
The answer is: $2000$
