Below is a math problem you are to solve (positive numerical answer!):
"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"

 The given equation is a product of two terms equal to zero, so one of the terms must be zero for the entire equation to be zero. This gives us two cases to consider:

1. $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ and $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$
2. $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ and $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$

For the first case, we have $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. This implies that $x + y = \pm 10$ and $x - y = \pm 10$. Solving these equations gives us the vertices of the square: $(0, 10), (0, -10), (10, 0), (-10, 0)$.

For the second case, we have $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$. This implies that $x = \pm 8$ and $y = \pm 8$. Solving these equations gives us the vertices of the square: $(8, 0), (-8, 0), (0, 8), (0, -8)$.

The vertices of the convex polygon are the intersections of these two squares, which is a square with side length 10. The area of this square is $10^2 = 100$. Therefore, the area of the convex polygon is 100.

The answer is: $100$

Below is a math problem you are to solve (positive numerical answer!):
"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"

The given equation is a product of two expressions equal to zero. Therefore, one of the expressions must be zero for the product to be zero. This gives us two separate cases to consider:

Case 1: $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$
Case 2: $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$

In Case 1, both $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2$ and $( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2$ must be zero. This implies that $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. Solving these absolute value equations gives us the vertices of a square with side length 10.

In Case 2, both $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2$ and $( \vert y \vert - 8)^2$ must be zero. This implies that $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$. Solving these absolute value equations gives us the vertices of a square with side length 16.

The area of the convex polygon formed by the union of these two squares is the sum of their areas. The area of a square is given by side length squared, so the area of the first square is $10^2 = 100$ and the area of the second square is $16^2 = 256$. Therefore, the total area of the convex polygon is $100 + 256 = 356$. The answer is: $356$

Below is a math problem you are to solve (positive numerical answer!):
"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"

The given equation is equal to zero if and only if both of the factors are equal to zero. This means we have two sets of equations to solve:

1. $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ and $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$
2. $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ and $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$

From the first set of equations, we have $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. This means that $x + y = \pm 10$ and $x - y = \pm 10$. Solving these equations, we get the vertices of the first set of lines as $(5, 5)$, $(5, -5)$, $(-5, 5)$, and $(-5, -5)$.

From the second set of equations, we have $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$. This means that $x = \pm 8$ and $y = \pm 8$. Solving these equations, we get the vertices of the second set of lines as $(8, 0)$, $(-8, 0)$, $(0, 8)$, and $(0, -8)$.

The convex polygon formed by the intersection of these lines is a square with side length 10. The area of a square is given by the square of the length of its side, so the area of this square is $10^2 = 100$.

So, the area of the convex polygon is 100. The answer is: $100$

"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"

Assistant:

 The given equation is a product of two expressions, so it equals zero if either of the expressions equals zero.

Let's consider the two expressions separately:

1. $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2) = 0$
This expression equals zero if both $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ and $( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$.
This means $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$.
The solutions to these equations are all points $(x, y)$ such that the sum of their coordinates is 10 or -10, and the absolute difference of their coordinates is 10. These are the vertices of a square with side length 10 and centered at the origin.

2. $((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$
This expression equals zero if both $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ and $( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$.
This means $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$.
The solutions to these equations are all points $(x, y)$ such that their coordinates are 8 or -8. These are the vertices of a square with side length 16 and centered at the origin.

The convex polygon enclosed by the points satisfying the given equation is the intersection of the two squares described above. This intersection is a smaller square with side length 10 and centered at the origin.

The area of this square is side length squared, so the area is $10^2 = 100$.

So the area of the convex polygon is 100. The answer is: $100$

Assistant:

 The equation $AB = 0$ is equivalent to $A = 0$ or $B = 0$. Therefore, the given equation is equivalent to $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$, $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$, $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$, or $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$.
The solutions to these equations are $x + y = \pm 10$, $x - y = \pm 10$, $x = \pm 8$, or $y = \pm 8$. These lines form a square with side length 16. The area of this square is $16^2 = 256$. Therefore, the area of the convex polygon is 256. The answer is: $256$

"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"
Analyze this problem and think step by step to come to a solution with programs. After solving the problem, output the final numerical answer within \boxed{}.

Assistant:

 The given equation is a product of two terms equal to zero, so either the first term is zero or the second term is zero.
The first term is zero when $|x+y| - 10 = 0$ or $|x-y| - 10 = 0$, which means $|x+y| = 10$ or $|x-y| = 10$.
The second term is zero when $|x| - 8 = 0$ or $|y| - 8 = 0$, which means $|x| = 8$ or $|y| = 8$.
The solutions to these equations are four lines in the coordinate plane: $x+y = \pm 10$, $x-y = \pm 10$, $x = \pm 8$, and $y = \pm 8$.
These lines enclose a square with side length 16 (since the distance between the lines $x+y = 10$ and $x+y = -10$ is the square root of $(10 - (-10))^2 + (10 - (-10))^2 = 16\sqrt{2}$, which is the diagonal of the square).
The area of this square is $16^2 = 256$.
So the area of the convex polygon is 256.
The answer is: $256$

The expression $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2)$ is equal to zero if and only if either $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$.
This means that either $\vert x + y \vert = 10$, $\vert x - y \vert = 10$, $\vert x \vert = 8$, or $\vert y \vert = 8$.
The first two equations represent lines in the coordinate plane, and the last two equations represent circles centered at the origin with radius 8.
The intersection of these lines and circles forms a convex polygon, which is a square with side length 16.
The area of this square is $16^2 = 256$.
So the area of the convex polygon is 256.
The answer is: $256$

Below is a math problem you are to solve (positive numerical answer!):
"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"

 The given equation is equivalent to the product of two equations being equal to zero:
\[((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2) = 0\] or \[((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0.\]
The first equation implies that $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$, which means that the points $(x, y)$ lie on a square with side length 20. The second equation implies that $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$, which means that the points $(x, y)$ lie on a square with side length 16. Therefore, the points $(x, y)$ that satisfy the given equation are those that lie on the intersection of these two squares, which is a square with side length 8. The area of this square is $8^2 = 64$.
The answer is: $64$

The given equation is a product of two terms equal to zero, which means that either one of the terms is zero. So we have two cases:

1. $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$. This implies $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ or $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. The solutions to these absolute value equations are the lines $x + y = 10$, $x + y = -10$, $x - y = 10$, and $x - y = -10$.

2. $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$. This implies $\vert x \vert = 8$ or $\vert y \vert = 8$. The solutions to these absolute value equations are the lines $x = 8$, $x = -8$, $y = 8$, and $y = -8$.

The intersection points of these lines are the vertices of the polygon: $(8,8)$, $(8,-8)$, $(-8,8)$, and $(-8,-8)$. The polygon is a square with side length 16. The area of a square is the side length squared, so the area of the polygon is $16^2 = 256$.
The answer is: $256$
