Interesting, let's analyze step by step:



1. First, we observe that the product of two numbers is zero if and only if at least one of the numbers is zero. Thus, the given equation is equivalent to the system of equations:
   $$(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0,$$
   $$(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0,$$
   $$(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0,$$
   $$(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0.$$

2. From the second equation, we have $\vert x \vert = 8$, which implies $x = 8$ or $x = -8$. Similarly, from the fourth equation, we have $\vert y \vert = 8$, which implies $y = 8$ or $y = -8$.

3. Now, let's consider the first equation. If $\vert x + y \vert = 10$, then for $x = 8$ and $y = 8$, we have $\vert 8 + 8 \vert = 16 \neq 10$. Similarly, for $x = 8$ and $y = -8$, we have $\vert 8 - 8 \vert = 0 \neq 10$. For $x = -8$ and $y = 8$, we have $\vert -8 + 8 \vert = 0 \neq 10$. And for $x = -8$ and $y = -8$, we have $\vert -8 - 8 \vert = 16 \neq 10$. Hence, the first equation doesn't have solutions that satisfy the conditions for $x$ and $y$.

4. Similarly, for the third equation, $\vert x - y \vert = 10$, it doesn't have solutions that satisfy the conditions for $x$ and $y$.

5. Therefore, the only possible solutions for the system of equations are when $(x, y) = (8, 8)$, $(8, -8)$, $(-8, 8)$, or $(-8, -8)$. These points form a square with side length 16.

6. The area of the square is given by the square of the side length, which is $16^2 = 256$. Therefore, the area of the convex polygon is 256 square units.

The steps to solve this problem are:
1. Break down the problem into smaller parts.
2. Identify the sympy functions required for each step.
3. Implement these functions step-by-step, commenting each line for clarity.
4. Calculate the final answer and verify it's a positive integer.

```python

    eq4 = Abs(y) - 8

    # Solve the system of equations

    side_length = max([abs(x - y) for x, y in solutions])

```
The code above is incorrect because it's trying to find the maximum absolute difference between the x and y values of all possible solutions. However, the problem is not asking for the maximum distance between points, but rather to form a square with vertices at these points, and the side length of this square is the maximum distance between any two points. The condition for a square to be formed is that for a given $x$, $y$ pair, both $|x+y| = 10$ and $|x-y| = 10$ must be satisfied. Unfortunately, this is not the case for the solutions obtained from the system of equations above.

Let's revise our approach. 

We know that the points $(x, y)$ that satisfy the equation are either $(8, 8)$, $(8, -8)$, $(-8, 8)$, or $(-8, -8)$. 

The side length of the square is the distance between any two points on the square. For example, the distance between $(8, 8)$ and $(8, -8)$ is $16$. Similarly, the distance between $(8, 8)$ and $(-8, 8)$ is also $16$. Therefore, the side length of the square is $16$.

The area of a square is the square of its side length. So, the area of the square is $16^2 = 256$.

Therefore, the area of the convex polygon is 256 square units.

So, the answer is $\boxed{256}$.

Below is a math problem you are to solve (positive numerical answer):
"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"

Interesting, let's analyze step by step:



The equation given is $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$. For the product of two numbers to be zero, either one of them must be zero. This gives us two conditions:

1) $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$
2) $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$

From condition 1, both $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2$ and $( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2$ must be zero. This can only happen if $|x + y| = 10$ and $|x - y| = 10$. These equations describe the vertices of a square with side length 10.

From condition 2, both $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2$ and $( \vert y \vert - 8)^2$ must be zero. This can only happen if $|x| = 8$ and $|y| = 8$. These equations describe a square with side length 16.

So, the points satisfying the original equation form the union of two squares: one with side length 10 and another with side length 16. The area of the convex polygon formed by the union of these two squares is the sum of their areas.

The area of a square is given by side length squared. Therefore, the area of the square with side length 10 is $10^2 = 100$, and the area of the square with side length 16 is $16^2 = 256$. Adding these areas together gives the total area of the convex polygon as $100 + 256 = 356$.

The positive integer area of the convex polygon is $\boxed{356}$.
The answer is: $356$

Assistant:

Interesting, let's analyze step by step:


The product of two numbers is 0 if and only if at least one of the numbers is 0. Therefore, the equation is satisfied if and only if at least one of the following two conditions is met:
1. $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2) = 0$
2. $((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$
For the first condition to be met, we need both $\vert x + y \vert - 10 = 0$ and $\vert x - y \vert - 10 = 0$, which implies $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. These equations describe a square with side length 10.
For the second condition to be met, we need both $\vert x \vert - 8 = 0$ and $\vert y \vert - 8 = 0$, which implies $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$. These equations describe a square with side length 16.
Therefore, the points satisfying the original equation are those that lie in the intersection of these two squares, which is a square with side length 10.
The area of this square is $10^2 = 100$.
Therefore, the area of the convex polygon is 100.
Since the problem asks for a positive integer answer, the value of the area is 100.
The answer is: $100$

Interesting, let's analyze step by step:



The function $f(x, y) = ((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2)$ is zero if and only if either $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$.

So, the zeros of the function are given by:

1. $|x + y| = 10$, which forms a square with side length 20.
2. $|x - y| = 10$, which also forms a square with side length 20.
3. $|x| = 8$, which forms a pair of vertical lines at $x = 8$ and $x = -8$.
4. $|y| = 8$, which forms a pair of horizontal lines at $y = 8$ and $y = -8$.

The intersection of these lines and squares forms a cross, which is a convex polygon. The area of this polygon is the sum of the areas of the two squares, which each have area $20 \times 20 = 400$. So, the area of the cross is $400 + 400 = 800$.

The positive integer value of the area of the convex polygon is 800. The answer is: $800$.

Interesting, let's analyze step by step:



We're asked to find the area of a polygon formed by points that satisfy the given equation. If the product of two numbers is zero, it means that at least one of the numbers is zero. Therefore, we can break down the problem into two cases:

1. $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$.
2. $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$.

In the first case, we have $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ or $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. This forms a square with side length $10\sqrt{2}$, and its area is $100*2 = 200$.

In the second case, we have $\vert x \vert = 8$ or $\vert y \vert = 8$. This forms a square with side length $16$, and its area is $256$.

The total area of the convex polygon is the sum of the areas of the two squares, which is $200 + 256 = 456$. 

Therefore, the area of the convex polygon is $456$.
The answer is: $456$

Assistant:

Interesting, let's analyze step by step:



The condition given in the problem, $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$, is satisfied if any of the two factors is equal to zero.

This translates to:
- Either $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$, or
- Either $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$.

Each of these equations implies that $\vert x + y \vert = 10$, $\vert x - y \vert = 10$, $\vert x \vert = 8$, or $\vert y \vert = 8$.

The solutions to these equations are:
- For $\vert x + y \vert = 10$, we get the lines $x + y = 10$ and $x + y = -10$.
- For $\vert x - y \vert = 10$, we get the lines $x - y = 10$ and $x - y = -10$.
- For $\vert x \vert = 8$, we get the lines $x = 8$ and $x = -8$.
- For $\vert y \vert = 8$, we get the lines $y = 8$ and $y = -8$.

These lines form a square with side length 10. The area of this square is $10^2 = 100$. 

The area of the square is $\boxed{100}$.

Note: In mathematics, if the condition A * B = 0 is given, it implies that A = 0 or B = 0. So if we have $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$, we can conclude that either $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$, $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$, $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$. This is how we arrive at the four pairs of lines. The intersection of these lines forms the vertices of the square.

Assistant:

Interesting, let's analyze step by step:



Step 1: List the variables and known values from the problem.
The problem involves expressions with absolute value and squares. Absolute values can be represented as:
\[|x| = \begin{cases}
x, & \text{if } x \geq 0 \\
-x, & \text{if } x < 0
\end{cases}\]

Squares are always non-negative. So in the given problem, for the product of two expressions to be zero, either one of the expressions has to be zero. So we have:
\[((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2) = 0 \text{ or } ((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0.\]

Step 2: Outline the steps using sympy to solve the problem.
We can use sympy to solve the system of equations. The steps are:

1. For each equation, identify the values of $x$ and $y$ that make the equation zero.
2. Plot the points $(x, y)$ on the coordinate plane to form a polygon.
3. Calculate the area of the polygon.

Step 3: Implement these functions step-by-step, commenting each line for clarity.
After plotting the points on the coordinate plane, we can see that the polygon formed is a square with side length 16 units. So the area of the square is $16^2 = 256$ square units.

Step 4: Calculate the final answer and verify it's a positive integer.
The area of the polygon is 256, which is a positive integer.

Step 5: Output the result.
The area of the polygon is $\boxed{256}$ square units.

However, please note that the original problem requires solving a system of equations with absolute value and square functions. The approach outlined above is based on simplifying the problem and solving it step by step using sympy. The actual solution of this problem might be more complex and might not be solvable using sympy directly. It is important to note that the problem might be designed to test the understanding of absolute value and square functions rather than the actual capabilities of sympy. In such cases, the problem might not be solvable using sympy as it is designed to handle symbolic computations, but instead, it might be solved using algebraic methods or geometric interpretations.

Interesting, let's analyze step by step:



The product of two numbers is zero if and only if at least one of them is zero. This means the condition 
$$((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$$
can happen in two ways: either 
$$((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2) = 0$$ 
or 
$$((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0.$$ 

From the first case, we have 
$$\vert x + y \vert = 10 \text{ and } \vert x - y \vert = 10.$$
These two conditions are satisfied by all points $(x, y)$ lying on the line $x = y$ and the line $x = -y$. These are two lines passing through the origin and making an angle of $90^\circ$ with each other.

From the second case, we have 
$$\vert x \vert = 8 \text{ and } \vert y \vert = 8.$$
These conditions are satisfied by all points $(x, y)$ lying on the square with vertices at $(8,8)$, $(8,-8)$, $(-8,8)$, and $(-8,-8)$.

So, the points that satisfy the given condition are the vertices of the square and the points on the lines $x = y$ and $x = -y$ that lie within the square. These points enclose a convex polygon.

The area of the square is $8^2 = 64$. The lines $x = y$ and $x = -y$ that lie within the square form a square of side length $10$ (the diagonal of the square of side length $8$) and thus area $50$. However, this square is only half of the lines satisfying the first case (since it lies within the square of side length 8), so the total area of the region defined by the first case is $50$ square units.

Therefore, the area of the convex polygon is the area of the square minus the area of the square defined by the first case, which is $64 - 50 = 14$. The area of the convex polygon is $14$ square units. The answer is: $14$

Interesting, let's analyze step by step:



The equation is defined in such a way that the product of the two terms should be equal to zero. In other words, either the first term should be zero or the second term should be zero. This is because the product of two numbers is zero only if at least one of the numbers is zero.

First, let's examine the first term: 
$$((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + (\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2) = 0.$$

This term is zero if and only if $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$.
This implies that $x + y = \pm 10$ and $x - y = \pm 10$.

These four equations are the equations of the lines forming the vertices of the square. 

Second, let's examine the second term:
$$((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + (\vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0.$$

This term is zero if and only if $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$. 
This implies that $x = \pm 8$ and $y = \pm 8$.

These four equations are the equations of the lines forming the sides of the square.

So, the points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying the given condition form a square with vertices at $(\pm 10, 0)$ and $(0, \pm 10)$, and sides of length 16 (from $(-8, 0)$ to $(8, 0)$ or from $(0, -10)$ to $(0, 10)$).

To find the area of this square, we simply multiply the length of one side by itself.
