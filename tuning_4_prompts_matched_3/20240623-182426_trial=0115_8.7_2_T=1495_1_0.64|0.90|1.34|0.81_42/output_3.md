Interesting, let's analyze step by step:



The given equation is $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + (\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + (\vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$.

This equation equals zero if either of the two terms equals zero. So, we have two cases to consider:

1. $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + (\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$
2. $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + (\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$

From case 1, we have $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. This means that the points $(x, y)$ lie on a square with side length 10 and diagonals of length $10\sqrt{2}$.

From case 2, we have $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$. This means that the points $(x, y)$ lie on a square with side length 8 and diagonals of length $8\sqrt{2}$.

The intersection of these two squares is the convex polygon we are looking for. The side length of this polygon is the smaller side length, which is 8. The area of a square is given by the square of the side length, so the area of the convex polygon is $8^2 = 64$.

Therefore, the area of the convex polygon is 64 square units. The answer is: $64$

Interesting, let's analyze step by step:



1. The given equation is a product of two terms equals to zero. This means that either the first term equals to zero or the second term equals to zero.

2. Let's denote the two terms as $A = ((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)$ and $B = ((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2)$. The equation is then $AB = 0$. This implies that either $A = 0$ or $B = 0$.

3. If $A = 0$, then we have $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$. This implies that $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. The only possible solutions for this are $(x, y) = (10, 0)$ or $(x, y) = (0, 10)$ or $(x, y) = (-10, 0)$ or $(x, y) = (0, -10)$. These points form a square with side length 20.

4. If $B = 0$, then we have $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$. This implies that $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$. The only possible solutions for this are $(x, y) = (8, 8)$ or $(x, y) = (8, -8)$ or $(x, y) = (-8, 8)$ or $(x, y) = (-8, -8)$. These points form a square with side length 16.

5. Combining the two cases, we have a total of 4 squares. The larger square has side length 20 and area $20^2 = 400$, and the smaller square has side length 16 and area $16^2 = 256$.

6. The total area of the convex polygon is the sum of the areas of the two squares, which is $400 + 256 = 656$.

So, the area of the convex polygon is 656. However, this is not a positive integer. It seems that we made a mistake in our calculation. Let's retrace our steps:

1. The given equation is a product of two terms equals to zero. This means that either the first term equals to zero or the second term equals to zero.

2. Let's denote the two terms as $A = ((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)$ and $B = ((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2)$. The equation is then $AB = 0$. This implies that either $A = 0$ or $B = 0$.

3. If $A = 0$, then we have $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$. This implies that $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. The only possible solutions for this are $(x, y) = (10, 0)$ or $(x, y) = (0, 10)$ or $(x, y) = (-10, 0)$ or $(x, y) = (0, -10)$. These points form a square with side length 20 and area $20^2 = 400$.

4. If $B = 0$, then we have $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$. This implies that $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$. The only possible solutions for this are $(x, y) = (8, 8)$ or $(x, y) = (8, -8)$ or $(x, y) = (-8, 8)$ or $(x, y) = (-8, -8)$. These points form a square with side length 16 and area $16^2 = 256$.

5. Combining the two cases, we have a total of 4 squares. The larger square has side length 20 and area $20^2 = 400$, and the smaller square has side length 16 and area $16^2 = 256$.

6. The total area of the convex polygon is the sum of the areas of the two squares, which is $400 + 256 = 656$.

3. If $A = 0$, then we have $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$. This implies that $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. The only possible solutions for this are $(x, y) = (10, 0)$ or $(x, y) = (0, 10)$ or $(x, y) = (-10, 0)$ or $(x, y) = (0, -10)$. These points form a square with side length 20 and area $20^2 = 400$.

Interesting, let's analyze step by step:



1. The expression $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ implies $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$, which means $x + y = \pm 10$ and $x - y = \pm 10$. Solving these equations gives $x = y = 5$ or $x = -y = 5$. Similarly, the expression $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ implies $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$, which means $x = \pm 8$ and $y = \pm 8$.

2. The solutions from the two equations are the vertices of the polygon. The polygon is a square with side length 10 (the maximum of $x+y$ and $x-y$ when $x,y$ are 8), so its area is $10^2 = 100$.

3. Therefore, the area of the convex polygon is 100.

The answer is: $100$

Assistant:

Interesting, let's analyze step by step:



The expression is equal to zero if and only if both terms are zero:
$$((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2) = 0$$
and
$$((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0.$$

From the first equation, we have $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$.
This implies that $x + y = \pm 10$ and $x - y = \pm 10$.
Solving these equations, we get $x = \pm 10$ and $y = 0$, or $x = 0$ and $y = \pm 10$.

From the second equation, we have $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$.
This implies that $x = \pm 8$ and $y = \pm 8$.

Combining the solutions from both equations, we get the vertices of the polygon:
$$(8, 8), (8, -8), (-8, 8), (-8, -8), (10, 0), (-10, 0), (0, 10), (0, -10).$$

The polygon is a square with side length 16.
The area of a square is side length squared, so the area of the polygon is $16^2 = 256$.
The answer is: $256$

Interesting, let's analyze step by step:



The given equation is a product of two terms equal to zero. Hence, either the first term is zero or the second term is zero.

The first term is $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)$. This term equals to zero if and only if both $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. This implies that $x$ and $y$ are both $5$ or both $-5$.

The second term is $((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2)$. This term equals to zero if and only if both $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$. This implies that $x$ is in the interval $[-8, 8]$ and $y$ is in the interval $[-8, 8]$.

Combining these two conditions, we find that the points $(x, y)$ that satisfy the equation are exactly the points of the square with vertices at $(5, 5)$, $(-5, 5)$, $(-5, -5)$, and $(5, -5)$.

The side length of this square is $10$, so its area is $10^2 = 100$.

Therefore, the area of the convex polygon is $100$. The answer is: $100$

The expression $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ implies that $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. This means $x + y = \pm 10$ and $x - y = \pm 10$. Solving these equations, we get the four lines $y = -x \pm 10$ and $y = x \pm 10$.

The intersection of these lines forms a square with side length 16. The area of this square is $16^2 = 256$. So the area of the convex polygon is 256.

Interesting, let's analyze step by step:



The equation given is $ ((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$.

This equation equals zero if either of the two factors equals zero.

So we have two cases:

1) $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$. This equation can only be true if $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. This implies that $x + y = \pm 10$ and $x - y = \pm 10$. Solving these equations gives us the vertices of the polygon: $(5,5), (5,-5), (-5,5), (-5,-5)$.

2) $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$. This equation can only be true if $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$. This implies that $x = \pm 8$ and $y = \pm 8$. Solving these equations gives us the vertices of the polygon: $(8,0), (0,8), (-8,0), (0,-8)$.

Now we can plot these points on a graph and connect them to form a square with side length 10. The area of this square is $10^2 = 100$.

So the area of the convex polygon is 100. The answer is: $100$

Assistant:

Interesting, let's analyze step by step:



The expression $A \cdot B = 0$ is equivalent to $A = 0$ or $B = 0$. Thus the given equation is satisfied if either of the following two conditions hold:

1. $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$.
2. $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$.

For the first condition to hold, we must have $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. This implies that the points $(x, y)$ must lie on the lines $x + y = 10$ and $x - y = 10$ or their opposites $x + y = -10$ and $x - y = -10$. These lines form a square with side length $10\sqrt{2}$.

For the second condition to hold, we must have $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$. This implies that the points $(x, y)$ must lie on the lines $x = 8$ and $y = 8$ or their opposites $x = -8$ and $y = -8$. These lines form a square with side length $16$.

The intersection of the two squares is a smaller square with side length $10\sqrt{2} - 2 \cdot 8 = 10\sqrt{2} - 16$. The area of this square is $(10\sqrt{2} - 16)^2$.

However, we are asked to find the area of the convex polygon formed by the union of the two squares. This is simply the sum of the areas of the two squares minus the area of their intersection:

\[Area = (10\sqrt{2})^2 + (16)^2 - (10\sqrt{2} - 16)^2 = 200 + 256 - (200 - 32\sqrt{2} + 256) = 456 - 456 + 32\sqrt{2} = 32\sqrt{2}.\]

However, this is not a positive integer. Let's check our calculations.

Upon reexamination, we realize that the side length of the smaller square is $10\sqrt{2} - 16$, but the side length of the larger square is $10\sqrt{2}$, not $10\sqrt{2} - 16$.

Correcting this, the side length of the smaller square is $10\sqrt{2} - 16$, but the side length of the larger square is $16$, not $10\sqrt{2}$.

Correcting this again, the side length of the smaller square is $10\sqrt{2} - 16$, but the side length of the larger square is $10\sqrt{2}$, not $16$.

Finally, we have the correct calculations. The side length of the smaller square is $10\sqrt{2} - 16$, and the side length of the larger square is $10\sqrt{2}$. The area of the smaller square is $(10\sqrt{2} - 16)^2$, and the area of the larger square is $(10\sqrt{2})^2 = 200$. The area of the convex polygon is the sum of the areas of the two squares minus the area of their intersection:

\[Area = 200 + (10\sqrt{2} - 16)^2 - (10\sqrt{2} - 16)^2 = 200.\]

Thus the area of the convex polygon is 200. The answer is: $200$

Interesting, let's analyze step by step:



The equation is defined as follows:
$$((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$$

This equation is equal to zero if either of the two terms is zero. This gives us two systems of equations to solve:

1. $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ and $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$
2. $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ and $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$

From the first system, we get $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x \vert = 8$, $\vert y \vert = 8$. This means $-8 \leq x, y \leq 8$.

From the second system, we get $\vert x - y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x \vert = 8$, $\vert y \vert = 8$. This means $-8 \leq x, y \leq 8$.

So the points that satisfy the equation are all the points in the square with vertices at $(-8, -8), (-8, 8), (8, -8), (8, 8)$. The side length of this square is $16$, so the area is $16^2 = 256$.

Therefore, the area of the convex polygon is $256$.
The answer is: $256$

Interesting, let's analyze step by step:



The equation is a product of two terms equal to zero, so either the first term is zero or the second term is zero. This gives us two systems of equations to solve:

1. $\vert x + y \vert - 10 = 0$ and $\vert x - y \vert - 10 = 0$
2. $\vert x \vert - 8 = 0$ and $\vert y \vert - 8 = 0$

For the first system, we have $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. This implies that $x + y = \pm 10$ and $x - y = \pm 10$. Solving these equations, we get the vertices of the polygon as $(0, 10), (0, -10), (10, 0), (-10, 0)$.

For the second system, we have $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$. This implies that $x = \pm 8$ and $y = \pm 8$. Solving these equations, we get the vertices of the polygon as $(8, 8), (8, -8), (-8, 8), (-8, -8)$.

Now, we can plot these points on a coordinate plane and observe that the polygon is a square with side length 16. The area of a square is given by the square of the length of its side, so the area of the polygon is $16^2 = 256$.

The answer is: $256$
