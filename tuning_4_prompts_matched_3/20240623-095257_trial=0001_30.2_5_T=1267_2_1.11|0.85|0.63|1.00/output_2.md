Question (hint: positive numerical answer):
"For how many positive integers $m$ does the equation \[\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}\] have $4$ distinct solutions?"
Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:


The equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has $4$ distinct solutions.
For the absolute value equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=k$, where $k$ is a positive constant, there are $4$ distinct solutions when $k=\frac{1}{2}$.
So, we have $\frac{m}{100} = \frac{1}{2}$, which implies $m=50$.
Therefore, the only positive integer $m$ for which the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has $4$ distinct solutions is $m=50$. The answer is: $1$

"For how many positive integers $m$ does the equation \[\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}\] have $4$ distinct solutions?"
Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:


The equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has $4$ distinct solutions means that the right side $\frac{m}{100}$ must be equal to $2$.
So we have $\frac{m}{100}=2$, which gives $m=200$.
Therefore, there is only one positive integer $m$ that makes the equation have $4$ distinct solutions, and that is $m=200$. The answer is: $1$

Question (hint: positive numerical answer):
"For how many positive integers $m$ does the equation \[\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}\] have $4$ distinct solutions?"
Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:



The equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has four distinct solutions if and only if $\frac{m}{100}$ is between $1$ and $2$, exclusive. This is because the expression on the left-hand side of the equation, $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert$, can take on any value from $0$ to $3$, inclusive, and it has exactly four distinct solutions when it is equal to a value between $1$ and $2$. 

To find the values of $m$ that satisfy this condition, we multiply both sides of the inequality $1<\frac{m}{100}<2$ by $100$ to obtain $100<m<200$. 

The positive integers $m$ that satisfy this inequality are precisely the integers from $101$ to $199$, inclusive. To find the number of these integers, we subtract the smallest integer in this range from the largest, and then add $1$: $199 - 101 + 1 = 99$. 

Therefore, there are $99$ positive integers $m$ for which the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has four distinct solutions. The answer is: $99$

Question (hint: positive numerical answer):
"For how many positive integers $m$ does the equation \[\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}\] have $4$ distinct solutions?"
Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:


The equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has $4$ distinct solutions.
We know that $\frac{m}{100}$ must be positive, so $m$ must be positive.
The equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ can be rewritten as two separate equations:
$\vert x-1 \vert -2 =\frac{m}{100}$ or $\vert x-1 \vert -2 =-\frac{m}{100}$.
For the first equation, $\vert x-1 \vert =2+\frac{m}{100}$.
This gives us two separate equations: $x-1 =2+\frac{m}{100}$ or $x-1 =-2-\frac{m}{100}$.
Simplifying these gives $x =3+\frac{m}{100}$ or $x =-1-\frac{m}{100}$.
For the second equation, $\vert x-1 \vert =2-\frac{m}{100}$.
This gives us two separate equations: $x-1 =2-\frac{m}{100}$ or $x-1 =-2+\frac{m}{100}$.
Simplifying these gives $x =3-\frac{m}{100}$ or $x =-1+\frac{m}{100}$.
To have $4$ distinct solutions, the values of $2+\frac{m}{100}$ and $2-\frac{m}{100}$ must be positive and different.
This means $0<2-\frac{m}{100}<2+\frac{m}{100}$.
Simplifying this gives $0<2-\frac{m}{100}$ and $2-\frac{m}{100}<2+\frac{m}{100}$.
The first inequality gives $0<2-\frac{m}{100}$, which simplifies to $\frac{m}{100}<2$, or $m<200$.
The second inequality gives $2-\frac{m}{100}<2+\frac{m}{100}$, which simplifies to $0<\frac{2m}{100}$, or $0<m$.
Combining these inequalities, we have $0<m<200$.
Therefore, the possible values of $m$ are the positive integers from $1$ to $199$.
The number of these integers is $199$.
So the value of $m$ for which the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has $4$ distinct solutions is $199$.
The answer is: $199$

Question (hint: positive numerical answer):
"For how many positive integers $m$ does the equation \[\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}\] have $4$ distinct solutions?"
Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:


The equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has 4 distinct solutions.
The number of solutions of an equation of the form $\vert \vert f(x) \vert -k \vert=c$ is determined by the number of times the graph of $y=k$ intersects the graph of $y=\vert f(x) \vert$.
In this case, $f(x)=\vert x-1 \vert -2$, and we want the number of values of $m$ such that the graph of $y=\frac{m}{100}$ intersects the graph of $y=\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert$ exactly 4 times.
The graph of $y=\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert$ consists of two V-shaped pieces, one with the vertex at $(1,2)$ and the other with the vertex at $(1,-2)$.
The graph of $y=\frac{m}{100}$ is a horizontal line.
We want to find the number of values of $m$ such that the line $y=\frac{m}{100}$ intersects the graph of $y=\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert$ exactly 4 times.
This occurs when $\frac{m}{100}$ is between $0$ and $2$ (exclusive), or when $\frac{m}{100}$ is between $-2$ and $0$ (exclusive).
In the first case, we have $0 < \frac{m}{100} < 2$, which gives $0 < m < 200$.
In the second case, we have $-2 < \frac{m}{100} < 0$, which gives $-200 < m < 0$.
Therefore, the positive integers $m$ that satisfy the equation are the integers in the set $\{1, 2, ..., 199\}$.
The number of these integers is 199. The answer is: $199$

Question (hint: positive numerical answer):
"For how many positive integers $m$ does the equation \[\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}\] have $4$ distinct solutions?"
Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:


The equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has $4$ distinct solutions means that the expression inside the absolute value, $\vert x-1 \vert -2$, changes its sign twice when $x$ increases from $-\infty$ to $+\infty$. This happens when $\vert x-1 \vert -2 = 0$, or $\vert x-1 \vert = 2$. The solutions to this equation are $x = 1 \pm 2$, or $x = -1$ and $x = 3$. So the expression $\vert x-1 \vert -2$ changes its sign at $x=-1$, $x=1$, and $x=3$. This means that the value of $\frac{m}{100}$ must be between $0$ and $1$ (exclusive), $1$ and $2$ (exclusive), and $2$ and $3$ (exclusive) for the equation to have $4$ distinct solutions. 

This gives us $\frac{m}{100} \in (0,1)$, $(1,2)$, and $(2,3)$. In other words, $0 < \frac{m}{100} < 1$, $1 < \frac{m}{100} < 2$, and $2 < \frac{m}{100} < 3$.

For the first and third intervals, we have $0 < \frac{m}{100} < 1$ and $2 < \frac{m}{100} < 3$. This gives us $0 < m < 100$ and $200 < m < 300$. However, these intervals overlap, so the possible values of $m$ are in the range $200 < m < 300$.

For the second interval, we have $1 < \frac{m}{100} < 2$. This gives us $100 < m < 200$.

Therefore, the possible values of $m$ are in the range $100 < m < 300$. The positive integers in this range are the integers from $101$ to $299$, inclusive. To find the number of these integers, we subtract the smallest integer from the largest and add $1$. This gives us $299 - 101 + 1 = 198$.

However, we have double-counted the integer $200$, so we need to subtract $1$ from our result. Therefore, the number of positive integers $m$ for which the equation has $4$ distinct solutions is $198 - 1 = 197$.
The answer is: $197$

Question (hint: positive numerical answer):
"For how many positive integers $m$ does the equation \[\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}\] have $4$ distinct solutions?"
Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:


The equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has 4 distinct solutions.

The inner absolute value $\vert x-1 \vert -2$ can take on the values $-\frac{m}{100}$, $0$, and $\frac{m}{100}$.

1. If $\vert x-1 \vert -2 = -\frac{m}{100}$, then $\vert x-1 \vert = 2 - \frac{m}{100}$. This gives us two equations:

   a) $x - 1 = 2 - \frac{m}{100}$, which simplifies to $x = 3 - \frac{m}{100}$.
   
   b) $-(x - 1) = 2 - \frac{m}{100}$, which simplifies to $x = -1 + \frac{m}{100}$.

2. If $\vert x-1 \vert -2 = 0$, then $\vert x-1 \vert = 2$. This gives us two equations:

   a) $x - 1 = 2$, which simplifies to $x = 3$.
   
   b) $-(x - 1) = 2$, which simplifies to $x = -1$.

3. If $\vert x-1 \vert -2 = \frac{m}{100}$, then $\vert x-1 \vert = 2 + \frac{m}{100}$. This gives us two equations:

   a) $x - 1 = 2 + \frac{m}{100}$, which simplifies to $x = 3 + \frac{m}{100}$.
   
   b) $-(x - 1) = 2 + \frac{m}{100}$, which simplifies to $x = -1 - \frac{m}{100}$.

We want the four solutions to be distinct, so the four equations above should give distinct values of $x$. This means that the expressions $-1 - \frac{m}{100}$, $-1 + \frac{m}{100}$, $3 - \frac{m}{100}$, and $3 + \frac{m}{100}$ should all be different.

This implies that $-1 - \frac{m}{100} < -1 + \frac{m}{100} < 3 - \frac{m}{100} < 3 + \frac{m}{100}$.

Simplifying the inequalities gives:

$$-1 - \frac{m}{100} < -1 + \frac{m}{100} \implies -2m < 0 \implies m > 0.$$
$$-1 + \frac{m}{100} < 3 - \frac{m}{100} \implies -4 < \frac{2m}{100} \implies -200 < 2m \implies m > 100.$$
$$3 - \frac{m}{100} < 3 + \frac{m}{100} \implies -2\frac{m}{100} < 0 \implies m > 0.$$

Combining the inequalities, we find that $m > 100$. Since $m$ is a positive integer, the possible values of $m$ are 101, 102, 103, ..., and so on.

However, we are also given that the number of distinct solutions is 4. Looking at the four equations above, we can see that the expression $\frac{m}{100}$ should be less than 1 for the four solutions to be distinct. This means that $m < 100$.

Combining the two conditions $m > 100$ and $m < 100$, we find that there are no possible values of $m$ that satisfy both conditions simultaneously. However, we have missed a case. When we are dealing with absolute values, we must also consider the negative of the expressions inside the absolute values. So let's go back and reconsider the case when $\vert x-1 \vert -2 = -\frac{m}{100}$.

When we take the negative of the expression inside the absolute value, we get $\vert x-1 \vert -2 = \frac{m}{100}$. This gives us the equations:

a) $x - 1 = 2 + \frac{m}{100}$, which simplifies to $x = 3 + \frac{m}{100}$.
b) $-(x - 1) = 2 + \frac{m}{100}$, which simplifies to $x = -1 - \frac{m}{100}$.

Now, we want these two equations to give distinct values of $x$ from the other two equations. This means that $-1 - \frac{m}{100} < 3 - \frac{m}{100} < 3 + \frac{m}{100}$.

Simplifying the inequalities gives:

$$-1 - \frac{m}{100} < 3 - \frac{m}{100} \implies -4 < 0.$$
$$3 - \frac{m}{100} < 3 + \frac{m}{100} \implies -2\frac{m}{100} < 0 \implies m > 0.$$

The first inequality is always true, and the second inequality implies that $m > 0$. So, this set of equations gives distinct solutions if $m > 0$.

Now, let's combine all the conditions on $m$:

1. $m > 100$: This comes from the condition that the four solutions given by $\vert x-1 \vert -2 = -\frac{m}{100}$ should be distinct.
2. $m < 100$: This comes from the condition that the number of distinct solutions should be 4.
3. $m > 0$: This comes from the fact that $m$ is a positive integer.

Combining all these conditions, we find that there is no value of $m$ that satisfies all three conditions simultaneously. However, we have missed a case. When we are dealing with absolute values, we must also consider the negative of the expressions inside the absolute values. So let's go back and reconsider the case when $\vert x-1 \vert -2 = 0$.

When we take the negative of the expression inside the absolute value, we get $\vert x-1 \vert -2 = 0$. This gives us the equations:

a) $x - 1 = 2$, which simplifies to $x = 3$.
b) $-(x - 1) = 2$, which simplifies to $x = -1$.

Now, we want these two equations to give distinct values of $x$ from the other two equations. This means that $-1 < 3 - \frac{m}{100} < 3 + \frac{m}{100}$.

Simplifying the inequalities gives

Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:


The equation $||x-1|-2|=\frac{m}{100}$ has 4 distinct solutions if and only if $\frac{m}{100}=2$.
So we set $\frac{m}{100}=2$ and solve for $m$:
\[m = 2 \cdot 100 = 200.\]
Therefore, the value of $m$ is 200. The answer is: $1$
