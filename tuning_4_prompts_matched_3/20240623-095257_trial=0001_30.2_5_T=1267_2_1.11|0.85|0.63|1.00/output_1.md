Question (hint: positive numerical answer):
"What is the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ when $x$ and $y$ range over all real numbers such that $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$?"
Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:


First, let's rewrite the equation $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$ using the property $|a-b| = |b-a|$. We get:
$$|x-2y| + |2y-x| = 40.$$
Since $|a| = |-a|$ for all $a$, we can further simplify this to:
$$|x-2y| + |- (x-2y)| = 40.$$
This simplifies to:
$$|x-2y| + |x-2y| = 40,$$
or
$$2|x-2y| = 40.$$
Dividing both sides by 2 gives:
$$|x-2y| = 20.$$
Now, let's consider the expression $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$. We can rewrite this as:
$$5(x^2+y^2) - 8xy = 5[(x-2y)^2 + 4xy] - 8xy.$$
We know that $|x-2y| = 20$, so $(x-2y)^2 = 400$. We can substitute this into the equation to get:
$$5[400 + 4xy] - 8xy = 2000 + 20xy - 8xy = 2000 + 12xy.$$
To minimize this expression, we need to minimize $12xy$. Since $|x-2y| = 20$, we know that $x$ and $y$ cannot both be 0. So, let's consider the case where $x = 2y$. Then, $|x-2y| = |2y-2y| = 0$, which does not satisfy the given equation. However, if we let $x = 2y + k$, where $k$ is a constant, we get:
$$|x-2y| = |2y+k-2y| = |k| = 20.$$
So, $k = \pm 20$. Without loss of generality, let's take $k = 20$. Then, $x = 2y + 20$. Substituting this into the equation $12xy$ gives:
$$12xy = 12(2y+20)y = 24y^2 + 240y.$$
To minimize this expression, we can take the derivative with respect to $y$ and set it equal to zero:
$$\frac{d}{dy}(24y^2 + 240y) = 48y + 240 = 0.$$
Solving for $y$, we get:
$$y = -\frac{240}{48} = -5.$$
Substituting this back into $x = 2y + 20$, we get:
$$x = 2(-5) + 20 = 10.$$
So, the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ occurs when $x = 10$ and $y = -5$. Substituting these values into the expression gives:
$$5(10)^2 + 5(-5)^2 - 8(10)(-5) = 500 + 125 + 400 = 1025.$$
Therefore, the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ is 1025. The answer is: 1025

Question (hint: positive numerical answer):
"What is the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ when $x$ and $y$ range over all real numbers such that $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$?"
Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:


Let $A = x - 2y$ and $B = y - 2x$. We are given that $|A| + |B| = 40$.
By the triangle inequality, we have $|A + B| \leq |A| + |B|$, so $|x - 2y + y - 2x| \leq 40$, which simplifies to $|3(y - x)| \leq 40$.
This implies that $-40 \leq 3(y - x) \leq 40$, or $-40/3 \leq y - x \leq 40/3$.
Now, let's substitute $y - x = t$ into the given expression $5x^2 + 5y^2 - 8xy$. We get
\[5(x^2 + y^2 - 2xy) = 5((x - y)^2) = 5t^2.\]
So we want to minimize $5t^2$ under the condition $-40/3 \leq t \leq 40/3$. The minimum value of $5t^2$ occurs when $t = 0$, which corresponds to $x = y$.
When $x = y$, the given equation $|x - 2x| + |x - 2x| = 40$ simplifies to $0 = 40$, which is clearly not true. However, we can still find a solution.
Notice that the equation $|x - 2y| + |y - 2x| = 40$ is symmetric in $x$ and $y$. So if $(x, y)$ is a solution, then $(y, x)$ is also a solution.
If we let $x = y$, the equation becomes $|0| + |0| = 40$, which is false. But if we let $x = -y$, the equation becomes $|2x| + |-2x| = 40$, which simplifies to $4|x| = 40$, or $|x| = 10$. So $x = \pm 10$ and $y = \mp 10$ are solutions.
Now, let's substitute $x = 10$ and $y = -10$ into the expression $5x^2 + 5y^2 - 8xy$. We get
\[5(10^2) + 5(-10^2) - 8(10)(-10) = 500 - 500 + 800 = 800.\]
Similarly, if we substitute $x = -10$ and $y = 10$, we also get the same result of 800.
So the minimum value of $5x^2 + 5y^2 - 8xy$ is 800 when $x$ and $y$ range over all real numbers such that $|x - 2y| + |y - 2x| = 40$. The answer is: $800$.

Question (hint: positive numerical answer):
"What is the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ when $x$ and $y$ range over all real numbers such that $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$?"
Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:


First, we note that the equation $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$ is equivalent to $|x-2y| = 40 - |y-2x|$.
Expanding the absolute values, we get two cases:
Case 1: If $x - 2y \ge 0$ and $y - 2x \ge 0$, then $x - 2y = 40 - (y - 2x)$, which simplifies to $3x - 3y = 40$ or $x - y = \frac{40}{3}$.
Case 2: If $x - 2y < 0$ and $y - 2x < 0$, then $-(x - 2y) = 40 - -(y - 2x)$, which also simplifies to $x - y = \frac{40}{3}$.
So, in both cases, we have $x - y = \frac{40}{3}$.
Now, let's substitute $y = x - \frac{40}{3}$ into the expression $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$:
\begin{align*}
5x^2+5y^2-8xy &= 5x^2 + 5\left(x - \frac{40}{3}\right)^2 - 8x\left(x - \frac{40}{3}\right) \\
&= 5x^2 + 5\left(x^2 - \frac{80x}{3} + \frac{1600}{9}\right) - 8x^2 + \frac{320x}{3} \\
&= -3x^2 + \frac{320x}{3} + \frac{800}{9}.
\end{align*}
Now, let $f(x) = -3x^2 + \frac{320x}{3} + \frac{800}{9}$.
To find the minimum value of $f(x)$, we take the derivative and set it equal to zero:
\begin{align*}
f'(x) &= -6x + \frac{320}{3} = 0 \\
\Rightarrow -6x &= -\frac{320}{3} \\
\Rightarrow x &= \frac{160}{9}.
\end{align*}
Substituting $x = \frac{160}{9}$ into $y = x - \frac{40}{3}$, we get $y = \frac{40}{9}$.
Finally, substituting $x = \frac{160}{9}$ and $y = \frac{40}{9}$ into $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$, we get
\begin{align*}
5\left(\frac{160}{9}\right)^2 + 5\left(\frac{40}{9}\right)^2 - 8\left(\frac{160}{9}\right)\left(\frac{40}{9}\right) &= \frac{12800}{9} + \frac{800}{9} - \frac{51200}{81} \\
&= \frac{12800 + 7200 - 51200}{81} \\
&= -\frac{25600}{81}.
\end{align*}
So, the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ under the given condition is $-\frac{25600}{81}$. The answer is: $-\frac{25600}{81}$

Question (hint: positive numerical answer):
"What is the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ when $x$ and $y$ range over all real numbers such that $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$?"
Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:



We first note that the equation $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$ is always true, because $|x-2y| = |-(2x-y)| = |y-2x|$. So this equation doesn't restrict the values of $x$ and $y$ at all.

Now let's look at the expression $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$. We can rewrite it as $5(x^2+y^2) - 8xy = 5[(x-y)^2 + 2xy] - 8xy = 5(x-y)^2 + 3xy$.

To minimize this expression, we want to minimize $3xy$ while keeping $(x-y)^2$ as small as possible. The smallest possible value of $(x-y)^2$ is 0, which occurs when $x=y$.

If $x=y$, then the expression $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ simplifies to $10x^2 - 8x^2 = 2x^2$. This is minimized when $x=0$, giving a minimum value of 0.

However, if we substitute $x=y$ into the equation $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$, we get $|x-2x| + |x-2x| = 40$, which simplifies to $0=40$, a contradiction. So the condition $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$ does not hold when $x=y$.

The condition $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$ is actually equivalent to the equation $x-2y = \pm (y-2x)$, which simplifies to $3x = 3y$ or $x=-y$. The first case gives $x=y$, which we've already ruled out. The second case gives $x=-y$, which does satisfy the condition.

If $x=-y$, then the expression $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ simplifies to $5(x^2+x^2) - 8(-x^2) = 13x^2$. This is minimized when $x=0$, giving a minimum value of 0 again.

However, if we substitute $x=-y$ into the equation $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$, we get $|x+2x| + |-x-2x| = 40$, which simplifies to $5|x|^2 = 40$, and then $|x|^2 = 8$. So $x=\pm\sqrt{8} = \pm 2\sqrt{2}$.

Now let's substitute $x=2\sqrt{2}$ into the expression $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$, which gives $5(8) - 8(2\sqrt{2})^2 = 40 - 32 = 8$.

So the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ under the condition $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$ is 8.
The answer is: $8$

Question (hint: positive numerical answer):
"What is the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ when $x$ and $y$ range over all real numbers such that $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$?"
Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:


To find the minimum value of the expression $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ subject to the constraint $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$,
we can first use the constraint to eliminate one of the variables.
By the triangle inequality, we have
\[|x-2y| + |y-2x| = |(x-2y) - (y-2x)| = |x-2y - y+2x| = |3x-3y| = 3|x-y| = 40.\]
Dividing both sides by 3 gives $|x-y| = \frac{40}{3}$.
Now, let $u = x-y$ and $v = x+y$. Then we have $x = \frac{u+v}{2}$ and $y = \frac{v-u}{2}$.
Substituting these into the expression $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$, we get
\begin{align*}
5\left(\frac{u+v}{2}\right)^2 + 5\left(\frac{v-u}{2}\right)^2 - 8\left(\frac{u+v}{2}\right)\left(\frac{v-u}{2}\right) &= \frac{5}{4}(u^2+v^2) - 2uv \\
&= \frac{5}{4}(u^2+2uv+v^2) - 4uv \\
&= \frac{5}{4}((u+v)^2) - \frac{11}{4}(uv).
\end{align*}
Now, we know that $|u| = \frac{40}{3}$, so $u^2 = \left(\frac{40}{3}\right)^2 = \frac{1600}{9}$.
Also, from the equation $|x-y| = \frac{40}{3}$, we have $u^2 + v^2 = \left(\frac{40}{3}\right)^2 + \left(\frac{40}{3}\right)^2 = \frac{3200}{9}$.
So, we can substitute these values into the expression to get
\[\frac{5}{4}\cdot \frac{3200}{9} - \frac{11}{4} \cdot uv.\]
To minimize this expression, we need to maximize $uv$. By AM-GM, we have
\[uv \le \left(\frac{u^2+v^2}{2}\right) = \frac{1600}{9},\]
with equality when $u=v=\frac{40}{3}$.
So, the maximum value of $uv$ is $\frac{1600}{9}$, and substituting this into the expression gives
\[\frac{5}{4}\cdot \frac{3200}{9} - \frac{11}{4} \cdot \frac{1600}{9} = \frac{4000}{9}.\]
Therefore, the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ is $\boxed{-\frac{4000}{9}}$. The answer is: $-\frac{4000}{9}$

Question (hint: positive numerical answer):
"What is the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ when $x$ and $y$ range over all real numbers such that $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$?"
Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:


First, let's consider the constraint $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$. We can rewrite this as $|2y-x| + |2x-y| = 40$. Now, let's examine the cases when the expressions inside the absolute values are positive and negative.

Case 1: $2y - x > 0$ and $2x - y > 0$. This gives us $2y - x + 2x - y = 40$, which simplifies to $y = 40$. Substituting this into the constraint equation gives $x = 80$. So, one solution is $(x, y) = (80, 40)$.

Case 2: $2y - x > 0$ and $2x - y < 0$. This gives us $2y - x - (2x - y) = 40$, which simplifies to $y = 10$. Substituting this into the constraint equation gives $x = 20$. So, another solution is $(x, y) = (20, 10)$.

Case 3: $2y - x < 0$ and $2x - y > 0$. This gives us -(2y - x) + 2x - y = 40, which simplifies to $y = -10$. Substituting this into the constraint equation gives $x = -20$. So, another solution is $(x, y) = (-20, -10)$.

Case 4: $2y - x < 0$ and $2x - y < 0$. This gives us -(2y - x) - (2x - y) = 40, which simplifies to $y = -40$. Substituting this into the constraint equation gives $x = -80$. So, another solution is $(x, y) = (-80, -40)$.

Now, we substitute each of these solutions into the expression $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ to find its minimum value:

For $(x, y) = (80, 40)$, we get $5(80^2) + 5(40^2) - 8(80)(40) = 32000$.
For $(x, y) = (20, 10)$, we get $5(20^2) + 5(10^2) - 8(20)(10) = 1000$.
For $(x, y) = (-20, -10)$, we get $5(-20^2) + 5(-10^2) - 8(-20)(-10) = 1000$.
For $(x, y) = (-80, -40)$, we get $5(-80^2) + 5(-40^2) - 8(-80)(-40) = 32000$.

The minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ is $1000$. The answer is: $1000$

Question (hint: positive numerical answer):
"What is the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ when $x$ and $y$ range over all real numbers such that $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$?"
Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:


Let $A = x - 2y$ and $B = y - 2x$. Then we have $|A| + |B| = 40$.
We know that $|A| + |B| = |A + B| + |A - B|$. So we have $|A + B| + |A - B| = 40$.
We can rewrite $A + B$ and $A - B$ as follows:
$A + B = x - 2y + y - 2x = -x - y$,
$A - B = x - 2y - (y - 2x) = x - 2y - y + 2x = 3x - 3y$.
So we have $| -x - y| + |3x - 3y| = 40$.
We can simplify this to $|x + y| + |3x - 3y| = 40$.
We know that $|a + b| + |a - b| = 2|a| + 2|b|$ for all real numbers $a$ and $b$.
So we have $2|x + y| + 2|3x - 3y| = 40$.
Simplifying further, we get $2|x + y| + 6|x - y| = 40$.
Dividing both sides by 2, we have $|x + y| + 3|x - y| = 20$.
We know that $|x + y| + 3|x - y| \geq |x + y + 3(x - y)| = |4x - 2y| = 2|2x - y|$.
So we have $2|2x - y| \leq 20$.
Dividing both sides by 2, we have $|2x - y| \leq 10$.
This means that $-10 \leq 2x - y \leq 10$.
We can rewrite this as $-10 + y \leq 2x \leq 10 + y$.
Dividing all sides by 2, we have $-\frac{10}{2} + \frac{y}{2} \leq x \leq \frac{10}{2} + \frac{y}{2}$.
Simplifying, we get $-5 + \frac{y}{2} \leq x \leq 5 + \frac{y}{2}$.
This means that $x$ is bounded between $-5 + \frac{y}{2}$ and $5 + \frac{y}{2}$.
Now we can substitute this into the expression $5x^2 + 5y^2 - 8xy$:
\begin{align*}
5x^2 + 5y^2 - 8xy &= 5\left(-5 + \frac{y}{2}\right)^2 + 5y^2 - 8\left(-5 + \frac{y}{2}\right)y \\
&= 5\left(25 - 5y + \frac{y^2}{4}\right) + 5y^2 + 40y - 4y^2 \\
&= 125 - 25y + \frac{5y^2}{4} + 5y^2 + 40y - 4y^2 \\
&= 125 + \frac{5y^2}{4} + 15y.
\end{align*}
To find the minimum value of this expression, we can take the derivative with respect to $y$ and set it equal to 0:
\begin{align*}
\frac{d}{dy}\left(125 + \frac{5y^2}{4} + 15y\right) &= 0 + \frac{5y}{2} + 15 = 0 \\
\frac{5y}{2} &= -15 \\
5y &= -30 \\
y &= -6.
\end{align*}
Substituting this value of $y$ back into the inequality $-5 + \frac{y}{2} \leq x \leq 5 + \frac{y}{2}$, we get $-5 - 3 \leq x \leq 5 - 3$, or $-8 \leq x \leq 2$.
So the minimum value of $5x^2 + 5y^2 - 8xy$ occurs when $x = -4$ and $y = -6$.
Substituting these values back into the expression, we get
\begin{align*}
5x^2 + 5y^2 - 8xy &= 5(-4)^2 + 5(-6)^2 - 8(-4)(-6) \\
&= 5(16) + 5(36) - 8(24) \\
&= 80 + 180 - 192 \\
&= 168 - 192 \\
&= -24.
\end{align*}
Therefore, the minimum value of $5x^2 + 5y^2 - 8xy$ is $-24$.
The answer is: $-24$

Question (hint: positive numerical answer):
"What is the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ when $x$ and $y$ range over all real numbers such that $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$?"
Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:



We first note that the equation $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$ is equivalent to $|x-2y| = |2x-y|$, which simplifies to $x-2y = \pm(2x-y)$.

If $x-2y = 2x-y$, then $y = x$. If $x-2y = -(2x-y)$, then $x = 2y$.

Thus, the pairs $(x, y)$ that satisfy the equation are of the form $(x, x)$ or $(2y, y)$ for some real numbers $x$ and $y$.

Now we substitute these forms into the expression $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$.

If $(x, y) = (x, x)$, then $5x^2+5y^2-8xy = 5x^2+5x^2-8x^2 = 2x^2$.
If $(x, y) = (2y, y)$, then $5x^2+5y^2-8xy = 5(2y)^2+5y^2-8(2y)(y) = 20y^2+5y^2-16y^2 = 9y^2$.

Therefore, the expression $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ is equal to either $2x^2$ or $9y^2$.

Since $x$ and $y$ can be any real numbers, both $2x^2$ and $9y^2$ can be any nonnegative real numbers.

Thus, the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ is 0, which is achieved when $(x, y) = (0, 0)$.
However, this solution does not satisfy the equation $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$.

So we need to consider the cases where $(x, y) = (x, x)$ or $(2y, y)$.

For the case $(x, y) = (x, x)$, we have $5x^2+5y^2-8xy = 2x^2$.

For the case $(x, y) = (2y, y)$, we have $5x^2+5y^2-8xy = 9y^2$.

We want to find the minimum value of these two expressions.

Since $x$ and $y$ can be any real numbers, we can consider the minimum value of $2x^2$ and $9y^2$.

The minimum value of $2x^2$ is achieved when $x = 0$, and the minimum value is 0.
The minimum value of $9y^2$ is achieved when $y = 0$, and the minimum value is 0.

However, both cases $(x, y) = (x, x)$ and $(x, y) = (2y, y)$ do not satisfy the equation $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$.

So we need to find the minimum value of $2x^2$ and $9y^2$ subject to the condition $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$.

We can check that when $x = 2y$, we have $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 0 + 4y = 40$, which gives $y = 10$.
Substituting $y = 10$ into $x = 2y$, we get $x = 20$.

Now we substitute $x = 20$ and $y = 10$ into $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$, we get $5(20)^2+5(10)^2-8(20)(10) = 2000+500-1600 = 1900$.

So the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ when $x$ and $y$ range over all real numbers such that $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$ is 1900.
The answer is: $1900$.

Question (hint: positive numerical answer):
"What is the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ when $x$ and $y$ range over all real numbers such that $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$?"
Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:


First, we notice that the given equation $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$ can be rewritten as $|2y-x| + |2x-y| = 40$.
Then, we recognize that $|a-b| + |b-a| = 2|a-b|$ for all real numbers $a$ and $b$. So, we can simplify the equation to $2|2y-x| = 40$, which simplifies further to $|2y-x| = 20$.
This equation represents a circle centered at $(1,2)$ with a radius of 20.
Now, let's consider the expression $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$. We can rewrite it as $\frac{5}{2}[(x^2 - \frac{8}{5}xy + y^2) + (y^2 - \frac{8}{5}xy + x^2)] = \frac{5}{2}[(x-\frac{4}{5}y)^2 + (y-\frac{4}{5}x)^2]$.
The minimum value of this expression will occur when $(x-\frac{4}{5}y)^2 + (y-\frac{4}{5}x)^2 = 0$, which means $x = \frac{4}{5}y$ and $y = \frac{4}{5}x$. Substituting these values into the equation of the circle, we get $|\frac{4}{5}y-y| = 20$, which simplifies to $|\frac{-y}{5}| = 20$, and further simplifies to $y = \pm 100$.
Substituting $y = 100$ into the equation $x = \frac{4}{5}y$, we get $x = 80$. Similarly, substituting $y = -100$, we get $x = -80$.
Now, substituting $x = 80$ and $y = 100$ into the expression $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$, we get $5(80)^2 + 5(100)^2 - 8(80)(100) = 32000$.
Substituting $x = -80$ and $y = -100$ into the expression, we get the same result of 32000.
Therefore, the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ when $x$ and $y$ range over all real numbers such that $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$ is 32000. The answer is: $32000$

Question (hint: positive numerical answer):
"What is the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ when $x$ and $y$ range over all real numbers such that $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$?"
Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:


We are given the equation $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$.
We can rewrite this equation as $|x-2y| + |2y-x| = 40$.
Using the property $|a| = |-a|$, we can further simplify this equation to $|x-2y| - |2y-x| = 40$.
By the property $|a| - |b| = |a - b|$, we can rewrite this equation as $|(x-2y) - (2y-x)| = 40$.
Simplifying the expression inside the absolute value, we get $|2x - 4y| = 40$.
Again, using the property $|a| = |-a|$, we can rewrite this equation as $|-2(2y - x)| = 40$.
So, we have $|2(2y - x)| = 40$.
This means that $2(2y - x) = 40$ or $2(2y - x) = -40$.
Simplifying these equations, we get $4y - 2x = 40$ or $4y - 2x = -40$.
Rearranging these equations, we get $2x - 4y = -40$ or $2x - 4y = 40$.
Now, we can rewrite the original equation $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$ as one of these two equations:
\[2x - 4y = -40 \quad \text{or} \quad 2x - 4y = 40.\]
We can solve for $y$ in terms of $x$ in each equation:
For the first equation $2x - 4y = -40$, we have $y = \frac{2x + 40}{4} = \frac{x}{2} + 10$.
For the second equation $2x - 4y = 40$, we have $y = \frac{2x - 40}{4} = \frac{x}{2} - 10$.
Now, we substitute these expressions for $y$ into the expression $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$:
For $y = \frac{x}{2} + 10$, we have
\[5x^2 + 5\left(\frac{x}{2} + 10\right)^2 - 8x\left(\frac{x}{2} + 10\right) = 5x^2 + 5\left(\frac{x^2}{4} + 10x + 100\right) - 4x^2 - 80x = \frac{x^2}{4} - 4x^2 + 50x + 500 = -\frac{15x^2}{4} + 50x + 500.\]
For $y = \frac{x}{2} - 10$, we have
\[5x^2 + 5\left(\frac{x}{2} - 10\right)^2 - 8x\left(\frac{x}{2} - 10\right) = 5x^2 + 5\left(\frac{x^2}{4} - 10x + 100\right) - 4x^2 + 80x = \frac{x^2}{4} - 4x^2 + 50x + 500 = -\frac{15x^2}{4} + 50x + 500.\]
In both cases, the expression is of the form $-\frac{15x^2}{4} + 50x + 500$.
To find the minimum value of this expression, we can find the derivative with respect to $x$ and set it equal to zero:
\[-\frac{15x}{2} + 50 = 0 \implies x = \frac{100}{15} = \frac{20}{3}.\]
Substituting this value of $x$ back into the expression, we get
\[-\frac{15\left(\frac{20}{3}\right)^2}{4} + 50\left(\frac{20}{3}\right) + 500 = -\frac{15 \cdot 400}{36} + \frac{1000}{3} + 500 = -\frac{6000}{36} + \frac{3000}{3} + 1500 = -\frac{1500}{9} + \frac{3000}{3} + 1500 = \frac{-1500 + 9000 + 13500}{9} = \frac{21000}{9} = \frac{7000}{3}.\]
Therefore, the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ is $\frac{7000}{3}$.
The answer is: $\boxed{\frac{7000}{3}}$

Question (hint: positive numerical answer):
"What is the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ when $x$ and $y$ range over all real numbers such that $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$?"
Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:


First, we notice that the expression $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ can be rewritten as $(x-2y)^2 + (y-2x)^2$. This is because $(x-2y)^2 + (y-2x)^2 = x^2 - 4xy + 4y^2 + y^2 - 4xy + 4x^2 = 5x^2 + 5y^2 - 8xy$.
Now, we are given that $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$. By the triangle inequality, we know that $|x-2y| + |y-2x| \geq |(x-2y) - (y-2x)| = |x-2y-y+2x| = |3x-3y| = 3|x-y|$. So we have $3|x-y| = 40$, which implies $|x-y| = \frac{40}{3}$.
Now, we know that $(x-2y)^2 + (y-2x)^2 \geq 0$, because it is a sum of squares. So the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ is 0, which occurs when $x = 2y$ and $y = 2x$. Solving this system of equations, we get $x = \frac{40}{9}$ and $y = \frac{80}{9}$.
Substituting these values back into the expression $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$, we get $5\left(\frac{40}{9}\right)^2 + 5\left(\frac{80}{9}\right)^2 - 8\left(\frac{40}{9}\right)\left(\frac{80}{9}\right) = 0$.
Therefore, the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ is 0. The answer is: $0$

Question (hint: positive numerical answer):
"What is the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ when $x$ and $y$ range over all real numbers such that $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$?"
Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:



First, we need to find the relation between $x$ and $y$ from the given condition $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$.
We can split the absolute value into cases:

Case 1: $x-2y \ge 0$ and $y-2x \ge 0$.
In this case, we have $x-2y + y-2x = 40$, which simplifies to $-x-y = 40$, or $x+y=-40$.

Case 2: $x-2y \ge 0$ and $y-2x < 0$.
In this case, we have $x-2y - (y-2x) = 40$, which simplifies to $x-3y = 40$.

Case 3: $x-2y < 0$ and $y-2x \ge 0$.
In this case, we have -(x-2y) + y-2x = 40, which simplifies to $-3x+y = 40$.

Case 4: $x-2y < 0$ and $y-2x < 0$.
In this case, we have -(x-2y) - (y-2x) = 40, which simplifies to $-x-y = 40$, which is the same as Case 1.

So, we only need to consider cases 2 and 3.

Case 2: $x-3y = 40$, or $x = 3y + 40$.

Case 3: $-3x+y = 40$, or $y = 3x - 40$.

Now, substitute these into the expression we want to minimize: $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$.

Case 2: $5(3y+40)^2 + 5y^2 - 8(3y+40)y$
$= 5(9y^2 + 240y + 1600) + 5y^2 - 24y^2 - 320y$
$= 45y^2 + 1200y + 8000 + 5y^2 - 24y^2 - 320y$
$= 26y^2 + 880y + 8000$.

Case 3: $5x^2 + 5(3x-40)^2 - 8x(3x-40)$
$= 5x^2 + 5(9x^2 - 240x + 1600) - 24x^2 + 320x$
$= 5x^2 + 45x^2 - 1200x + 8000 - 24x^2 + 320x$
$= 26x^2 - 880x + 8000$.

Comparing the two cases, we can see that case 3 is the same as case 2 after substituting $x = 3y + 40$.

So, we only need to consider one case, which is $26y^2 + 880y + 8000$.

To find the minimum value, we can take the derivative with respect to $y$ and set it equal to zero: $52y + 880 = 0$.
Solving for $y$, we get $y = -\frac{880}{52} = -16.923$.

However, this value of $y$ doesn't satisfy the original condition $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$.

Therefore, we made a mistake in our calculations. Let's go back and check our work.

We found that the minimum occurs at $y = -\frac{880}{52} = -16.923$, which is clearly not possible since $y$ is a real number. So, we must have made a mistake somewhere.

Let's try another approach. The expression we want to minimize is $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$.

We can rewrite this as $5(x^2 - \frac{8}{5}xy + y^2) = 5[(x - \frac{4}{5}y)^2 + \frac{11}{25}y^2]$.

This is clearly always nonnegative, since $(x - \frac{4}{5}y)^2 \ge 0$ and $\frac{11}{25}y^2 \ge 0$.

Therefore, the minimum value is 0, which occurs when $x = \frac{4}{5}y$.

Now, we substitute this into the original condition $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$:
$|(\frac{4}{5}y)-2y| + |y-2(\frac{4}{5}y)| = 40$
$|- \frac{6}{5}y| + |-\frac{6}{5}y| = 40$
$\frac{6}{5}|y| + \frac{6}{5}|y| = 40$
$\frac{12}{5}|y| = 40$
$|y| = \frac{200}{12} = \frac{50}{3}$.

Since $|y|$ cannot be a fraction, we must have made a mistake in our calculations.

Let's go back and check our work.

We found that the minimum occurs when $x = \frac{4}{5}y$, which is clearly not possible since $x$ and $y$ are integers. So, we must have made a mistake somewhere.

Let's try another approach. The expression we want to minimize is $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$.

We can rewrite this as $5(x^2 - \frac{8}{5}xy + y^2) = 5[(x - \frac{4}{5}y)^2 + \frac{11}{25}y^2]$.

This is clearly always nonnegative, since $(x - \frac{4}{5}y)^2 \ge 0$ and $\frac{11}{25}y^2 \ge 0$.

Therefore, the minimum value is 0, which occurs when $x = \frac{4}{5}y$.

Now, we substitute this into the original condition $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$:
$|(\frac{4}{5}y)-2y| + |y-2(\frac{4}{5}y)| = 40$
$|- \frac{6}{5}y| + |-\frac{6}{5}y| = 40$
$\frac{6}{5}|y| + \frac{6}{5}|y

Question (hint: positive numerical answer):
"What is the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ when $x$ and $y$ range over all real numbers such that $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$?"
Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:


First, let's rewrite the expression $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ as $\frac{1}{2}((5x^2-8xy+8y^2)+(5y^2-8xy+8x^2)) = \frac{1}{2}((x-2y)^2 + (2x-y)^2)$.

Now, let's consider the constraint $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$. Using the triangle inequality, we have $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = |x-2y| + |2y-x| \geq |(x-2y) + (2y-x)| = 0$.
Since the sum of two non-negative numbers is equal to 40, both numbers must be equal to 20. This gives us the system of equations:
\begin{align*}
x - 2y &= 20, \\
2x - y &= 20.
\end{align*}

Solving this system, we get $x = 12$ and $y = -4$.

Substituting these values into the expression, we have $\frac{1}{2}((x-2y)^2 + (2x-y)^2) = \frac{1}{2}((12-2(-4))^2 + (2(12)-(-4))^2) = \frac{1}{2}(100^2 + 28^2) = \frac{1}{2}(10000 + 784) = \frac{1}{2}(10784) = 5392$.

Therefore, the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ under the given constraint is 5392. The answer is: $5392$.

Question (hint: positive numerical answer):
"What is the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ when $x$ and $y$ range over all real numbers such that $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$?"
Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:


First, let's rewrite the given equation $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$ as $|2y-x| + |2x-y| = 40$.

Now, let's consider the expression $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$. We can rewrite it as $(5x^2 - 8xy + 5y^2)$, which is a perfect square trinomial: $(3x - 4y)^2$.

The minimum value of a square of a real number is 0, which occurs when the real number is 0. Therefore, $(3x - 4y)^2$ achieves its minimum value of 0 when $3x - 4y = 0$.

Now we need to solve the equation $|2y-x| + |2x-y| = 40$. We can split this into two cases:

Case 1: $2y-x > 0$ and $2x-y > 0$. In this case, the equation becomes $2y - x + 2x - y = 40$, which simplifies to $y = 40$. But this contradicts the condition $3x - 4y = 0$.

Case 2: $2y-x < 0$ and $2x-y < 0$. In this case, the equation becomes $-(2y - x) - (2x - y) = 40$, which simplifies to $3x - 4y = 40$.

Now we have the system of equations:
\[
\begin{cases}
3x - 4y = 0, \\
3x - 4y = 40.
\end{cases}
\]

From this system, we can see that there is no solution for $x$ and $y$ that satisfies both equations simultaneously. This means that we made a mistake in our case analysis. Let's reconsider the equation $|2y-x| + |2x-y| = 40$.

The absolute value function $|f(x)|$ is equal to $f(x)$ when $f(x) \geq 0$, and $-f(x)$ when $f(x) < 0$. So the equation $|2y-x| + |2x-y| = 40$ can be split into four cases:

Case 1: $2y-x \geq 0$ and $2x-y \geq 0$. In this case, the equation becomes $2y - x + 2x - y = 40$, which simplifies to $y = 40$. But this contradicts the condition $3x - 4y = 0$.

Case 2: $2y-x \geq 0$ and $2x-y < 0$. In this case, the equation becomes $2y - x - (2x - y) = 40$, which simplifies to $y = 10$ and $x = 20$. This solution satisfies the condition $3x - 4y = 0$.

Case 3: $2y-x < 0$ and $2x-y \geq 0$. In this case, the equation becomes -(2y - x) + 2x - y = 40, which simplifies to $y = -10$ and $x = -20$. This solution satisfies the condition $3x - 4y = 0$.

Case 4: $2y-x < 0$ and $2x-y < 0$. In this case, the equation becomes -(2y - x) - (2x - y) = 40, which simplifies to $3x - 4y = 40$. But this contradicts the condition $3x - 4y = 0$.

So the only valid solutions are $(x, y) = (20, 10)$ and $(x, y) = (-20, -10)$. We substitute these values into $(3x - 4y)^2$ to find the minimum value. For $(x, y) = (20, 10)$, $(3x - 4y)^2 = (3*20 - 4*10)^2 = (60 - 40)^2 = 20^2 = 400$. For $(x, y) = (-20, -10)$, $(3x - 4y)^2 = (3*(-20) - 4*(-10))^2 = (-60 + 40)^2 = (-20)^2 = 400$.

Therefore, the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ is 0 when $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$. The answer is: $\boxed{0}$.
