Question (hint: positive numerical answer):
"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"
Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:



The given equation is of the form $AB = 0$, which means that either $A=0$ or $B=0$. 

So, we have two cases to consider:

1. $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$.
2. $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$.

For the first case, $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$, this can only happen when $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. This means that the points $(x, y)$ must lie on the lines $x + y = 10$ and $x - y = 10$. These two lines intersect at the point $(5, 5)$.

For the second case, $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$, this can only happen when $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$. This means that the points $(x, y)$ must lie on the lines $x = 8$ and $y = 8$. These two lines intersect at the point $(8, 8)$.

So, the points $(x, y)$ that satisfy the original equation are the points that lie on the lines $x + y = 10$, $x - y = 10$, $x = 8$, and $y = 8$. These lines enclose a rectangle with vertices at $(5, 5)$, $(8, 8)$, $(8, 5)$, and $(5, 8)$.

The area of this rectangle is the product of its length and width. The length is the distance between the points $(8, 8)$ and $(5, 5)$, which is $\sqrt{(8 - 5)^2 + (8 - 5)^2} = \sqrt{9 + 9} = \sqrt{18} = 3\sqrt{2}$. The width is the distance between the points $(8, 8)$ and $(8, 5)$, which is $\sqrt{(8 - 8)^2 + (8 - 5)^2} = \sqrt{0 + 9} = \sqrt{9} = 3$. So, the area of the rectangle is $3\sqrt{2} \times 3 = 9\sqrt{2}$.
The answer is: $9\sqrt{2}$

Question (hint: positive numerical answer):
"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"
Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:



The given equation is a product of two terms equal to zero. This means that either the first term is zero or the second term is zero. 

The first term is: $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)$. This term is zero if both $(\vert x + y \vert - 10) = 0$ and $(\vert x - y \vert - 10) = 0$. Solving these two equations gives $x + y = 10$ and $x - y = 10$ or $x + y = 10$ and $x - y = -10$. The first pair of equations gives $x = 5$ and $y = 5$, and the second pair gives $x = 0$ and $y = 10$ or $x = 10$ and $y = 0$. So these are the vertices of the polygon: $(5, 5)$, $(0, 10)$, and $(10, 0)$.

The second term is: $((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2)$. This term is zero if both $(\vert x \vert - 8) = 0$ and $(\vert y \vert - 8) = 0$. Solving these two equations gives $x = 8$ and $y = 8$. So this is the center of the polygon.

Now, let's draw the polygon on the coordinate plane. The vertices $(5, 5)$, $(0, 10)$, and $(10, 0)$ form a right triangle. The center $(8, 8)$ is the midpoint of the line segment connecting the points $(0, 10)$ and $(10, 0)$. So the polygon is a right triangle with vertices at $(5, 5)$, $(0, 10)$, and $(10, 0)$, and with the center at $(8, 8)$.

To find the area of the triangle, we can use the formula for the area of a triangle: $\frac{1}{2} \times \text{base} \times \text{height}$. The base and the height of the triangle are both 10 units long (the distance between the points $(0, 10)$ and $(10, 0)$), so the area of the triangle is $\frac{1}{2} \times 10 \times 10 = 50$ square units.

Therefore, the area of the convex polygon is 50 square units. The answer is: $50$

Question (hint: positive numerical answer):
"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"
Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:


The expression $ab = 0$ is true if and only if $a = 0$ or $b = 0$. So the given equation is satisfied if either of the following two equations is satisfied:
1. $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2) = 0$
2. $((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$
For the first equation to be true, both $\vert x + y \vert - 10 = 0$ and $\vert x - y \vert - 10 = 0$, which means $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. This implies that the points $(x, y)$ lie on the lines $x + y = 10$ and $x - y = 10$, or $x + y = -10$ and $x - y = -10$. These lines form a square with side length $10\sqrt{2}$.
For the second equation to be true, both $\vert x \vert - 8 = 0$ and $\vert y \vert - 8 = 0$, which means $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$. This implies that the points $(x, y)$ lie on the lines $x = 8$ and $x = -8$, or $y = 8$ and $y = -8$. These lines form a square with side length $16$.
The area of the convex polygon is the sum of the areas of these two squares. The area of a square with side length $s$ is $s^2$, so the area of the first square is $(10\sqrt{2})^2 = 200$ and the area of the second square is $16^2 = 256$. Therefore, the total area of the convex polygon is $200 + 256 = 456$. The answer is: $456$

Question (hint: positive numerical answer):
"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"
Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:


The product of two numbers is zero if and only if at least one of the numbers is zero. Therefore, the equation
\[((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0\]
implies that either
\[((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2) = 0 \quad \text{or} \quad ((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0.\]
If $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2) = 0$, then $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$, which means $x + y = \pm 10$ and $x - y = \pm 10$. Solving these equations gives us the vertices of a square with side length 10. The area of this square is $10^2 = 100$.
If $((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$, then $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$, which means $x = \pm 8$ and $y = \pm 8$. Solving these equations gives us the vertices of a square with side length 16. The area of this square is $16^2 = 256$.
Therefore, the area of the convex polygon is the sum of the areas of the two squares, which is $100 + 256 = 356$. The answer is: $356$

"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"
Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:



The expression $AB = 0$ is equivalent to $A = 0$ or $B = 0$. Thus, the given equation is equivalent to either $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$.

For the first equation to be true, both $\vert x + y \vert - 10 = 0$ and $\vert x - y \vert - 10 = 0$, which implies $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. This is the equation of a square with side length 10.

For the second equation to be true, both $\vert x \vert - 8 = 0$ and $\vert y \vert - 8 = 0$, which implies $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$. This is the equation of a square with side length 8.

Therefore, the points satisfying the given equation are those that lie either inside or on the boundaries of two squares: one with side length 10 and centered at the origin, and the other with side length 8 and also centered at the origin.

The intersection of these two squares is the convex polygon in question. To find its area, we simply subtract the area of the smaller square from the area of the larger square:

Area = (Area of larger square) - (Area of smaller square)
= $(10)^2 - (8)^2$
= $100 - 64$
= $36$.
The answer is: $36$

"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"
Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:


The equation is satisfied if either $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$.
The first two conditions imply $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$.
The second two conditions imply $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$.
The solutions to $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ are the lines $x + y = 10$ and $x + y = -10$.
The solutions to $\vert x - y \vert = 10$ are the lines $x - y = 10$ and $x - y = -10$.
The solutions to $\vert x \vert = 8$ are the lines $x = 8$ and $x = -8$.
The solutions to $\vert y \vert = 8$ are the lines $y = 8$ and $y = -8$.
The lines form a square with side length 16.
The area of this square is $16^2 = 256$.
Therefore, the area of the convex polygon is 256 square units. The answer is: 256.

Step-by-step Solution:


The product of two numbers is zero if and only if at least one of the numbers is zero. This means that either $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$, $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$, $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$, or $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$.
For $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$, we have $\vert x + y \vert = 10$, which gives us two lines: $x + y = 10$ and $x + y = -10$.
For $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$, we have $\vert x - y \vert = 10$, which gives us two more lines: $x - y = 10$ and $x - y = -10$.

Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:


To solve this problem, we need to understand the properties of absolute value and the condition for the product of two numbers to be zero.

The product of two numbers is zero if and only if at least one of the numbers is zero. Therefore, the equation $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ is satisfied if and only if either of the following two conditions is true:

1. $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ or
2. $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$.

The first condition implies that $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$, which means that the points $(x, y)$ lie on a square with side length 10. The second condition implies that $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$, which means that the points $(x, y)$ lie on a square with side length 16.

Therefore, the points that satisfy the original equation are those that lie on either of these two squares. The convex polygon formed by these points is the union of these two squares.

The area of a square with side length $s$ is $s^2$. So the area of the smaller square (side length 10) is $10^2 = 100$, and the area of the larger square (side length 16) is $16^2 = 256$.

The area of the convex polygon is the sum of the areas of these two squares, which is $100 + 256 = 356$. The answer is: $356$.

"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"
Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:



The product of two numbers is zero if and only if at least one of the numbers is zero. So, $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ if and only if either $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$.

If $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$, then $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. This means $x + y = \pm 10$ and $x - y = \pm 10$. Solving these equations gives us four lines: $x + y = 10$, $x + y = -10$, $x - y = 10$, and $x - y = -10$.

If $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$, then $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$. This means $x = \pm 8$ and $y = \pm 8$. Solving these equations gives us four lines: $x = 8$, $x = -8$, $y = 8$, and $y = -8$.

The intersection of these lines forms a square with side length 10. The area of this square is $10^2 = 100$. So the area of the convex polygon is $\boxed{100}$.
The answer is: $\boxed{100}$

Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:



For the product of two numbers to be zero, at least one of the numbers must be zero. So we have two cases to consider:

Case 1: $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$
This means that both $\vert x + y \vert - 10 = 0$ and $\vert x - y \vert - 10 = 0$.
So $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$.
This gives us the lines $x + y = \pm 10$ and $x - y = \pm 10$.

Case 2: $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$
This means that both $\vert x \vert - 8 = 0$ and $\vert y \vert - 8 = 0$.
So $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$.
This gives us the lines $x = \pm 8$ and $y = \pm 8$.

The intersection points of these lines are the vertices of the polygon.
By plotting these lines on a coordinate plane, we find that the polygon is a square with side length 16.
The area of this square is $16^2 = 256$.
The answer is: $256$.

Question (hint: positive numerical answer):
"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"
Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:


The expression $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ is true if either of the two expressions inside the product is zero.
For the first expression, we have $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$.
This means $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ or $\vert x - y \vert = 10$.
For the second expression, we have $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$.
This means $\vert x \vert = 8$ or $\vert y \vert = 8$.
Combining these conditions, we find that the points $(x, y)$ that satisfy the equation are the points that lie on the square with vertices at $(\pm 8, \pm 8)$.
To find the area of this square, we simply square the length of one side. The length of a side of the square is 16 (twice the distance from the origin to each vertex), so the area of the square is $16^2 = 256$.
The answer is: $256$
