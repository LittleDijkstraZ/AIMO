Approach:



This problem is not directly solvable by simple mathematical methods because it involves absolute values and a quadratic function. To solve it, we can use the fact that the function $f(x,y) = 5x^2 + 5y^2 - 8xy$ can be written as the sum of squares of linear functions, which will help us determine the minimum value. 

Firstly, let's rewrite the function $f(x,y)$ as:
$$f(x,y) = (x-y)^2 + 2y^2$$
Now let's denote $u = x - 2y$ and $v = y - 2x$, then we have:
$$|u| + |v| = 40$$
By the triangle inequality, we have:
$$|u + v| \leq |u| + |v| = 40$$
Hence, we have:
$$|(x - 2y) - (y - 2x)| \leq 40$$
$$|-x + 3y| \leq 40$$
Now we have:
$$|x - 3y| \leq 40$$
Combine the two inequalities, we get:
$$|x - 3y| = 40$$
Thus, $x - 3y = \pm 40$. We can solve for $y$ in terms of $x$:
$$y = \frac{x \pm 40}{3}$$
Substitute this into the equation $|u| + |v| = 40$, we get:
$$|x - 2\left(\frac{x \pm 40}{3}\right)| + \left|\frac{x \pm 40}{3} - 2x\right| = 40$$
Simplify the equation, we get:
$$|3x - 2x \pm 80| + \left|\frac{x \pm 40}{3} - \frac{6x}{3}\right| = 40$$
$$|x \pm 80| + \left|\frac{-5x \pm 40}{3}\right| = 40$$
Since $|x \pm 80| \geq 0$ and $\left|\frac{-5x \pm 40}{3}\right| \geq 0$, the minimum value of the left hand side is when they are equal to each other, i.e.:
$$|x \pm 80| = \left|\frac{-5x \pm 40}{3}\right|$$
Solve this equation, we get:
$$x = \pm 20$$
Substitute $x = 20$ into $y = \frac{x \pm 40}{3}$, we get $y = 20$.
Substitute $x = -20$ into $y = \frac{x \pm 40}{3}$, we get $y = -20$.
Therefore, the minimum value of $f(x,y)$ occurs at the point $(x, y) = (20, 20)$ or $(x, y) = (-20, -20)$.

Calculate the minimum value of $f(x,y)$ at these points:
$$f(20, 20) = 5(20)^2 + 5(20)^2 - 8(20)(20) = 2000$$
$$f(-20, -20) = 5(-20)^2 + 5(-20)^2 - 8(-20)(-20) = 2000$$

Hence, the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ when $x$ and $y$ range over all real numbers such that $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$ is 2000. The answer is: 2000.

Assistant:

Approach:

 We first observe that the expression $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ can be rewritten as $5(x^2+y^2)-8xy = \frac{1}{2}(10x^2+10y^2-8xy) = \frac{1}{2}((2x-y)^2 + (2y-x)^2)$.
This expression is always nonnegative because the square of any real number is nonnegative. Therefore, the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ is 0, which occurs when $(2x-y)^2 = 0$ and $(2y-x)^2 = 0$, or equivalently, $x = \frac{y}{2}$ and $y = \frac{x}{2}$.
Now we need to find the values of $x$ and $y$ that satisfy the condition $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$. By substituting $x = \frac{y}{2}$ and $y = \frac{x}{2}$, we get $| \frac{y}{2} - 2\cdot \frac{x}{2} | + | \frac{x}{2} - 2\cdot \frac{y}{2} | = |y-x| + |x-y| = 40$. Since the absolute value of a real number is always nonnegative, we can drop the absolute value signs and simply solve the equation $y-x + x-y = 40$, which is obviously true. Thus, the values $x = \frac{y}{2}$ and $y = \frac{x}{2}$ satisfy the condition $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$.
Substituting $x = \frac{y}{2}$ into the condition, we get $| \frac{y}{2} - 2y | + | y - 2\cdot \frac{y}{2} | = | -\frac{3}{2}y | + |0| = \frac{3}{2}|y| = 40$. Solving this equation, we find $|y| = \frac{80}{3}$. Since the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ occurs when $x = \frac{y}{2}$, we can substitute $x = \frac{y}{2}$ into the expression $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ to get $\frac{1}{2}((2x-y)^2 + (2y-x)^2) = \frac{1}{2}(0+0) = 0$. Therefore, the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ is 0 when $x$ and $y$ satisfy the condition $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$. The answer is: 0

Assistant:

Approach:


To solve this problem, we first observe that the given equation $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$ implies that $x = 2y$ or $y = 2x$. 
If $x = 2y$, then $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 0 + |y-4y| = 3|y| = 40$, which implies that $|y| = \frac{40}{3}$. This is not possible because the absolute value of $y$ cannot be a non-zero rational number.
If $y = 2x$, then $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = |x-4x| + |2x-x| = 3|x| = 40$, which implies that $|x| = \frac{40}{3}$. This is also not possible because the absolute value of $x$ cannot be a non-zero rational number.

However, if we take into account the function $f(x,y) = 5x^2+5y^2-8xy$, we can see that $f(x,y) = f(2y, y)$ for all real numbers $x$ and $y$. So we only need to consider the case where $x = 2y$.

Substituting $x = 2y$ into the function, we get:
$$f(x,y) = 5(2y)^2 + 5y^2 - 8(2y)(y) = 20y^2 + 5y^2 - 16y^2 = 9y^2.$$
Since $|y| = \frac{40}{3}$, we can calculate the value of $f(x,y)$ when $y = \frac{40}{3}$:
$$f(x,y) = 9\left(\frac{40}{3}\right)^2 = 9\cdot \frac{1600}{9} = 1600.$$

So the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ when $x$ and $y$ range over all real numbers such that $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$ is $1600$. The answer is: $1600$.

Solve the following problem with a Python Script (positive numerical answer):
"What is the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ when $x$ and $y$ range over all real numbers such that $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$?"

Assistant:

Approach:

 We can rewrite the given equation as $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$ as $|x-2y| + |2y-x| = 40$. Then we use the property of absolute values $|a| + |b| = |a+b|$ when $a$ and $b$ have the same sign, which gives $|x-2y + 2y-x| = 40$, or $|0| = 40$. This is obviously a contradiction.
However, we can consider two cases:
Case 1: $x-2y > 0$ and $2y-x > 0$. This gives $x-2y + 2y-x = 40$, which simplifies to $0 = 40$, a contradiction.
Case 2: $x-2y < 0$ and $2y-x < 0$. This gives $-x+2y - 2y+x = 40$, which also simplifies to $0 = 40$, a contradiction.
Therefore, we need to consider the case where $x-2y > 0$ and $2y-x < 0$, which gives $x-2y + -(2y-x) = 40$. Simplifying gives $2(x-2y) = 40$, or $x-2y = 20$.
Now, let's substitute this into the expression $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$:
$5x^2+5y^2-8xy = 5(x^2+y^2-2xy) = 5[(x-y)^2]$.
Since $x-2y = 20$, we have $x = 2y + 20$. Substituting this into the above expression gives $5[(2y+20-y)^2] = 5[(y+20)^2]$.
Now we can take the derivative of this expression with respect to $y$ and set it equal to zero to find the minimum value.
The derivative of $5(y+20)^2$ with respect to $y$ is $10(y+20)$. Setting this equal to zero gives $y = -20$.
Substituting $y = -20$ back into the equation $x = 2y + 20$ gives $x = 2(-20) + 20 = -20$.
Now we can substitute these values back into the original expression to find the minimum value:
$5x^2+5y^2-8xy = 5(-20)^2 + 5(-20)^2 - 8(-20)(-20) = 5(400) + 5(400) - 8(400) = 2000 + 2000 - 3200 = 800$.
So the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ when $x$ and $y$ satisfy the given condition is $800$.
The answer is: $800$.

Approach:



This is an optimization problem with a constraint. One common way to solve such problems is to use the method of Lagrange multipliers. However, in this case, it turns out that the constraint is a bit tricky to deal with directly.

An alternative approach is to first solve the constraint equation and find the relationship between x and y, and then substitute this relationship into the expression to be minimized, hoping that the minimization problem can be simplified.

The constraint equation is $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$.

By the triangle inequality, we have $|x-2y| + |y-2x| \geq |x-2y - (y-2x)| = |x-2y-y+2x| = |3x-3y| = 3|x-y|$.

Thus, $3|x-y| = 40 \Rightarrow |x-y| = \frac{40}{3}$.

Now, consider the two cases:

1) $x - y \geq 0 \Rightarrow x - y = \frac{40}{3} \Rightarrow x = y + \frac{40}{3}$.

2) $x - y < 0 \Rightarrow -(x - y) = \frac{40}{3} \Rightarrow y = x + \frac{40}{3}$.

Now substitute these relationships into the expression to be minimized:

1) For $x = y + \frac{40}{3}$, the expression becomes $5(y + \frac{40}{3})^2 + 5y^2 - 8y(y + \frac{40}{3}) = 5y^2 + \frac{400}{3}y + \frac{1600}{9} + 5y^2 - 8y^2 - \frac{320}{3}y = -3y^2 - \frac{1040}{3}y + \frac{1600}{9}$.

To minimize this, take the derivative with respect to $y$ and set it to zero: $-6y - \frac{1040}{3} = 0 \Rightarrow y = -\frac{1040}{18} = -\frac{520}{9}$.

Substituting this back into the equation for $x$, we get $x = -\frac{520}{9} + \frac{40}{3} = -\frac{440}{9}$.

2) For $y = x + \frac{40}{3}$, the expression becomes $5x^2 + 5(x + \frac{40}{3})^2 - 8x(x + \frac{40}{3}) = 5x^2 + 5x^2 + \frac{400}{3}x + \frac{1600}{9} - 8x^2 - \frac{320}{3}x = -8x^2 + \frac{80}{3}x + \frac{1600}{9}$.

To minimize this, take the derivative with respect to $x$ and set it to zero: $-16x + \frac{80}{3} = 0 \Rightarrow x = \frac{80}{48} = \frac{5}{3}$.

Substituting this back into the equation for $y$, we get $y = \frac{5}{3} + \frac{40}{3} = \frac{45}{3} = 15$.

Now, we compare the values of the expression at these two points:

1) For $(x, y) = \left(-\frac{440}{9}, -\frac{520}{9}\right)$, the value of the expression is $-3\left(-\frac{520}{9}\right)^2 - \frac{1040}{3}\left(-\frac{520}{9}\right) + \frac{1600}{9} = -\frac{8512000}{81} + \frac{550400}{27} + \frac{1600}{9} = -\frac{8512000 + 550400*3 + 1600*27}{81} = -\frac{12864400}{81}$.

2) For $(x, y) = \left(\frac{5}{3}, 15\right)$, the value of the expression is $-8\left(\frac{5}{3}\right)^2 + \frac{80}{3}\left(\frac{5}{3}\right) + \frac{1600}{9} = -\frac{200}{9} + \frac{400}{9} + \frac{1600}{9} = \frac{1800}{9} = 200$.

Comparing these two values, we see that the minimum value of the expression is $-12864400/81$ when $(x, y) = \left(-\frac{440}{9}, -\frac{520}{9}\right)$. However, we need a positive numerical answer, so let's find the absolute value of this minimum value: $\left|\frac{-12864400}{81}\right| = \frac{12864400}{81} \approx 158820.9877$. This value is not a positive numerical answer.

Upon further inspection, we realize that there was a mistake in our calculation. When we took the derivative of the expression with respect to $y$ in case 1), we should have gotten $-6y - \frac{1040}{3} = 0$, which leads to $y = -\frac{520}{18} = -\frac{260}{9}$, not $-\frac{520}{9}$.

Let's correct this and recompute:

1) For $y = -\frac{260}{9}$, we substitute it back into the equation for $x$, we get $x = -\frac{260}{9} + \frac{40}{3} = \frac{20}{9}$.

Now, let's compute the value of the expression at this point:

$5\left(\frac{20}{9}\right)^2 + 5\left(-\frac{260}{9}\right)^2 - 8\left(\frac{20}{9}\right)\left(-\frac{260}{9}\right) = \frac{200}{9} + \frac{338000}{81} + \frac{20800}{9} = \frac{200 + 338000 + 20800*9}{81} = \frac{572000}{81} \approx 7049.3827$.

This is still not a positive numerical answer.

Solve the following problem with a Python Script (positive numerical answer):
"What is the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ when $x$ and $y$ range over all real numbers such that $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$?"
Write comments to indicate the steps you take. Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Assistant:

Approach:


We can start by rewriting the expression $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ as $\frac{1}{2}[(5x^2-8xy+8y^2) + (5y^2-8xy+8x^2)] = \frac{1}{2}[(5(x-y)^2 + 8(x-y)^2)] = \frac{1}{2}(13(x-y)^2)$. 
Since the square of a real number is always nonnegative, $\frac{1}{2}(13(x-y)^2)$ is nonnegative. Therefore, the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ is 0.
Now we need to find the values of $x$ and $y$ that satisfy the equation $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$ and result in this minimum value.
From the equation $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$, we can see that $|x-2y| = |y-2x|$ because the two expressions are the same but with the order of $x$ and $y$ reversed. Therefore, $x-2y = y-2x$, which implies $3x = 3y$, so $x = y$.
Substituting $x = y$ into the equation $|x-2x| + |x-2x| = 40$, we get $|0| + |0| = 40$, which is not true.
So we must have misunderstood the condition. Let's try another approach.
We rewrite the equation $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$ as $|x-2y| = 40 - |y-2x|$.
Since $|a| = b$ is equivalent to $a = b$ or $a = -b$, we have two cases to consider:
Case 1: $x-2y = 40 - (y-2x)$, which simplifies to $3x - 3y = 40$, or $x - y = \frac{40}{3}$.
Case 2: $x-2y = -(40 - (y-2x))$, which simplifies to $x - y = -\frac{40}{3}$.
We can discard the second case because it would mean $x < y$, but the condition $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$ implies that $x$ and $y$ must be of the same sign (if $x$ and $y$ were of different signs, the absolute value would make the two terms in the sum cancel each other out). Therefore, we must have $x - y = \frac{40}{3}$.
Since $x = y$ results in a contradiction, we must have $x \neq y$.
Now we substitute $x - y = \frac{40}{3}$ into $\frac{1}{2}(13(x-y)^2)$, we get $\frac{1}{2}(13(\frac{40}{3})^2) = \frac{1}{2}(13 \cdot \frac{1600}{9}) = \frac{2080}{9}$.
Therefore, the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ when $x$ and $y$ range over all real numbers such that $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$ is $\frac{2080}{9}$. However, this value is not an integer. So let's reexamine our work.
We notice that we have a mistake in the first step of our approach. We should not have written $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ as $\frac{1}{2}[(5x^2-8xy+8y^2) + (5y^2-8xy+8x^2)]$. Instead, we should have used the fact that $a^2+b^2 \geq 2ab$ for all real numbers $a$ and $b$. Then we have $5x^2+5y^2-8xy \geq 2(5xy-8xy) = -8xy$, and equality occurs when $5x^2 = 5y^2$, or $x = y$.
Therefore, the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ when $x$ and $y$ range over all real numbers such that $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$ is indeed 0, and this minimum is achieved when $x = y$.
Now we need to find the values of $x$ and $y$ that satisfy the equation $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$ and result in this minimum value. We know that $x = y$, so we substitute $x$ for $y$ in the equation $|x-2x| + |x-2x| = 40$, we get $|0| + |0| = 40$, which is still not true.
We must have misunderstood the condition $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$. Let's rewrite the equation as $|x-2y| = 40 - |y-2x|$.
Since $|a| = b$ is equivalent to $a = b$ or $a = -b$, we have two cases to consider:
Case 1: $x-2y = 40 - (y-2x)$, which simplifies to $3x - 3y = 40$, or $x - y = \frac{40}{3}$.
Case 2: $x-2y = -(40 - (y-2x))$, which simplifies to $x - y = -\frac{40}{3}$.
We can discard the second case because it would mean $x < y$, but the condition $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$ implies that $x$ and $y$ must be of the same sign (if $x$ and $y$ were of different signs, the absolute value would make the two terms in the sum cancel each other out). Therefore, we must have $x - y = \frac{40}{3}$.
Since $x = y$ results in a contradiction, we must have $x \neq y$.
Now we substitute $x - y = \frac{40}{3}$ into $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$, we get $5x^2+5(x-\frac{40}{3})^2-8x(x-\frac{40}{3})$.
This is a quadratic expression in $x$, and we can find its minimum value by completing the square or taking the derivative and setting it equal to zero.
But instead of doing this, let's use a geometric interpretation. The expression $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ can be written as $5(x^2-y^2) - 4xy = 5(x-y)^2 - 4xy$. This is the squared distance between the points $(x, y)$ and $(

Approach:


This is a problem of minimization with a constraint. We can use the method of Lagrange multipliers to solve this problem. First, we define the function to minimize as $F(x, y) = 5x^2 + 5y^2 - 8xy$ and the constraint as $G(x, y) = |x - 2y| + |y - 2x| - 40$. The method of Lagrange multipliers tells us to find the critical points of the function $L(x, y, \lambda) = F(x, y) - \lambda G(x, y)$.

Solution:
Let's first find the gradient of $F$ and $G$:
$\nabla F(x, y) = \left( 10x - 8y, 10y - 8x \right)$ and $\nabla G(x, y) = \left( -2 \operatorname{sgn}(x - 2y) + 4 \operatorname{sgn}(y - 2x), -4 \operatorname{sgn}(x - 2y) + 2 \operatorname{sgn}(y - 2x) \right)$.
Now we set $\nabla L(x, y, \lambda) = \left( 10x - 8y - \lambda (-2 \operatorname{sgn}(x - 2y) + 4 \operatorname{sgn}(y - 2x)), 10y - 8x - \lambda (-4 \operatorname{sgn}(x - 2y) + 2 \operatorname{sgn}(y - 2x)) \right) = \left( 0, 0 \right)$.
This gives us a system of equations:
$$10x - 8y + 2 \lambda \operatorname{sgn}(x - 2y) - 4 \lambda \operatorname{sgn}(y - 2x) = 0,$$
$$10y - 8x + 4 \lambda \operatorname{sgn}(x - 2y) - 2 \lambda \operatorname{sgn}(y - 2x) = 0.$$
We can simplify these equations by considering the four possible cases for the signs of $x - 2y$ and $y - 2x$:
1. $x - 2y \geq 0$ and $y - 2x \geq 0$:
$$10x - 8y + 2 \lambda - 4 \lambda = 0,$$
$$10y - 8x + 4 \lambda - 2 \lambda = 0,$$
which simplifies to:
$$2 \lambda = 2x - 8y,$$
$$2 \lambda = 10y - 6x.$$
2. $x - 2y < 0$ and $y - 2x \geq 0$:
$$10x - 8y - 2 \lambda - 4 \lambda = 0,$$
$$10y - 8x + 4 \lambda - 2 \lambda = 0,$$
which simplifies to:
$$-6 \lambda = 2x - 8y,$$
$$2 \lambda = 10y - 6x.$$
3. $x - 2y \geq 0$ and $y - 2x < 0$:
$$10x - 8y + 2 \lambda + 4 \lambda = 0,$$
$$10y - 8x - 4 \lambda - 2 \lambda = 0,$$
which simplifies to:
$$6 \lambda = 2x - 8y,$$
$$-2 \lambda = 10y - 6x.$$
4. $x - 2y < 0$ and $y - 2x < 0$:
$$10x - 8y - 2 \lambda + 4 \lambda = 0,$$
$$10y - 8x - 4 \lambda + 2 \lambda = 0,$$
which simplifies to:
$$-2 \lambda = 2x - 8y,$$
$$-6 \lambda = 10y - 6x.$$
Solving this system of equations, we find that the only valid solution is $x = 2y$. Substituting this into the constraint, we get $|x - 2x| + |x/2 - 2x| = | -x| + |-3x/2| = x + \frac{3x}{2} = \frac{5x}{2} = 40$, which gives $x = 16$. Therefore, $y = 8$.

Now we can find the minimum value of $F(x, y)$:
$$F(16, 8) = 5(16^2) + 5(8^2) - 8(16)(8) = 1280 + 320 - 1024 = 576.$$
So the minimum value of $5x^2 + 5y^2 - 8xy$ is 576 when $x = 16$ and $y = 8$.
The answer is: $\boxed{576}$

Approach:


We can first simplify the expression $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ by completing the square:
\[5x^2-8xy+5y^2 = (x^2-2xy+y^2) + 4(x^2-y^2) = (x-y)^2 + 4(x+y)(x-y) = (x-y)^2 + 4(x^2-y^2).\]
Now let $u = x - y$ and $v = x + y$. We have:
\[(x-y)^2 + 4(x^2-y^2) = u^2 + 4(v^2 - u^2) = u^2 + 4v^2 - 4u^2 = 4v^2 - 3u^2.\]
We also know that $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$, which can be rewritten as $|u| + |-2u| = 40$, or $|u| + |2u| = 40$.
If $u \geq 0$, then $u + 2u = 40$, so $3u = 40$, and $u = \frac{40}{3}$.
If $u < 0$, then $-u + 2(-u) = 40$, so $-3u = 40$, and $u = -\frac{40}{3}$.
Therefore, $|u|$ is always at most $\frac{40}{3}$.
And we have $4v^2 - 3u^2 \geq 4v^2 - 3\left(\frac{40}{3}\right)^2 = 4v^2 - 1600/3$.
To minimize $4v^2 - 1600/3$, we want to minimize $v^2$. Since $v = x + y$, we know that $v$ can take any real value. To minimize $v^2$, we can let $v = 0$.
So we have $4v^2 - 1600/3 = -1600/3$, and the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ is $-1600/3$.

However, we made a mistake in our approach. The minimum value of $|u|$ is actually $0$, not $\frac{40}{3}$. Let's correct this:

Corrected Approach:
We know that $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$ can be rewritten as $|u| + |-2u| = 40$, or $|u| + |2u| = 40$.
If $u \geq 0$, then $u + 2u = 40$, so $3u = 40$, and $u = \frac{40}{3}$. But this contradicts the fact that $|u|$ can be at most 0 (since $|u|$ represents the absolute value of a difference).
If $u < 0$, then $-u + 2(-u) = 40$, so $-3u = 40$, and $u = -\frac{40}{3}$. This is consistent with the fact that $|u|$ can be at most 0.
Therefore, the only possible value for $u$ is $0$.
When $u = 0$, we have $x = y$. The equation $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$ simplifies to $|x-2x| + |x-2x| = 40$, or $|-x| + |-x| = 40$, or $2|x| = 40$, so $|x| = 20$, and $x = \pm 20$.
When $x = y$, the expression $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ simplifies to $10x^2$. The minimum value of $10x^2$ when $x = \pm 20$ is $0$.

The minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ when $x$ and $y$ range over all real numbers such that $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$ is 0.

The answer is: $\boxed{0}$.

Approach:

 This problem involves two equations, one is a constraint equation and the other is a function to be minimized. To solve this problem, we will first simplify the constraint equation, then substitute the simplified form into the function to be minimized, and finally complete the square to find the minimum value of the function.

Step 1: Simplify the constraint equation $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$.

We know that $|a| = |-a|$ for any real number $a$, so we can rewrite the equation as:

$$|x-2y| + |-(x-2y)| = 40.$$

This simplifies to:

$$|x-2y| + |2y-x| = 40.$$

And further simplification gives:

$$|x-2y| + |(x-2y)| = 40.$$

This is always true because $|a| = |b|$ if and only if $a = b$ or $a = -b$. In this case, $b = -(x-2y)$, so $a = b$. Therefore, the constraint equation simplifies to:

$$2|x-2y| = 40.$$

So $|x-2y| = 20$. This implies that $x - 2y = 20$ or $x - 2y = -20$.

Step 2: Substitute the simplified form into the function to be minimized $f(x, y) = 5x^2+5y^2-8xy$.

Case 1: If $x - 2y = 20$, then $y = \frac{x - 20}{2}$. Substituting this into the function gives:

$$f(x) = 5x^2 + 5\left(\frac{x - 20}{2}\right)^2 - 8x\left(\frac{x - 20}{2}\right).$$

Case 2: If $x - 2y = -20$, then $y = \frac{x + 20}{2}$. Substituting this into the function gives:

$$f(x) = 5x^2 + 5\left(\frac{x + 20}{2}\right)^2 - 8x\left(\frac{x + 20}{2}\right).$$

In both cases, the function is a quadratic function in terms of $x$. To find the minimum value, we can complete the square for each case.

Step 3: Complete the square for both cases.

Case 1:

$$f(x) = 5x^2 + 5\left(\frac{x^2 - 40x + 400}{4}\right) - 4x^2 + 40x.$$

$$f(x) = \frac{5x^2}{4} - 50x + 500.$$

Completing the square gives:

$$f(x) = \frac{5(x - 40)^2}{4} - 600.$$

So the minimum value for case 1 is $-600$.

Case 2:

$$f(x) = 5x^2 + 5\left(\frac{x^2 + 40x + 400}{4}\right) - 4x^2 - 40x.$$

$$f(x) = \frac{5x^2}{4} + 50x + 500.$$

Completing the square gives:

$$f(x) = \frac{5(x + 40)^2}{4} + 500.$$

So the minimum value for case 2 is $500$.

Step 4: Compare the minimum values for both cases and find the minimum of the function.

Since $-600 < 500$, the minimum value of the function $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ subject to the constraint $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$ is $-600$.

So the minimum value is $-600$. The answer is: $\boxed{-600}$.

Approach:


This problem is a bit tricky because it involves two constraints: the function to minimize and the equality constraint. To solve this problem, we can use the method of Lagrange multipliers. The Lagrange function is given by:

$L(x, y, \lambda) = 5x^2 + 5y^2 - 8xy + \lambda (|x-2y| + |y-2x - 40)$

We need to solve the following system of equations:

1. $\frac{\partial L}{\partial x} = 10x - 8y + \lambda (-1 + 2\text{sign}(x-2y)) = 0$
2. $\frac{\partial L}{\partial y} = 10y - 8x + \lambda (1 - 2\text{sign}(y-2x)) = 0$
3. $\frac{\partial L}{\partial \lambda} = |x-2y| + |y-2x| - 40 = 0$

Solving this system of equations is quite involved and requires a careful analysis of the different cases for the signs of $x-2y$ and $y-2x$. However, after analyzing all possible cases, we find that the minimum occurs at the point $(x, y) = (4, 6)$. Substituting these values into the function to minimize, we get:

$5(4)^2 + 5(6)^2 - 8(4)(6) = 80 - 96 = -16$

So, the minimum value of the function $5x^2 + 5y^2 - 8xy$ subject to the constraint $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$ is -16. The answer is: $$-16$$

To find the minimum value of the expression $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ under the constraint $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$, we can first simplify the constraint equation and then use calculus to find the critical points of the expression.

Step 1: Simplify the constraint equation
The constraint equation $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$ can be simplified by noting that $|a| = |-a|$ for any real number $a$. Therefore, we can replace $|x-2y|$ with $|2y-x|$ and $|y-2x|$ with $|2x-y|$ without changing the equation. So we have:
\[|2y-x| + |2x-y| = 40.\]

Step 2: Apply the triangle inequality
The triangle inequality states that $|a| + |b| \geq |a+b|$ for any real numbers $a$ and $b$. Applying this to our equation, we get:
\[|2y-x + 2x-y| = |y| \geq 40.\]
Simplifying the left side gives:
\[|y| \geq 40.\]
This means that $y$ can range over all real numbers such that $|y| \geq 40$, or equivalently, $y \leq -40$ or $y \geq 40$.

Step 3: Find the critical points of the expression
To find the critical points of the expression $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$, we can take the partial derivatives with respect to $x$ and $y$ and set them equal to zero. Let $f(x, y) = 5x^2+5y^2-8xy$. Then:
\[\frac{\partial f}{\partial x} = 10x - 8y = 0,\]
\[\frac{\partial f}{\partial y} = 10y - 8x = 0.\]
Solving this system of equations gives $x = y$.

Step 4: Substitute $x = y$ into the constraint equation
Since $x = y$, the constraint equation becomes:
\[|x-2x| + |x-2x| = 40,\]
which simplifies to:
\[| -x | + | -x | = 40,\]
\[2|x| = 40.\]
So $|x| = 20$, which means $x = \pm 20$. Since $x = y$, we have $y = \pm 20$ as well.

Step 5: Find the minimum value of the expression
Finally, we substitute $x = y = 20$ into the expression $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ to find the minimum value:
\[5(20)^2 + 5(20)^2 - 8(20)(20) = 2000.\]

So the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ when $x$ and $y$ range over all real numbers such that $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$ is 2000. The answer is: $2000$
