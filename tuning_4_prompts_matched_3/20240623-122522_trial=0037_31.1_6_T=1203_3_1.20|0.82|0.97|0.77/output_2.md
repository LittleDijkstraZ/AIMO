Approach:

 To have four distinct solutions, the right hand side $\frac{m}{100}$ should be $2$. Hence, we have $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert= 0.02$.
This further simplifies to $\vert x-1 -2 \vert = 0.02$ or $\vert x-1 +2 \vert = 0.02$.
Solving the above absolute value equations, we get the following:
1. For the first equation, $\vert x-3 \vert = 0.02$, we get two solutions $x = 3.02$ and $x = 2.98$.
2. For the second equation, $\vert x+1 \vert = 0.02$, we get two solutions $x = -1.02$ and $x = -0.98$.
So, the four distinct solutions are $2.98$, $3.02$, $-1.02$ and $-0.98$.
We can observe that for any $m$, the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ will have four distinct solutions.
Thus, the value of $m$ is $200$.
The answer is: $1$

To count the number of positive integers $m$ for which the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has 4 distinct solutions, we first need to understand the nature of the equation.

The equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ can be thought of as a piecewise function with 4 cases depending on the value of $x$. 

For each case, we solve the equation and find the number of distinct solutions. If the total number of distinct solutions for all cases equals 4, then we count that particular $m$ as a valid count.

By doing this for each $m$, we can find the total number of valid $m$.

The actual calculations for this problem are quite involved and are best done using a Python script.

The answer is: $\boxed{1}$

First, we analyze the structure of the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$. This equation has four distinct solutions if and only if the value $\frac{m}{100}$ is in the interval $(0,2)$. This is because the function $f(x) = \vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert$ has a graph that is a "V" shape with the "valley" between $0$ and $4$. So, the equation $f(x) = \frac{m}{100}$ has four distinct solutions when $\frac{m}{100}$ is strictly between $0$ and $2$. Multiplying both sides of this inequality by $100$, we get $0 < m < 200$.

Now, we need to find the number of positive integers $m$ that satisfy this inequality. This is simply the number of positive integers from $1$ to $199$. To find this number, we can subtract the smallest integer (which is $1$) from the largest integer (which is $199$) and then add $1$. So, the number of positive integers $m$ is $199 - 1 + 1 = 199$.

So, the number of positive integers $m$ for which the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has four distinct solutions is $199$.
The answer is: $199$

To find the number of positive integers $m$ for which the equation \[\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}\] has four distinct solutions, we need to understand the behavior of the function $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert$.

The function $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert$ has three "jumps":

1. When $\vert x-1 \vert -2 = 0$, we get $\vert x-1 \vert = 2$. This means $x-1 = 2$ or $x-1 = -2$. So the first jump occurs at $x=3$ or $x=-1$.

2. When $\vert x-1 \vert -2 = -\frac{m}{100}$, we get $\vert x-1 \vert = 2 - \frac{m}{100}$. This means $x-1 = 2 - \frac{m}{100}$ or $x-1 = -(2 - \frac{m}{100})$. So the second jump occurs at $x = 3 - \frac{m}{100}$ or $x = -1 + \frac{m}{100}$.

3. When $\vert x-1 \vert -2 = -\frac{2m}{100}$, we get $\vert x-1 \vert = 2 - \frac{2m}{100}$. This means $x-1 = 2 - \frac{2m}{100}$ or $x-1 = -(2 - \frac{2m}{100})$. So the third jump occurs at $x = 3 - \frac{2m}{100}$ or $x = -1 + \frac{2m}{100}$.

We want the equation to have four distinct solutions. This can happen when the jump from $\frac{m}{100}$ to $\frac{2m}{100}$ is between $3$ and $-1$. This means \[ -1 + \frac{m}{100} < 3 - \frac{2m}{100} < 3 - \frac{m}{100} < -1 + \frac{2m}{100}.\] Solving this inequality chain gives $m = 100$.

Therefore, the number of positive integers $m$ for which the equation has four distinct solutions is $1$. The answer is: $\boxed{1}$

We know that for the equation $||x-1|-2|=\frac{m}{100}$ to have $4$ distinct solutions, the value of $\frac{m}{100}$ must be less than $2$ because the graph of $||x-1|-2|$ is a "V" shape with the vertex at $x=1$ and the distance between the "arms" of the "V" is $4$. If the value of $\frac{m}{100}$ is greater than or equal to $2$, the equation will have only $2$ distinct solutions. Therefore, we need to find the number of positive integer values of $m$ such that $\frac{m}{100}<2$.

Solving the inequality:

\[\frac{m}{100}<2 \implies m<200.\]

The positive integers less than $200$ are the numbers from $1$ to $199$.

The number of these integers is $199$.

Therefore, the number of positive integers $m$ such that the equation $||x-1|-2|=\frac{m}{100}$ has $4$ distinct solutions is $199$.

The answer is: $199$

First, let's understand the problem. The equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has 4 distinct solutions. We need to find the number of positive integer values of $m$ for which this is true.

The equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ involves absolute values, which can make it difficult to solve directly. However, we can simplify the problem by considering the cases for the number of solutions based on the value of $\frac{m}{100}$.

When $\frac{m}{100} \leq 2$, there is only one solution, $x = 1 + \sqrt{2 + \frac{m}{100}}$.
When $\frac{m}{100} = 2$, there are two solutions, $x = 1 + \sqrt{2 + \frac{m}{100}}$ and $x = 1 - \sqrt{2 + \frac{m}{100}}$.
When $2 < \frac{m}{100} \leq 4$, there are four distinct solutions.
When $\frac{m}{100} > 4$, there is only one solution, $x = 1 - \sqrt{2 - \frac{m}{100}}$.

So, the only way for the equation to have 4 distinct solutions is when $2 < \frac{m}{100} \leq 4$.

This means $200 < m \leq 400$. The positive integer values of $m$ in this range are 201, 202, ..., 400. To find the number of these values, we can subtract the smallest value from the largest value and add 1:

Number of positive integer values of $m$ = $400 - 201 + 1 = 199$.

But we made a mistake. We forgot to consider the case when $0 < \frac{m}{100} \leq 2$. In this case, there are also 4 distinct solutions. So, we need to add the number of positive integer values of $m$ in the range $0 < m \leq 200$:

Number of positive integer values of $m$ = $200 - 1 + 1 = 200$.

So, the total number of positive integer values of $m$ for which the equation has 4 distinct solutions is the sum of the number of values in the two ranges:

Total number of positive integer values of $m$ = $199 + 200 = 399$.

So, the number of positive integers $m$ for which the equation has 4 distinct solutions is 399.
The answer is: $399$

Approach:


The equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has 4 distinct solutions if and only if $\frac{m}{100}$ is less than 2 but greater than 0. This is because the expression inside the absolute value, $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert$, oscillates between 0 and 4 as $x$ varies over the real numbers. Therefore, we need to find the number of positive integers $m$ such that $0<\frac{m}{100}<2$. Multiplying all parts of the inequality by 100 gives $0<m<200$. The positive integers $m$ that satisfy this inequality are the integers from 1 to 199. To count these integers, we subtract the smallest possible value of $m$ (which is 1) from the largest possible value of $m$ (which is 199), and then add 1. This gives the number of positive integers $m$ as $199 - 1 + 1 = 199$. Therefore, the number of positive integers $m$ such that the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has 4 distinct solutions is 199.
The answer is: $199$

Approach:

 The equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has 4 distinct solutions, it implies that the right side $\frac{m}{100}$ is in the range (0, 2). So $0 < \frac{m}{100} < 2$, which implies $0 < m < 200$. Thus, the positive integer $m$ that satisfies this condition is $1, 2, 3, ..., 199$. We need to count the number of these positive integers that make the equation have 4 distinct solutions.

For each $m$, we can solve the equation to find the number of distinct solutions. However, this can be quite tedious. Instead, we can use the property of the absolute value function to find the number of solutions for each $m$.

Solution: The equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has 4 distinct solutions when the right side $\frac{m}{100}$ is in the range (0, 2). This means $0 < m < 200$. We need to count the number of positive integers $m$ in this range. Since $m$ is a positive integer, the number of such $m$ is $199$. However, we need to find the number of $m$ that make the equation have 4 distinct solutions.

By analyzing the properties of the absolute value function, we can see that the equation has 4 distinct solutions when $\frac{m}{100}$ is in the range (0, 2). This means $0 < m < 200$. We need to count the number of positive integers $m$ in this range.

The positive integers $m$ that satisfy $0 < m < 200$ are $1, 2, 3, ..., 199$. There are 199 such numbers. Therefore, there are 199 positive integers $m$ for which the equation has 4 distinct solutions.
The answer is: $199$
