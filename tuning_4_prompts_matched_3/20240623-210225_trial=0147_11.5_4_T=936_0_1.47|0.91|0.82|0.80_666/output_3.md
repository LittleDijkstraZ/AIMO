 This problem involves understanding the properties of absolute value functions and how they result in a polygon. The equation involves the product of two expressions being equal to zero, which means that either of the expressions must be zero. The absolute value expressions are zero when the quantities inside the absolute value are zero, i.e., when $x + y = 0$, $x - y = 0$, $x = 0$, and $y = 0$. Solving these equations, we get the vertices of the polygon as $(0,0)$, $(10, -10)$, $(-10, 10)$, and $(10,10)$, $(-10, -10)$. These are the vertices of a square with side length 20 units. The area of this square is therefore side squared or $20^2 = 400$ square units. Therefore, the area of the convex polygon is 400 square units.

Note: This is a theoretical problem, but in practice, you would need numerical methods to obtain the exact coordinates of the vertices of the polygon.

However, given the equations, we can analyze them and come to the conclusion that the points $(x, y)$ that satisfy the equations are the vertices of a square with side length 20 units. This is because the absolute value expressions being zero results in four equations: $x + y = 0$, $x - y = 0$, $x = 0$, and $y = 0$, which have solutions $(0,0)$, $(10, -10)$, $(-10, 10)$, and $(10,10)$, $(-10, -10)$ respectively. Therefore, we know it's a square. And given the side length of 20 units, we can easily find its area as $20^2 = 400$ square units. The answer is: $400$

 The area of the polygon is found by taking the absolute value of the determinant of the matrix $\begin{bmatrix}a & b \\ c & d\end{bmatrix}$ and dividing it by 2. In this case, the matrix is $\begin{bmatrix}80 & 0 \\ 0 & 80\end{bmatrix}$ because all the entries are equal to 80. The determinant of this matrix is $80 \cdot 80 - 0 \cdot 0 = 6400$. The area of the polygon is then $\frac{6400}{2} = 3200$.

    a = 80

Below is a math problem you are to solve (positive numerical answer!):
"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"
Analyze this problem and think step by step to come to a solution with programs. After solving the problem, output the final numerical answer within \boxed{}.

Assistant:

 First, we need to understand the conditions for the equation to be equal to zero. A product of two or more factors is zero if and only if at least one of the factors is zero. Therefore, either $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$, $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$, $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$, or $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$.
Setting each factor to zero, we have:
1. $\vert x + y \vert = 10$, which means $x + y = 10$ or $x + y = -10$.
2. $\vert x - y \vert = 10$, which means $x - y = 10$ or $x - y = -10$.
3. $\vert x \vert = 8$, which means $x = 8$ or $x = -8$.
4. $\vert y \vert = 8$, which means $y = 8$ or $y = -8$.
The solutions to these equations are the vertices of the polygon. By plotting these vertices on a graph and connecting them, we get a square with side length 16. The area of this square is $16^2 = 256$.
Therefore, the area of the convex polygon is 256.
The answer is: $256$

"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"

The equation $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ is equal to zero if and only if $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$, $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$, $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$, or $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$. 
The only way for these expressions to be equal to zero is if $\vert x + y \vert = 10$, $\vert x - y \vert = 10$, $\vert x \vert = 8$, or $\vert y \vert = 8$. 
This gives us a system of inequalities: $\{-8 \leq x \leq 8\}$, $\{-8 \leq y \leq 8\}$, $\{-10 \leq x + y \leq 10\}$, and $\{-10 \leq x - y \leq 10\}$. 
The intersection of these inequalities forms a square with side length 16. Therefore, the area of the convex polygon is $16^2 = 256$. The answer is: $256$

"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"

 The given equation is a product of two terms equal to zero, so either the first term equals zero or the second term equals zero.
The first term is $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)$, and it equals zero if and only if $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$.
The second term is $((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2)$, and it equals zero if and only if $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$.

The solutions of $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$ are the four lines $x + y = \pm 10$ and $x - y = \pm 10$.
The solutions of $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$ are the four lines $x = \pm 8$ and $y = \pm 8$.

The lines intersect at the points $(8, 2), (8, -2), (-8, 2),$ and $(-8, -2)$, and form a square.
The side length of the square is $2 \cdot 8 = 16$, so the area of the square is $16^2 = 256$.
The answer is: 256.

"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"

This problem can be approached through understanding the properties of absolute value functions and the conditions for multiplication to be zero. The expression $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2)$ is equal to zero if either of the two factors is zero.

The first factor, $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)$, is zero if both $(\vert x + y \vert - 10) = 0$ and $(\vert x - y \vert - 10) = 0$, which implies that $|x + y| = 10$ and $|x - y| = 10$. This defines a square with side length 20 centered at the origin.

The second factor, $((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2)$, is zero if both $(\vert x \vert - 8) = 0$ and $(\vert y \vert - 8) = 0$, which implies that $|x| = 8$ and $|y| = 8$. This defines a square with side length 16 centered at the origin.

The intersection of these two squares is a smaller square with side length 16, which is the convex polygon formed by the points satisfying the given equation. The area of this square is $16^2 = 256$.
