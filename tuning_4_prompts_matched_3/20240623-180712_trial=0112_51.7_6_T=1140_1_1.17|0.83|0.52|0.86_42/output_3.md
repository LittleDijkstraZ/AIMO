Below is a math problem you are to solve (positive numerical answer):
"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"

To accomplish this:
- List the variables and known values from the problem.
- Outline the steps using sympy to solve the problem:
  * Identify the sympy functions required for each step.
  * Implement these functions step-by-step, commenting each line for clarity.
- Calculate the final answer and verify it's a positive integer.
- Output the result within \boxed{}.

Interesting, let's analyze step by step:



In the given equation, both terms have to be zero for the equation to be true:
$$((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2) = 0$$
$$((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$$

The first equation is satisfied when $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. The second equation is satisfied when $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$.

This gives us four points: $(8, 8)$, $(8, -8)$, $(-8, 8)$, and $(-8, -8)$.

Now, we can calculate the area of the square formed by these points. The length of each side of the square is $16$, so the area of the square is $16^2 = 256$.

So the area of the convex polygon is $256$.
The answer is: $256$

Interesting, let's analyze step by step:



1. The equation given is a product of two terms equal to zero, so either of the terms must be zero. This gives us two systems of equations to solve:

   a) $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ and $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ and $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$.

   b) $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$.

2. Solving a) gives us the vertices of the polygon: $(8, 8), (-8, 8), (8, -8), (-8, -8)$.

3. Solving b) gives us the vertices of the polygon where $|x - y| = 10$, which are on the lines $x - y = 10$ and $x - y = -10$. These lines pass through the vertices we found in a).

4. Plotting these lines and vertices, we find that the points enclose a square with side length 16.

5. The area of a square is given by side length squared, so the area of this square is $16^2 = 256$.

Therefore, the area of the convex polygon is 256. The answer is: $256$.

Interesting, let's analyze step by step:



Step 1: The problem involves absolute values, so we have to consider all possible cases for the signs of $x$ and $y$. Since there are four possible combinations of signs for $x$ and $y$, we will consider four separate cases.

Step 2: For each case, we will simplify the given equation and find the points that satisfy it. The equation is a product of two expressions, so if one of them is zero, the whole product is zero. This gives us two separate equations to solve: $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ and $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$, and $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ and $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$.

Step 3: Solving these equations, we find that the points that satisfy the original equation are $(8,8)$, $(-8,8)$, $(8,-8)$, and $(-8,-8)$.

Step 4: Plotting these points on a graph, we see that they form a square with side length 16. To find the area of this square, we simply square the side length: $16^2 = 256$.

Step 5: We can confirm that this is a positive integer.

The area of the convex polygon formed by the points satisfying the given equation is 256 square units. The answer is: $256$

Interesting, let's analyze step by step:



The expression equals to zero if either of the two factors equals to zero.
For the first factor:
- $ (\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ 
- $ (\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$
This implies that $|x + y| = 10$ and $|x - y| = 10$.
For the second factor:
- $ (\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$
- $ (\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$
This implies that $|x| = 8$ and $|y| = 8$.

The four lines defined by $|x + y| = 10$, $|x - y| = 10$, $|x| = 8$ and $|y| = 8$ enclose a rectangle. The sides of the rectangle are determined by the following equations:
- $x + y = \pm 10$
- $x - y = \pm 10$
- $x = \pm 8$
- $y = \pm 8$

Solving these equations, we find the vertices of the rectangle:
- $(8, 2)$
- $(-8, 2)$
- $(-8, -2)$
- $(8, -2)$

The length of the rectangle is $2*8 = 16$ and the width is $2*2 = 4$.

Therefore, the area of the rectangle is $16 * 4 = 64$. So the area of the convex polygon is 64.
The answer is: $64$

Interesting, let's analyze step by step:



First, we have the equation $AB = 0$, where $A = (|x + y| - 10)^2 + (|x - y| - 10)^2$ and $B = (|x| - 8)^2 + (|y| - 8)^2$. If the product of two factors is zero, then at least one of the factors must be zero. So either $A = 0$ or $B = 0$.

For $A = 0$, we have:
$(|x + y| - 10)^2 + (|x - y| - 10)^2 = 0$
This implies $|x + y| = 10$ and $|x - y| = 10$. Solving these equations, we get four lines: $x + y = 10$, $x + y = -10$, $x - y = 10$, and $x - y = -10$. These lines form a square with side length $10\sqrt{2}$.

For $B = 0$, we have:
$(|x| - 8)^2 + (|y| - 8)^2 = 0$
This implies $|x| = 8$ and $|y| = 8$. Solving these equations, we get four lines: $x = 8$, $x = -8$, $y = 8$, and $y = -8$. These lines form a square with side length $16$.

Combining the two squares, we find that the total area of the convex polygon is the sum of the areas of the two squares, which is $(10\sqrt{2})^2 + 16^2 = 200 + 256 = 456$. 

However, this is not the correct area of the convex polygon. 

The correct solution for $A = 0$ and $B = 0$ should give us a single square, not two squares. Let's re-examine the problem.

The equation $A = 0$ gives us two conditions: $|x + y| = 10$ and $|x - y| = 10$. This means that the points $(x, y)$ must lie on the lines $x + y = 10$, $x + y = -10$, $x - y = 10$, and $x - y = -10$. These four lines form a square with side length $10\sqrt{2}$.

Similarly, the equation $B = 0$ gives us two conditions: $|x| = 8$ and $|y| = 8$. This means that the points $(x, y)$ must lie on the lines $x = 8$, $x = -8$, $y = 8$, and $y = -8$. These four lines also form a square with side length $16$.

However, the solution for $A = 0$ and $B = 0$ actually describes a single square. The vertices of this square are the intersections of the lines $x + y = 10$ and $x - y = 10$ (which gives the point $(5,5)$), $x + y = 10$ and $y = 8$ (which gives the point $(2,8)$), $x + y = 10$ and $x = 8$ (which gives the point $(8,2)$), $x - y = 10$ and $x = 8$ (which gives the point $(8,-2)$), $x - y = 10$ and $y = 8$ (which gives the point $(2,-8)$), $x - y = 10$ and $x = -8$ (which gives the point $(-8,-2)$), $x + y = -10$ and $x = -8$ (which gives the point $(-8,2)$), and $x + y = -10$ and $y = -8$ (which gives the point $(-2,-8)$). This square has side length $10\sqrt{2}$, which is the same as the side length of the square formed by the lines $x + y = 10$, $x + y = -10$, $x - y = 10$, and $x - y = -10$.

The area of this square is indeed $(10\sqrt{2})^2 = 200$.

So the area of the convex polygon is $200$.

Therefore, the area of the convex polygon is 200 square units. The answer is: $200$

Interesting, let's analyze step by step:



The equation is defined as:
\[((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0.\]

This equation is equal to zero if either of the two terms is zero. Hence, the points that satisfy the equation are:
1) The points where $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$, which implies $\vert x + y \vert = 10$, or $x + y = \pm 10$.
2) The points where $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$, which implies $\vert x - y \vert = 10$, or $x - y = \pm 10$.
3) The points where $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$, which implies $\vert x \vert = 8$, or $x = \pm 8$.
4) The points where $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$, which implies $\vert y \vert = 8$, or $y = \pm 8$.

These lines and points form a square with side length 16, centered at the origin. The area of this square is $16^2 = 256$.

So the area of the convex polygon is $256$.
The answer is: $256$
