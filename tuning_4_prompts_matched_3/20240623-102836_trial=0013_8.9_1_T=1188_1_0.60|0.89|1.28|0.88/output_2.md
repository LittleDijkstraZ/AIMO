Interesting, let's analyze step by step:



The equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has 4 distinct solutions. We know that the absolute value function $\vert x \vert$ splits into two cases: $x$ if $x \geq 0$ and $-x$ if $x < 0$. So, we have four cases to consider for the given equation:

1. $x-1 \geq 2$, which implies $x \geq 3$. So, the equation becomes $\vert x-1-2 \vert = \frac{m}{100}$, or $\vert x-3 \vert = \frac{m}{100}$. This further splits into two cases: $x-3 = \frac{m}{100}$ and $-(x-3) = \frac{m}{100}$, or $x = 3 + \frac{m}{100}$ and $x = 3 - \frac{m}{100}$.

2. $1 \leq x < 3$, which implies $0 \leq x-1 < 2$. So, the equation becomes $\vert -(x-1) - 2 \vert = \frac{m}{100}$, or $\vert -x+1-2 \vert = \frac{m}{100}$, or $\vert -x-1 \vert = \frac{m}{100}$. This further splits into two cases: $-x-1 = \frac{m}{100}$ and $-( -x-1) = \frac{m}{100}$, or $-x = \frac{m}{100} + 1$ and $-x = -\frac{m}{100} - 1$, or $x = -\frac{m}{100} - 1$ and $x = \frac{m}{100} + 1$.

3. $x < 1$, which implies $x-1 < 0$. So, the equation becomes $\vert -(x-1) - 2 \vert = \frac{m}{100}$, or $\vert -x+1-2 \vert = \frac{m}{100}$, or $\vert -x-1 \vert = \frac{m}{100}$. This further splits into two cases: $-x-1 = \frac{m}{100}$ and $-( -x-1) = \frac{m}{100}$, or $-x = \frac{m}{100} + 1$ and $-x = -\frac{m}{100} - 1$, or $x = -\frac{m}{100} - 1$ and $x = \frac{m}{100} + 1$.

4. $x-1 < -2$, which implies $x < -1$. So, the equation becomes $\vert -(x-1) - 2 \vert = \frac{m}{100}$, or $\vert -x+1-2 \vert = \frac{m}{100}$, or $\vert -x-1 \vert = \frac{m}{100}$. This further splits into two cases: $-x-1 = \frac{m}{100}$ and $-( -x-1) = \frac{m}{100}$, or $-x = \frac{m}{100} + 1$ and $-x = -\frac{m}{100} - 1$, or $x = -\frac{m}{100} - 1$ and $x = \frac{m}{100} + 1$.

From the above analysis, we see that the solutions for $x$ in each case are:

1. $x = 3 + \frac{m}{100}$ and $x = 3 - \frac{m}{100}$.
2. $x = -\frac{m}{100} - 1$ and $x = \frac{m}{100} + 1$.
3. $x = -\frac{m}{100} - 1$ and $x = \frac{m}{100} + 1$.
4. $x = -\frac{m}{100} - 1$ and $x = \frac{m}{100} + 1$.

The solutions in each case are the same, so we can focus on one of them. For example, let's consider the solutions from case 1: $x = 3 + \frac{m}{100}$ and $x = 3 - \frac{m}{100}$. For these solutions to be distinct, we require that $3 + \frac{m}{100} \neq 3 - \frac{m}{100}$, which simplifies to $\frac{m}{100} \neq -\frac{m}{100}$. This is true for all $m$ except $m=0$. So, $m$ can be any positive integer.

Now, let's find the value of $m$ for which the solutions are integers. The solutions are integers when $\frac{m}{100}$ is an integer. The smallest positive integer value of $m$ that makes $\frac{m}{100}$ an integer is $m=100$. The next integer value of $m$ is $m=200$. Continuing this pattern, we find that the positive integer values of $m$ that make the solutions integers are $m=100n$ for $n=1,2,3,...$.

So, the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has 4 distinct integer solutions for $m=100n$, where $n$ is a positive integer.

To find the number of positive integer values of $m$ for which the equation has 4 distinct solutions, we need to find the number of positive integer values of $n$. Since $n$ can be any positive integer, there are infinitely many positive integer values of $n$. However, we are asked to find the number of positive integer values of $m$. Since $m=100n$, there are also infinitely many positive integer values of $m$.

However, the problem asks for the number of positive integers $m$ for which the equation has exactly 4 distinct solutions. From the analysis above, we see that the equation has 4 distinct solutions for all positive integer values of $m$. Therefore, there are infinitely many positive integers $m$ for which the equation has exactly 4 distinct solutions.

The problem statement seems to have a mistake. It should be asking for the number of positive integer values of $m$ for which the equation has exactly 4 distinct integer solutions. In this case, the equation has 4 distinct integer solutions for $m=100n$, where $n$ is a positive integer. So, the number of positive integer values of $m$ for which the equation has exactly 4 distinct integer solutions is the number of positive integer values of $n$, which is also infinite.

However, the problem asks for the number of positive integers $m$. From the analysis above, we see that the equation

The equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has 4 distinct solutions. This means that the right side of the equation, $\frac{m}{100}$, should be equal to 2. Thus, $m = 200$.

Now, we need to verify that $m = 200$ is indeed a positive integer. 

To do this, we can simply check if $m$ is a positive integer:

```python


INTERMEDIATE OUT :

def is_positive_integer(m):
    return m > 0 and m == int(m)

result = is_positive_integer(200)
print(result)
```

CODE RESULTS True

INTERMEDIATE OUT :
```output
True
```

The output is `True`, which means that $m = 200$ is a positive integer.

Therefore, the number of positive integers $m$ for which the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has 4 distinct solutions is 1. The answer is: $1$

Interesting, let's analyze step by step:



1. We are asked to find the number of positive integers $m$ for which the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has 4 distinct solutions.
2. We know that the right side of the equation is always positive, so the left side, $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert$, must also be positive. This means that $\vert x-1 \vert -2 > 0$, or $\vert x-1 \vert > 2$.
3. This inequality splits into two cases: $x-1 > 2$ or $x-1 < -2$. The first case gives $x > 3$, and the second case gives $x < -1$.
4. Now, let's consider the inner absolute value $\vert x-1 \vert$. This absolute value splits into two cases again: $x-1 > 0$ or $x-1 < 0$. The first case gives $x > 1$, and the second case gives $x < 1$.
5. We now have four possible ranges for $x$: $x > 3$, $1 < x < 3$, $-1 < x < 1$, and $x < -1$.
6. For each of these ranges, we can remove the absolute values from the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ and solve for $x$.
7. After solving for $x$ in each range, we find that the equation has 4 distinct solutions in the ranges $1 < x < 3$ and $-1 < x < 1$.
8. To find the corresponding values of $m$, we substitute the limits of these ranges into the equation and solve for $m$.
9. After calculating $m$ for both ranges, we find that the only positive integer values of $m$ are 200 and 300.
10. Therefore, there are 2 positive integers $m$ for which the equation has 4 distinct solutions.

Now, let's use sympy to verify our results:

```python


INTERMEDIATE OUT :

from sympy import symbols, Eq, solve, Abs

def find_m():
    x, m = symbols('x m')

    # Define the equation
    equation = Eq(Abs(Abs(x - 1) - 2), m / 100)

    # Find the solutions for each range of x
    solutions_positive = solve(equation.subs(x, 2), m)
    solutions_negative = solve(equation.subs(x, 0), m)

    # Return the positive integer solutions
    return [solution.evalf() for solution in solutions_positive + solutions_negative if solution.is_positive and solution.is_integer]

result = find_m()
print(result)
```

CODE RESULTS [100.000000000000, 100.000000000000]

INTERMEDIATE OUT :
```output
[100.000000000000, 100.000000000000]
```
The output is a list of two values, 100 and 100. These are the only positive integer values of $m$ for which the equation has 4 distinct solutions. Therefore, there are 2 positive integers $m$ that satisfy the condition.
The answer is: $2$

Interesting, let's analyze step by step:



The given equation is $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ and we want to find the number of positive integers $m$ such that this equation has 4 distinct solutions.

Let's first consider the right hand side of the equation, $\frac{m}{100}$. Since $m$ is a positive integer, $\frac{m}{100}$ is a positive rational number. The number of solutions of the equation depends on the value of $\frac{m}{100}$, so we need to find the values of $m$ for which the right hand side results in a value that gives 4 distinct solutions to the equation.

The number of solutions to the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ is 4 when $\frac{m}{100}=1$. This is because the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=1$ has four distinct solutions. So, $m=100$ is a solution.

Therefore, there is only one positive integer $m$ for which the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has 4 distinct solutions. The value of $m$ is 100.
The answer is: $1$

Interesting, let's analyze step by step:



We want to find the number of positive integers $m$ for which the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has $4$ distinct solutions.

Step 1: Simplify the equation

First, let's multiply both sides of the equation by $100$ to get rid of the fraction:
\[100 \cdot \vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert = m.\]
This simplifies to:
\[f(x) = 100 \cdot \vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert - m = 0.\]

Step 2: Analyze the equation

The function $f(x)$ has $4$ distinct solutions if and only if the graph of $y = f(x)$ intersects the $x$-axis at $4$ distinct points. This means that the function $f(x)$ changes sign $4$ times.

Step 3: Analyze the number of changes in sign

The function $f(x) = 100 \cdot \vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert - m$ changes sign when the expression inside the absolute value changes sign. This happens when $x-1 = 2$ or $x-1 = -2$, which gives $x = 3$ or $x = -1$.

The function $f(x)$ changes sign again when $\vert x-1 \vert -2 = 0$, which gives $\vert x-1 \vert = 2$, so $x-1 = 2$ or $x-1 = -2$, which gives $x = 3$ or $x = -1$.

So the function $f(x)$ changes sign at $x = -1$, $x = 1$, and $x = 3$. This means that for $f(x)$ to have $4$ distinct solutions, we need to choose $m$ such that $f(x)$ changes sign one more time.

Step 4: Find the value of $m$

The function $f(x)$ changes sign at $x = -1$, $x = 1$, and $x = 3$. This means that the value of $f(x)$ at $x = 0$ and $x = 2$ must have opposite signs.

For $x = 0$, we have $f(0) = 100 \cdot \vert \vert 0-1 \vert -2 \vert - m = 100 \cdot \vert -1 -2 \vert - m = 100 \cdot 3 - m = 300 - m$.

For $x = 2$, we have $f(2) = 100 \cdot \vert \vert 2-1 \vert -2 \vert - m = 100 \cdot \vert 1 -2 \vert - m = 100 \cdot 1 - m = 100 - m$.

For $f(x)$ to have $4$ distinct solutions, we need $f(0)$ and $f(2)$ to have opposite signs, which means $(300 - m)(100 - m) < 0$.

Solving this inequality gives $100 < m < 300$. The only positive integer in this range is $m = 200$.

Step 5: Verify the result

For $m = 200$, the equation becomes $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{200}{100} = 2$. This equation has $4$ distinct solutions: $x = -1$, $x = 1$, $x = 3$, and $x = 5$.

So the number of positive integers $m$ for which the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has $4$ distinct solutions is $1$. The only such positive integer is $m = 200$.

The answer is: $1$
