Interesting, let's analyze step by step:



The equation is $0$ if and only if at least one of the factors is $0$. Therefore, we have two cases to consider:

Case 1: $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$
This implies $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ or $\vert x - y \vert = 10$.

Case 2: $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$
This implies $\vert x \vert = 8$ or $\vert y \vert = 8$.

For Case 1, we have four lines: $x + y = 10$, $x + y = -10$, $x - y = 10$, and $x - y = -10$.
For Case 2, we have four lines: $x = 8$, $x = -8$, $y = 8$, and $y = -8$.

The intersection points of these lines are the vertices of the polygon. We can find these points by solving the systems of equations formed by the pairs of lines.

After finding the vertices, we can calculate the area of the polygon using the shoelace formula or by dividing the polygon into triangles and summing their areas.

The area of the polygon is 256 square units. The answer is: $256$

Interesting, let's analyze step by step:



The given equation is a product of two terms equal to zero, so either of the terms must be zero. This gives us two systems of equations to solve:

1. $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ and $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ and $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$.
2. $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$.

For the first system, we have:

1. $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ which implies $x + y = \pm 10$.
2. $\vert x \vert = 8$ which implies $x = \pm 8$.
3. $\vert y \vert = 8$ which implies $y = \pm 8$.

For the second system, we have:

4. $\vert x - y \vert = 10$ which implies $x - y = \pm 10$.

Now, we can find the intersection points of these lines:

1. $(8, 2)$ and $(8, -18)$.
2. $(-8, 2)$ and $(-8, -18)$.
3. $(18, 8)$ and $(-2, 8)$.

These points form a rectangle with side lengths 16 and 16, so its area is $16 \times 16 = 256$.

The area of the convex polygon is 256. The answer is: $256$

Interesting, let's analyze step by step:



1. The expression is equal to zero if either of the two factors is zero.
2. Therefore, we have two cases to consider:
   a. $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ and $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$
   b. $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ and $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$
3. For the first case, we have $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$.
   This implies that $x + y = \pm 10$ and $x - y = \pm 10$.
   Solving these equations gives us the vertices of the polygon:
   $(0, 10)$, $(0, -10)$, $(10, 0)$, $(-10, 0)$, $(8, 8)$, $(8, -8)$, $(-8, 8)$, and $(-8, -8)$.
4. For the second case, we have $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$.
   This implies that $x = \pm 8$ and $y = \pm 8$.
   Solving these equations gives us the same vertices as before.
5. To find the area of the polygon, we can use the Shoelace Formula.
   The Shoelace Formula states that if the vertices of a polygon are $(x_1, y_1), (x_2, y_2), \dots, (x_n, y_n)$,
   then the area of the polygon is given by $\frac{1}{2} \vert (x_1y_2 + x_2y_3 + \dots + x_ny_1) - (y_1x_2 + y_2x_3 + \dots + y_nx_1) \vert$.
6. Applying the Shoelace Formula to the vertices $(0, 10), (0, -10), (10, 0), (-10, 0), (8, 8), (8, -8), (-8, 8),$ and $(-8, -8)$,
   we get the area of the polygon as $\frac{1}{2} \vert (0 \cdot 10 + 0 \cdot 0 + 10 \cdot 0 + (-10) \cdot 0 + 8 \cdot 8 + 8 \cdot (-8) + (-8) \cdot 8 + (-8) \cdot (-8)) - (10 \cdot 0 + 0 \cdot (-10) + 0 \cdot 10 + 0 \cdot (-10) + 8 \cdot 8 + (-8) \cdot 8 + 8 \cdot (-8) + (-8) \cdot 8) \vert = \frac{1}{2} \vert 0 - 0 \vert = 0$.

However, the area of the polygon cannot be zero. There must be a mistake in our calculations.
Let's go back and re-examine the problem.

Upon closer inspection, we realize that the problem statement is incorrect.
The equation $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ implies that $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$,
which means that the polygon is a square with side length $20$.
Similarly, the equation $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ implies that $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$,
which means that the polygon is a square with side length $16$.
The two squares intersect at their centers, forming a smaller square with side length $8$.
The area of the convex polygon is the area of the larger square minus the area of the smaller square,
which is $20^2 - 8^2 = 400 - 64 = 336$.

The area of the convex polygon is 336 square units.

However, this is not a positive integer.

Interesting, let's analyze step by step:



The given equation is a product of two terms equal to zero. This means that either the first term is zero or the second term is zero. 

The first term is $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)$ and the second term is $((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2)$.

For the first term to be zero, we must have both $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. This implies that $x + y = \pm 10$ and $x - y = \pm 10$. Solving these equations gives us the vertices of the polygon.

For the second term to be zero, we must have both $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$. This implies that $x = \pm 8$ and $y = \pm 8$. Solving these equations gives us the vertices of the polygon.

Now, we need to find the vertices of the polygon and calculate the area.

The vertices of the polygon are:

1. $(10,0)$, $(0,10)$, $(-10,0)$, $(0,-10)$ from the equation $x + y = \pm 10$ and $x - y = \pm 10$.
2. $(8,0)$, $(0,8)$, $(-8,0)$, $(0,-8)$ from the equation $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$.

The polygon is a square with side length 16 (from the vertices $(8,0)$ to $(0,-8)$). The area of a square is side length squared, so the area of the polygon is $16^2 = 256$.

The answer is: $256$

The equation given is a product of two terms equal to zero. This means that either the first term is zero or the second term is zero. 

The first term is $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)$. This term equals zero if and only if both $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ and $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$. This happens if and only if $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$.

The second term is $((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2)$. This term equals zero if and only if both $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ and $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$. This happens if and only if $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$.

So the points that satisfy the equation are those that satisfy both $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$, and also $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$. 

The points that satisfy $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$ are the points of a square with side length 10, centered at the origin. The points that satisfy $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$ are the points of a square with side length 16, also centered at the origin.

The intersection of these two squares is the convex polygon we are looking for. This polygon is a square with side length 10, since the side length of the smaller square (10) is less than half the side length of the larger square (16).

The area of this square is side length squared, so the area is $10^2 = 100$.

Therefore, the area of the convex polygon is 100 square units.

The answer is: $100$

The first term is $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)$ and the second term is $((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2)$.

For the first term to be zero, both $\vert x + y \vert - 10 = 0$ and $\vert x - y \vert - 10 = 0$, which implies $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. This gives us four lines: $x + y = 10$, $x + y = -10$, $x - y = 10$, and $x - y = -10$.

For the second term to be zero, both $\vert x \vert - 8 = 0$ and $\vert y \vert - 8 = 0$, which implies $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$. This gives us four lines: $x = 8$, $x = -8$, $y = 8$, and $y = -8$.

The intersection of these lines forms a square with side length 10 (the distance from -10 to 10 on the x or y axis). The area of this square is $10^2 = 100$.

So the area of the convex polygon is 100. The answer is: $100$

Interesting, let's analyze step by step:



The equation is: $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$

This equation is equal to zero if and only if either of the two terms is equal to zero. This gives us two sets of equations to solve:

1. $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ and $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$
2. $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ and $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$

From the first set of equations, we get:

1. $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$

From the second set of equations, we get:

2. $\vert x - y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$

For both sets of equations, $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$ mean that $x$ and $y$ must be between -8 and 8.

Now, let's solve the absolute value equations:

For set 1, we have $\vert x + y \vert = 10$, which means $x + y = 10$ or $x + y = -10$. Similarly, for set 2, we have $\vert x - y \vert = 10$, which means $x - y = 10$ or $x - y = -10$.

These equations give us the following solutions:

For set 1:
- $x = 8, y = 2$
- $x = -8, y = -2$
- $x = 2, y = 8$
- $x = -2, y = -8$

For set 2:
- $x = 8, y = -2$
- $x = -8, y = 2$
- $x = 2, y = -8$
- $x = -2, y = 8$

All these solutions satisfy the conditions $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$. Therefore, the points that satisfy the equation are:

$(8, 2), (-8, -2), (2, 8), (-2, -8), (8, -2), (-8, 2), (2, -8), (-2, 8)$

These points form a square with side length 16. The area of the square is $16^2 = 256$.

So, the area of the convex polygon is 256 square units.

The answer is: $256$
