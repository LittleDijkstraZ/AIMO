Solve the following problem with a Python Script (positive numerical answer):
"For how many positive integers $m$ does the equation \[\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}\] have $4$ distinct solutions?"
Write comments to indicate the steps you take. Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Approach:


The equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has 4 distinct solutions if and only if $\frac{m}{100} = 2 - \frac{1}{2}$, because this is the only value for which the equation will have four solutions.

Steps:
1. We solve $\frac{m}{100} = 2 - \frac{1}{2}$ for $m$.

This gives us $\frac{m}{100} = \frac{3}{2}$.

2. Multiply both sides of the equation by $100$ to get rid of the fraction:

$m = \frac{3}{2} \times 100 = 150$.

So the only positive integer $m$ for which the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has four distinct solutions is $150$.

The answer is: $1$

Approach:

 The equation $| |x-1|-2|=\frac{m}{100}$ has 4 distinct solutions if and only if the number $\frac{m}{100}$ is in the interval $(0,2)$. This is because the expression $| |x-1|-2|$ can take on any value in the interval $[0,2]$ and only in this interval the equation has 4 distinct solutions. Therefore, we need to find the number of integers $m$ such that $0 < \frac{m}{100} < 2$, or equivalently, $0 < m < 200$.

Counting the number of positive integers in this interval, we find that there are $199$ such integers. Therefore, the number of positive integers $m$ for which the equation has 4 distinct solutions is $199$.

The solution is: 199.
The answer is: $199$

Approach:

 The number of distinct solutions to the equation \[\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}\] is equal to the number of times the function $f(x) = \vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert$ intersects the horizontal line $y = \frac{m}{100}$. We know that $f(x)$ takes the value $0$ at $x = 3$ and $x = -1$, and the value $2$ at $x = 1 \pm 2$. Therefore, the function $f(x)$ intersects the horizontal line $y = \frac{m}{100}$ at most four times if and only if $0 < \frac{m}{100} < 2$. This inequality simplifies to $0 < m < 200$. The number of positive integers $m$ in this range is $199$. However, we need to exclude the values of $m$ for which the equation has fewer than four distinct solutions. These occur when $\frac{m}{100} = 0$, $\frac{m}{100} = 2$, or when the line $y = \frac{m}{100}$ is tangent to the graph of $f(x)$. The value of $m$ for which $\frac{m}{100} = 2$ is $m = 200$, but this value is not in our range $0 < m < 200$. To find the values of $m$ for which the line $y = \frac{m}{100}$ is tangent to the graph of $f(x)$, we need to find the values of $m$ for which the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has exactly three distinct solutions. This occurs when $\frac{m}{100} = 1$, which gives $m = 100$. Therefore, the number of positive integers $m$ for which the equation has four distinct solutions is $199 - 1 = 198$. The answer is: $198$

The equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has 4 distinct solutions if $\frac{m}{100}$ is less than 2 but greater than 0.

This is because the function $f(x) = \vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert$ has a maximum value of 2 and a minimum value of 0. So for the equation to have 4 distinct solutions, $\frac{m}{100}$ must be in the range (0, 2).

If $\frac{m}{100}$ is less than 0 or greater than 2, the equation will have either 2 or 0 solutions.

To find the value of $m$, we need to solve the inequality $0 < \frac{m}{100} < 2$.

Multiplying all sides by 100, we get $0 < m < 200$.

Since $m$ is a positive integer, the number of possible values for $m$ is the number of integers from 1 to 199.

To find this number, we subtract the smallest value from the largest value and add 1: $199 - 1 + 1 = 199$.

So the number of positive integers $m$ for which the equation has 4 distinct solutions is 199.
The answer is: 199

Approach:



The equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has $4$ distinct solutions, if $\frac{m}{100}$ is less than $2$ but greater than or equal to $0$. This is because the expression inside the absolute value, $\vert x-1 \vert -2$, can change its sign twice when $x$ varies from negative infinity to positive infinity. The value of $\frac{m}{100}$ determines the number of times the function $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert$ changes its sign. If $\frac{m}{100}$ is $0$, the function changes its sign once. If $\frac{m}{100}$ is less than $2$ but greater than $0$, the function changes its sign twice. If $\frac{m}{100}$ is $2$ or more, the function changes its sign only once or does not change its sign at all.

Therefore, we have $0 \leq \frac{m}{100} < 2$. To satisfy this inequality, $m$ must be an integer between $0$ and $200$ (exclusive of $200$).

So, the number of positive integers $m$ that satisfy the condition is the number of positive integers from $1$ to $200$ (exclusive of $200$), which is $199$.

The answer is: $199$

Solve the following problem with a Python Script (positive numerical answer):
"For how many positive integers $m$ does the equation \[\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}\] have $4$ distinct solutions?"

The equation \[\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}\] has 4 distinct solutions means that the value of $\frac{m}{100}$ must be a number such that the expression inside the absolute value, $\vert x-1 \vert -2$, changes sign twice.

This happens when $\vert x-1 \vert -2 = 0$ or $\vert x-1 \vert -2 = \pm \frac{m}{100}$.

Solving $\vert x-1 \vert -2 = 0$ gives $\vert x-1 \vert = 2$, so $x-1 = \pm 2$, which gives $x = 3$ or $x = -1$.

For $\vert x-1 \vert -2 = \pm \frac{m}{100}$, we have two cases:

1. $\vert x-1 \vert -2 = \frac{m}{100}$: Solving this gives $\vert x-1 \vert = 2 + \frac{m}{100}$, so $x-1 = 2 + \frac{m}{100}$ or $x-1 = -2 - \frac{m}{100}$. This gives $x = 3 + \frac{m}{100}$ or $x = -1 - \frac{m}{100}$.

2. $\vert x-1 \vert -2 = -\frac{m}{100}$: Solving this gives $\vert x-1 \vert = 2 - \frac{m}{100}$, so $x-1 = 2 - \frac{m}{100}$ or $x-1 = -2 + \frac{m}{100}$. This gives $x = 3 - \frac{m}{100}$ or $x = -1 + \frac{m}{100}$.

For the four solutions to be distinct, we need the four values of $x$ to be different. This is true if the expressions inside the absolute value in each case are different:

- $3 + \frac{m}{100} \neq -1 - \frac{m}{100}$ and $3 + \frac{m}{100} \neq 3 - \frac{m}{100}$ and $-1 - \frac{m}{100} \neq -1 + \frac{m}{100}$ and $-1 - \frac{m}{100} \neq 3 - \frac{m}{100}$.

This simplifies to $2m \neq -100$, $2m \neq 0$, $2m \neq 100$, and $-4m \neq 100$, which are all true for $m > 0$.

So, the value of $\frac{m}{100}$ must be such that the expression inside the absolute value, $\vert x-1 \vert -2$, changes sign twice. This happens when $\frac{m}{100}$ is strictly between $1$ and $2$. In other words, $1 < \frac{m}{100} < 2$.

Multiplying all sides of the inequalities by $100$ gives $100 < m < 200$. The positive integers that satisfy this inequality are the integers from $101$ to $199$, inclusive. The number of such integers is $199 - 101 + 1 = 99$.

So, there are 99 positive integers $m$ for which the equation \[\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}\] has 4 distinct solutions. The answer is: $99$

We first look at the equation \[\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}\] and try to understand the number of solutions it has. The right side of the equation, $\frac{m}{100}$, is a positive constant. The left side, $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert$, is a piecewise function with four pieces: it's equal to $-(x-1)+2$ when $x<1$, $-(x-1)-2$ when $1\leq x<3$, $(x-1)-2$ when $3\leq x<5$, and $(x-1)+2$ when $x\geq 5$.

We can draw the graph of $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert$ and see that it consists of four segments, each of which is a line segment. The equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ will have 4 solutions when the height of the line segment, $\frac{m}{100}$, is between $1$ and $2$. This happens when $1\leq \frac{m}{100} < 2$, which is equivalent to $100\leq m < 200$. So the number of positive integers $m$ that satisfy this condition is $100$. The answer is: $100$

Approach:


We first need to understand that the absolute value function $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert$ creates a "V" shape graph with 3 segments.
The equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ will have 4 distinct solutions if $\frac{m}{100}$ is the height of the "V" shape graph that intersects the graph at 4 distinct points.
The maximum height of the "V" shape graph is 2, which occurs when $\frac{m}{100}=2$, giving $m=200$.
The minimum height of the "V" shape graph that allows for 4 distinct solutions is greater than 0 and less than 2.
This means $0<\frac{m}{100}<2$, giving $0<m<200$.
So the positive integers $m$ that satisfy the equation are the integers from 1 to 199.
The number of such positive integers is 199. The answer is: $199$
