Below is a math problem you are to solve (positive numerical answer!):
"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"
Analyze this problem and think step by step to come to a solution with programs. After solving the problem, output the final numerical answer within \boxed{}.

 The equation given is a product of two expressions equal to zero. This means that either one of the expressions is zero, or both are zero. 

The expressions are $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2$ and $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2$, and $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2$ and $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2$. 

For the first pair of expressions to be zero, either $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ or $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. This gives us the lines $x + y = 10$, $x + y = -10$, $x - y = 10$, and $x - y = -10$.

For the second pair of expressions to be zero, either $\vert x \vert = 8$ or $\vert y \vert = 8$. This gives us the lines $x = 8$, $x = -8$, $y = 8$, and $y = -8$.

The eight lines intersect at the vertices of a square with side length 10. The area of this square is $10^2 = 100$. So the area of the convex polygon is 100.

```python

    side_length = 10
    area = side_length ** 2
    return area

result = area_of_polygon()

The area of the convex polygon is $100$. The answer is: $100$.

"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"

 The given equation is equal to zero if and only if both of its factors are equal to zero. This gives us two sets of equations:
1. $|x+y| - 10 = 0$ and $|x-y| - 10 = 0$
2. $|x| - 8 = 0$ and $|y| - 8 = 0$

For the first set of equations, we have $|x+y| = 10$ and $|x-y| = 10$. This implies that $x+y = \pm 10$ and $x-y = \pm 10$. Solving these equations, we get the vertices of the polygon as $(0, 10), (0, -10), (10, 0), (-10, 0)$.

For the second set of equations, we have $|x| = 8$ and $|y| = 8$. This implies that $x = \pm 8$ and $y = \pm 8$. Solving these equations, we get the vertices of the polygon as $(8, 0), (-8, 0), (0, 8), (0, -8)$.

The polygon is a square with side length 10 (from the first set of equations) or a square with side length 16 (from the second set of equations). However, the side length of the square cannot be both 10 and 16 at the same time. This contradiction indicates that there might be an error in our analysis.

Let's re-examine the problem. The equation $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ implies that $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$, which means $x + y = \pm 10$ and $x - y = \pm 10$. Solving these equations, we get the vertices of the polygon as $(0, 10), (0, -10), (10, 0), (-10, 0)$.

The equation $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ implies that $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$, which means $x = \pm 8$ and $y = \pm 8$. Solving these equations, we get the vertices of the polygon as $(8, 0), (-8, 0), (0, 8), (0, -8)$.

Comparing the two sets of vertices, we see that they are the same. Therefore, the polygon is indeed a square with side length 10. The area of this square is $10^2 = 100$.

So the area of the convex polygon is 100. The answer is: $100$.

Below is a math problem you are to solve (positive numerical answer!):
"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"
Analyze this problem and think step by step to come to a solution with programs. After solving the problem, output the final numerical answer within \boxed{}.

 The equation given in the problem, $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$, implies that either $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$.
The first equation implies that $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$, which means $x + y = \pm 10$ and $x - y = \pm 10$. Solving these equations, we get the points $(5,5)$, $(5,-5)$, $(-5,5)$, and $(-5,-5)$.
The second equation implies that $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$, which means $x = \pm 8$ and $y = \pm 8$. Solving these equations, we get the points $(8,0)$, $(0,8)$, $(-8,0)$, and $(0,-8)$.
Plotting these points on a coordinate plane, we see that they form a square with side length $10$. The area of this square is $10^2 = 100$.
So, the area of the convex polygon is $100$. The answer is: $100$
