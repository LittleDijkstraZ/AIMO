Interesting, let's analyze step by step:



We need to find how many positive integers $m$ the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has 4 distinct solutions.

This problem can be tackled by a systematic approach involving the absolute value function, inequalities and the number of distinct solutions. Let's start by breaking down the absolute value expression.

The absolute value function can be rewritten as a piecewise function:

\[\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\begin{cases}
\vert x-1 \vert -2, & \text{if } \vert x-1 \vert \geq 2 \\
-( \vert x-1 \vert -2), & \text{if } \vert x-1 \vert < 2
\end{cases}\]

This simplifies to:

\[\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\begin{cases}
x-3, & \text{if } x \geq 3 \\
1, & \text{if } 1 \leq x < 3 \\
-(x-1)-2=-x-1, & \text{if } x < 1
\end{cases}\]

So, we have three cases to consider for the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$:

1. For $x \geq 3$, we have $x-3=\frac{m}{100}$, which gives $x=3+\frac{m}{100}$.
2. For $1 \leq x < 3$, we have $1=\frac{m}{100}$, which gives $m=100$.
3. For $x < 1$, we have $-x-1=\frac{m}{100}$, which gives $x=-1-\frac{m}{100}$.

For case 1, we need $x \geq 3$, which gives $3+\frac{m}{100} \geq 3$, so $\frac{m}{100} \geq 0$, which implies $m \geq 0$. But $m$ must be a positive integer, so the smallest possible value of $m$ is 100. Also, as $m$ increases, $x$ also increases, so we can find as many distinct solutions as we want. Therefore, the number of distinct solutions in this case is infinite.

For case 2, we have $m=100$, and the equation is satisfied for $x \in [1,3)$, so there is only one distinct solution in this case.

For case 3, we need $x < 1$, which gives $-1-\frac{m}{100} < 1$, so $\frac{m}{100} > -2$, which implies $m > -200$. But $m$ must be a positive integer, so the smallest possible value of $m$ is 1. Also, as $m$ increases, $x$ decreases, so we can find as many distinct solutions as we want. Therefore, the number of distinct solutions in this case is infinite.

In summary, the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has exactly one distinct solution for $m=100$, and infinite distinct solutions for both $m > 100$ and $m < 100$. So the only value of $m$ for which the equation has exactly 4 distinct solutions is $m=100$. As $100$ is a positive integer, the answer is $\boxed{1}$.
The answer is: $1$

Interesting, let's analyze step by step:



The equation $|\vert x-1 \vert -2|=\frac{m}{100}$ has 4 distinct solutions, and we need to find the value of $m$.

The equation inside the absolute value, $|\vert x-1 \vert -2|$, can be equal to $\frac{m}{100}$ or $-\frac{m}{100}$. This gives us two equations:

1. $|\vert x-1 \vert -2|=\frac{m}{100}$.
2. $|\vert x-1 \vert -2|=-\frac{m}{100}$.

Now, let's solve these two equations separately.

For equation 1: $|\vert x-1 \vert -2|=\frac{m}{100}$, the absolute value can be broken into two cases:

Case 1: $\vert x-1 \vert -2=\frac{m}{100}$.

Case 2: $\vert x-1 \vert -2=-\frac{m}{100}$.

For equation 2: $|\vert x-1 \vert -2|=-\frac{m}{100}$, this equation has no solution because the left side of the equation is always non-negative while the right side is always negative.

So, we only need to solve equation 1.

Case 1: $\vert x-1 \vert -2=\frac{m}{100}$.
This gives us two more equations:

1.1. $x-1 -2=\frac{m}{100}$, which simplifies to $x-3=\frac{m}{100}$.

1.2. $-(x-1) -2=\frac{m}{100}$, which simplifies to $-x+1-2=\frac{m}{100}$, or $-x-1=\frac{m}{100}$.

Now, let's solve these two equations separately.

For equation 1.1: $x-3=\frac{m}{100}$, we get $x=\frac{m}{100}+3$.

For equation 1.2: $-x-1=\frac{m}{100}$, we get $x=-1-\frac{m}{100}$.

Now, for a solution to be distinct, the two solutions from equations 1.1 and 1.2 must be different. This gives us the equation:

\[\frac{m}{100}+3 \neq -1-\frac{m}{100}.\]

Solving this equation gives:

\[2=\frac{2m}{100},\]

which simplifies to $m=100$.

Now, let's check if $m=100$ is a valid solution. If we substitute $m=100$ into the original equation, we get:

\[|\vert x-1 \vert -2|=\frac{100}{100}=1.\]

This gives us two more equations:

2.1. $\vert x-1 \vert -2=1$.
2.2. $\vert x-1 \vert -2=-1$.

For equation 2.1: $\vert x-1 \vert -2=1$, we get $\vert x-1 \vert =3$. This gives us two solutions: $x=4$ and $x=-2$.

For equation 2.2: $\vert x-1 \vert -2=-1$, we get $\vert x-1 \vert =1$. This gives us two solutions: $x=2$ and $x=0$.

So, for $m=100$, the equation has 4 distinct solutions: $x=4$, $x=-2$, $x=2$, and $x=0$.

Therefore, the number of positive integers $m$ for which the equation has 4 distinct solutions is 1, and that integer is $m=100$.

The answer is: $1$

Interesting, let's analyze step by step:


1. The equation is $| |x-1|-2|=\frac{m}{100}$.
2. We want this equation to have four distinct solutions. This means that the right-hand side, $\frac{m}{100}$, must be equal to either $2$ or $1$. If it's equal to $2$, then the left-hand side becomes either $0$ or $4$, which means that $|x-1|$ equals either $2$ or $6$. This gives us two possible solutions for $x$: $x=3$ or $x=-1$. If it's equal to $1$, then the left-hand side becomes either $1$ or $3$, which means that $|x-1|$ equals either $3$ or $1$. This gives us two more possible solutions for $x$: $x=4$ or $x=0$.
3. So, for the equation to have four distinct solutions, $\frac{m}{100}$ must be equal to $1$ or $2$. Therefore, $m$ must be equal to $100$, $200$. We can easily verify that these values of $m$ satisfy the conditions.
4. Thus, there are $2$ possible values of $m$ that make the equation have four distinct solutions. The answer is $2$. The value $m=2$ is a positive integer. The value of $m$ that makes the equation have four distinct solutions is 2. Hence, the output is $\boxed{2}$. The value $m=1$ is also a positive integer, but we are asked for the number of positive integers $m$ that satisfy the conditions, so we only consider $m=2$. Thus, the output is $2$.

Assistant:

Interesting, let's analyze step by step:



1. We have the equation $| |x - 1| - 2| = \frac{m}{100}$, and we want this equation to have 4 distinct solutions.
2. In order to have 4 distinct solutions, the right side of the equation, $\frac{m}{100}$, must be equal to 2.

Solving the equation:

3. We start by setting $\frac{m}{100} = 2$.
4. Then we can multiply both sides by 100 to get $m = 200$.

We found that $m = 200$ makes the equation $| |x - 1| - 2| = \frac{m}{100}$ have 4 distinct solutions. However, we need to verify that this value of $m$ indeed produces 4 distinct solutions.

5. Substitute $m = 200$ into the equation and we get $| |x - 1| - 2| = 2$.
6. Now, we solve this equation step by step:
   - First, we solve $|x - 1| - 2 = 2$. This gives us $|x - 1| = 4$.
   - The two cases are:
     - $x - 1 = 4$ which gives $x = 5$.
     - $x - 1 = -4$ which gives $x = -3$.
   - Second, we solve $|x - 1| - 2 = -2$. This gives us $|x - 1| = 0$, and the only solution is $x = 1$.
7. In total, we have found 3 distinct solutions: $x = -3, 1, 5$. So, the value of $m = 200$ does not produce 4 distinct solutions.

Let's try another value of $m$.

8. If we set $\frac{m}{100} = 1$, then $m = 100$.
9. Substitute $m = 100$ into the equation and we get $| |x - 1| - 2| = 1$.
10. Now, we solve this equation step by step:
   - First, we solve $|x - 1| - 2 = 1$. This gives us $|x - 1| = 3$.
   - The two cases are:
     - $x - 1 = 3$ which gives $x = 4$.
     - $x - 1 = -3$ which gives $x = -2$.
   - Second, we solve $|x - 1| - 2 = -1$. This gives us $|x - 1| = 1$, and the solutions are $x = 0$ and $x = 2$.
11. In total, we have found 4 distinct solutions: $x = -2, 0, 1, 2, 4$. So, the value of $m = 100$ produces 4 distinct solutions.

Therefore, the value of $m$ that makes the equation $| |x - 1| - 2| = \frac{m}{100}$ have 4 distinct solutions is $m = 100$. Since 100 is a positive integer, our solution is correct. The answer is: $1$

Interesting, let's analyze step by step:



Let's define the absolute value function as `abs` in sympy. The symbol `m` will represent the number of distinct solutions.

The problem requires us to find how many positive integer values of `m` make the equation $| |x - 1| - 2| = \frac{m}{100}$ have 4 distinct solutions.

Step 1: Determine the possible values of $m$.
The equation $| |x - 1| - 2| = \frac{m}{100}$ has 4 distinct solutions, so $| |x - 1| - 2| = c$ (where $c = \frac{m}{100}$) should have the following four roots: $1 - 2 + c$, $1 - 2 - c$, $1 + 2 - c$, and $1 + 2 + c$. These roots should be distinct.

The four roots can be simplified as follows:
$1 - 2 + c = -1 + c$,
$1 - 2 - c = -1 - c$,
$1 + 2 - c = 3 - c$, and
$1 + 2 + c = 3 + c$.

For the roots to be distinct, the following conditions must hold:
$-1 + c \neq -1 - c$,
$-1 + c \neq 3 - c$,
$-1 - c \neq 3 - c$, and
$-1 - c \neq 3 + c$.

These conditions simplify to:
$2c \neq 2$,
$2c \neq 4$,
$2c \neq 4$, and
$2c \neq 2$.

From these conditions, we can conclude that $c = 1$. Therefore, $m = 100c = 100 \cdot 1 = 100$.

Step 2: Check if the value of `m` is a positive integer.
Since `m` equals 100, it is a positive integer.

Step 3: Output the result.
The number of positive integers `m` that satisfy the equation $| |x - 1| - 2| = \frac{m}{100}$ having 4 distinct solutions is 1. Therefore, the value of `m` is 100.
The value of `m` is a positive integer.

Therefore, the number of positive integers `m` is 1.
The answer is: $1$
