  * Implement these functions step-by-step, commenting each line for clarity.

Interesting, let's analyze step by step:


The expression $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ can only be true if $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$ or if $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$.
This implies that the points must satisfy either $x + y = 10$ and $x - y = 10$ or $x = \pm 8$ and $y = \pm 8$.
Solving the first set of equations gives $x = 5$ and $y = -5$, and the second set gives $x = \pm 8$ and $y = \pm 8$.
These points form a square with side length 10, so the area of the square is $10^2 = 100$.
The value of the area of the convex polygon is 100.
The answer is: 100

Interesting, let's analyze step by step:



1. The problem is asking for the area of a polygon. It states that the polygon is formed by the points $(x, y)$ satisfying the equation $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$. 

2. This equation equals zero if either of the two factors equals zero. 

3. The first factor equals zero if either $(\vert x + y \vert - 10) = 0$ or $(\vert x - y \vert - 10) = 0$, which means $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ or $\vert x - y \vert = 10$.

4. The second factor equals zero if either $(\vert x \vert - 8) = 0$ or $(\vert y \vert - 8) = 0$, which means $\vert x \vert = 8$ or $\vert y \vert = 8$.

5. Solving these equations for the absolute values gives us the following four lines: $x + y = 10$, $x + y = -10$, $x - y = 10$, and $x - y = -10$. Combined with the four lines $x = 8$, $x = -8$, $y = 8$, and $y = -8$, we get a total of eight lines.

6. These lines form a square with side length 10. To find its area, we simply square the side length, so the area is $10^2 = 100$.

So, the area of the polygon is 100. Let's put the answer in a box:

The answer is $\boxed{100}$.

Interesting, let's analyze step by step:



$(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0 \Rightarrow \vert x + y \vert = 10, \vert x - y \vert = 10$

From the above two equations, it follows that:

1) For the case $\vert x + y \vert = 10$, $x + y = 10$ or $x + y = -10$.

2) For the case $\vert x - y \vert = 10$, $x - y = 10$ or $x - y = -10$.

Combining the four equations we get four possible lines:

a) $x + y = 10$
b) $x + y = -10$
c) $x - y = 10$
d) $x - y = -10$

And also:

$(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0 \Rightarrow \vert x \vert = 8, \vert y \vert = 8$

So we have:

e) $x = 8$
f) $x = -8$
g) $y = 8$
h) $y = -8$

The convex polygon is formed by the intersection of these lines. It's a square with side length 16. The area of this square is $16^2 = 256$. Therefore, the area of the polygon is 256.

```python

    # Side length of the square
    side_length = 16

    # Area of the square
    area = side_length**2

    return area

result = area_of_polygon()
print(result)

The area of the convex polygon is $256$.

Interesting, let's analyze step by step:



First, notice that the product of two numbers is zero if and only if at least one of the numbers is zero. That is, if $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2) = 0$ or $((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$.

The first equation $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ implies that $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. That is, $x + y = \pm 10$ and $x - y = \pm 10$, which results in the lines $x + y = 10$, $x + y = -10$, $x - y = 10$, and $x - y = -10$.

The second equation $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ implies that $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$, which results in the lines $x = 8$, $x = -8$, $y = 8$, and $y = -8$.

Now, we need to find the intersection points of these lines. There are 9 intersection points: (8,8), (8,-8), (-8,8), (-8,-8), (10,0), (-10,0), (0,10), (0,-10), and (0,0).

Finally, we calculate the area of the polygon formed by these points. It is a square with side length 16, so its area is $16^2 = 256$. The answer is: $256$.
The answer is: $256$

"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"

Interesting, let's analyze step by step:



If a product of two factors is zero, then at least one of the factors must be zero. So, either $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$.

This gives us four conditions:
1. $\vert x + y \vert = 10$,
2. $\vert x - y \vert = 10$,
3. $\vert x \vert = 8$, and
4. $\vert y \vert = 8$.

Solving these four conditions gives us the vertices of the polygon:

1. From $\vert x + y \vert = 10$, we have $x + y = 10$ or $x + y = -10$. This gives us two pairs of points: $(8, 2)$ and $(8, -18)$.
2. From $\vert x - y \vert = 10$, we have $x - y = 10$ or $x - y = -10$. This gives us two more pairs of points: $(18, -8)$ and $(-2, -8)$.
3. From $\vert x \vert = 8$, we have $x = 8$ or $x = -8$. This gives us two pairs of points: $(8, 2)$ and $(-8, 2)$.
4. From $\vert y \vert = 8$, we have $y = 8$ or $y = -8$. This gives us two more pairs of points: $(8, -18)$ and $(8, 18)$.

Now we can plot these points and observe the vertices of the polygon: $(8, 2)$, $(8, -18)$, $(18, -8)$, $(-2, -8)$, $(-8, 2)$, and $(8, 18)$.

To find the area of this polygon, we can use the shoelace formula: If the vertices of the polygon are $(x_1, y_1), (x_2, y_2), \dots, (x_n, y_n)$, then the area is given by
$$\frac{1}{2} \vert (x_1y_2 + x_2y_3 + \dots + x_ny_1) - (y_1x_2 + y_2x_3 + \dots + y_nx_1) \vert.$$

For our polygon, we have:
$$\text{Area} = \frac{1}{2} \vert (8 \cdot 2 + 8 \cdot (-18) + 18 \cdot (-8) + (-2) \cdot (-8) + (-8) \cdot 2 + 8 \cdot 18) - (2 \cdot 8 + (-18) \cdot 8 + (-8) \cdot 18 + (-8) \cdot (-2) + 2 \cdot (-8) + 18 \cdot 8) \vert.$$

Calculating this gives us:
$$\text{Area} = \frac{1}{2} \vert (16 - 144 - 144 + 16 - 16 + 144) - (16 - 144 - 144 + 16 + 16 - 144) \vert = \frac{1}{2} \vert (-240) - (-240) \vert = \frac{1}{2} \cdot 0 = 0.$$

However, this result is not correct as the area should be a positive value. It seems we have made a mistake in our calculations. Let's go back and check our work.

Upon revisiting our calculations, we realize that the problem statement specifies that the points enclose a convex polygon, which means the area must be positive. Let's reconsider the conditions:

1. From $\vert x + y \vert = 10$, we have $x + y = 10$ or $x + y = -10$. This gives us two pairs of points: $(8, 2)$ and $(8, -18)$.
2. From $\vert x - y \vert = 10$, we have $x - y = 10$ or $x - y = -10$. This gives us two more pairs of points: $(18, -8)$ and $(-2, -8)$.
3. From $\vert x \vert = 8$, we have $x = 8$ or $x = -8$. This gives us two pairs of points: $(8, 2)$ and $(-8, 2)$.
4. From $\vert y \vert = 8$, we have $y = 8$ or $y = -8$. This gives us two more pairs of points: $(8, -18)$ and $(8, 18)$.

Now, let's plot these points again and observe the vertices of the polygon: $(8, 2)$, $(8, -18)$, $(18, -8)$, $(-2, -8)$, $(-8, 2)$, and $(8, 18)$.

We can now apply the shoelace formula to find the area of the polygon:
$$\text{Area} = \frac{1}{2} \vert (8 \cdot 2 + 8 \cdot (-18) + 18 \cdot (-8) + (-2) \cdot (-8) + (-8) \cdot 2 + 8 \cdot 18) - (2 \cdot 8 + (-18) \cdot 8 + (-8) \cdot 18 + (-8) \cdot (-2) + 2 \cdot (-8) + 18 \cdot 8) \vert.$$

Calculating this gives us:
$$\text{Area} = \frac{1}{2} \vert (16 - 144 - 144 + 16 - 16 + 144) - (16 - 144 - 144 + 16 + 16 - 144) \vert = \frac{1}{2} \vert (-240) - (-240) \vert = \frac{1}{2} \cdot 0 = 0.$$

Again, we realize that our mistake was in the final calculation. The shoelace formula gives us the signed area of the polygon. Since the points form a convex polygon, the area should be positive. However, we calculated the absolute value of the difference of the sums, which resulted in 0. This means our calculation is incorrect.

Let's reconsider the shoelace formula:
$$\text{Area} = \frac{1}{2} \vert (x_1y_2 + x_2y_3 + \dots + x_ny_1) - (y_1x_2 + y_2x_3 + \dots + y_nx_1) \vert.$$

Since the polygon is convex, we should take the positive difference of the
