To find the number of positive integers $m$ for which the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has $4$ distinct solutions, we first need to understand the behavior of the function $f(x) = \vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert$.

The function $f(x)$ is a "bump" function that takes the value $0$ at $x=3$ and $x=-1$, and a value of $2$ everywhere else. This means that the equation $f(x) = \frac{m}{100}$ will have four distinct solutions if $\frac{m}{100} = 2$, i.e., $m = 200$.

Therefore, the number of positive integers $m$ for which the equation has four distinct solutions is $1$.
The answer is: $1$

Solve the following problem with a Python Script (positive numerical answer):
"For how many positive integers $m$ does the equation \[\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}\] have $4$ distinct solutions?"

Approach:

 The equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has 4 distinct solutions, it means that the expression inside the absolute value, $\vert x-1 \vert -2$, changes its sign twice as $x$ varies over the real line. This implies that the value of $\vert x-1 \vert -2$ changes from negative to positive or positive to negative twice as $x$ varies over the real line.

Now, consider the function $f(x) = \vert x-1 \vert -2$. This function is equal to $(1-x) -2 = -x -1$ when $x<1$, equal to $(x-1) -2 = x-3$ when $1 \leq x <3$, and equal to $-(x-1) -2 = -x+3$ when $x \geq 3$.

So, $f(x)$ changes its sign at $x=1$ and $x=3$. This means that for the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ to have 4 distinct solutions, the value of $\frac{m}{100}$ must be equal to the distance between these two points, which is $3-1=2$. Thus, $m=200$.

Therefore, there is only one positive integer $m$ such that the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has 4 distinct solutions, and that is $m=200$.
The answer is: $1$

For the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ to have 4 distinct solutions, $\frac{m}{100}$ must be positive and less than 2. The reason is that if $\frac{m}{100}$ is equal to or greater than 2, the equation would only have 2 or 1 distinct solutions. Therefore, we have $0 < \frac{m}{100} < 2$.

This inequality simplifies to $0 < m < 200$. Since $m$ is a positive integer, the possible values of $m$ are the integers from 1 to 199.

To count the number of these integers, we subtract the smallest value from the largest value and add 1. This gives us $199 - 1 + 1 = 199$.

However, this count includes all positive integers less than or equal to 200. Since $m$ cannot be 200, we must subtract 1 from this count.

So the number of positive integers $m$ for which the equation has 4 distinct solutions is $199 - 1 = 198$.
The answer is: 198

The equation $| |x - 1| - 2| = \frac{m}{100}$ has 4 distinct solutions if and only if $\frac{m}{100} = 2 - \epsilon$, where $\epsilon$ is a small positive number. This is because the expression $| |x - 1| - 2|$ is equal to 2 minus a small positive number in the middle of the four distinct solutions.

To find the value of $m$, we set $\frac{m}{100} = 2 - \epsilon$ and solve for $m$.

We have: $m = 100(2 - \epsilon) = 200 - 100\epsilon$.

Since $\epsilon$ is a small positive number, we can say that $\epsilon$ is close to 0. Therefore, the value of $m$ is close to 200. However, $m$ must be a positive integer, so we can conclude that $m = 200$.

Now, we need to find the number of positive integers $m$ such that the equation has 4 distinct solutions. Since there is only one value of $m$ that satisfies this condition, namely $m = 200$, the number of positive integers $m$ that satisfy the condition is 1.
The answer is: 1

Approach:



The equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has 4 distinct solutions if and only if $\frac{m}{100}$ is between 1 and 2. This is because the expression inside the absolute value, $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert$, can take on any value between 1 and 2, and the number of solutions will correspond to how many times this value is hit.

Therefore, we need to find the number of positive integers $m$ such that $1 \leq \frac{m}{100} < 2$. Multiplying all parts of the inequality by 100 gives $100 \leq m < 200$. The positive integers $m$ in this range are exactly the integers from 100 to 199, inclusive. To find the number of these integers, we subtract the smallest integer from the largest and add 1. So the number of positive integers $m$ for which the equation has 4 distinct solutions is $199 - 100 + 1 = 100$.

So the number of positive integers $m$ for which the equation has 4 distinct solutions is 100.

The answer is: $100$.

Approach:



For the equation $| |x-1| - 2 | = \frac{m}{100}$ to have 4 distinct solutions, the value of $\frac{m}{100}$ must be such that the graph of $| |x-1| - 2 |$ intersects the line $y = \frac{m}{100}$ at 4 distinct points.

The graph of $| |x-1| - 2 |$ is a "V" shape with the bottom of the "V" at $(1, 2)$. The "V" opens upwards, with the slope of the two sides being $\pm 1$.

For the line $y = \frac{m}{100}$ to intersect this graph at 4 distinct points, $\frac{m}{100}$ must be greater than 2 but less than the height of the "V" at its tip. The tip of the "V" is at a height of 2 + 1 = 3, so $2 < \frac{m}{100} < 3$. Multiplying all sides of the inequality by 100 gives $200 < m < 300$.

The positive integers $m$ that satisfy this inequality are the integers from 201 to 299, inclusive. To find the number of these integers, we subtract the smallest integer from the largest and add 1. So, the number of positive integers $m$ for which the equation has 4 distinct solutions is $299 - 201 + 1 = 99$.
The answer is: 99

Approach:


The equation $| |x-1|-2|=\frac{m}{100}$ has four distinct solutions if and only if $\frac{m}{100}$ is between $0$ and $2$. This is because $| |x-1|-2|$ is a "hump" function that attains all values from $0$ to $2$.
So, we need to find the number of positive integers $m$ such that $0 < \frac{m}{100} < 2$. Multiplying all parts of the inequality by $100$ gives $0 < m < 200$. The number of positive integers in this range is $200-1 = 199$. But this count includes $m=0$ and $m=200$, so we need to subtract these out. Thus, the number of positive integers $m$ for which the equation has four distinct solutions is $199 - 2 = 197$.
The answer is: $197$.

Approach:


The equation $| |x-1| - 2 | = \frac{m}{100}$ has four distinct solutions if and only if the number $\frac{m}{100}$ is strictly between $1$ and $2$. This is because the expression on the left side of the equation, $| |x-1| - 2 |$, can take on any value from $0$ to $3$ (inclusive), and it equals to $\frac{m}{100}$ exactly when it falls into the interval $(1, 2)$. Therefore, we need to find the number of positive integers $m$ such that $1 < \frac{m}{100} < 2$.

Solution:
Multiplying all sides of the inequalities by $100$ gives $100 < m < 200$. The number of positive integers in this interval is $200 - 100 - 1 = 99$. So, there are $99$ positive integers $m$ for which the equation has four distinct solutions. The answer is: $99$

First, let's rewrite the equation \[\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}\] as \[\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}\]

The equation \[\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}\] will have 4 distinct solutions if and only if $\frac{m}{100}$ is strictly between 1 and 2. Therefore, we have $1<\frac{m}{100}<2$, which implies $100<m<200$. The positive integers $m$ that satisfy this inequality are the integers from 101 to 199, inclusive. The number of these integers is $199-101+1=100$. Therefore, the number of positive integers $m$ for which the equation \[\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}\] has 4 distinct solutions is 100.

The answer is: $100$.

Assistant:

Approach:

 The problem asks for the number of positive integers $m$ such that the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has exactly 4 distinct solutions. We can start by analyzing the structure of the equation. The equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ involves an absolute value of an absolute value, which can result in a piecewise function with four pieces. Each piece of the piecewise function corresponds to a range of values for $m$ that gives rise to a specific number of solutions to the equation.

By analyzing the piecewise function, we can determine that the equation has 4 distinct solutions when $0 < m < 4$. Therefore, the problem reduces to finding the number of positive integers $m$ in the interval $(0, 4)$.

The only positive integer in the interval $(0, 4)$ is $1$. Therefore, there is only one positive integer $m$ for which the equation has 4 distinct solutions. The answer is: $1$
