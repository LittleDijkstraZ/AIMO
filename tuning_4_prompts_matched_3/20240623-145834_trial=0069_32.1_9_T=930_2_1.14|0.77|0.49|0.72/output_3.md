Question (hint: positive numerical answer):
"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"
Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:


The product of two numbers is zero if and only if at least one of the numbers is zero. Therefore, we have two cases to consider:

Case 1: $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$.
For this to be true, we must have $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. This gives us four equations:
1) $x + y = 10$,
2) $x + y = -10$,
3) $x - y = 10$, and
4) $x - y = -10$.
Solving these equations, we get the vertices of the polygon: $(5,5)$, $(5,-5)$, $(-5,5)$, and $(-5,-5)$.

Case 2: $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$.
For this to be true, we must have $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$. This gives us four more vertices: $(8,0)$, $(-8,0)$, $(0,8)$, and $(0,-8)$.

Now, we can draw a rectangle with vertices at $(5,5)$, $(5,-5)$, $(-5,5)$, and $(-5,-5)$, and another rectangle with vertices at $(8,0)$, $(-8,0)$, $(0,8)$, and $(0,-8)$. The intersection of these two rectangles forms a square with side length 5. The area of this square is $5^2 = 25$.
The answer is: $25$

Question (hint: positive numerical answer):
"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"
Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:


The product of two numbers is zero if and only if at least one of the numbers is zero. Therefore, the equation
$$((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$$
implies that either $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$.
If $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$, then $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$, which means $x + y = \pm 10$ and $x - y = \pm 10$. Solving these equations gives $x = \pm 5$ and $y = \pm 5$.
If $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$, then $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$, which means $x = \pm 8$ and $y = \pm 8$.
Therefore, the points that satisfy the equation are the vertices of a square with side length 10, which has side length 16. The area of this square is $10^2 = 100$. The answer is: $100$

Question (hint: positive numerical answer):
"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"
Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:


The equation given is a product of two expressions equal to zero, so either the first expression is zero or the second expression is zero.

The first expression is $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)$. This expression is zero if and only if both $(\vert x + y \vert - 10) = 0$ and $(\vert x - y \vert - 10) = 0$. This implies that $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. The solutions to these equations are the lines $x + y = \pm 10$ and $x - y = \pm 10$.

The second expression is $((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2)$. This expression is zero if and only if both $(\vert x \vert - 8) = 0$ and $(\vert y \vert - 8) = 0$. This implies that $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$. The solutions to these equations are the lines $x = \pm 8$ and $y = \pm 8$.

The intersection points of these lines are $(8, 8)$, $(-8, 8)$, $(8, -8)$, and $(-8, -8)$. These points form a square with side length 16. The area of this square is $16^2 = 256$. So the area of the convex polygon is 256 square units. The answer is: $256$

Question (hint: positive numerical answer):
"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"
Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:



First, let's analyze the equation given:
\[((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0.\]

For the product of two factors to be zero, either one of the factors must be zero. This gives us two equations:
\[(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0,\]
\[(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0.\]

The first equation implies that both $\vert x + y \vert - 10 = 0$ and $\vert x - y \vert - 10 = 0$, which means $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. This gives us a square with side length 10, centered at the origin.

The second equation implies that both $\vert x \vert - 8 = 0$ and $\vert y \vert - 8 = 0$, which means $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$. This gives us a square with side length 16, centered at the origin.

The intersection of these two squares is the convex polygon we are looking for. The side length of this polygon is the smaller side length, which is 10. The area of a square with side length $s$ is $s^2$, so the area of the convex polygon is $10^2 = 100$.

The answer is: $100$

Question (hint: positive numerical answer):
"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"
Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:


The expression $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ is equal to zero if either of the two factors is equal to zero.
For the first factor to be zero, we must have $\vert x + y \vert - 10 = 0$ and $\vert x - y \vert - 10 = 0$, which implies $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$.
This means that $x + y = \pm 10$ and $x - y = \pm 10$.
Solving these equations, we find that the points $(x, y)$ that satisfy these conditions are $(10, 0)$, $(-10, 0)$, $(0, 10)$, and $(0, -10)$.
For the second factor to be zero, we must have $\vert x \vert - 8 = 0$ and $\vert y \vert - 8 = 0$, which implies $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$.
This means that $x = \pm 8$ and $y = \pm 8$.
Solving these equations, we find that the points $(x, y)$ that satisfy these conditions are $(8, 0)$, $(-8, 0)$, $(0, 8)$, and $(0, -8)$.
Combining the points from both factors, we find that the convex polygon is a square with side length 10.
The area of a square is given by side length squared, so the area of this square is $10^2 = 100$. The answer is: $100$

Question (hint: positive numerical answer):
"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"
Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:


The product of two numbers is zero if and only if at least one of the numbers is zero. Therefore, the equation $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ is satisfied if and only if either $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$.
The first equation is satisfied if and only if $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. These are the equations of two lines, $x + y = 10$ and $x - y = 10$, and their reflections across the coordinate axes. The four lines form a square with side length 10 and area $10^2 = 100$.
The second equation is satisfied if and only if $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$. These are the equations of two lines, $x = 8$ and $x = -8$, and their reflections across the coordinate axes, and two more lines, $y = 8$ and $y = -8$, and their reflections across the coordinate axes. The eight lines form a square with side length 16 and area $16^2 = 256$.
However, the intersection of the two squares is the line $x + y = 10$ and $x - y = 10$, which is a single point $(5,5)$. Therefore, the two squares only share a single point, and the area of the convex polygon enclosed by the points satisfying the equation is the area of the larger square, which is 256 square units.
The answer is: $256$

Question (hint: positive numerical answer):
"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"
Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:


The equation is equal to zero if either of the two factors are equal to zero. This gives us two sets of equations to solve:
1) $|x + y| - 10 = 0$ and $|x| - 8 = 0$, $|y| - 8 = 0$.
2) $|x - y| - 10 = 0$ and $|x| - 8 = 0$, $|y| - 8 = 0$.
From the first set of equations, we have $|x + y| = 10$, $|x| = 8$, and $|y| = 8$.
This gives us four possible combinations: $(x, y) = (8, 2), (8, -2), (-8, 2), (-8, -2)$.
From the second set of equations, we have $|x - y| = 10$, $|x| = 8$, and $|y| = 8$.
This gives us four more possible combinations: $(x, y) = (2, 8), (2, -8), (-2, 8), (-2, -8)$.
So the eight points are: $(8, 2), (8, -2), (-8, 2), (-8, -2), (2, 8), (2, -8), (-2, 8), (-2, -8)$.
These points form a square with side length 16. The area of the square is $16^2 = 256$. The answer is: $\boxed{256}$.

Question (hint: positive numerical answer):
"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"
Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:


The equation $AB=0$ is satisfied if and only if at least one of the factors $A$ or $B$ is equal to zero. So, the given equation is satisfied if and only if at least one of the following conditions holds:
(1) $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$,
(2) $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$.

From condition (1), we have $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. This gives us four lines: $x + y = \pm 10$ and $x - y = \pm 10$.
From condition (2), we have $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$, which gives us four lines: $x = \pm 8$ and $y = \pm 8$.

The lines $x + y = \pm 10$, $x - y = \pm 10$, $x = \pm 8$, and $y = \pm 8$ form a square with side length 16. The area of this square is $16^2 = 256$. So, the area of the convex polygon is 256 square units. The answer is: $256$
