Question (hint: positive numerical answer):
"What is the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ when $x$ and $y$ range over all real numbers such that $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$?"
Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:


We start by noting that $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$ can be rewritten as $|2y-x| + |2x-y| = 40$.
By the triangle inequality, we have $|2y-x| + |2x-y| \ge |(2y-x) + (2x-y)| = |y| = |2y/2| \le 2|y|/2 = |y|$.
Therefore, $|y| = 40$. This means that $y = \pm 20$.

Now, let's substitute $y = 20$ into the equation $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$.
We get $|x-40| + |20-2x| = 40$.
By the triangle inequality again, we have $|x-40| + |20-2x| \ge |(x-40) + (20-2x)| = |20-10| = 10$.
So, $|x-40| + |20-2x| = 40$ implies that equality must hold, which means $x-40 = 20-2x$.
Solving this equation gives $x = 20$.

Similarly, if we substitute $y = -20$, we get $|x+40| + |-20-2x| = 40$.
By the same argument, we have $|x+40| + |-20-2x| \ge |(x+40) + (-20-2x)| = |-20-10| = 30$.
So, $|x+40| + |-20-2x| = 40$ implies that equality must hold, which means $x+40 = -20-2x$.
Solving this equation gives $x = -20$.

So, the possible pairs of $(x, y)$ are $(20, 20)$ and $(-20, -20)$.

Now, let's substitute these pairs into the expression $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$.
For $(x, y) = (20, 20)$, we have $5(20^2) + 5(20^2) - 8(20)(20) = 2000 + 2000 - 3200 = 800$.
For $(x, y) = (-20, -20)$, we have $5(-20^2) + 5(-20^2) - 8(-20)(-20) = -2000 - 2000 + 3200 = -800$.

Since we are looking for the minimum value, the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ is $-800$.
The answer is: $-800$

Question (hint: positive numerical answer):
"What is the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ when $x$ and $y$ range over all real numbers such that $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$?"
Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:



First, let's rewrite the equation $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$ as $|2y-x| + |2x-y| = 40$.

Now, let's consider the expression $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$. We can rewrite it as $5(x^2+y^2)-8xy$.

By the Cauchy-Schwarz inequality, we know that $(x^2+y^2)^2 \geq ((\sqrt{5})^2(x^2)+(-\sqrt{5})^2(y^2))^2 = (5x^2+5y^2)^2$, which implies that $x^2+y^2 \geq \frac{(5x^2+5y^2)}{5}$.

So, $5(x^2+y^2) \geq 5x^2+5y^2$.

Therefore, $5(x^2+y^2)-8xy \geq 5x^2+5y^2-8xy$.

Now, let's consider the expression $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$. We can rewrite it as $\frac{1}{2}(5x^2+5y^2-8xy+5x^2+5y^2+8xy) = \frac{1}{2}(10x^2+10y^2) = 5(x^2+y^2)$.

So, $5x^2+5y^2-8xy \geq 5(x^2+y^2)$.

Now, let's consider the expression $5(x^2+y^2)$. We know that $x^2+y^2 \geq \frac{(5x^2+5y^2)}{5}$, so $5(x^2+y^2) \geq 5x^2+5y^2$.

But we also know that $5x^2+5y^2-8xy \geq 5x^2+5y^2$, so $5(x^2+y^2) \geq 5x^2+5y^2-8xy$.

Therefore, $5x^2+5y^2-8xy = 5(x^2+y^2)$.

So, the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ is achieved when $x^2+y^2$ is minimized.

From the equation $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$, we can deduce that $x=2y$ or $y=2x$.

If $x=2y$, then $x^2+y^2 = 5y^2 = 5(x^2/4) = 5x^2/4$.

If $y=2x$, then $x^2+y^2 = 5x^2 = 5(y^2/4) = 5y^2/4$.

In both cases, $x^2+y^2$ is minimized when $x=2y$ or $y=2x$.

So, the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ is achieved when $x^2+y^2$ is minimized, which is when $x=2y$ or $y=2x$.

Substituting $x=2y$ into $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$, we get $5(2y)^2+5y^2-8(2y)y = 20y^2+5y^2-16y^2 = 9y^2$.

Substituting $y=2x$ into $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$, we get $5x^2+5(2x)^2-8x(2x) = 5x^2+20x^2-16x^2 = 9x^2$.

In both cases, we get $9x^2$ or $9y^2$.

Since $x^2+y^2$ is minimized when $x=2y$ or $y=2x$, the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ is achieved when $x^2+y^2$ is minimized, which is $9x^2$ or $9y^2$.

Therefore, the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ is $9x^2$ or $9y^2$.

However, we know that $x^2+y^2$ is always nonnegative, so $9x^2$ or $9y^2$ is always nonnegative.

Therefore, the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ is $0$.

Therefore, the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ when $x$ and $y$ range over all real numbers such that $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$ is $0$.
The answer is: $0$

Question (hint: positive numerical answer):
"What is the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ when $x$ and $y$ range over all real numbers such that $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$?"
Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:


First, we notice that the given expression is a quadratic form, and we can rewrite it as follows:
\[5x^2+5y^2-8xy = \frac{1}{2}((5x-4y)^2+(4y-5x)^2).\]
This expression is always non-negative, and it equals zero if and only if $x=y$.
Next, we consider the constraint equation $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$.
Without loss of generality, we can assume that $x \geq y$, so the constraint equation becomes:
\[x - 2y + 2x - y = 40 \Rightarrow 3x - 3y = 40 \Rightarrow x - y = \frac{40}{3}.\]
Now, we substitute $x = y + \frac{40}{3}$ into the quadratic form:
\[5(y + \frac{40}{3})^2 + 5y^2 - 8(y + \frac{40}{3})y = \frac{1}{2}((5y + \frac{20}{3})^2 + (5y - \frac{20}{3})^2).\]
This expression simplifies to:
\[\frac{1}{2}(10y^2 + \frac{200}{3}y + \frac{400}{9} + 10y^2 - \frac{200}{3}y + \frac{400}{9}) = 10y^2 + \frac{400}{9}.\]
This is a quadratic function in $y$, and it is minimized when $y = 0$.
Substituting $y = 0$ into the equation $x = y + \frac{40}{3}$, we get $x = \frac{40}{3}$.
Finally, we substitute $x = \frac{40}{3}$ and $y = 0$ into the quadratic form to find the minimum value:
\[5(\frac{40}{3})^2 + 5(0)^2 - 8(\frac{40}{3})(0) = \frac{8000}{9}.\]
So, the minimum value of the expression is $\frac{8000}{9}$.
The answer is: $\frac{8000}{9}$

Question (hint: positive numerical answer):
"What is the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ when $x$ and $y$ range over all real numbers such that $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$?"
Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:


First, let's simplify the given equation $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$.
We can rewrite it as $|x-2y| + |2y-x| = 40$.
Using the property $|a| = |-a|$, we can further simplify it to $|x-2y| - |2y-x| = 40$.
Now, let's consider the expression $|x-2y| - |2y-x|$.
By the triangle inequality, $|a| - |b| \leq |a-b|$.
So we have $|x-2y| - |2y-x| \leq |(x-2y) - (2y-x)| = 0$.
But we know that $|x-2y| - |2y-x| = 40$, which is a contradiction.
So there must be some cancellation happening in the absolute values.
If $x-2y \geq 0$ and $2y-x \geq 0$, then $|x-2y| - |2y-x| = (x-2y) - (2y-x) = 0$, which is not equal to 40.
If $x-2y \geq 0$ and $2y-x < 0$, then $|x-2y| - |2y-x| = (x-2y) - (-(2y-x)) = 2(x-2y) = 40$, so $x-2y = 20$.
If $x-2y < 0$ and $2y-x \geq 0$, then $|x-2y| - |2y-x| = -(x-2y) - (2y-x) = -2(x-2y) = 40$, so $x-2y = -20$.
If $x-2y < 0$ and $2y-x < 0$, then $|x-2y| - |2y-x| = -(x-2y) - (-(2y-x)) = 0$, which is not equal to 40.
So we have two possible cases: $x-2y = 20$ or $x-2y = -20$.
Without loss of generality, let's consider the case $x-2y = 20$.
Then $x = 2y + 20$.
Substitute this into the expression $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$, we get
\begin{align*}
5(2y+20)^2 + 5y^2 - 8(2y+20)y &= 5(4y^2 + 80y + 400) + 5y^2 - 16y^2 - 160y \\
&= 20y^2 + 400y + 2000 + 5y^2 - 16y^2 - 160y \\
&= -y^2 + 240y + 2000.
\end{align*}
This is a quadratic function in $y$, and its minimum value occurs at $y = -\frac{240}{2(-1)} = 120$.
Substituting $y = 120$ into $x = 2y + 20$, we get $x = 2(120) + 20 = 260$.
Now substitute $x = 260$ and $y = 120$ into the expression $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$, we get
\begin{align*}
5(260)^2 + 5(120)^2 - 8(260)(120) &= 338000 + 72000 - 249600 \\
&= 208400.
\end{align*}
So the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ is 208400.
The answer is: $208400$

Step-by-step Solution:


We start by considering the equation $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$.
By the triangle inequality, we have $|x-2y| + |y-2x| \ge |x-2y + y-2x| = |x-y|$.
Therefore, $|x-y| = 40$.
Now, let's rewrite the given expression $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ as $\frac{1}{2}((5x-4y)^2 + (4x-5y)^2)$.
We can then apply the inequality $|x-y| = 40$ to this expression.
Since $|5x-4y| + |4x-5y| = |(5x-4y) - (4x-5y)| = |x-y| = 40$,
by the triangle inequality, we have $\frac{1}{2}((5x-4y)^2 + (4x-5y)^2) \ge \frac{1}{2} (40^2) = 800$.
Therefore, the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ is 800.
The answer is: $800$

Question (hint: positive numerical answer):
"What is the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ when $x$ and $y$ range over all real numbers such that $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$?"
Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:



First, let's consider the equation $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$. We can rewrite this equation using the property $|a| = \sqrt{a^2}$. So, we have:

$\sqrt{(x-2y)^2} + \sqrt{(y-2x)^2} = 40$

This simplifies to:

$\sqrt{x^2 - 4xy + 4y^2} + \sqrt{y^2 - 4xy + 4x^2} = 40$

or

$\sqrt{(x-2y)^2} + \sqrt{(2x-y)^2} = 40$.

Now, let's consider the expression $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$. We can rewrite this as:

$5(x^2 + y^2) - 8xy = 5[(x-2y)^2 + (2x-y)^2] - 8xy$.

Now, we know that $(x-2y)^2 + (2x-y)^2 \geq 0$, and equality holds when $x-2y = 0$ and $2x-y = 0$, which implies $x = \frac{4}{3}y$. Substituting $x = \frac{4}{3}y$ into the equation $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$, we get:

$| \frac{4}{3}y - 2y | + | y - 2(\frac{4}{3}y) | = 40$

which simplifies to:

$| -\frac{2}{3}y | + | -\frac{2}{3}y | = 40$

or

$\frac{4}{3}|y| = 40$.

So, $|y| = 30$. Therefore, the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ is achieved when $x = \frac{4}{3}y$ and $|y| = 30$. Substituting these values into the expression $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$, we get:

$5(\frac{4}{3}y)^2 + 5y^2 - 8(\frac{4}{3}y)y = 5(\frac{16}{9}y^2) + 5y^2 - \frac{32}{3}y^2 = \frac{80}{9}y^2 + \frac{45}{9}y^2 = \frac{125}{9}y^2$.

Since $|y| = 30$, we have $y^2 = 900$, so the minimum value of the expression is $\frac{125}{9} \cdot 900 = 12500$.
The answer is: $12500$

Question (hint: positive numerical answer):
"What is the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ when $x$ and $y$ range over all real numbers such that $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$?"
Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:



First, let's rewrite the expression $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ as $\frac{1}{2}((5x^2-8xy+5y^2) + (5x^2-8xy+5y^2)) = \frac{1}{2}((5x-4y)^2 + (4x-5y)^2)$.

Now, let's consider the equation $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$. We can rewrite this as $|x-2y| + |2y-x| = 40$, which simplifies to $2|x-2y| = 40$, or $|x-2y| = 20$.

This means that the distance between $x$ and $2y$ is always 20. We can use the triangle inequality to say that $|x-2y| + |2y-y| \geq |x-y|$, so $20 + |y| \geq |x-y|$. Rearranging, we get $|x-y| \leq 20 + |y|$.

Now, let's consider the expression $\frac{1}{2}((5x-4y)^2 + (4x-5y)^2)$. By the Cauchy-Schwarz inequality, we have
\[((5x-4y)^2 + (4x-5y)^2)(1^2 + 1^2) \geq (5x-4y + 4x-5y)^2 = (9x-9y)^2 = 81(x-y)^2.\]
So,
\[\frac{1}{2}((5x-4y)^2 + (4x-5y)^2) \geq \frac{81}{2}(x-y)^2.\]

But we know that $(x-y)^2 \leq (20 + |y|)^2$, so
\[\frac{81}{2}(x-y)^2 \leq \frac{81}{2}(20 + |y|)^2.\]

Now, we want to minimize $\frac{1}{2}((5x-4y)^2 + (4x-5y)^2)$. We know that the minimum value of $\frac{81}{2}(20 + |y|)^2$ is 0 (when $y = -20$), so the minimum value of $\frac{1}{2}((5x-4y)^2 + (4x-5y)^2)$ is also 0.

Therefore, the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ is 0 when $x$ and $y$ satisfy the equation $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$. The answer is: $0$

Question (hint: positive numerical answer):
"What is the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ when $x$ and $y$ range over all real numbers such that $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$?"
Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:


First, we need to solve the equation $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$.
By the triangle inequality, we know that $|a+b| \leq |a| + |b|$ for all real numbers $a$ and $b$. So we have
\[|x-2y| + |y-2x| = |x-2y| + |2x-y| \geq |(x-2y) + (2x-y)| = |3x-3y| = 3|x-y|.\]
Hence, $3|x-y| = 40$.
So $|x-y| = \frac{40}{3}$.

Now let's consider the expression $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$. We can rewrite it as $5(x^2+y^2) - 8xy = 5[(x-y)^2 + 2xy] - 8xy = 5(x-y)^2 + 3xy$.
Substituting $|x-y| = \frac{40}{3}$, we get
\[5(x-y)^2 + 3xy = 5\left(\frac{40}{3}\right)^2 + 3xy = \frac{8000}{9} + 3xy.\]
To minimize this expression, we need to minimize $3xy$.
By the Trivial Inequality, we know that $(x+y)^2 \geq 0$, so $x^2 + 2xy + y^2 \geq 0$. Rearranging, we get $2xy \geq -(x^2 + y^2)$.
Multiplying by $\frac{3}{2}$, we have $3xy \geq -\frac{3}{2}(x^2 + y^2)$.
Adding $\frac{8000}{9}$ to both sides, we get $\frac{8000}{9} + 3xy \geq \frac{8000}{9} - \frac{3}{2}(x^2 + y^2)$.
So the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ is $\frac{8000}{9} - \frac{3}{2}(x^2 + y^2)$.

But we know that $x^2 + y^2 = \left(\frac{x-y+x+y}{2}\right)^2 \leq \frac{(x-y)^2 + (x+y)^2}{2} = \frac{(x-y)^2 + 4xy}{2}$.
Substituting $|x-y| = \frac{40}{3}$, we get
\[x^2 + y^2 \leq \frac{\left(\frac{40}{3}\right)^2 + 4xy}{2} = \frac{1600}{9} + 2xy.\]
Substituting this back into the expression for the minimum value, we get
\[\frac{8000}{9} - \frac{3}{2}(x^2 + y^2) \geq \frac{8000}{9} - \frac{3}{2}\left(\frac{1600}{9} + 2xy\right) = \frac{8000}{9} - \frac{2400}{9} - 3xy = \frac{5600}{9} - 3xy.\]
So the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ is $\frac{5600}{9}$.
The answer is: $\boxed{\frac{5600}{9}}$

Question (hint: positive numerical answer):
"What is the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ when $x$ and $y$ range over all real numbers such that $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$?"
Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:


We start by noting that $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$ can be rewritten as $|x-2y| + |2y-x| = 40$.
By the triangle inequality, we know that $|a| + |b| \ge |a+b|$ for all real numbers $a$ and $b$.
So we have $|x-2y| + |2y-x| \ge |(x-2y) + (2y-x)| = |0| = 0$.
But we are given that $|x-2y| + |2y-x| = 40$, so this implies that $|x-2y| = |2y-x| = 20$.
Without loss of generality, let $x - 2y = 20$. Then $x = 2y + 20$.
Substituting this into the expression $5x^2 + 5y^2 - 8xy$, we get
\[5(2y+20)^2 + 5y^2 - 8(2y+20)y = 5(4y^2 + 80y + 400) + 5y^2 - 16y^2 - 160y = 20y^2 + 400.\]
Now we want to minimize this expression. Taking the derivative with respect to $y$ and setting it equal to zero, we get
\[40y = 0 \implies y = 0.\]
Substituting this back into $x = 2y + 20$, we get $x = 20$.
So the minimum value of $5x^2 + 5y^2 - 8xy$ is
\[5(20)^2 + 5(0)^2 - 8(20)(0) = 2000.\] The answer is: $-2000$

To find the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ given the constraint $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$, we can use the method of Lagrange multipliers. Define the function $F(x, y, \lambda) = 5x^2+5y^2-8xy + \lambda(|x-2y| + |y-2x| - 40)$.

Now we need to find the gradient of $F$ and set it equal to the zero vector:

$\nabla F(x, y, \lambda) = \begin{bmatrix} 10x - 8y + \lambda(-1 + 2) \\ 10y - 8x + \lambda(2 - 1) \end{bmatrix} = \begin{bmatrix} 0 \\ 0 \end{bmatrix}$.

Simplifying the equations gives us:

$10x - 8y - \lambda = 0$,
$10y - 8x + \lambda = 0$.

Adding these two equations gives $2(10x - 8y) = 0$, or $10x = 8y$, or $y = \frac{5}{4}x$.

Substituting this into the constraint equation $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$, we get:

$|x-2(\frac{5}{4}x)| + |\frac{5}{4}x - 2x| = 40$,
$|x - \frac{5}{2}x| + |\frac{5}{4}x - \frac{8}{4}x| = 40$,
$|\frac{-1}{2}x| + |\frac{-3}{4}x| = 40$,
$\frac{1}{2}|x| + \frac{3}{4}|x| = 40$,
$\frac{5}{4}|x| = 40$,
$|x| = 32$,
$x = \pm 32$.

For $x = 32$, we have $y = \frac{5}{4} \cdot 32 = 40$.
For $x = -32$, we have $y = \frac{5}{4} \cdot -32 = -40$.

Now we can substitute these values back into the original function $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ to find the minimum value:

For $(x, y) = (32, 40)$:
$5(32)^2 + 5(40)^2 - 8(32)(40) = 5(1024) + 5(1600) - 8(1280) = 5120 + 8000 - 10240 = 2880$.

For $(x, y) = (-32, -40)$:
$5(-32)^2 + 5(-40)^2 - 8(-32)(-40) = 5(1024) + 5(1600) - 8(1280) = 5120 + 8000 - 10240 = 2880$.

So the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ under the given constraint is 2880. The answer is: $2880$.

Question (hint: positive numerical answer):
"What is the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ when $x$ and $y$ range over all real numbers such that $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$?"
Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:



Let's first simplify the given equation $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$.

We know that $|a-b| = |b-a|$, so we can rewrite the equation as $|x-2y| + |2y-x| = 40$.

Then, we use the property of absolute value $|a| + |b| = |a+b|$ if and only if $ab \geq 0$. So, we have $(x-2y) + (2y-x) = 40$, which simplifies to $0 = 40$.

However, this is not possible. So, we must have $(x-2y) - (2y-x) = 40$, which simplifies to $-2(x-2y) = 40$, and then $x-2y = -20$.

Now, we can solve this equation for $y$ in terms of $x$: $y = \frac{x+20}{2}$.

Substitute this into the expression $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$, we get
\begin{align*}
5x^2+5y^2-8xy &= 5x^2+5\left(\frac{x+20}{2}\right)^2 - 8x\left(\frac{x+20}{2}\right) \\
&= 5x^2 + \frac{5(x^2+40x+400)}{4} - 4x^2 - 40x \\
&= \frac{x^2 + 40x + 400}{4} \\
&= \frac{(x+20)^2}{4}.
\end{align*}

Now, since $(x+20)^2 \geq 0$, we have $\frac{(x+20)^2}{4} \geq 0$.

Therefore, the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ is $0$.
The answer is: $0$
