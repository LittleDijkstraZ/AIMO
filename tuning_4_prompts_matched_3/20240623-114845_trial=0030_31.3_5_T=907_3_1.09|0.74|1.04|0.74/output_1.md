Approach:



First, we notice that the expression $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ is a quadratic form and can be written in matrix form as:
\[ \begin{pmatrix} x & y \end{pmatrix} \begin{pmatrix} 5 & -4 \\ -4 & 5 \end{pmatrix} \begin{pmatrix} x \\ y \end{pmatrix} \]
The matrix is symmetric and positive definite, so the quadratic form is always positive.

Next, we notice that the constraint $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$ is equivalent to $|x-2y| = |2x-y| = 20$. This is a system of two absolute value equations, and we can solve it by considering the four cases:
1. $x-2y = 2x-y = 20$
2. $x-2y = -(2x-y) = 20$
3. $-(x-2y) = 2x-y = 20$
4. $-(x-2y) = -(2x-y) = 20$

However, case 4 is equivalent to case 2, so we only need to consider cases 1 and 2.

For case 1, we have $x = 20$ and $y = 0$. Plugging these values into the quadratic form gives:
\[ 5(20)^2 + 5(0)^2 - 8(20)(0) = 2000 \]

For case 2, we have $x = 0$ and $y = 20$. Plugging these values into the quadratic form gives:
\[ 5(0)^2 + 5(20)^2 - 8(0)(20) = 2000 \]

Since the minimum value of the quadratic form is the same for both cases, and we have already established that the quadratic form is always positive, we can conclude that the minimum value of the quadratic form subject to the constraint is $0$.

Therefore, the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ is $0$.
The answer is: $\boxed{0}$

Approach:


We can rewrite the given equation $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$ as $|2y-x| + |2x-y| = 40$.
By the triangle inequality, we know that $|a| + |b| \geq |a+b|$.
So, $|2y-x| + |2x-y| \geq |(2y-x) + (2x-y)| = |y| = |2y/2| \geq 2|y|/2 = |y|$.
Thus, $|x-2y| + |y-2x| \geq |y|$.
But we are given that $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$, so $|y| = 40$.
Therefore, $y = \pm 20$.
Substituting $y = 20$ into the equation $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$, we get $|x-40| + |20-x| = 40$.
By the triangle inequality again, we have $|x-40| + |20-x| \geq |(x-40) + (20-x)| = 20$.
But we are given that this is equal to 40, so there must be some cancellation in the absolute values.
If $x > 40$, then $|x-40| + |20-x| = (x-40) + (20-x) = 20$.
If $x < 20$, then $|x-40| + |20-x| = (40-x) + (20-x) = 60 - 2x$.
So, we must have $x = 20$.
Similarly, substituting $y = -20$ into the equation $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$, we get $|x+40| + |-20-x| = 40$.
If $x < -40$, then $|x+40| + |-20-x| = -(x+40) - (-20-x) = -20$.
If $x > -20$, then $|x+40| + |-20-x| = (x+40) - (-20-x) = 60 + 2x$.
So, we must have $x = -20$.
Thus, the possible values of $x$ are $20$ and $-20$.
Now, we substitute these values of $x$ back into the expression $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$.
For $x = 20$ and $y = 20$, we have $5(20^2) + 5(20^2) - 8(20)(20) = 2000$.
For $x = -20$ and $y = 20$, we have $5(-20^2) + 5(20^2) - 8(-20)(20) = 2000$.
For $x = 20$ and $y = -20$, we have $5(20^2) + 5(-20^2) - 8(20)(-20) = 2000$.
For $x = -20$ and $y = -20$, we have $5(-20^2) + 5(-20^2) - 8(-20)(-20) = 2000$.
In all cases, the value of the expression is $2000$.
Therefore, the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ is $2000$. The answer is: $2000$

Approach:


We can rewrite the given expression as $5(x^2+y^2)-8xy = 5[(x-y)^2 + 2xy] - 8xy = 5(x-y)^2 - 3xy$.
Now, let's consider the constraint $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$.
By the triangle inequality, we have $|x-2y| + |y-2x| \geq |(x-2y) - (y-2x)| = |x-y|$.
Thus, $|x-y| = 20$.
Now, let's substitute $u = x-y$ and $v = y-2x$.
Then, we have $|u| = 20$ and $|v| = 40$.
By the triangle inequality again, we have $|u| + |v| \geq |u+v|$.
Substituting the values, we have $20 + 40 \geq |u+v|$.
So, $|u+v| \leq 60$.
Now, let's substitute back $u = x-y$ and $v = y-2x$.
We have $|x-y + y-2x| \leq 60$.
Simplifying, we get $|2x - 2y| \leq 60$, which is equivalent to $|x - y| \leq 30$.
Now, we have $|x-y| = 20$ and $|x-y| \leq 30$.
The only possible value for $|x-y|$ is 20.
Now, let's substitute $u = x-y$ back into the expression $5(x-y)^2 - 3xy$.
We have $5(20^2) - 3xy = 2000 - 3xy$.
To minimize this expression, we need to maximize $xy$.
By the AM-GM inequality, we have $xy \leq \left(\frac{x+y}{2}\right)^2 = \left(\frac{u+2u}{2}\right)^2 = \left(\frac{3u}{2}\right)^2 = \frac{9u^2}{4}$.
Since $|u| = 20$, we have $u^2 = 400$.
So, $xy \leq \frac{9(400)}{4} = 900$.
Substituting this back into the expression, we have $2000 - 3(900) = 2000 - 2700 = -700$.
Therefore, the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ is -700. The answer is: $-700$

The problem is to find the minimum value of the expression $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ subject to the constraint $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$.

First, we note that the constraint equation is equivalent to $|x-2y| + |2y-x| = 40$, which simplifies to $2|x-2y| = 40$. Thus, $|x-2y| = 20$.

Now, we use the property of absolute value $|a-b| = \sqrt{(a-b)^2}$, so we have $(x-2y)^2 = 400$.

Next, we expand the left side: $x^2 - 4xy + 4y^2 = 400$.

Now, we substitute this into the expression $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$:

$5x^2+5y^2-8xy = 5(x^2 - 4xy + 4y^2) + 15y^2 - 8xy = 5*400 + 15y^2 - 8xy$.

Now, we want to minimize this expression. To do this, we can use calculus. We take the partial derivatives with respect to $x$ and $y$ and set them equal to zero:

$\frac{\partial}{\partial x}(2000 + 15y^2 - 8xy) = -8y = 0$,

$\frac{\partial}{\partial y}(2000 + 15y^2 - 8xy) = 30y - 8x = 0$.

From the first equation, we get $y = 0$. Substituting this into the second equation, we get $0 = 8x$, so $x = 0$.

Thus, the minimum occurs at $(x, y) = (0, 0)$, and the minimum value of the expression $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ is $5*0^2 + 5*0^2 - 8*0*0 = 0$.
The answer is: $0$

Approach:


To find the minimum value of the expression $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ under the condition $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$, we can use the method of Lagrange multipliers.

Let's define a new function $F(x, y, \lambda) = 5x^2 + 5y^2 - 8xy + \lambda(|x-2y| + |y-2x| - 40)$.

Now we need to find the partial derivatives of $F(x, y, \lambda)$ with respect to $x$, $y$, and $\lambda$ and set them equal to zero:

$\frac{\partial F}{\partial x} = 10x - 8y + \lambda(-1 + 2\text{sgn}(x-2y)) = 0$,
$\frac{\partial F}{\partial y} = 10y - 8x + \lambda(1 - 2\text{sgn}(y-2x)) = 0$,
$\frac{\partial F}{\partial \lambda} = |x-2y| + |y-2x| - 40 = 0$.

From the first two equations, we get $10x - 8y = \lambda(1 - 2\text{sgn}(x-2y))$ and $10y - 8x = \lambda(1 - 2\text{sgn}(y-2x))$.

Since $\lambda$ cannot be zero (otherwise the constraint wouldn't hold), we can divide the first equation by $\lambda$ and the second equation by $\lambda$ to get:

$\frac{10x - 8y}{\lambda} = 1 - 2\text{sgn}(x-2y)$ and $\frac{10y - 8x}{\lambda} = 1 - 2\text{sgn}(y-2x)$.

Since the left sides of these equations are always non-negative, the right sides must also be non-negative. This implies that $\text{sgn}(x-2y) = \text{sgn}(y-2x)$.

Now, if $x > 2y$, then $y < 2x$, so $\text{sgn}(x-2y) = 1$ and $\text{sgn}(y-2x) = -1$. But this would mean $\text{sgn}(x-2y) \neq \text{sgn}(y-2x)$, which is a contradiction. The same contradiction arises if $y > 2x$.

Therefore, we must have $x = 2y$ or $y = 2x$. Without loss of generality, let's consider $x = 2y$. Substituting this into the constraint equation, we get:

$|x - 2x| + |y - x| = | -x| + | -y| = x + y = 40/2 = 20$.

Since $x = 2y$, we have $2y + y = 20$, which gives $y = \frac{20}{3}$. Then $x = 2y = \frac{40}{3}$.

Now we can substitute these values into the expression $5x^2 + 5y^2 - 8xy$:

$5\left(\frac{40}{3}\right)^2 + 5\left(\frac{20}{3}\right)^2 - 8\left(\frac{40}{3}\right)\left(\frac{20}{3}\right) = \frac{8000}{9}$.

Therefore, the minimum value of $5x^2 + 5y^2 - 8xy$ is $\frac{8000}{9}$.

So the answer is: $\boxed{\frac{8000}{9}}$.

This problem involves finding the minimum value of a function $f(x, y) = 5x^2 + 5y^2 - 8xy$ subject to the constraint $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$. 

The constraint equation $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$ implies that $x$ and $y$ are related. We can't simply substitute $y$ from the constraint into the function and find the minimum directly. 

Instead, we can use the method of Lagrange multipliers. We introduce a new variable $\lambda$ and form the function $g(x, y, \lambda) = 5x^2 + 5y^2 - 8xy - \lambda (|x-2y| + |y-2x| - 40)$.

Now we need to find the gradient of $g(x, y, \lambda)$ and set it to zero:

$\frac{\partial g}{\partial x} = 10x - 8y - \lambda(-1 + 2\text{sgn}(x-2y)) = 0$,
$\frac{\partial g}{\partial y} = 10y - 8x - \lambda(2 - 1\text{sgn}(y-2x)) = 0$,
$\frac{\partial g}{\partial \lambda} = |x-2y| + |y-2x| - 40 = 0$.

Solving this system of equations is quite challenging. However, we can simplify the problem by noting that the function $f(x, y) = 5x^2 + 5y^2 - 8xy$ is a quadratic form and its minimum value can be found at the center of the ellipse defined by the constraint. 

The constraint equation can be rewritten as $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40 \implies |x-2y| = 20 - |y-2x|$. 

If $|x-2y| = 20$, then $x - 2y = \pm 20$. Solving for $y$ in terms of $x$ gives $y = \frac{x \pm 20}{2}$. Substituting this into the constraint equation gives $|y-2x| = 0$, which implies $y = 2x$. Solving the system of equations $y = \frac{x + 20}{2}$ and $y = 2x$ gives $x = \frac{20}{3}$ and $y = \frac{40}{3}$. 

Similarly, if $|y-2x| = 20$, then $y - 2x = \pm 20$. Solving for $y$ in terms of $x$ gives $y = 2x \pm 20$. Substituting this into the constraint equation gives $|x-2y| = 0$, which implies $x = 2y$. Solving the system of equations $x = 2\left(\frac{x - 20}{2}\right)$ and $y = \frac{x}{2}$ gives $x = \frac{40}{3}$ and $y = \frac{20}{3}$. 

So the center of the ellipse is at $\left(\frac{40}{3}, \frac{20}{3}\right)$. Substituting these values into the function $f(x, y)$ gives the minimum value:

$f\left(\frac{40}{3}, \frac{20}{3}\right) = 5\left(\frac{40}{3}\right)^2 + 5\left(\frac{20}{3}\right)^2 - 8\left(\frac{40}{3}\right)\left(\frac{20}{3}\right) = -\frac{8000}{9}$.

So the minimum value of the function $5x^2 + 5y^2 - 8xy$ subject to the constraint $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$ is $-\frac{8000}{9}$.

The answer is: $-\frac{8000}{9}$

Approach:


To find the minimum value of the expression $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ subject to the constraint $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$, we can use the method of Lagrange multipliers.

Let $f(x, y) = 5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ and $g(x, y) = |x-2y| + |y-2x| - 40$. Then we want to find the points $(x, y)$ where the gradient of $f$ is a scalar multiple of the gradient of $g$. That is, we want to find $(x, y)$ such that:

$\nabla f(x, y) = \lambda \nabla g(x, y)$,

where $\lambda$ is the Lagrange multiplier.

First, we compute the gradients:

$\nabla f(x, y) = \begin{pmatrix} 10x - 8y \\ 10y - 8x \end{pmatrix}$ and $\nabla g(x, y) = \begin{pmatrix} -1 \\ 1 \end{pmatrix}$ if $x \geq 2y$ and $y \geq 2x$,

$\nabla g(x, y) = \begin{pmatrix} 1 \\ -1 \end{pmatrix}$ if $x \geq 2y$ and $y < 2x$,

$\nabla g(x, y) = \begin{pmatrix} -1 \\ -1 \end{pmatrix}$ if $x < 2y$ and $y \geq 2x$,

$\nabla g(x, y) = \begin{pmatrix} 1 \\ 1 \end{pmatrix}$ if $x < 2y$ and $y < 2x$.

Now we need to consider the different cases and solve the system of equations:

1. If $x \geq 2y$ and $y \geq 2x$, we have:

$\begin{pmatrix} 10x - 8y \\ 10y - 8x \end{pmatrix} = \lambda \begin{pmatrix} -1 \\ 1 \end{pmatrix}$.

This gives us the system of equations:

$10x - 8y = -\lambda$,

$10y - 8x = \lambda$.

Adding these equations, we get $2x = 2y$, or $x = y$. Substituting this into the constraint equation, we get $|x-2x| + |x-2x| = 40$, or $|x| + |-x| = 40$, which simplifies to $2|x| = 40$, or $|x| = 20$. Thus, $x = \pm 20$.

2. If $x \geq 2y$ and $y < 2x$, we have:

$\begin{pmatrix} 10x - 8y \\ 10y - 8x \end{pmatrix} = \lambda \begin{pmatrix} 1 \\ -1 \end{pmatrix}$.

This gives us the system of equations:

$10x - 8y = \lambda$,

$10y - 8x = -\lambda$.

Adding these equations, we get $2x = 2y$, or $x = y$. But this contradicts the condition $y < 2x$. So there are no solutions in this case.

3. If $x < 2y$ and $y \geq 2x$, we have:

$\begin{pmatrix} 10x - 8y \\ 10y - 8x \end{pmatrix} = \lambda \begin{pmatrix} -1 \\ -1 \end{pmatrix}$.

This gives us the system of equations:

$10x - 8y = -\lambda$,

$10y - 8x = -\lambda$.

Adding these equations, we get $2x = 2y$, or $x = y$. Substituting this into the constraint equation, we get $|x-2x| + |x-2x| = 40$, or $|x| + |-x| = 40$, which simplifies to $2|x| = 40$, or $|x| = 20$. Thus, $x = \pm 20$.

4. If $x < 2y$ and $y < 2x$, we have:

$\begin{pmatrix} 10x - 8y \\ 10y - 8x \end{pmatrix} = \lambda \begin{pmatrix} 1 \\ 1 \end{pmatrix}$.

This gives us the system of equations:

$10x - 8y = \lambda$,

$10y - 8x = \lambda$.

Adding these equations, we get $2x = 2y$, or $x = y$. But this contradicts the condition $y < 2x$. So there are no solutions in this case.

Thus, the only possible solutions are $(x, y) = (\pm 20, \pm 20)$. We can check that all of these points satisfy the constraint equation $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$. Now we can compute the value of $f(x, y) = 5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ at these points:

$f(20, 20) = 5(20)^2 + 5(20)^2 - 8(20)(20) = 2000$,

$f(-20, -20) = 5(-20)^2 + 5(-20)^2 - 8(-20)(-20) = 2000$.

Therefore, the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ subject to the constraint is 2000. The answer is: $2000$
