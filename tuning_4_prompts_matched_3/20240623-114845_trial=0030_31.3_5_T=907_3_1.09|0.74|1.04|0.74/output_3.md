Solve the following problem with a Python Script (positive numerical answer):
"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"

Approach:


The given equation is a product of two terms, which equals to zero. This means that either the first term equals to zero or the second term equals to zero. We will solve each case separately.

Case 1: $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$
For the sum of two absolute values to be zero, both absolute values must be zero. So we have:
$\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$.
This implies that $x + y = \pm 10$ and $x - y = \pm 10$.
Solving these equations, we get the vertices of the polygon as $(5, 5), (5, -5), (-5, 5),$ and $(-5, -5)$.

Case 2: $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$
For the sum of two absolute values to be zero, both absolute values must be zero. So we have:
$\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$.
This implies that $x = \pm 8$ and $y = \pm 8$.
But this case doesn't give us any new vertices.

So the vertices of the polygon are $(5, 5), (5, -5), (-5, 5),$ and $(-5, -5)$. These points form a square with side length 10. The area of a square is given by side length squared, so the area of this square is $10^2 = 100$.
The answer is: $100$

Solve the following problem with a Python Script (positive numerical answer):
"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"

Approach:

 The equation $AB = 0$ is equivalent to $A = 0$ or $B = 0$. Therefore, the given equation is equivalent to either $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$.

For the first equation to be zero, we must have $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. This means that the points $(x, y)$ must lie on the lines $x + y = 10$ and $x - y = 10$. The intersection of these lines is the point $(5, 5)$.

For the second equation to be zero, we must have $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$. This means that the points $(x, y)$ must lie on the lines $x = 8$ and $y = 8$. The intersection of these lines is the point $(8, 8)$.

So, the points $(x, y)$ satisfying the given equation are the points $(5, 5)$ and $(8, 8)$. These two points form a line segment, which is the convex polygon in question. The length of the line segment is the distance between the points $(5, 5)$ and $(8, 8)$, which can be found using the distance formula: $\sqrt{(8 - 5)^2 + (8 - 5)^2} = \sqrt{9 + 9} = \sqrt{18} = 3\sqrt{2}$. The height of the rectangle is 3 (the difference between 8 and 5), so the area of the rectangle is $3 \cdot 3\sqrt{2} = 9\sqrt{2}$. Therefore, the area of the convex polygon is $9\sqrt{2}$.
The answer is: $9\sqrt{2}$

Solve the following problem with a Python Script (positive numerical answer):
"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"

Approach:



The equation $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ is satisfied only when either of the factors is zero.

For the first factor to be zero, we must have $\vert x + y \vert - 10 = 0$ and $\vert x - y \vert - 10 = 0$, which implies $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. This gives us the following four equations:

1. $x + y = 10$
2. $x + y = -10$
3. $x - y = 10$
4. $x - y = -10$

Solving these equations gives us the vertices of the square: $(5,5)$, $(5,-5)$, $(-5,5)$, and $(-5,-5)$.

For the second factor to be zero, we must have $\vert x \vert - 8 = 0$ and $\vert y \vert - 8 = 0$, which implies $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$. This gives us the following four equations:

1. $x = 8$
2. $x = -8$
3. $y = 8$
4. $y = -8$

Solving these equations gives us the vertices of the square: $(8,0)$, $(-8,0)$, $(0,8)$, and $(0,-8)$.

The points that satisfy the equation form the union of these two squares. The side length of each square is $10$, so the area of each square is $10^2 = 100$. Since there are two squares, the total area is $2 \times 100 = 200$.

Therefore, the area of the convex polygon is $200$. The answer is: $200$

Approach:

 The equation $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + (\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + (\vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ is satisfied only when either $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + (\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + (\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$.
The first equation is satisfied when $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$, which represent two lines parallel to the x-axis at $y = \pm 10$ and two lines parallel to the y-axis at $x = \pm 10$.
The second equation is satisfied when $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$, which represent four lines parallel to the x-axis at $y = \pm 8$ and two lines parallel to the y-axis at $x = \pm 8$.
The intersection of these lines form a square with side length 16.
The area of this square is $16^2 = 256$. The answer is: $256$

Approach:



The given equation is $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$. For the product of two numbers to be zero, either one of them must be zero. Hence, we have two cases to consider:

Case 1: $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$. This implies that $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. The absolute value equations can be split into two separate equations: $x + y = 10$ and $x + y = -10$, $x - y = 10$ and $x - y = -10$. Solving these systems of equations gives us the vertices of the polygon.

Case 2: $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$. This implies that $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$. The absolute value equations can be split into two separate equations: $x = 8$ and $x = -8$, $y = 8$ and $y = -8$. Solving these systems of equations gives us the vertices of the polygon.

Once we have the vertices of the polygon, we can calculate the area using the formula for the area of a polygon given its vertices.

The Python code to calculate the area of the polygon is as follows:

```python


INTERMEDIATE OUT :

from sympy import symbols, Abs, solveset, S, Rational

def calculate_area():
    x, y = symbols('x y')

    # Solve the system of equations for case 1
    solutions_1 = solveset((Abs(x + y) - 10)**2 + (Abs(x - y) - 10)**2, (x, y), domain=S.Reals)

    # Solve the system of equations for case 2
    solutions_2 = solveset((Abs(x) - 8)**2 + (Abs(y) - 8)**2, (x, y), domain=S.Reals)

    # Combine the solutions
    solutions = solutions_1.union(solutions_2)

    # Convert the solutions to a list
    vertices = list(solutions)

    # Calculate the area of the polygon
    area = Rational(1, 2) * len(vertices) * 64 - sum([x*y for x, y in vertices])

    return area

result = calculate_area()
print(result)
```

CODE RESULTS Traceback: line 2217, in solveset
    raise ValueError("%s is not a valid SymPy symbol" % (symbol,))

INTERMEDIATE OUT :
```output
Traceback: line 2217, in solveset
    raise ValueError("%s is not a valid SymPy symbol" % (symbol,))
ValueError: (x, y) is not a valid SymPy symbol

FAIL

```

The error in the code is due to the use of `solveset` function which does not support the domain `S.Reals` for absolute value equations. Instead, we can solve these equations manually to obtain the vertices of the polygon.

Solving $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ gives us the vertices $(5,5)$, $(5,-5)$, $(-5,5)$, and $(-5,-5)$.

Solving $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ gives us the vertices $(8,0)$, $(8,0)$, $(0,8)$, and $(0,-8)$.

Combining these vertices, we get a square with side length 10 units. The area of this square is $10^2 = 100$ square units.

Therefore, the area of the convex polygon is 100 square units. The answer is: $100$

Approach:

 The given equation is equivalent to the product of two terms being zero, i.e., $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$. The first equation implies that $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$, and the second equation implies that $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$.

The solutions to the first equation form a square with side length 20, and the solutions to the second equation form a square with side length 16. The intersection of these two squares is the convex polygon we are looking for.

To find the area of the convex polygon, we need to find the area of the square formed by the solutions to the first equation and subtract the area of the square formed by the solutions to the second equation.

The area of a square with side length $a$ is $a^2$. Therefore, the area of the square formed by the solutions to the first equation is $20^2 = 400$, and the area of the square formed by the solutions to the second equation is $16^2 = 256$.

The area of the convex polygon is the difference of these two areas, i.e., $400 - 256 = 144$.

So, the area of the convex polygon is 144 square units.
The answer is: $144$

The equation $AB = 0$ implies that $A = 0$ or $B = 0$. Therefore, we can solve the given equation as either $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$.

For the first equation, we have:

$\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. This implies that $x + y = \pm 10$ and $x - y = \pm 10$. Solving these equations gives us the vertices of the square as $(5, 5)$, $(5, -5)$, $(-5, -5)$, and $(-5, 5)$.

For the second equation, we have:

$\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$. This implies that $x = \pm 8$ and $y = \pm 8$. Solving these equations gives us the vertices of the square as $(8, 8)$, $(8, -8)$, $(-8, -8)$, and $(-8, 8)$.

The total region enclosed by these points is a rectangle with length $10$ and width $16$. The area of the rectangle is $10 \times 16 = 160$. The answer is: $160$

Approach:


The equation given is a product of two expressions equal to zero, which means that either one of the expressions is zero. So we have two cases to consider:

1. $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$
2. $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$

For the first case, both $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2$ and $( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2$ must be zero. This implies that $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. This forms a square with side length 10 units.

For the second case, both $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2$ and $( \vert y \vert - 8)^2$ must be zero. This implies that $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$. This forms a square with side length 16 units.

The area of the convex polygon formed by the intersection of the two squares is the area of the smaller square.

The side length of the smaller square is 10 units. Therefore, the area of the convex polygon is $10^2 = 100$ square units. The answer is: $100$

Approach:

 The equation given is a product of two expressions equal to zero. This means that either the first expression is zero or the second expression is zero. We will consider each case separately.

Case 1: $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$
This implies that both $\vert x + y \vert - 10 = 0$ and $\vert x - y \vert - 10 = 0$. This further simplifies to $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. This means that the points $(x, y)$ are such that the sum of their coordinates in absolute value is 10 and the difference of their coordinates in absolute value is also 10. This forms a square with side length 10 units.

Case 2: $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$
This implies that both $\vert x \vert - 8 = 0$ and $\vert y \vert - 8 = 0$. This further simplifies to $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$. This means that the points $(x, y)$ are such that the absolute values of both coordinates are 8. This forms a square with side length 16 units (since the coordinates can be both positive and negative).

Now, we need to find the intersection of these two cases. The square formed by Case 1 is completely inside the square formed by Case 2. Therefore, the convex polygon formed by the intersection of these two cases is the square formed by Case 1.

To find the area of this square, we simply square the side length. The side length is 10 units, so the area is $10^2 = 100$ square units.
The answer is: $100$
