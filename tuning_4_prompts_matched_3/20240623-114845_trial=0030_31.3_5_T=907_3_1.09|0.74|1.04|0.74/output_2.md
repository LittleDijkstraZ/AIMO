Solve the following problem with a Python Script (positive numerical answer):
"For how many positive integers $m$ does the equation \[\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}\] have $4$ distinct solutions?"

Approach:



The equation $| |x - 1| - 2 | = \frac{m}{100}$ has 4 distinct solutions if and only if $\frac{m}{100}$ is a number between 1 and 2 (exclusive). This is because the expression $| |x - 1| - 2 |$ can take on values from 0 to 3, and it is equal to $\frac{m}{100}$.

Therefore, we need to find the number of positive integers $m$ such that $1 < \frac{m}{100} < 2$.

Multiplying all sides of the inequalities by 100, we get $100 < m < 200$. The number of positive integers $m$ in this range is $200 - 100 - 1 = 99$.
The answer is: $99$

Approach:


We know that the equation $| |x - 1| - 2| = \frac{m}{100}$ has 4 distinct solutions. The expression $| |x - 1| - 2|$ is a piecewise function that has 4 different cases to consider:

1. $|x - 1| - 2 = \frac{m}{100}$
2. $-(|x - 1| - 2) = \frac{m}{100}$
3. $|-(x - 1)| - 2 = \frac{m}{100}$
4. $-(|-(x - 1)| - 2) = \frac{m}{100}$

We need to find the number of values of $m$ for which the equation has 4 distinct solutions. We can analyze each case separately and count the number of solutions for each case.

Case 1: $|x - 1| - 2 = \frac{m}{100}$
This equation has 2 solutions if $0 \leq \frac{m}{100} \leq 2$. So, $0 \leq m \leq 200$.

Case 2: $-(|x - 1| - 2) = \frac{m}{100}$
This equation has 2 solutions if $-2 \leq \frac{m}{100} \leq 0$. So, $-200 \leq m \leq 0$.

Case 3: $|-(x - 1)| - 2 = \frac{m}{100}$
This is equivalent to Case 1, so it also has 2 solutions if $0 \leq \frac{m}{100} \leq 2$. So, $0 \leq m \leq 200$.

Case 4: $-(|-(x - 1)| - 2) = \frac{m}{100}$
This is equivalent to Case 2, so it also has 2 solutions if $-2 \leq \frac{m}{100} \leq 0$. So, $-200 \leq m \leq 0$.

Combining all the cases, we find that the equation has 4 distinct solutions when $-200 \leq m \leq 200$. The number of positive integers in this range is $200 - (-200) + 1 = 401$. However, this includes the case $m = 0$, which we need to exclude because it corresponds to only 2 distinct solutions. So, the number of positive integers $m$ for which the equation has 4 distinct solutions is $401 - 1 = 400$.

Therefore, the number of positive integers $m$ for which the equation $| |x - 1| - 2| = \frac{m}{100}$ has 4 distinct solutions is 400.
The answer is: $400$

We know that the equation $| |x - 1| - 2| = \frac{m}{100}$ has 4 distinct solutions if and only if $\frac{m}{100}$ is strictly between 1 and 2. This is because the function $| |x - 1| - 2|$ oscillates between 1 and 3, and we want the right hand side to be strictly between 1 and 2 so that the equation has 4 distinct solutions.

So, we have $1 < \frac{m}{100} < 2$. Multiplying all sides of the inequalities by 100, we get $100 < m < 200$. The positive integers $m$ that satisfy this inequality are the integers from 101 to 199, inclusive.

Counting the number of these integers gives us the number of positive integers $m$ for which the equation has 4 distinct solutions.

```python


INTERMEDIATE OUT :

def count_m():
    return len(range(101, 200))

result = count_m()
print(result)
```

CODE RESULTS 99

The number of positive integers $m$ for which the equation $| |x - 1| - 2| = \frac{m}{100}$ has 4 distinct solutions is 99.
The answer is: $99$

To find the number of positive integers $m$ for which the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has $4$ distinct solutions, we need to analyze the equation.

The equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ can have at most $4$ distinct solutions because the absolute value function creates two branches, and each branch can have at most two distinct solutions.

To have exactly $4$ distinct solutions, the right side of the equation, $\frac{m}{100}$, must be equal to $2$. This is because the absolute value function creates two branches, and for each branch to have exactly two distinct solutions, the right side of the equation must be equal to the value that splits the function into two separate functions. In this case, that value is $2$.

So, we have $\frac{m}{100}=2$, which implies $m=200$.

Therefore, there is only one positive integer $m$ that makes the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ have $4$ distinct solutions, and that is $m=200$. The answer is: $\boxed{1}$

The equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has 4 distinct solutions means that the right side $\frac{m}{100}$ is a number such that it splits the graph of $y = \vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert$ into 4 parts.

We first analyze the graph of $y = \vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert$.

The function $y = \vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert$ has a "V" shape. The function changes its value from 1 to 3 at $x = 1 \pm 2$, and changes its value from 3 to 1 at $x = 1$. Therefore, the graph of $y = \vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert$ is a "V" shape with its peak at $(1, 2)$ and its "arms" reaching to $(3, 1)$ and $(-1, 1)$.

For the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ to have 4 distinct solutions, $\frac{m}{100}$ must be a number in the interval $(0, 1)$. Therefore, we need to find how many positive integers $m$ in the interval $(0, 100)$ make $\frac{m}{100}$ fall into the interval $(0, 1)$.

This is simply the number of integers in the interval $(0, 100)$, which is 100. However, we must subtract 1 from this number because 0 is not included in the interval $(0, 100)$. So, there are 99 positive integers $m$ that make $\frac{m}{100}$ fall into the interval $(0, 1)$.

Therefore, there are 99 positive integers $m$ such that the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has 4 distinct solutions.
The answer is: 99
