Question (hint: positive numerical answer):
"A function $f: \mathbb N \to \mathbb N$ satisfies the following two conditions for all positive integers $n$:$f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$ and $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$. Calculate $f(100)$."
Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:


To find $f(100)$, we first need to find a pattern in the function $f$.

From the second condition, we have $f(2n) = 2f(n) + 1$. This means that if we know the value of $f(n)$ for any $n$, we can find the value of $f(2n)$ using this formula.

Now, let's use the first condition $f(f(f(n))) = 8n - 7$. We can start by setting $n = 1$, and find the value of $f(f(f(1)))$. By the first condition, $f(f(f(1))) = 8*1 - 7 = 1$. So, $f(f(1)) = 1$.

Then, we have $f(1) = 1$.

Using the second condition, we can find $f(2) = 2f(1) + 1 = 2*1 + 1 = 3$.

Again, using the second condition, we can find $f(4) = 2f(2) + 1 = 2*3 + 1 = 7$.

Similarly, we can find $f(8) = 2f(4) + 1 = 2*7 + 1 = 15$.

And $f(16) = 2f(8) + 1 = 2*15 + 1 = 31$.

By observing these values, we can see a pattern. The value of $f(2^k)$ is $2^k + 2^k - 1 = 2^{k+1} - 1$.

Now, let's find $f(100)$. First, we write $100$ in binary form: $100 = 2^6 + 2^2 = 64 + 4$. So, $f(100) = f(2^6 + 2^2) = f(64 + 4)$.

Using the pattern we found, $f(64) = 2^7 - 1 = 127$ and $f(4) = 2*2 + 1 = 5$.

Then, using the second condition again, $f(100) = f(64 + 4) = 2f(64) + 1 = 2*127 + 1 = 254 + 1 = 255$.

So, $f(100) = 255$. The answer is: $255$

Question (hint: positive numerical answer):
"A function $f: \mathbb N \to \mathbb N$ satisfies the following two conditions for all positive integers $n$:$f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$ and $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$. Calculate $f(100)$."
Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:



First, let's plug $n = 1$ into the second equation: $f(2) = 2f(1) + 1$.
Next, let's plug $n = f(1)$ into the second equation: $f(2f(1)) = 2f(f(1)) + 1$.
But we know that $f(f(f(1))) = 8*1 - 7 = 1$, so $f(2f(1)) = 1$.
Combining these equations, we have $2f(f(1)) + 1 = 1$, so $2f(f(1)) = 0$, and thus $f(f(1)) = 0$.
Since $f(f(f(1))) = 1$, we must have $f(1) = 2$.
Then, plugging $n = 2$ into the second equation, we have $f(4) = 2f(2) + 1$.
But from the first equation, we know that $f(f(f(2))) = 8*2 - 7 = 9$, so $f(4) = 9$.
Then, plugging $n = 4$ into the second equation, we have $f(8) = 2f(4) + 1 = 2*9 + 1 = 19$.
Continuing this process, we can find that $f(16) = 37$, $f(32) = 73$, and so on.
By observing this pattern, we can conjecture that $f(2^k) = 2^{k+2} - 3$ for all positive integers $k$.
Now, let's check if this conjecture holds for $k = 6$.
We have $f(64) = 2^{6+2} - 3 = 128 - 3 = 125$.
And indeed, from the first equation, we know that $f(f(f(64))) = 8*64 - 7 = 511$.
And $f(f(64)) = f(125) = 2*125 - 3 = 247$.
Finally, we have $f(64) = 125$.
So our conjecture holds for $k = 6$.
Now we can find $f(100)$.
Since $100 = 2^2 * 5^2$, we can write $100 = 2^2 * 25 = 2^4 * 5^2$.
Using our conjecture, we have $f(100) = f(2^4 * 5^2) = 2^{4+2} - 3 = 2^6 - 3 = 64 - 3 = 61$.
Therefore, $f(100) = 61$.
The value of $f(100)$ is 61. The answer is: $61$

Question (hint: positive numerical answer):
"A function $f: \mathbb N \to \mathbb N$ satisfies the following two conditions for all positive integers $n$:$f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$ and $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$. Calculate $f(100)$."
Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:



To find $f(100)$, we need to use the second condition of the function $f$, which is $f(2n) = 2f(n) + 1$. We can apply this condition repeatedly to simplify $f(100)$ until we reach a value we know.

First, let's express $100$ as $2 \cdot 50$. Then we can use the second condition to get:
$$f(100) = f(2 \cdot 50) = 2f(50) + 1.$$
Now, we need to find $f(50)$. We can express $50$ as $2 \cdot 25$, and apply the second condition again:
$$f(50) = f(2 \cdot 25) = 2f(25) + 1.$$
Next, we need to find $f(25)$. We can express $25$ as $2 \cdot 12.5$, but $12.5$ is not an integer, so we cannot directly apply the second condition. However, we know that $f(f(f(n))) = 8n - 7$, and if we set $n = 12.5$, we get:
$$f(f(f(12.5))) = 8 \cdot 12.5 - 7 = 100.$$
Since $f(f(f(n))) = 8n - 7$, we have:
$$f(12.5) = \frac{100}{f(f(12.5))} = \frac{100}{f(f(12.5))}.$$
Now we need to find $f(f(12.5))$. We can express $f(12.5)$ as $2 \cdot 6.25$, and apply the second condition:
$$f(f(12.5)) = f(2 \cdot 6.25) = 2f(6.25) + 1.$$
Again, $6.25$ is not an integer, so we cannot directly apply the second condition. But we know that $f(f(f(n))) = 8n - 7$, and if we set $n = 6.25$, we get:
$$f(f(f(6.25))) = 8 \cdot 6.25 - 7 = 47.$$
So, $f(6.25) = \frac{47}{f(f(6.25))} = \frac{47}{47} = 1$. Substituting this into the equation for $f(f(12.5))$:
$$f(f(12.5)) = 2f(6.25) + 1 = 2 \cdot 1 + 1 = 3.$$
And substituting this into the equation for $f(50)$:
$$f(50) = 2f(25) + 1.$$
But we know that $f(25) = \frac{100}{f(f(25))}$. We already found that $f(f(25)) = f(f(12.5)) = 3$, so:
$$f(25) = \frac{100}{3}.$$
Substituting this into the equation for $f(50)$:
$$f(50) = 2 \cdot \frac{100}{3} + 1 = \frac{200}{3} + 1 = \frac{203}{3}.$$
And finally, substituting $f(50)$ into the equation for $f(100)$:
$$f(100) = 2f(50) + 1 = 2 \cdot \frac{203}{3} + 1 = \frac{406}{3} + 1 = \frac{409}{3}.$$
But this is a contradiction because the value of $f(100)$ should be a natural number. Therefore, our assumption that $n$ is not an integer must be wrong. The mistake must be in our usage of the second condition of the function $f$. We must have forgotten to account for some boundary conditions or restrictions on the function.

Let's reconsider the conditions given:
$$f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$$ and $$f(2n)=2f(n)+1.$$
We notice that the first equation implies that $f(f(f(n)))$ must be an odd number for all positive integers $n$. However, the second equation implies that $f(2n)$ must be an even number for all positive integers $n$. This contradiction suggests that we might need to consider a more general form of the function $f$ that incorporates this discrepancy.

Let's consider a modified function $g(n) = f(n) + 1$. Then the conditions become:
$$g(g(g(n)))=8n$$ and $$g(2n)=2g(n).$$
Now the second condition is consistent with the first one, because if $g(2n) = 2g(n)$ for all positive integers $n$, then $g(g(g(n))) = g(2 \cdot g(g(n-1))) = 2g(g(n-1)) = 2 \cdot 2g(n-1) = 4g(n-1) = 8n-8$.

Now we can proceed with the calculation using the modified function $g(n)$:
$$g(100) = f(100) + 1.$$
Using the same method as before, we can find that $g(100) = 409$. Therefore, $f(100) = g(100) - 1 = 409 - 1 = 408$.

So the value of $f(100)$ is 408. The answer is: $\boxed{408}$

Question (hint: positive numerical answer):
"A function $f: \mathbb N \to \mathbb N$ satisfies the following two conditions for all positive integers $n$:$f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$ and $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$. Calculate $f(100)$."
Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:



We first need to find $f(1)$ before we can find $f(100)$.
Using $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$, we let $n=1$ to get $f(2) = 2f(1)+1$.
But we also know that $f(f(f(1)))=8(1)-7=1$, so $f(f(f(1)))=1$.

Let $f(1)=a$. Then $f(f(a))=1$, so $f(a)=b$ where $f(b)=1$.

Substituting $a=b$ into $f(2) = 2f(1)+1$, we get $f(2) = 2a+1$.
And since $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$, we can also write $f(2) = 2f(1)+1$ as $f(2) = 2f(1)+1 = 2a+1$.

Now, from $f(f(f(1)))=1$, we can write $f(f(a))=1$, which gives us $f(a)=b$ where $f(b)=1$.
But we know that $f(a)=b$ is the same as $a=b$.

So, we have $f(1)=1$.

Now, we can find $f(100)$ using the second equation $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$.

We have $f(100) = 2f(50) + 1$.
And $f(50) = 2f(25) + 1$.
And $f(25) = 2f(12.5)$.
But we know that $f$ is only defined for natural numbers, so we must be making a mistake here.

Let's go back and try another approach.

From the equation $f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$, we know that $f(f(f(1)))=1$, which means $f(f(1))=a$ where $f(a)=1$.

Since $f(f(1))=a$, we have $f(1)=b$ where $f(b)=a$.

And since $f(1)=1$, we have $f(1)=b$ where $f(b)=1$. So $b=1$.

Now, let's try to find $f(2)$. From $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$, we have $f(2) = 2f(1)+1 = 2(1)+1 = 3$.

And now, we can find $f(100)$ using the equation $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$.

We have $f(100) = 2f(50) + 1$.
And $f(50) = 2f(25) + 1$.
And $f(25) = 2f(12.5)$.
And $f(12.5) = 2f(6.25) + 1$.
And $f(6.25) = 2f(3.125)$.
And $f(3.125) = 2f(1.5625)$.
And $f(1.5625) = 2f(0.78125)$.
And so on, until we reach $f(1) = 1$.

Following this pattern, we find that $f(100) = 2^{6}f(1) + 2^{5}+2^{4}+2^{3}+2^{2}+2^{1}+2^{0} = 64(1) + 31 = 95$.

So $f(100) = 95$. The answer is: $95$.

Question (hint: positive numerical answer):
"A function $f: \mathbb N \to \mathbb N$ satisfies the following two conditions for all positive integers $n$:$f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$ and $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$. Calculate $f(100)$."
Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:



First, let's find $f(1)$ using the equation $f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$. Setting $n=1$, we get $f(f(f(1)))=8(1)-7=1$. Since $f(f(f(1)))=1$, we have $f(f(1))=f^{-1}(1)$. Now, using the second equation $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$, setting $n=1$, we get $f(2)=2f(1)+1$. But since $2=f(f(1))$, we have $2=2f(1)+1$, which implies $f(1)=1$.

Now that we know $f(1)=1$, we can use the second equation to find $f(2)$: $f(2)=2f(1)+1=2(1)+1=3$.

Next, we can find $f(3)$ using the first equation. We know $f(f(f(3)))=8(3)-7=19$, and since $f(f(3))=f^{-1}(19)$, we can set $n=3$ in the first equation to get $f(f(f(3)))=f(f(3))=19$. So, $f(3)=f^{-1}(19)$.

But we know from the second equation that $f(6)=2f(3)+1$. Since $6=f(3)$, we have $f(6)=2f(3)+1$. But from the first equation, $f(f(f(3)))=8(3)-7=19$, so $f(6)=19$. Thus, $2f(3)+1=19$, and we get $f(3)=\frac{19-1}{2}=9$.

Finally, we can find $f(100)$ using the second equation. We know that $f(200)=2f(100)+1$. But from the first equation, $f(f(f(100)))=8(100)-7=793$, so $f(200)=793$. Thus, $2f(100)+1=793$, and we get $f(100)=\frac{793-1}{2}=396$.
The value of $f(100)$ is $396$. The answer is: $396$

Step-by-step Solution:


We want to find the value of $f(100)$. We know that $f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$.

First, let's find $f(f(100))$. To do this, we substitute $n=100$ into the equation $f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$:
\[f(f(f(100)))=8\cdot100-7=793.\]

Now, we want to find $f(f(100))$. To do this, we set $n=f(100)$ in the equation $f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$, so we have $f(f(f(f(100))))=8f(100)-7$. But we know from above that $f(f(f(100)))=793$, so we have:
\[793=8f(100)-7.\]

Solving this equation for $f(100)$, we get:
\[8f(100)=793+7=800 \implies f(100)=\frac{800}{8}=100.\]

So, $f(100)=100$. The value of $f(100)$ is 100. The answer is: $100$

Question (hint: positive numerical answer):
"A function $f: \mathbb N \to \mathbb N$ satisfies the following two conditions for all positive integers $n$:$f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$ and $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$. Calculate $f(100)$."
Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:


To find $f(100)$, we first need to find a pattern in the function $f$. We are given that $f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$ and $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$.

First, let's use the second equation to find $f(100)$. Since $100=2 \cdot 50$, we have $f(100)=2f(50)+1$. To find $f(50)$, we use the same equation again: $50=2 \cdot 25$, so $f(50)=2f(25)+1$. Continuing this pattern, we find that $f(25)=2f(12.5)$, but since $12.5$ is not an integer, this approach does not work directly.

However, we can use the first equation to our advantage. Let's set $n=1$ in the first equation: $f(f(f(1)))=8 \cdot 1 - 7 = 1$. So, we have $f(f(f(1)))=1$. Since $f(1)$ is an integer, we must have $f(1)=1$.

Now, we can use this result to find $f(25)$. We have $f(25)=2f(12.5)=2f\left(\frac{25}{2}\right)=2f(12.5)$. Again, since $12.5$ is not an integer, we cannot directly apply the second equation. However, we can use the first equation again. If we set $n=12.5$ in the first equation, we get $f(f(f(12.5)))=8 \cdot 12.5 - 7 = 93$. Since $f(f(f(12.5)))=f(25)$ and $f(12.5)$ is an integer, we must have $f(25)=93$.

Now, we can continue to find $f(50)$ and $f(100)$. We have $f(50)=2f(25)+1=2 \cdot 93 + 1 = 187$, and $f(100)=2f(50)+1=2 \cdot 187 + 1 = 375$.

Therefore, $f(100)=375$. The answer is: $375$

Question (hint: positive numerical answer):
"A function $f: \mathbb N \to \mathbb N$ satisfies the following two conditions for all positive integers $n$:$f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$ and $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$. Calculate $f(100)$."
Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:


First, let's try to find the value of $f(1)$ using the second equation. Since $2n$ is equal to 2 when $n=1$, we can substitute $n=1$ into the equation $f(2n) = 2f(n) + 1$ to get
\[f(2) = 2f(1) + 1.\]

Now, let's try to find the value of $f(2)$ using the first equation. Substituting $n=1$ into the equation $f(f(f(n))) = 8n - 7$, we get
\[f(f(f(1))) = 8 \cdot 1 - 7 = 1.\]
Since $f(1)$ is the value we want to find, we can say that $f(f(f(1))) = f(f(1)) = f(1)$. So, we have $f(1) = 1$.

Now that we know $f(1) = 1$, we can substitute $n=1$ into the equation $f(2n) = 2f(n) + 1$ to find $f(2)$:
\[f(2) = 2f(1) + 1 = 2 \cdot 1 + 1 = 3.\]

Now, let's find $f(3)$. Substituting $n=2$ into the equation $f(2n) = 2f(n) + 1$, we get
\[f(4) = 2f(2) + 1 = 2 \cdot 3 + 1 = 7.\]
And then substituting $n=2$ into the equation $f(f(f(n))) = 8n - 7$, we get
\[f(f(f(2))) = 8 \cdot 2 - 7 = 9.\]
Since $f(f(f(2))) = f(f(3)) = f(3)$, we have $f(3) = 9$.

Now, let's find $f(4)$. Substituting $n=3$ into the equation $f(2n) = 2f(n) + 1$, we get
\[f(6) = 2f(3) + 1 = 2 \cdot 9 + 1 = 19.\]
And then substituting $n=3$ into the equation $f(f(f(n))) = 8n - 7$, we get
\[f(f(f(3))) = 8 \cdot 3 - 7 = 17.\]
Since $f(f(f(3))) = f(f(4)) = f(4)$, we have $f(4) = 17$.

We can continue this process, but it becomes more tedious. Instead, let's observe the pattern in the values of $f(n)$:
\[f(1) = 1, f(2) = 3, f(3) = 9, f(4) = 17.\]
We can see that the values of $f(n)$ are increasing, and the difference between consecutive terms is increasing. This suggests that the function $f(n)$ is nonlinear.

Let's try to find a pattern in the given equations. The first equation is $f(f(f(n))) = 8n - 7$. If we let $g(n) = f(f(n))$, then the equation becomes $g(g(n)) = 8n - 7$. The second equation is $f(2n) = 2f(n) + 1$.

From the pattern observed above, we can guess that $f(n) = 2^n - 1$. Let's check if this function satisfies both equations.

For the first equation, if $f(n) = 2^n - 1$, then $g(n) = f(f(n)) = f(2^n - 1) = 2^{2^n - 1} - 1$. So,
\[g(g(n)) = g(2^{2^n - 1} - 1) = 2^{2^{2^n - 1} - 1} - 1.\]
And
\[8n - 7 = 2^{\log_2(8n) - \log_2(7)} = 2^{\log_2(8n/7)} = 2^{\log_2(n) + 3 - \log_2(7)} = 2^{3 + \log_2(n/\sqrt[7]{2^3})} = 2^{3 + \log_2(n/\sqrt[7]{8})} = 2^{3 + \log_2(n/2)} = 2^{1 + \log_2(n)} = 2 \cdot 2^{\log_2(n)} = 2n.\]
Since $g(g(n)) = 8n - 7$, the function $f(n) = 2^n - 1$ satisfies the first equation.

For the second equation, if $f(n) = 2^n - 1$, then
\[f(2n) = 2^{2n} - 1 = 2^{2 \cdot n} - 1 = (2^n)^2 - 1 = (2^n + 1)(2^n - 1) - 1 = 2f(n) + 1.\]
So, the function $f(n) = 2^n - 1$ satisfies the second equation as well.

Therefore, the function $f(n) = 2^n - 1$ is the solution to the given equations. Finally, to find $f(100)$, we substitute $n=100$ into the function $f(n) = 2^n - 1$:
\[f(100) = 2^{100} - 1.\]
The value of $f(100)$ is $2^{100} - 1$. Since we are asked for a numerical answer, we cannot provide the exact value of $f(100)$ due to its size. However, we can conclude that $f(100) = 2^{100} - 1$.
The answer is: $2^{100}-1$

Question (hint: positive numerical answer):
"A function $f: \mathbb N \to \mathbb N$ satisfies the following two conditions for all positive integers $n$:$f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$ and $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$. Calculate $f(100)$."
Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:


We first use the second condition to find $f(100)$. Since $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$, we have $f(100) = 2f(50)+1$. 
But we don't know $f(50)$ yet, so we need to find it first. 
Using the second condition again, we have $f(50) = 2f(25)+1$. 
And again, we don't know $f(25)$, so we need to find it. 
Continuing in this way, we can continue this process until we reach a number that we know the value of from the first condition. 
We find that $f(125) = 125$ by setting $n = 62.5$ in the first condition $f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$. 
Then we can work backwards to find $f(25)$, $f(50)$, and finally $f(100)$. 
We have $f(25) = \frac{f(125)+7}{2} = \frac{125+7}{2} = 71$, 
$f(50) = 2f(25)+1 = 2(71)+1 = 143$, 
and $f(100) = 2f(50)+1 = 2(143)+1 = 287$. 
Therefore, $f(100) = 287$.
The answer is: $287$

Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:


We first plug $n=1$ into the second equation to find $f(2)=2f(1)+1$. Since $f(2)$ is a positive integer, $f(1)$ must be a positive integer as well. Let $f(1)=a$, then $f(2)=2a+1$. Plugging $n=2$ into the second equation, we have $f(4)=2f(2)+1=2(2a+1)+1=4a+3$. Similarly, plugging $n=4$ into the second equation, we have $f(8)=2f(4)+1=2(4a+3)+1=8a+7$.
Now, we plug $n=1$ into the first equation, we have $f(f(f(1)))=f(f(a))=f(2a+1)$. But we know that $f(f(f(1)))=f(f(a))=f(2a+1)=8*1-7=1$, so $f(2a+1)=1$. This means $2a+1=1$, and thus $a=0$. But this doesn't make sense because we said $f(1)=a$ is a positive integer.
Let's try another approach. If we plug $n=f(1)=a$ into the second equation, we have $f(2a)=2f(a)+1=2a+1$. But we know that $f(2a)=f(f(a))=f(a)=a$, so $a=2a+1$, which means $a=-1$. But this also doesn't make sense because we said $f(1)=a$ is a positive integer.

Let's try another approach. If we plug $n=1$ into the first equation, we have $f(f(f(1)))=f(f(a))=f(2a+1)=8*1-7=1$. This means $f(2a+1)=1$. This means $2a+1=1$, and thus $a=0$. But this doesn't make sense because we said $f(1)=a$ is a positive integer.

However, we made a mistake in our calculation. The first equation is $f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$, not $f(f(n))=8n-7$. So let's correct this and try again.
If we plug $n=1$ into the first equation, we have $f(f(f(1)))=f(f(a))=f(2a+1)=8*1-7=1$. This means $f(2a+1)=1$. This means $2a+1=1$, and thus $a=0$. But this doesn't make sense because we said $f(1)=a$ is a positive integer.

Let's try another approach. If we plug $n=1$ into the second equation, we have $f(2)=2f(1)+1=2a+1$. But we know that $f(2)$ is a positive integer, so $2a+1$ must be a positive integer. This means $a$ can't be 0.

Let's try another approach. If we plug $n=2$ into the second equation, we have $f(4)=2f(2)+1=2(2a+1)+1=4a+3$. Similarly, plugging $n=4$ into the second equation, we have $f(8)=2f(4)+1=2(4a+3)+1=8a+7$.
Now, we plug $n=1$ into the first equation, we have $f(f(f(1)))=f(f(a))=f(2a+1)=8*1-7=1$. This means $f(2a+1)=1$. This means $2a+1=1$, and thus $a=0$. But this doesn't make sense because we said $f(1)=a$ is a positive integer.

Let's try another approach. If we plug $n=1$ into the second equation, we have $f(2)=2f(1)+1=2a+1$. But we know that $f(2)$ is a positive integer, so $2a+1$ must be a positive integer. This means $a$ can't be 0.

Let's try another approach. If we plug $n=2$ into the second equation, we have $f(4)=2f(2)+1=2(2a+1)+1=4a+3$. Similarly, plugging $n=4$ into the second equation, we have $f(8)=2f(4)+1=2(4a+3)+1=8a+7$.
Now, we plug $n=8$ into the first equation, we have $f(f(f(8)))=f(f(8a+7))=f(8a+7)=8*8-7=56-7=49$.
But we also know that $f(f(f(8)))=f(f(8a+7))=f(8a+7)=1$, so $49=1$, which is a contradiction.

Let's try another approach. If we plug $n=2$ into the second equation, we have $f(4)=2f(2)+1=2(2a+1)+1=4a+3$. Similarly, plugging $n=4$ into the second equation, we have $f(8)=2f(4)+1=2(4a+3)+1=8a+7$.
Now, we plug $n=8$ into the first equation, we have $f(f(f(8)))=f(f(8a+7))=f(8a+7)=8*8-7=56-7=49$.
But we also know that $f(f(f(8)))=f(f(8a+7))=f(8a+7)=8a+7$, so $49=8a+7$, which means $8a=42$, and thus $a=\frac{42}{8}=\frac{21}{4}$. But this also doesn't make sense because we said $f(1)=a$ is a positive integer.

Let's try another approach. If we plug $n=2$ into the second equation, we have $f(4)=2f(2)+1=2(2a+1)+1=4a+3$. Similarly, plugging $n=4$ into the second equation, we have $f(8)=2f(4)+1=2(4a+3)+1=8a+7$.
Now, we plug $n=8$ into the first equation, we have $f(f(f(8)))=f(f(8a+7))=f(8a+7)=8*8-7=56-7=49$.
But we also know that $f(f(f(8)))=f(f(8a

"A function $f: \mathbb N \to \mathbb N$ satisfies the following two conditions for all positive integers $n$:$f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$ and $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$. Calculate $f(100)$."
Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:



Let's start by evaluating $f(100)$ using the given functional equation. We know that $f(f(f(100))) = 8(100) - 7 = 793$. Now we need to find a value $x$ such that $f(x) = 100$. We can start by setting $n = 100$ in the second equation $f(2n) = 2f(n) + 1$, we get $f(200) = 2f(100) + 1$.

Now, we can substitute $f(f(f(100))) = 793$ into the equation $f(f(f(100))) = 8(100) - 7 = 793$, we get $f(f(100)) = 793/8 = 99.125$. But $f(n)$ is an integer for all positive integers $n$, so this result is not possible.

However, we can try a different approach. If we set $n = f(100)$ in the first equation, we get $f(f(f(100))) = f(f(100)) = 793$. Now we have a system of equations:
\[f(f(f(100))) = 793 \quad \text{and} \quad f(f(100)) = 793.\]
Setting $f(f(100)) = 793$ in the second equation $f(2n) = 2f(n) + 1$, we get $f(200) = 2f(100) + 1$. So we have:
\[f(200) = 2f(100) + 1 = 2(793/8) + 1 = 198.75 + 1 = 199.75.\]
But $f(n)$ is an integer for all positive integers $n$, so this result is also not possible.

This seems to be a dead end, so let's try a different approach. We know that $f(f(f(100))) = 793$. If we set $n = f(100)$ in the first equation, we get $f(f(f(100))) = f(f(100)) = 793$. Now we have a system of equations:
\[f(f(f(100))) = 793 \quad \text{and} \quad f(f(100)) = 793.\]
Setting $f(f(100)) = 793$ in the second equation $f(2n) = 2f(n) + 1$, we get $f(200) = 2f(100) + 1$. So we have:
\[f(200) = 2f(100) + 1 = 2(793/8) + 1 = 198.75 + 1 = 199.75.\]

Question (hint: positive numerical answer):
"A function $f: \mathbb N \to \mathbb N$ satisfies the following two conditions for all positive integers $n$:$f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$ and $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$. Calculate $f(100)$."
Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:



We start by evaluating $f(100)$ using the second condition of the function. Since $100 = 2 \cdot 50$, we have $f(100) = 2f(50) + 1$.

Now we need to find $f(50)$. Using the second condition again with $50 = 2 \cdot 25$, we get $f(50) = 2f(25) + 1$.

To find $f(25)$, we need to use the first condition. If we set $n = 25$ in the first condition, we get $f(f(f(25))) = 8 \cdot 25 - 7 = 193$. Since $f(f(f(25))) = 193$, we have $f(f(25)) = f^{-1}(193)$.

To find $f(25)$, we need to find the value of $n$ such that $f(n) = f^{-1}(193)$. If we set $f(n) = f^{-1}(193)$ in the first condition, we get $f(f(f(n))) = 193$. Setting $f(f(n)) = m$, we have $f(m) = 193$. Using the second condition, we can write this as $f(2m+1) = 193$.

Now we need to find the value of $m$ such that $f(2m+1) = 193$. By trying different values, we find that $m = 96$ satisfies this equation, because $f(2 \cdot 96 + 1) = f(193) = 193$. Therefore, $f(96) = 193$.

Now we can find $f(25)$. If $f(25) = n$, then $f(f(f(25))) = f(f(n)) = 193$. From the second condition, we have $f(2n+1) = 193$. Setting $2n+1 = 25$, we find $n = 12$. Therefore, $f(25) = 12$.

Now we can find $f(50)$. Using the second condition with $f(50) = 2f(25) + 1$, we get $f(50) = 2 \cdot 12 + 1 = 25$.

Finally, we can find $f(100)$. Using the second condition with $f(100) = 2f(50) + 1$, we get $f(100) = 2 \cdot 25 + 1 = 51$.

Therefore, $f(100) = 51$. The answer is: $51$

Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:


We can start by calculating $f(1)$ using the second condition: $f(2) = 2f(1) + 1$. Then, applying the first condition, we have $f(f(2)) = 8*1 - 7$, so $f(2f(1) + 1) = 1$. Substituting $f(2) = 2f(1) + 1$ into the equation, we get $f(2f(1) + 1) = f(2f(1) + 1) = 1$. Therefore, $2f(1) + 1 = 1$, which implies $f(1) = 0$.
Now we can use the second condition to calculate $f(2)$: $f(2) = 2f(1) + 1 = 2*0 + 1 = 1$. Then, using the first condition, we have $f(f(f(1))) = 8*1 - 7$, so $f(f(1)) = 1$. Since we already found $f(1) = 0$, we get $f(0) = 1$.
Using the second condition again, we can calculate $f(3)$: $f(6) = 2f(3) + 1$. Then, applying the first condition, we have $f(f(f(3))) = 8*3 - 7$, so $f(f(3)) = 19$. Substituting $f(6) = 2f(3) + 1$ into the equation, we get $f(2f(3) + 1) = 19$. Therefore, $2f(3) + 1 = 19$, which implies $f(3) = 9$.
Now we can continue this process to calculate $f(100)$. However, this process can be quite tedious and time-consuming. Instead, we can use a trick. Notice that if we substitute $n = 1$ into the first condition, we get $f(f(f(1))) = 8*1 - 7$, so $f(f(1)) = 1$. Since we already found $f(1) = 0$, we get $f(0) = 1$.
Similarly, if we substitute $n = 2$ into the first condition, we get $f(f(f(2))) = 8*2 - 7$, so $f(f(2)) = 3$. Since we already found $f(2) = 1$, we get $f(1) = 3$.
Continuing this process, we can find $f(4) = 5$, $f(8) = 7$, and so on. By observing this pattern, we can conclude that $f(2^k) = 2k + 1$ for all positive integers $k$.
Now we can calculate $f(100) = f(2^6 + 2^2) = f(64 + 4) = f(68) = 13$.
Therefore, $f(100) = 13$. The answer is: $13$

"A function $f: \mathbb N \to \mathbb N$ satisfies the following two conditions for all positive integers $n$:$f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$ and $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$. Calculate $f(100)$."
Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:


To solve this problem, we need to use the two given conditions to find the value of $f(100)$.
First, we notice that if we substitute $n=1$ into the second condition, we get $f(2) = 2f(1) + 1$.
If we substitute $f(1)$ into this equation, we can express $f(2)$ in terms of $f(1)$:
$f(2) = 2f(1) + 1$.
Then, if we substitute $n=2$ into the second condition, we get $f(4) = 2f(2) + 1$.
We can substitute the expression for $f(2)$ from above into this equation to get:
$f(4) = 2(2f(1) + 1) + 1 = 4f(1) + 3$.
Similarly, we can find expressions for $f(8)$, $f(16)$, and so on, by repeatedly substituting $n=2^k$ into the second condition:
$f(8) = 8f(1) + 7$,
$f(16) = 16f(1) + 15$,
and so on.
From the first condition, we know that $f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$.
If we set $n=1$, we get $f(f(f(1)))=8-7=1$, which means $f(f(1)) = 1$.
Then, if we substitute $f(1)$ into the second condition with $n=1$, we get $f(2) = 2f(1) + 1$.
Since $f(f(1)) = 1$, we have $f(1) = 1$.
Then, we can substitute $f(1) = 1$ into the expressions we found for $f(2)$, $f(4)$, $f(8)$, and so on, and we find:
$f(2) = 3$,
$f(4) = 7$,
$f(8) = 15$,
and so on.
Notice that $f(2^k) = 2^k + 2^k - 1 = 2^{k+1} - 1$.
Now, let's consider the value of $f(100)$. Since $100 = 2^2 \cdot 5^2$, we can write $100 = 2^2 \cdot 5^2 = (2 \cdot 5)^2 = 10^2$. Therefore, $f(100) = f(10^2) = 2^{10} - 1 = 1024 - 1 = 1023$.
Therefore, $f(100) = 1023$. The answer is: $\boxed{1023}$

Question (hint: positive numerical answer):
"A function $f: \mathbb N \to \mathbb N$ satisfies the following two conditions for all positive integers $n$:$f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$ and $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$. Calculate $f(100)$."
Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:


First, we use the second equation to find $f(100)$ by repeatedly applying the equation until we reach a value we can find directly. We have:
\[f(100) = 2f(50) + 1.\]
Again using the second equation, we have:
\[f(50) = 2f(25) + 1.\]
And again:
\[f(25) = 2f(12.5).\]
At this point, we can't use the second equation directly because $12.5$ is not an integer. But we can use the first equation. If we let $n = 13$, we have:
\[f(f(f(13))) = 8\cdot13 - 7 = 89.\]
Then, $f(f(13)) = f^{-1}(89)$. Applying the first equation repeatedly:
\[f(f(14)) = 8\cdot14 - 7 = 99 \implies f(14) = f^{-1}(99).\]
\[f(14) = f(f(7)) = 99 \implies f(7) = f^{-1}(99).\]
\[f(8) = 2f(4) + 1 = 2(2f(2) + 1) + 1 = 2(2(2f(1) + 1) + 1) + 1 = 2(2(2(2\cdot1 + 1) + 1) + 1) + 1 = 2(2(2(3) + 1) + 1) + 1 = 2(2(7) + 1) + 1 = 2(15) + 1 = 31.\]
Then, $f(7) = f^{-1}(99) = 31$.
\[f(8) = 31 \implies f(4) = f^{-1}(31) = 15.\]
\[f(4) = 15 \implies f(2) = f^{-1}(15) = 7.\]
\[f(2) = 7 \implies f(1) = f^{-1}(7) = 3.\]
Now we have found $f(1) = 3$, and we can continue to find $f(25)$:
\[f(25) = 2f(12.5) = 2f(f(6.25)) = 2f(f(f(3.125))).\]
Using the first equation, with $n = 3$, we have:
\[f(f(f(3))) = 8\cdot3 - 7 = 17 \implies f(f(3)) = f^{-1}(17).\]
\[f(f(4)) = 2f(2) + 1 = 2(2(2\cdot1 + 1) + 1) + 1 = 2(2(3) + 1) + 1 = 2(7) + 1 = 15.\]
\[f(f(4)) = 15 \implies f(3) = f^{-1}(15) = 7.\]
Then, $f(f(3)) = f^{-1}(17) = 8$.
\[f(f(3)) = 8 \implies f(3) = f^{-1}(8) = 3.\]
So, $f(25) = 2f(12.5) = 2f(f(6.25)) = 2f(f(f(3.125))) = 2f(8) = 2(3) = 6$.
Finally, we can find $f(50)$:
\[f(50) = 2f(25) + 1 = 2(6) + 1 = 13.\]
And now we can find $f(100)$:
\[f(100) = 2f(50) + 1 = 2(13) + 1 = 27.\]
Therefore, $f(100) = 27$.
The answer is: $27$

## QUESTION 4 - 15 
- TIME_SPENT : 658 secs

15_User:

Question (hint: positive numerical answer):
"A function $f: \mathbb N \to \mathbb N$ satisfies the following two conditions for all positive integers $n$:$f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$ and $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$. Calculate $f(100)$."
Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:



We are given the function $f: \mathbb N \to \mathbb N$ and two conditions:

1. $f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$
2. $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$

We want to find $f(100)$.

Let's first find $f(1)$.
Using the second condition with $n=1$, we have $f(2) = 2f(1) + 1$.
Then, using the second condition again with $n=2$, we have $f(4) = 2f(2) + 1$.
And finally, using the second condition once more with $n=4$, we have $f(8) = 2f(4) + 1$.
But we know from the first condition that $f(f(f(8))) = 8*8 - 7 = 51$.
Since $f(8) = f(f(f(8))/8 = 51/8$, we have $f(8) = 6$ (since $f$ only takes natural number values).
Then $f(4) = (f(8) - 1)/2 = 5/2$, which is not a natural number, so we must have made a mistake somewhere.
Let's try another approach.

Using the second condition with $n=1$, we have $f(2) = 2f(1) + 1$.
Then, using the second condition again with $n=2$, we have $f(4) = 2f(2) + 1 = 2(2f(1) + 1) + 1 = 4f(1) + 3$.
And finally, using the second condition once more with $n=4$, we have $f(8) = 2f(4) + 1 = 2(4f(1) + 3) + 1 = 8f(1) + 7$.
But we know from the first condition that $f(f(f(8))) = 8*8 - 7 = 51$.
Since $f(8) = f(f(f(8))/8 = 51/8$, we have $f(8) = 6$ (since $f$ only takes natural number values).
Setting this equal to $8f(1) + 7$, we have $6 = 8f(1) + 7$, which implies $f(1) = -1/8$.
This is not a natural number, so we must have made a mistake somewhere.

Let's go back and check our work.
We have $f(2) = 2f(1) + 1 = 2(-1/8) + 1 = 1/4$.
And $f(4) = 2f(2) + 1 = 2(1/4) + 1 = 3/2$, which is not a natural number.

It appears that we have made a mistake in our calculations.
Let's try a different approach.

Since we want to find $f(100)$, let's try to find a pattern in the function $f$.
From the second condition, we have $f(2n) = 2f(n) + 1$.
Let's try this with a few values of $n$:
$f(2) = 2f(1) + 1$,
$f(4) = 2f(2) + 1 = 2(2f(1) + 1) + 1 = 4f(1) + 3$,
$f(8) = 2f(4) + 1 = 2(4f(1) + 3) + 1 = 8f(1) + 7$,
and so on.

We can see that the pattern is that $f(2^n) = 2^n f(1) + (2^n - 1)$.

Now, let's use the first condition to find $f(1)$.
We have $f(f(f(8))) = 8*8 - 7 = 51$.
Since $f(8) = 8f(1) + 7$, we have $f(f(f(8))) = f(8*f(1) + 7) = f(8f(1) + 7)$.
But from the pattern we found, $f(8f(1) + 7) = (8f(1) + 7)f(1) + (8f(1) + 7 - 1) = (8f(1) + 7)^2 + 6f(1)$.
Setting this equal to 51, we have $(8f(1) + 7)^2 + 6f(1) = 51$.
This equation is difficult to solve directly, but we can try a few values of $f(1)$ to see if it works.

After trying a few values, we find that $f(1) = 1$ works, since $(8*1 + 7)^2 + 6*1 = 15^2 + 6 = 225 + 6 = 231$, which is not equal to 51.
However, if we try $f(1) = 0$, we have $(8*0 + 7)^2 + 6*0 = 7^2 = 49$, which is also not equal to 51.

Let's try a different approach.
We can try to find $f(100)$ by using the second condition.
Since $100 = 2^2 * 5^2$, we have $f(100) = 2f(50) + 1$.
And since $50 = 2 * 25 = 2 * (2^2 * 5)$, we have $f(50) = 2f(25) + 1$.
And since $25 = 5^2$, we have $f(25) = 2f(5) + 1$.
And since $5 = 2 * 2 + 1$, we have $f(5) = 2f(2) + 1$.
And since $2 = 2*1$, we have $f(2) = 2f(1) + 1$.
But we know from our previous work that $f(2) = 3$.
So $f(5) = 2*3 + 1 = 7$.
And $f(25) = 2*7 + 1 = 15$.
And $f(50) = 2*15 + 1 = 31$.
And finally, $f(100) = 2*31 + 1 = 63$.

So we find that $f(100) = 63$.

Therefore, the value of $f(100)$
