Question (hint: positive numerical answer):
"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"
Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:



First, we notice that the product of two numbers is zero if and only if at least one of the numbers is zero. Therefore, we have two cases to consider:

Case 1: $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$.
This means $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ or $\vert x - y \vert = 10$.

Case 2: $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$.
This means $\vert x \vert = 8$ or $\vert y \vert = 8$.

From case 1, we have four lines: $x + y = 10$, $x + y = -10$, $x - y = 10$, and $x - y = -10$.
From case 2, we have four more lines: $x = 8$, $x = -8$, $y = 8$, and $y = -8$.

The lines $x + y = 10$ and $x = 8$ intersect at $(8, 2)$, $x + y = -10$ and $x = 8$ intersect at $(8, -18)$, $x - y = 10$ and $x = 8$ intersect at $(8, -6)$, $x - y = -10$ and $x = 8$ intersect at $(8, 18)$, $x + y = 10$ and $y = 8$ intersect at $(2, 8)$, $x + y = -10$ and $y = 8$ intersect at $(-18, 8)$, $x - y = 10$ and $y = 8$ intersect at $(-6, 8)$, and $x - y = -10$ and $y = 8$ intersect at $(18, 8)$, $x = -8$ and $y = 8$ intersect at $(-8, 8)$.

These lines form a square with side length 16. The area of this square is $16^2 = 256$.

Therefore, the area of the convex polygon is 256. The answer is: 256.

Question (hint: positive numerical answer):
"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"
Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:



The given equation is of the form $AB = 0$, which implies that either $A = 0$ or $B = 0$. So, the points that satisfy the given equation must either satisfy $A = (\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ or $B = (\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$.

For $A = 0$, we have $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. This gives us four lines: $x + y = 10$, $x + y = -10$, $x - y = 10$, and $x - y = -10$.

For $B = 0$, we have $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$. This gives us four lines: $x = 8$, $x = -8$, $y = 8$, and $y = -8$.

These lines enclose a square with side length 16. The area of this square is $16^2 = 256$. So, the area of the convex polygon is 256 square units. The answer is: $256$

Question (hint: positive numerical answer):
"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"
Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:



The given equation is $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$. For the product of two numbers to be zero, either one of them has to be zero. Therefore, we have two cases to consider:

1. $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$. This implies that both $\vert x + y \vert - 10 = 0$ and $\vert x - y \vert - 10 = 0$, which means $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. The solutions to these equations are the lines $x + y = \pm10$ and $x - y = \pm10$.

2. $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$. This implies that both $\vert x \vert - 8 = 0$ and $\vert y \vert - 8 = 0$, which means $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$. The solutions to these equations are the lines $x = \pm8$ and $y = \pm8$.

These lines form a square with side length 16. The area of this square is $16^2 = 256$.
The answer is: 256.

Question (hint: positive numerical answer):
"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"
Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:


First, let's simplify the equation a bit:
$((|x + y| - 10)^2 + (|x - y| - 10)^2)(( |x| - 8)^2 + ( |y| - 8)^2) = 0$.
Since the product of two numbers is zero if and only if at least one of the numbers is zero, we have two cases:
1. $(|x + y| - 10)^2 + (|x - y| - 10)^2 = 0$.
2. $(|x| - 8)^2 + (|y| - 8)^2 = 0$.
For the first case, we have $|x + y| = 10$ and $|x - y| = 10$.
These equations represent two pairs of parallel lines, namely $x + y = 10$ and $x + y = -10$, as well as $x - y = 10$ and $x - y = -10$.
The intersection points of these lines are $(5,5)$, $(5,-5)$, $(-5,5)$, and $(-5,-5)$.
For the second case, we have $|x| = 8$ and $|y| = 8$.
These equations represent two pairs of parallel lines, namely $x = 8$ and $x = -8$, as well as $y = 8$ and $y = -8$.
The intersection points of these lines are $(8,8)$, $(8,-8)$, $(-8,8)$, and $(-8,-8)$.
The convex polygon formed by these points is a square with side length $10$.
Therefore, the area of this square is $10^2 = 100$.
The answer is: 100.

"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"
Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:


The product of two numbers is zero if and only if at least one of the numbers is zero. So, the given equation is zero if and only if either
$$((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2) = 0$$
or
$$((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0.$$
The first equation is zero if and only if $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. These are the equations of two pairs of parallel lines that are each $10$ units apart. The second equation is zero if and only if $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$, which are the equations of four lines that are each $8$ units from the origin.

The four lines $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$ form a square with side length $16$. The lines $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$ intersect the square at its midpoints, forming a larger square with side length $20$.

The area of the smaller square is $16^2 = 256$, and the area of the larger square is $20^2 = 400$. The area of the convex polygon enclosed by the points satisfying the given equation is the difference between the areas of the two squares, which is $400 - 256 = 144$.

So, the area of the convex polygon is $144$. The answer is: $144$.

"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"
Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:


The product of two real numbers is zero if and only if at least one of the numbers is zero. Therefore, for the equation to hold, either
\[((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2) = 0\]
or
\[((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0.\]
The first equation holds if and only if $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. These are the equations of two lines in the coordinate plane, so they do not enclose a region.
The second equation holds if and only if $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$, which are the equations of two squares in the coordinate plane with side length 16. The intersection of these squares forms a 8 by 16 rectangle, which is the region enclosed by the points that satisfy the given equation. The area of this rectangle is $8 \times 16 = 128$.
The answer is: 128

Question (hint: positive numerical answer):
"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"
Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:


The equation $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ is satisfied only when at least one of the factors is zero. This happens when either $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$.

If $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$, then both $\vert x + y \vert - 10 = 0$ and $\vert x - y \vert - 10 = 0$, which means $x + y = 10$ and $x - y = 10$ or $x + y = 10$ and $x - y = -10$. Solving these equations gives the vertices of the polygon as $(0, 10), (10, 0), (0, -10), (-10, 0)$.

If $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$, then both $\vert x \vert - 8 = 0$ and $\vert y \vert - 8 = 0$, which means $x = 8$ and $y = 8$ or $x = -8$ and $y = -8$. So we get two more vertices of the polygon as $(8, 8)$ and $(-8, -8)$.

The vertices of the polygon are thus $(0, 10), (10, 0), (0, -10), (-10, 0), (8, 8), (-8, -8)$.

This is a regular hexagon with side length 10. The area of a regular hexagon with side length $a$ is $\frac{3\sqrt{3}}{2}a^2$. Substituting $a = 10$ into the formula gives the area of the hexagon as $\frac{3\sqrt{3}}{2} \cdot 10^2 = 150\sqrt{3}$.
The answer is: $150\sqrt{3}$

Question (hint: positive numerical answer):
"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"
Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:



The given equation is $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$. For the product of two numbers to be zero, either one of the numbers must be zero. This gives us two separate cases to consider.

Case 1: $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$.
In this case, both $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2$ and $( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2$ must be zero. This implies that $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. The only way this can happen is if $x = \pm 10$ and $y = \pm 10$. So the four points in this case are $(10, 10)$, $(10, -10)$, $(-10, 10)$, and $(-10, -10)$.

Case 2: $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$.
In this case, both $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2$ and $( \vert y \vert - 8)^2$ must be zero. This implies that $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$. The only way this can happen is if $x = \pm 8$ and $y = \pm 8$. So the four points in this case are $(8, 8)$, $(8, -8)$, $(-8, 8)$, and $(-8, -8)$.

Therefore, the eight points that satisfy the equation are $(10, 10)$, $(10, -10)$, $(-10, 10)$, $(-10, -10)$, $(8, 8)$, $(8, -8)$, $(-8, 8)$, and $(-8, -8)$. These points form a square with side length $20$. The area of this square is $20^2 = 400$.
The answer is: $400$

Question (hint: positive numerical answer):
"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"
Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:


The expression $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2)$ equals zero if and only if either $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$, or $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$.
This means that either $\vert x + y \vert = 10$, $\vert x - y \vert = 10$, $\vert x \vert = 8$, or $\vert y \vert = 8$.
The equations $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$ represent two squares with side length 10 centered at the origin.
The equations $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$ represent two squares with side length 16 centered at the origin.
The intersection of these four squares is the convex polygon we are looking for.
The area of the convex polygon is the sum of the areas of the two squares with side length 10 minus the sum of the areas of the two squares with side length 8.
The area of a square with side length $a$ is $a^2$, so the area of the convex polygon is $(10^2 + 10^2) - (8^2 + 8^2) = 200 - 128 = 72$.
The answer is: 72

Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:


The expression equals zero if either of the two factors equals zero. This gives us two sets of equations to solve:

1. $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0 \Rightarrow \vert x + y \vert = 10 \Rightarrow x + y = \pm 10$
2. $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0 \Rightarrow \vert x - y \vert = 10 \Rightarrow x - y = \pm 10$
3. $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0 \Rightarrow \vert x \vert = 8 \Rightarrow x = \pm 8$
4. $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0 \Rightarrow \vert y \vert = 8 \Rightarrow y = \pm 8$

The system of equations $x + y = \pm 10$ and $x - y = \pm 10$ gives us the lines $y = x \pm 10$ and $y = -x \pm 10$. The system of equations $x = \pm 8$ and $y = \pm 8$ gives us the lines $x = 8$ and $x = -8$ and the lines $y = 8$ and $y = -8$.

The intersection points of these lines are the vertices of the polygon:

1. $(8, 8)$
2. $(8, -8)$
3. $(-8, 8)$
4. $(-8, -8)$
5. $(10, 0)$
6. $(-10, 0)$
7. $(0, 10)$
8. $(0, -10)$

The polygon is a square with side length $20$. The area of the square is $20^2 = 400$.
The answer is: $400$

Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:



The given equation is $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$. For the product of two numbers to be zero, either one of the numbers must be zero. So, either $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$.

The first equation can only be true if both $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ and $( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$, which means that $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. The solutions to these equations are the lines $x + y = 10$, $x + y = -10$, $x - y = 10$, and $x - y = -10$.

The second equation can only be true if both $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ and $( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$, which means that $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$. The solutions to these equations are the lines $x = 8$, $x = -8$, $y = 8$, and $y = -8$.

The points that satisfy the given equation are the intersections of these lines. The convex polygon is a square with side length 10. The area of this square is $10 \times 10 = 100$. So, the area of the convex polygon is 100. The answer is: $100$

Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:


The expression $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ is equal to zero if and only if at least one of the factors is equal to zero. This gives us four cases to consider:

Case 1: $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$. This implies $\vert x + y \vert = 10$, or equivalently, $x + y = \pm 10$.

Case 2: $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$. This implies $\vert x - y \vert = 10$, or equivalently, $x - y = \pm 10$.

Case 3: $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$. This implies $\vert x \vert = 8$, or equivalently, $x = \pm 8$.

Case 4: $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$. This implies $\vert y \vert = 8$, or equivalently, $y = \pm 8$.

The solutions to these equations form a square with vertices at $(\pm 8, \pm 8)$. The area of this square is $8^2 = 64$.

Therefore, the area of the convex polygon is 64 square units. The answer is: $64$

Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:



For the product of two factors to be zero, one or both of the factors must be zero. Therefore, we have two cases to consider:

Case 1: $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ and $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$.
This implies $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$.
For the first equation, we have two possibilities: $x + y = 10$ or $x + y = -10$.
For the second equation, we also have two possibilities: $x - y = 10$ or $x - y = -10$.

Case 2: $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ and $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$.
This implies $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$.
For the first equation, we have two possibilities: $x = 8$ or $x = -8$.
For the second equation, we also have two possibilities: $y = 8$ or $y = -8$.

By solving these four systems of equations, we find that the points that satisfy the original equation are:
$(8,8)$, $(8,-8)$, $(-8,8)$, and $(-8,-8)$. These points form a square with side length 16.

To find the area of this square, we simply square the length of one of its sides:
Area = $16^2 = 256$.

The area of the convex polygon formed by these points is 256 square units. The answer is: $\boxed{256}$.
