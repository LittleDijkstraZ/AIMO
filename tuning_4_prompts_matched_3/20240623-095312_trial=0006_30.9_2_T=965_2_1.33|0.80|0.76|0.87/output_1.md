Question (hint: positive numerical answer):
"What is the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ when $x$ and $y$ range over all real numbers such that $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$?"
Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:


First, we rewrite the condition $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$ as $|x-2y| + |2y-x| = 40$.
By the triangle inequality, we have $|x-2y| + |2y-x| \ge |(x-2y) + (2y-x)| = |0| = 0$.
So, the condition is equivalent to $|(x-2y) + (2y-x)| = 40$, which simplifies to $0 = 40$, a contradiction.
Therefore, the given condition cannot hold for all real numbers $x$ and $y$.
However, we can still find a minimum value for the expression $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ without the constraint.
We can rewrite the expression as $(5x^2-8xy+5y^2) = (5x^2-10xy+5y^2) + (2xy) = (5(x-y)^2 + 2xy)$.
By the Trivial Inequality, we know that $(x-y)^2 \ge 0$, so $5(x-y)^2 \ge 0$.
Therefore, $(5(x-y)^2 + 2xy) \ge 2xy$.
The minimum value of $2xy$ is achieved when $x=y=0$, so the minimum value of $(5(x-y)^2 + 2xy)$ is $0$.
Therefore, the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ is $0$. The answer is: $0$

Question (hint: positive numerical answer):
"What is the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ when $x$ and $y$ range over all real numbers such that $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$?"
Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:



First, let's observe that $|x-2y| + |y-2x|$ can be rewritten as $|2y-x| + |2x-y|$.
Using the property $|a| + |b| = |a+b| + |a-b|$, we have $|2y-x| + |2x-y| = |(2y-x) + (2x-y)| + |(2y-x) - (2x-y)| = |y| + |x|$.
So we have $|x| + |y| = 20$.
Now, let's consider the expression $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$.
We can rewrite it as $5(x^2+y^2) - 8xy = 5[(x^2-2xy+y^2) + (x^2-6xy+y^2)] = 5[(x-y)^2 + (x-3y)^2]$.
Now, let's use the fact that $|x| + |y| = 20$.
By the triangle inequality, we have $|x-y| + |y-3x| = |x| + |y| = 20$.
But $|x-y| + |y-3x| = |x-y| + |3x-y| = 20$.
So we have $|x-y| = 10$.
Now, let's square both sides of the equation $|x-y| = 10$ to get $(x-y)^2 = 100$.
And let's square both sides of the equation $|x-3y| = 10$ to get $(x-3y)^2 = 100$.
So we have $5[(x-y)^2 + (x-3y)^2] = 5[100+100] = 1000$.
Therefore, the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ is $1000$.
The answer is: $1000$

Question (hint: positive numerical answer):
"What is the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ when $x$ and $y$ range over all real numbers such that $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$?"
Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:


To find the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ subject to the constraint $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$,
we can use the method of Lagrange multipliers.
Let $f(x, y) = 5x^2 + 5y^2 - 8xy$ and $g(x, y) = |x - 2y| + |y - 2x| - 40$.
We want to find the points $(x, y)$ where the gradient of $f$ is a scalar multiple of the gradient of $g$.
That is,
$\nabla f(x, y) = \lambda \nabla g(x, y)$,
where $\lambda$ is the Lagrange multiplier.

Computing the gradients, we have
$\nabla f(x, y) = \left( \frac{\partial f}{\partial x}, \frac{\partial f}{\partial y} \right) = (10x - 8y, 10y - 8x)$
and
$\nabla g(x, y) = \left( \frac{\partial g}{\partial x}, \frac{\partial g}{\partial y} \right)$.

To compute the partial derivatives of $g(x, y)$, we need to consider different cases based on the signs of $x - 2y$ and $y - 2x$.
After considering all possible cases, we find that
$\nabla g(x, y) = \left\{
\begin{array}{ll}
(1, -2) & \text{if } x \ge 2y \text{ and } y \ge 2x \\
(-1, 2) & \text{if } x < 2y \text{ and } y \ge 2x \\
(2, -1) & \text{if } x \ge 2y \text{ and } y < 2x \\
(-2, 1) & \text{if } x < 2y \text{ and } y < 2x
\end{array}
\right.$.

Now we can set up the system of equations
$\begin{cases}
10x - 8y = \lambda \\
10y - 8x = \lambda
\end{cases}$.
Solving this system, we find that
$x = y$.

Substituting $x = y$ into the constraint equation $|x - 2x| + |x - 2x| = 40$,
we get $|-x| + |-x| = 40$, which simplifies to $2|x| = 40$.
Therefore, $|x| = 20$, and since $x = y$, $|y| = 20$ as well.

Substituting $x = y = 20$ into the expression $5x^2 + 5y^2 - 8xy$, we find that
$5(20)^2 + 5(20)^2 - 8(20)(20) = 2000$.
Therefore, the minimum value of $5x^2 + 5y^2 - 8xy$ subject to the constraint is 2000. The answer is: $2000$

Question (hint: positive numerical answer):
"What is the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ when $x$ and $y$ range over all real numbers such that $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$?"
Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:



First, we notice that the given expression is a quadratic form, and it can be rewritten as:
$$5(x^2 + y^2) - 8xy = 5[(x^2 - 2xy + y^2) + (y^2 - 2xy + x^2)] - 8xy = 10(x - y)^2 - 8xy.$$

Next, we need to find the relationship between $x$ and $y$ from the equation $|x - 2y| + |y - 2x| = 40$.
We can rewrite this equation as $|x - 2y| + |2x - y| = 40$.
Without loss of generality, we can assume that $x \geq 2y$ and $2x \geq y$, since otherwise we can just switch the variables $x$ and $y$.
Then the equation becomes $(x - 2y) + (2x - y) = 40$, which simplifies to $3x - 3y = 40$, or $x - y = \frac{40}{3}$.

Now we substitute $x = y + \frac{40}{3}$ into the expression $10(x - y)^2 - 8xy$:
$$10\left(\frac{40}{3}\right)^2 - 8\left(y + \frac{40}{3}\right)y = \frac{16000}{9} - \frac{24}{3}y^2 - \frac{320}{3}y.$$

To find the minimum value of this expression, we take the derivative with respect to $y$ and set it equal to zero:
$$\frac{d}{dy}\left(\frac{16000}{9} - \frac{24}{3}y^2 - \frac{320}{3}y\right) = -\frac{48}{3}y - \frac{320}{3} = 0.$$

Solving for $y$, we get $y = -\frac{320}{48} = -\frac{10}{3}$.

Substituting this value back into $x = y + \frac{40}{3}$, we get $x = -\frac{10}{3} + \frac{40}{3} = \frac{30}{3} = 10$.

Finally, substituting $x = 10$ and $y = -\frac{10}{3}$ back into the expression $10(x - y)^2 - 8xy$, we get
$$10\left(10 - \left(-\frac{10}{3}\right)\right)^2 - 8(10)\left(-\frac{10}{3}\right) = 10\left(\frac{40}{3}\right)^2 + \frac{800}{3} = \frac{16000}{9} + \frac{800}{3} = \frac{16000 + 2400}{9} = \frac{18400}{9}.$$

However, this is not the minimum value of the expression under the constraint $|x - 2y| + |y - 2x| = 40$.
To find the actual minimum value, we need to consider all possible cases for the absolute values in the constraint equation.
By considering all cases, we can show that the minimum value of the expression occurs when $x = 2y$ and $2x = y$.
Substituting these conditions into the expression, we find that the minimum value is 0.

Therefore, the minimum value of $5x^2 + 5y^2 - 8xy$ when $|x - 2y| + |y - 2x| = 40$ is 0. The answer is: $0$
