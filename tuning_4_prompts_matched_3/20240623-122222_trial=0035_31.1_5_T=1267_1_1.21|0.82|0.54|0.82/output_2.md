Interesting, let's analyze step by step:



The problem is asking for how many positive integers $m$ does the equation \[\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}\] have $4$ distinct solutions.

Firstly, we need to understand the nature of the absolute value function and its piecewise nature. The equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ will have 4 distinct solutions when the right hand side $\frac{m}{100}$ falls within the range of values of the absolute value function, specifically, it needs to be equal to or less than 2. Hence, we need $0 \leq \frac{m}{100} \leq 2$, which implies $0 \leq m \leq 200$.

Now, we need to find out how many integer values of $m$ are there in this range. The possible integer values of $m$ are from 0 to 200, inclusive. To find the total number of these integers, we subtract the smallest possible value from the largest possible value and then add 1.

The smallest possible value is 0 and the largest possible value is 200. So the total number of possible integer values of $m$ is $200 - 0 + 1 = 201$.

However, we know that $m$ cannot be 0 because it would make the right hand side zero and the equation will only have two solutions instead of four. Therefore, we subtract 1 from the total number of possible values of $m$.

So the total number of positive integer values of $m$ for which the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has four distinct solutions is $201 - 1 = 200$.

Therefore, the number of positive integers $m$ for which the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has four distinct solutions is 200.

Since 200 is a positive integer, we have found the correct answer. The value of $m$ that satisfies the condition is $200$.

Hence, the number of positive integers $m$ for which the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has four distinct solutions is 200. The answer is: $200$

Interesting, let's analyze step by step:



The equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has $4$ distinct solutions. This equation is equivalent to a piecewise function with $4$ cases:

1. If $\vert x-1 \vert -2 \geq 0$, then the equation becomes $\vert x-1 \vert -2 = \frac{m}{100}$.
2. If $\vert x-1 \vert -2 < 0$, then the equation becomes $-\vert x-1 \vert +2 = \frac{m}{100}$.

Let's solve each case:

1. $\vert x-1 \vert -2 = \frac{m}{100}$: $\vert x-1 \vert = \frac{m}{100} + 2$. This implies $x-1 = \frac{m}{100} + 2$ or $x-1 = -\frac{m}{100} - 2$. Solving these equations, we get $x = \frac{m}{100} + 3$ or $x = -\frac{m}{100} + 1$.
2. $-\vert x-1 \vert +2 = \frac{m}{100}$: $\vert x-1 \vert = 2 - \frac{m}{100}$. This implies $x-1 = 2 - \frac{m}{100}$ or $x-1 = -\left(2 - \frac{m}{100}\right)$. Solving these equations, we get $x = \frac{m}{100} + 3$ or $x = -\frac{m}{100} + 1$.

As we can see, both cases give the same solutions. Now we need to find the values of $m$ for which there are $4$ distinct solutions. This happens when the right-hand side of the equations, $\frac{m}{100} + 3$ and $-\frac{m}{100} + 1$, are both positive and distinct. This means:

- $\frac{m}{100} + 3 > 0 \Rightarrow m > -300$, but $m$ is a positive integer, so we don't need to worry about this condition.
- $-\frac{m}{100} + 1 > 0 \Rightarrow m < 100$.
- $\frac{m}{100} + 3 \neq -\frac{m}{100} + 1 \Rightarrow m \neq 0$.

So, $0 < m < 100$. The possible values of $m$ are the positive integers from $1$ to $99$. The number of such integers is $99$. Therefore, there are $99$ values of $m$ for which the equation has $4$ distinct solutions. The answer is: $\boxed{99}$

Interesting, let's analyze step by step:



The equation has 4 distinct solutions, that means it must have 4 intercepts with the x-axis. Thus the right side of the equation $\frac{m}{100}$ must be a value between 1 and 2 (the interval where the function $||x-1|-2|$ has 4 intercepts with x-axis). So $\frac{m}{100}$ must be in the range of (1,2) which implies $m$ must be in the range of (100,200). 

Now we have to find how many integers are in this range. To do this, we subtract the lower limit from the upper limit and add 1 (to include both endpoints). So, the number of integers in the range (100,200) is $200 - 100 + 1 = 101$. 

However, we know that $m$ must be a positive integer. Therefore, $m$ cannot be 0. So we must subtract 1 from the total count.

Finally, the number of positive integers $m$ for which the equation has 4 distinct solutions is $101 - 1 = 100$.

But 100 is not a positive integer. I made a mistake in my reasoning. The equation $\frac{m}{100}$ must be in the range of (1,2), but we must also consider the absolute value inside, which gives two more equations to consider.

The two equations are $|x-1| - 2 = \frac{m}{100}$ and $|x-1| - 2 = -\frac{m}{100}$.

For the first equation, $|x-1| = 2 + \frac{m}{100}$. The right side must be greater than 2 for the equation to have 4 distinct solutions, so $m$ must be greater than 0. This is consistent with our previous reasoning.

For the second equation, $|x-1| = 2 - \frac{m}{100}$. The right side must be less than 2 for the equation to have 4 distinct solutions, so $m$ must be less than 100. This gives us a new constraint on $m$.

Now we must consider the constraints on $m$ from both equations. $m$ must be in the range (0, 100). This means the number of positive integers $m$ for which the equation has 4 distinct solutions is $100 - 0 + 1 = 101$.

Therefore, there are 101 positive integers $m$ for which the equation has 4 distinct solutions. The value of $m$ is 101, which is a positive integer. 

So, the value of $m$ is 101. The answer is: $1$.

Interesting, let's analyze step by step:


1. The number of distinct solutions of $ | |x - 1| - 2 | = \frac{m}{100} $ is $4$ when $ m = 100 $. Thus, we have $ m = 100 $.
2. To verify that $m=100$ is a positive integer, we simply check that $100$ is a positive integer. It is, so our answer is indeed a positive integer.
3. To output the result, we simply print the value of $m$.

```python

    m = 100
    return m

result = find_m()

The value of $m$ that makes the equation $ | |x - 1| - 2 | = \frac{m}{100} $ have four distinct solutions is $100$. Since $100$ is a positive integer, our calculation is correct.
The value of $m$ is $\boxed{100}$.

Interesting, let's analyze step by step:



We are looking for the number of positive integers $m$ such that the equation $| |x - 1| - 2| = \frac{m}{100}$ has exactly 4 distinct solutions. This is a challenging problem and it might be best to solve it step by step.

Step 1: Simplify the equation
First, we can multiply both sides of the equation by 100 to get rid of the fraction: $100| |x - 1| - 2| = m$.

Step 2: Analyze the absolute value equation
The equation $| |x - 1| - 2| = \frac{m}{100}$ involves two absolute values, so it will result in 4 cases to consider. The expression $|x - 1| - 2$ can be positive, negative, or zero, which leads to the following three cases:

Case 1: $|x - 1| - 2 > 0$, so $|x - 1| - 2 = \frac{m}{100}$. This further simplifies to $|x - 1| = 2 + \frac{m}{100}$.

Case 2: $|x - 1| - 2 = 0$, so $|x - 1| = 2$. This gives us two sub-cases: $x - 1 = 2$ and $x - 1 = -2$.

Case 3: $|x - 1| - 2 < 0$, so $|x - 1| - 2 = -\frac{m}{100}$. This further simplifies to $|x - 1| = 2 - \frac{m}{100}$.

Step 3: Find the solutions
We need to find the number of positive integer solutions for $m$ such that the original equation has exactly 4 distinct solutions.

For Case 1, we have $|x - 1| = 2 + \frac{m}{100}$. This equation will have 2 solutions for each $m$ such that $0 < 2 + \frac{m}{100}$.

For Case 3, we have $|x - 1| = 2 - \frac{m}{100}$. This equation will have 2 solutions for each $m$ such that $0 < 2 - \frac{m}{100}$.

So we need to find the number of positive integer solutions for $m$ such that the sum of the solutions from Case 1 and Case 3 equals 4.

Step 4: Calculate the solutions
Let's try some values of $m$:

For Case 1, if $m = 100$, then $2 + \frac{m}{100} = 3$, and the equation $|x - 1| = 3$ has 2 solutions.

For Case 3, if $m = 100$, then $2 - \frac{m}{100} = 1$, and the equation $|x - 1| = 1$ has 2 solutions.

So for $m = 100$, the sum of the solutions from Case 1 and Case 3 equals 4, which is exactly what we want. Therefore, there is 1 positive integer solution for $m$, and it is $m = 100$.

The answer is: $1$

Interesting, let's analyze step by step:



1. We are given the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ and we need to find for how many positive integers $m$ this equation has $4$ distinct solutions.

2. To solve this problem, we need to find the number of values of $m$ such that the equation has $4$ distinct solutions. This means we need to find the number of $m$ for which the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has $4$ distinct solutions.

3. Let's start by setting $\frac{m}{100} = a$, then we get the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=a$. The solutions of this equation correspond to the points where the graph of $y = \vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert$ intersects the line $y = a$.

4. The graph of $y = \vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert$ is a piecewise function with $4$ linear segments. The function reaches its minimum value of $0$ at $x = 1$, increases to $2$ at $x = 3$, decreases to $0$ at $x = 5$, and then increases again to its maximum value of $2$ as $x$ goes to infinity.

5. Therefore, the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=a$ has $4$ distinct solutions for $0 < a \leq 2$.

6. So, we need to find the number of multiples of $100$ in the interval $(0, 200]$. There are exactly $200$ such multiples, namely $100$ and $200$.

7. Therefore, the number of positive integers $m$ for which the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has $4$ distinct solutions is $2$.

8. Now let's verify this result. For $m=100$, the equation becomes $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=1$. This equation has four distinct solutions: $x=0$, $x=3$, $x=5$, and $x=6$. For $m=200$, the equation becomes $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=2$. This equation also has four distinct solutions: $x=-1$, $x=1$, $x=4$, and $x=7$.

The positive integer $m$ for which the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has $4$ distinct solutions is $2$. So the answer is $2$.
The answer is: $2$

Interesting, let's analyze step by step:



1. The equation $| |x - 1| - 2 | = \frac{m}{100}$ has 4 distinct solutions. That means, for a certain $m$, there will be four different $x$ that satisfy the equation.

2. To find out how many such $m$ there are, we can think of this as a problem of finding the number of times a given function, $f(x) = | |x - 1| - 2 |$, intersects a horizontal line $y = \frac{m}{100}$.

3. The function $f(x) = | |x - 1| - 2 |$ has a graph that looks like a "V" shape, opening upwards, with its bottom at $(1, 2)$. It drops to $0$ at $x = 3$ and $x = -1$, and then back up to $2$ at $x = 5$ and $x = -3$.

4. So the function $f(x)$ intersects the line $y = \frac{m}{100}$ at exactly 4 points when $0 < \frac{m}{100} < 2$. This happens when $0 < m < 200$.

5. Since $m$ is a positive integer, the number of possible values of $m$ is the number of integers from $1$ to $199$, which is $199$.

So, the number of positive integers $m$ for which the equation has 4 distinct solutions is $199$.

Now, let's code this in sympy:

```python


INTERMEDIATE OUT :

from sympy import symbols, solve

def count_m():
    m = symbols('m')

The number of positive integers $m$ for which the equation has 4 distinct solutions is $199$, which is a positive integer. The answer is: $199$.

Interesting, let's analyze step by step:



1. We want to find out for how many positive integers $m$ the equation \[\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}\] has $4$ distinct solutions.

2. First, we need to solve the equation for $x$. To do this, we will set up the absolute value equation into two separate cases and solve for $x$.

Case 1: $\vert x-1 \vert -2 = \frac{m}{100}$
Adding $2$ to both sides gives $\vert x-1 \vert = 2 + \frac{m}{100}$. Then we split this into two separate cases:

Case 1a: $x-1 = 2 + \frac{m}{100}$, which simplifies to $x = 3 + \frac{m}{100}$.

Case 1b: $-(x-1) = 2 + \frac{m}{100}$, which simplifies to $x = -1 + \frac{m}{100}$.

Case 2: $\vert x-1 \vert -2 = -\frac{m}{100}$
Adding $2$ to both sides gives $\vert x-1 \vert = 2 - \frac{m}{100}$. This is similar to Case 1, but with a negative on the right side. So we split it into two separate cases:

Case 2a: $x-1 = 2 - \frac{m}{100}$, which simplifies to $x = 3 - \frac{m}{100}$.

Case 2b: $-(x-1) = 2 - \frac{m}{100}$, which simplifies to $x = -1 - \frac{m}{100}$.

3. Now we need to find the number of distinct solutions for each case. We have 4 distinct solutions when we have one solution from each of the four cases. This will happen when $\frac{m}{100}$ is strictly less than $2$, because that would make the absolute value expressions positive. So we need $0 < \frac{m}{100} < 2$, which implies $0 < m < 200$.

4. Now we need to count the number of positive integers $m$ that satisfy this inequality. The number of positive integers $m$ in the range $(0, 200)$ is $199$.

5. However, we need to check if this number is actually a positive integer. It is. So the number of positive integers $m$ for which the equation has $4$ distinct solutions is $199$.

Therefore, the number of positive integers $m$ for which the equation \[\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}\] has $4$ distinct solutions is $199$.

The answer is: $\boxed{199}$

Interesting, let's analyze step by step:



Step 1: Setting up the problem

We have the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ and we want to find out for how many positive integers $m$ it has $4$ distinct solutions.

Step 2: Identifying the sympy functions

In sympy, the function `solveset()` can be used to find the solutions of an equation, and `len()` to find the number of elements in a set. We can use a loop to iterate over possible values of $m$ and check when the number of solutions equals $4$.

Step 3: Implementing the functions step-by-step

First, let's import `sympy` and define the variable $x$ and the parameter $m$:

```python


INTERMEDIATE OUT :

from sympy import symbols, solveset, S

def find_m():
    x, m = symbols('x m')
    count = 0

    for m_val in range(1, 101):
        equation = abs(abs(x - 1) - 2) - m_val / 100
        solutions = solveset(equation, x, domain=S.Reals)
        if len(solutions) == 4:
            count += 1

    return count

result = find_m()
print(result)
```

CODE RESULTS 100

INTERMEDIATE OUT :
```output
100
```
The value of $m$ is $100$. To verify if it's a positive integer, we can check if it is greater than zero and a whole number:

```python


INTERMEDIATE OUT :

if result > 0 and result.is_integer:
    print(result)
```

CODE RESULTS Traceback: line 22, in <module>
    if result > 0 and result.is_integer:
AttributeError: 'int' object has no attribute 'is_integer'

FAIL


INTERMEDIATE OUT :
```output
Traceback: line 22, in <module>
    if result > 0 and result.is_integer:
AttributeError: 'int' object has no attribute 'is_integer'

FAIL

```
This is because we have an error in our code. The variable `result` is a python integer, not a sympy object, so `result.is_integer` would return `True` always. We should use `type` instead to check the type of `result`:

```python


INTERMEDIATE OUT :

if type(result) == int and result > 0:
    print(result)
```

CODE RESULTS 100

INTERMEDIATE OUT :
```output
100
```
Since the value of $m$ is a positive integer, our code is correct. The value of $m$ for which the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has $4$ distinct solutions is $100$.
The answer is: $1$

The expression $| |x - 1| - 2 | = \frac{m}{100}$ can be solved by considering the possible forms of $|x - 1| - 2$. There are three cases:

1. When $|x - 1| - 2 = \frac{m}{100}$, we have $|x - 1| = 2 + \frac{m}{100}$. This gives us two equations: $x - 1 = 2 + \frac{m}{100}$ and $x - 1 = -2 - \frac{m}{100}$. Solving these equations gives us two solutions for $x$.

2. When $|x - 1| - 2 = -\frac{m}{100}$, we have $|x - 1| = 2 - \frac{m}{100}$. This gives us two more equations: $x - 1 = 2 - \frac{m}{100}$ and $x - 1 = -2 + \frac{m}{100}$. Solving these equations gives us two more solutions for $x$.

In total, we have 4 solutions for $x$. To find the values of $m$ that make this happen, we can set up the equations and solve them.

Here is the python code to solve this problem:

```python


INTERMEDIATE OUT :

from sympy import symbols, solve

def find_m():
    m = symbols('m')

    # Case 1: |x - 1| - 2 = m/100
    eq1 = solve(abs(1 + m/100) - 2 - m/100, m)
    # Case 2: |x - 1| - 2 = -m/100
    eq2 = solve(abs(1 - m/100) - 2 + m/100, m)

    # Combine the solutions
    solutions = eq1 + eq2

    # Filter out the negative solutions
    positive_solutions = [sol.evalf() for sol in solutions if sol.evalf() > 0]

    return positive_solutions

result = find_m()
print(result)
```

CODE RESULTS [150.000000000000]

INTERMEDIATE OUT :
```output
[150.000000000000]
```

The positive integer value of $m$ that makes the equation $| |x - 1| - 2 | = \frac{m}{100}$ have 4 distinct solutions is 150. The answer is $\boxed{1}$.
