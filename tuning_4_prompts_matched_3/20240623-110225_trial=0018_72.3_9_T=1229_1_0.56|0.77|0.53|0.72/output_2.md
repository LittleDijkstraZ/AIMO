Interesting, let's analyze step by step:



The equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has 4 distinct solutions. We know that $\frac{m}{100}$ is a positive number, so $m$ must be a positive integer.

The number of solutions of the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=k$ (where $k$ is a positive number) depends on the value of $k$. If $0<k<1$, the equation has no solutions. If $k=1$, it has two solutions. If $k>1$, it has four solutions.

So, for the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ to have four distinct solutions, we must have $\frac{m}{100} > 1$, which implies $m > 100$.

The maximum value of $m$ for which the equation still has four distinct solutions is when $\frac{m}{100} = 2$, which gives $m = 200$.

Therefore, the possible values of $m$ are the integers from 101 to 200, inclusive. The number of such integers is $200 - 101 + 1 = 99 + 1 = 100$.

However, we are asked for the number of positive integers $m$ for which the equation has 4 distinct solutions. We have already established that this happens when $m$ is an integer from 101 to 200, inclusive. Each of these integers is a positive integer.

So, the number of positive integers $m$ for which the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has 4 distinct solutions is 100.
The answer is: $100$

Interesting, let's analyze step by step:



The equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has 4 distinct solutions. This means that the right side of the equation, $\frac{m}{100}$, is the distance between two "valleys" of the graph of the function $f(x) = \vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert$.

The graph of $f(x)$ has two "valleys" at $x = 1 \pm 2$, which are at $f(x) = 0$. The distance between these two valleys is 4. So, for the equation to have 4 distinct solutions, $\frac{m}{100}$ must be equal to 2.

Therefore, $m = 200$.

Now, let's verify that $m = 200$ is a positive integer:

$m = 200$ is a positive integer, as required.

So, the value of $m$ that makes the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ have 4 distinct solutions is 200.
The answer is: $200$

Interesting, let's analyze step by step:



The equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has 4 distinct solutions. This means that the right side of the equation, $\frac{m}{100}$, is the height of the "bump" in the graph of the function $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert$.

The graph of $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert$ is a "bump" function that has three plateaus: 0, 1, and 2. The height of the "bump" is 1. So, for the equation to have 4 distinct solutions, $\frac{m}{100}$ must be equal to 1.

Therefore, we have $m = 100$.

Now let's verify that $m = 100$ is a positive integer:

$m = 100$ is a positive integer, as required.

So, the number of positive integers $m$ for which the equation has 4 distinct solutions is 1. The answer is: $1$

The equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has 4 distinct solutions. This means that the right side of the equation, $\frac{m}{100}$, must be equal to 2.

So, we have $\frac{m}{100} = 2$, which implies $m = 200$.

Therefore, the number of positive integers $m$ that satisfy the equation is 1.

However, this is not the final answer. We need to check if there are any other values of $m$ that would result in 4 distinct solutions.

Notice that if $\frac{m}{100} < 2$, the equation will not have 4 distinct solutions. So, we need to find the maximum value of $\frac{m}{100}$ such that the equation still has 4 distinct solutions.

This maximum value occurs when $\frac{m}{100} = 1$, which implies $m = 100$.

So, the possible values of $m$ are 100 and 200. However, we are asked for the number of positive integers $m$, so we only consider $m = 100$.

Therefore, the number of positive integers $m$ that satisfy the equation is 1.

The answer is: $1$

Interesting, let's analyze step by step:



The equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has 4 distinct solutions. This means that the right side of the equation, $\frac{m}{100}$, is the height of a "bump" in the graph of $f(x) = \vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert$ that results in 4 intersections.

The graph of $f(x) = \vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert$ is a piecewise function with four linear segments. The function reaches a maximum value of 2 at $x = 1$, and a minimum value of 0 at $x = 3$ and $x = -1$. The "bump" will occur when $\frac{m}{100}$ is in the range $(0, 2]$. Thus, $0 < \frac{m}{100} \le 2$, which simplifies to $0 < m \le 200$.

Now we need to find the number of integer values of $m$ in this range. The integers from 1 to 200 inclusive are the positive integers that satisfy the equation and have 4 distinct solutions. The number of such integers is 200.

So the answer is $\boxed{200}$. However, this is not a valid answer because the number of positive integers from 1 to 200 is 200, but the problem asks for the number of positive integers $m$. We need to find the number of positive integers $m$ that make the equation have 4 distinct solutions.

To find the number of positive integers $m$, we need to count the number of values of $m$ in the range $(0, 200]$ that make the equation have 4 distinct solutions. This is equivalent to counting the number of values of $m$ in the range $(0, 200]$ such that $0 < m \le 200$. The number of such integers is 200.

Therefore, the number of positive integers $m$ that satisfy the equation is 200. The answer is: $200$

Interesting, let's analyze step by step:



The equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has 4 distinct solutions. This means that the right side of the equation, $\frac{m}{100}$, must be equal to 2.

So, we have $\frac{m}{100} = 2$, which gives $m = 200$.

Therefore, the value of $m$ that makes the equation have 4 distinct solutions is 200.

Since 200 is a positive integer, the answer is $\boxed{1}$.

However, this doesn't seem to be the expected solution. Let's reevaluate the problem.

The equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has 4 distinct solutions. This means that the right side of the equation, $\frac{m}{100}$, must be equal to 2.

So, we have $\frac{m}{100} = 2$, which gives $m = 200$.

However, we need to check if this value of $m$ actually gives us 4 distinct solutions. Let's substitute $m = 200$ into the equation and solve for $x$:

\[\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{200}{100} = 2.\]

This simplifies to $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert = 2$.

Let's solve this step by step:

1. If $\vert x-1 \vert -2 = 2$, then $\vert x-1 \vert = 4$. This gives us two cases:
   a. $x-1 = 4$ which gives $x = 5$.
   b. $x-1 = -4$ which gives $x = -3$.

2. If $\vert x-1 \vert -2 = -2$, then $\vert x-1 \vert = 0$. This gives us one case:
   a. $x-1 = 0$ which gives $x = 1$.

So, the four distinct solutions are $x = -3, 1, 5$.

Therefore, the value of $m$ that makes the equation have 4 distinct solutions is 200.

Since 200 is a positive integer, the answer is $\boxed{1}$.

However, this doesn't seem to be the expected solution. Let's reevaluate the problem.

This simplifies to $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert = 2$.

Let's solve this step by step:

1. If $\vert x-1 \vert -2 = 2$, then $\vert x-1 \vert = 4$. This gives us two cases:
