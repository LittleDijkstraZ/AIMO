Interesting, let's analyze step by step:



The expression $A \cdot B = 0$ implies that either $A = 0$ or $B = 0$. Therefore, the given equation is satisfied if either of the following two conditions holds:

1. $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$
2. $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$

For the first condition to be true, we must have $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. This implies that $x + y = \pm 10$ and $x - y = \pm 10$, which gives us four lines in the plane: $x + y = 10$, $x + y = -10$, $x - y = 10$, and $x - y = -10$. The intersection of these lines forms a square with side length 10. The area of this square is $10^2 = 100$.

For the second condition to be true, we must have $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$, which implies that $x = \pm 8$ and $y = \pm 8$. This gives us four lines in the plane: $x = 8$, $x = -8$, $y = 8$, and $y = -8$. The intersection of these lines forms a square with side length 16. The area of this square is $16^2 = 256$.

However, the first condition and the second condition cannot hold simultaneously, because the square formed by the first condition is entirely contained within the square formed by the second condition. Therefore, the area of the convex polygon is the area of the square formed by the first condition, which is 100.

Therefore, the area of the convex polygon is 100. The answer is: $100$

Interesting, let's analyze step by step:



The equation given is a product of two terms equal to zero. This means that either the first term is zero or the second term is zero. 

The first term is $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)$ and the second term is $((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2)$. 

For the first term to be zero, both $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)$ and $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)$ must be zero. This implies that $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. The only way this can happen is if $x = \pm 10$ and $y = \pm 10$.

For the second term to be zero, both $(\vert x \vert - 8)$ and $(\vert y \vert - 8)$ must be zero. This implies that $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$. The only way this can happen is if $x = \pm 8$ and $y = \pm 8$.

So the points that satisfy the equation are $(\pm 10, \pm 10)$ and $(\pm 8, \pm 8)$. These points form a square with side length 20. The area of this square is $20^2 = 400$.

Therefore, the area of the convex polygon is 400.
The answer is: $400$

So, the area of the convex polygon is 400.

The expression $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ implies that $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. This means that $x + y = \pm 10$ and $x - y = \pm 10$. Solving these equations, we get four lines: $y = -x \pm 10$ and $y = x \pm 10$.

Similarly, the expression $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ implies that $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$. This means that $x = \pm 8$ and $y = \pm 8$. So we get four more lines: $x = \pm 8$ and $y = \pm 8$.

These eight lines form a square with side length 16. The area of this square is $16^2 = 256$. So the area of the convex polygon is 256. The answer is: $256$

Interesting, let's analyze step by step:



The equation is given as:
$$((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$$

This equation is equal to zero if and only if either of the two factors is zero. This gives us two sets of equations to solve:

1. $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ and $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$
2. $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ and $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$

For the first set of equations, we have:

1.1. $\vert x + y \vert = 10$
1.2. $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$

For the second set of equations, we have:

2.1. $\vert x - y \vert = 10$
2.2. $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$

From 1.2 and 2.2, we know that $x$ and $y$ must be in the range of $[-8, 8]$.

Now, let's consider 1.1 and 2.1. For 1.1, we have $x + y = \pm 10$. For 2.1, we have $x - y = \pm 10$. These four equations represent the sides of a square with side length 10.

The area of this square is $10^2 = 100$. So the area of the convex polygon is 100.

The answer is: $100$

Interesting, let's analyze step by step:



The expression $A \cdot B = 0$ is equivalent to $A = 0$ or $B = 0$. So, the given equation is equivalent to either $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$.

This gives us the following four equations:

1. $\vert x + y \vert = 10$
2. $\vert x - y \vert = 10$
3. $\vert x \vert = 8$
4. $\vert y \vert = 8$

The solutions to these equations are the vertices of the polygon.

1. For $\vert x + y \vert = 10$, the solutions are $(x, y) = (10, 0), (0, 10), (-10, 0), (0, -10)$.
2. For $\vert x - y \vert = 10$, the solutions are $(x, y) = (10, 0), (0, -10), (-10, 0), (0, 10)$.
3. For $\vert x \vert = 8$, the solutions are $(x, y) = (8, y), (-8, y)$.
4. For $\vert y \vert = 8$, the solutions are $(x, y) = (x, 8), (x, -8)$.

Combining all the solutions, we get the vertices of the polygon: $(8, 8), (8, -8), (-8, 8), (-8, -8), (10, 0), (0, 10), (-10, 0), (0, -10)$.

The polygon is a square with side length 16. The area of the square is $16^2 = 256$.

So, the area of the convex polygon is 256.
The answer is: $256$

The equation is given as:
$$((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$$

This equation is satisfied if either of the two factors is zero. That is, either:
$$(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0 \quad \text{or} \quad (\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0 \quad \text{or} \quad (\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0 \quad \text{or} \quad (\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$$

This implies that either $|x + y| = 10$, $|x - y| = 10$, $|x| = 8$, or $|y| = 8$. These equations represent four lines in the plane. The intersection points of these lines form a rectangle with side lengths 16 and 20. The area of this rectangle is $16 \times 20 = 320$.

So, the area of the convex polygon is 320.

Interesting, let's analyze step by step:



The equation is given as:
\[((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0\]

This equation is equal to zero if either of the two factors is zero. Therefore, we have two sets of equations to solve:

1. $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ and $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$
2. $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ and $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$

For the first set of equations, we have:

1.1. $\vert x + y \vert = 10$
1.2. $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$

For the second set of equations, we have:

2.1. $\vert x - y \vert = 10$
2.2. $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$

From 1.2 and 2.2, we know that $x$ and $y$ must be in the range of $[-8, 8]$.

Now, let's consider 1.1 and 2.1. For 1.1, we have $x + y = \pm 10$ and for 2.1, we have $x - y = \pm 10$. These are the equations of two lines in the plane. The intersection of these lines with the range of $x$ and $y$ gives us the vertices of the polygon.

By solving these equations, we find that the vertices of the polygon are:

$A = (8, 2)$, $B = (8, -2)$, $C = (6, 4)$, $D = (6, -4)$, $E = (-6, 4)$, $F = (-6, -4)$, $G = (-8, 2)$, and $H = (-8, -2)$.

Now, we can calculate the area of the polygon using the Shoelace formula. The Shoelace formula states that if the vertices of a polygon are $(x_1, y_1), (x_2, y_2), \ldots, (x_n, y_n)$ in counterclockwise order, then the area of the polygon is given by:

\[Area = \frac{1}{2} \vert (x_1y_2 + x_2y_3 + \ldots + x_ny_1) - (y_1x_2 + y_2x_3 + \ldots + y_nx_1) \vert\]

By applying the Shoelace formula to the vertices $A, B, C, D, E, F, G, H$, we find that the area of the polygon is 128 square units.

Since the area is a positive integer, we have found the area of the convex polygon. The answer is:
\[128\]
The answer is: $128$

The equation given is:
$$((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$$

This equation equals to zero if and only if either of the two factors equals to zero. So we have two cases:

1. $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ and $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 \neq 0$
2. $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ and $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 \neq 0$

For the first case, we have $\vert x + y \vert = 10$, which means $x + y = \pm 10$. The second case gives $\vert x - y \vert = 10$, which means $x - y = \pm 10$.

The four lines $x + y = 10$, $x + y = -10$, $x - y = 10$, and $x - y = -10$ form a rectangle with side lengths 20 and 10. The area of this rectangle is $20 \times 10 = 200$.

So the area of the convex polygon is 200. The answer is: $200$

The equation given is $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$.

This equation equals to zero if and only if either of the two factors equals to zero. That is, either $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$.

For the first factor to be zero, we must have $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. This implies that $x + y = \pm 10$ and $x - y = \pm 10$. Solving these equations gives us the vertices of the polygon: $(8,2)$, $(8,-2)$, $(-8,2)$, and $(-8,-2)$.

For the second factor to be zero, we must have $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$. This implies that $x = \pm 8$ and $y = \pm 8$. Solving these equations gives us the same vertices: $(8,2)$, $(8,-2)$, $(-8,2)$, and $(-8,-2)$.

So the points that satisfy the equation are exactly the vertices of a square with side length 16. The area of this square is $16^2 = 256$.

Therefore, the area of the convex polygon is 256. The answer is: $256$

Interesting, let's analyze step by step:



The equation is given as:
$$((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$$

This equation is equal to zero if and only if either of the two factors is equal to zero. This gives us two sets of equations to solve:

1. $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ and $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$
2. $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ and $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$

For the first set of equations:

1. From $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$, we have $\vert x + y \vert = 10$. This implies $x + y = 10$ or $x + y = -10$.
2. From $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$, we have $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$, which implies $x = 8$ or $x = -8$ and $y = 8$ or $y = -8$.

By combining these results, we get the vertices of the polygon as:

$(8, 8), (8, -8), (-8, 8), (-8, -8)$

For the second set of equations:

1. From $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$, we have $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. This implies $x - y = 10$ or $x - y = -10$.
2. From $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$, we have $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$, which implies $x = 8$ or $x = -8$ and $y = 8$ or $y = -8$.

By combining these results, we get the same vertices as before.

Now, we can calculate the area of the polygon. The polygon is a square with side length 16 (since the distance between $(8, 8)$ and $(8, -8)$ is 16). The area of the square is $16^2 = 256$.

So, the area of the convex polygon is 256.

The answer is: $256$
