Question (hint: positive numerical answer):
"For how many positive integers $m$ does the equation \[\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}\] have $4$ distinct solutions?"
Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:


The equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has 4 distinct solutions when $\frac{m}{100}=2$. This is because the expression inside the absolute value, $\vert x-1 \vert -2$, can take on the values $-2, 0, 2$. The value of 2 gives us 4 distinct solutions.

To find the value of $m$, we can multiply both sides of the equation $\frac{m}{100}=2$ by 100 to get $m=200$.

So, there is only one positive integer $m$ for which the equation has 4 distinct solutions, and that is $m=200$. The answer is: $1$

Question (hint: positive numerical answer):
"For how many positive integers $m$ does the equation \[\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}\] have $4$ distinct solutions?"
Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:


The equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has 4 distinct solutions if and only if $\frac{m}{100}$ is equal to the positive difference between the values of $k$ for which the function $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert$ changes its slope.

The function $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert$ changes its slope at $x=1 \pm 2$, which are $x=-1$ and $x=3$. The positive difference between these two values is $3 - (-1) = 4$. Therefore, $\frac{m}{100} = 4$, which implies $m = 400$.

So, the only positive integer $m$ for which the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has 4 distinct solutions is $m = 400$. The answer is: $1$

Question (hint: positive numerical answer):
"For how many positive integers $m$ does the equation \[\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}\] have $4$ distinct solutions?"
Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:


The equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has 4 distinct solutions if and only if $\frac{m}{100} = 2$.
This is because the expression $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert$ takes on the value of 2 exactly four times.
To solve for $m$, we multiply both sides of the equation $\frac{m}{100} = 2$ by 100 to get $m = 200$.
Therefore, there is only one positive integer $m$ for which the equation has 4 distinct solutions, and that is $m = 200$. The answer is: $1$

"For how many positive integers $m$ does the equation \[\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}\] have $4$ distinct solutions?"

Step-by-step Solution:


The equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has 4 distinct solutions if and only if $\frac{m}{100} = 2$.
Solving the equation $\frac{m}{100} = 2$, we find $m = 200$.
Therefore, there is only one positive integer $m$ that makes the equation have 4 distinct solutions, and that is $m = 200$.
The answer is: $1$
