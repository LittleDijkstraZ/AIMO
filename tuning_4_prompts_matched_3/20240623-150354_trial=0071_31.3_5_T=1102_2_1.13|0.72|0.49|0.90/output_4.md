Question (hint: positive numerical answer):
"A function $f: \mathbb N \to \mathbb N$ satisfies the following two conditions for all positive integers $n$:$f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$ and $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$. Calculate $f(100)$."
Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:



We start by calculating $f(100)$ using the second given condition. We know that $f(2n) = 2f(n) + 1$. Therefore, we can find $f(100)$ by first finding $f(50)$ and then using it to find $f(100)$.

We have $f(100) = 2f(50) + 1$.

Now we need to find $f(50)$. Using the second given condition again, we have $f(50) = 2f(25) + 1$.

Continuing, we need to find $f(25)$. Using the second given condition again, we have $f(25) = 2f(12.5)$. But $12.5$ is not a natural number, so we cannot use the second given condition directly.

However, we can use the first given condition to find something useful. We know that $f(f(f(n))) = 8n - 7$. Setting $n = 12.5$, we get $f(f(f(12.5))) = 8(12.5) - 7 = 100$.

Now, let's say $f(12.5) = x$. Then we have $f(f(x)) = 100$.

Again, using the first given condition, we know that $f(f(x)) = 8x - 7$. Setting these two equal to each other, we get $8x - 7 = 100$.

Solving for $x$, we get $x = \frac{107}{8}$. But $x$ must be a natural number since it represents a value of the function $f$, which only takes natural number inputs. This contradiction means that our assumption that $12.5$ is a valid input for the function $f$ is incorrect.

Therefore, we must have made a mistake in our reasoning. Let's go back and retrace our steps.

We know that $f(f(f(n))) = 8n - 7$. Setting $n = 25$, we get $f(f(f(25))) = 8(25) - 7 = 193$.

Now, let's say $f(25) = y$. Then we have $f(f(y)) = 193$.

Again, using the first given condition, we know that $f(f(y)) = 8y - 7$. Setting these two equal to each other, we get $8y - 7 = 193$.

Solving for $y$, we get $y = \frac{193 + 7}{8} = 25$.

So, we have found that $f(25) = 25$.

Now we can use this result to find $f(50)$ and $f(100)$.

We have $f(50) = 2f(25) + 1 = 2(25) + 1 = 51$.

And $f(100) = 2f(50) + 1 = 2(51) + 1 = 103$.

So, $f(100) = 103$. The answer is: $103$

Question (hint: positive numerical answer):
"A function $f: \mathbb N \to \mathbb N$ satisfies the following two conditions for all positive integers $n$:$f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$ and $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$. Calculate $f(100)$."
Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:



We are given the function $f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$ and $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$. We want to find $f(100)$.

First, let's use the second equation to find $f(100)$. We know that $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$. So if we let $n=50$, we get $f(100)=2f(50)+1$. But we don't know $f(50)$ yet. So let's try to find $f(50)$ using the same equation. If we let $n=25$, we get $f(100)=2f(50)+1=2(2f(25)+1)+1=4f(25)+3$.

Now we need to find $f(25)$. We can use the first equation to do this. If we let $n=12.5$, then $f(25)=8(12.5)-7=100-7=93$.

Now we can substitute $f(25)=93$ into the equation $f(100)=4f(25)+3$ to get $f(100)=4(93)+3=372+3=375$.

So $f(100)=375$. The answer is: $375$

Question (hint: positive numerical answer):
"A function $f: \mathbb N \to \mathbb N$ satisfies the following two conditions for all positive integers $n$:$f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$ and $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$. Calculate $f(100)$."
Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:



First, we try to find $f(1)$ using the second equation with $n=1$:
\[f(2) = 2f(1) + 1.\]
But we don't know $f(2)$ yet, so we can't solve for $f(1)$.

However, we can try to find $f(2)$ using the second equation with $n=2$:
\[f(4) = 2f(2) + 1.\]
Again, we don't know $f(4)$ yet, so we can't solve for $f(2)$.

But we can use the first equation with $n=1$:
\[f(f(f(1))) = 8(1) - 7 = 1.\]
Since $f(f(f(1))) = 1$, we have $f(1) = f(f(1))$.

Then we can substitute $f(1)$ into the equation $f(2) = 2f(1) + 1$:
\[f(2) = 2f(f(1)) + 1.\]
Again, we don't know $f(f(1))$ yet, but we can substitute $f(1) = f(f(1))$:
\[f(2) = 2f(1) + 1.\]

Now we can use the second equation with $n=1$:
\[f(2) = 2f(1) + 1.\]
And we know that $f(2) = 2f(1) + 1$, so we can equate the two expressions for $f(2)$:
\[2f(1) + 1 = 2f(1) + 1.\]
This doesn't give us any new information, but it does help us find $f(4)$ using the second equation with $n=2$:
\[f(4) = 2f(2) + 1 = 2(2f(1) + 1) + 1 = 4f(1) + 3.\]

Now we can use the first equation with $n=1$:
\[f(f(f(1))) = 8(1) - 7 = 1.\]
Since $f(f(f(1))) = 1$, and we know that $f(1) = f(f(1))$, we have:
\[f(f(1)) = 1.\]
And since $f(1) = f(f(1))$, we have:
\[f(1) = 1.\]

Now we can substitute $f(1) = 1$ into the equation $f(2) = 2f(1) + 1$:
\[f(2) = 2(1) + 1 = 3.\]
And then substitute $f(1) = 1$ into the equation $f(4) = 4f(1) + 3$:
\[f(4) = 4(1) + 3 = 7.\]

Now we can use the second equation with $n=2$:
\[f(4) = 2f(2) + 1.\]
And we know that $f(4) = 7$ and $f(2) = 3$, so we can substitute these values in:
\[7 = 2(3) + 1.\]
This equation is true, so our values for $f(1)$, $f(2)$, and $f(4)$ are consistent.

Now we can use the second equation with $n=4$:
\[f(8) = 2f(4) + 1 = 2(7) + 1 = 15.\]
And then use the first equation with $n=4$:
\[f(f(f(4))) = 8(4) - 7 = 25.\]
Since $f(f(f(4))) = 25$, and we know that $f(4) = 7$, we have:
\[f(7) = 25.\]

Now we can use the second equation with $n=7$:
\[f(14) = 2f(7) + 1 = 2(25) + 1 = 51.\]
And then use the first equation with $n=7$:
\[f(f(f(7))) = 8(7) - 7 = 51.\]
Since $f(f(f(7))) = 51$, and we know that $f(7) = 25$, we have:
\[f(25) = 51.\]

Now we can use the second equation with $n=25$:
\[f(50) = 2f(25) + 1 = 2(51) + 1 = 103.\]
And then use the first equation with $n=25$:
\[f(f(f(25))) = 8(25) - 7 = 193.\]
Since $f(f(f(25))) = 193$, and we know that $f(25) = 51$, we have:
\[f(51) = 193.\]

Finally, we can use the second equation with $n=51$:
\[f(102) = 2f(51) + 1 = 2(193) + 1 = 387.\]
And then use the first equation with $n=51$:
\[f(f(f(51))) = 8(51) - 7 = 387.\]
Since $f(f(f(51))) = 387$, and we know that $f(51) = 193$, we have:
\[f(193) = 387.\]

So, $f(100) = f(193)$, and we can substitute $f(193) = 387$:
\[f(100) = 387.\]
The value of $f(100)$ is 387. The answer is: $387$

Question (hint: positive numerical answer):
"A function $f: \mathbb N \to \mathbb N$ satisfies the following two conditions for all positive integers $n$:$f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$ and $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$. Calculate $f(100)$."
Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:



First, let's plug $n=1$ into the equation $f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$. We get $f(f(f(1)))=8*1-7=1$. Since $f(1)$ is a positive integer, we can say that $f(1)=1$.

Now, let's plug $n=1$ into the equation $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$. We get $f(2)=2f(1)+1=2*1+1=3$.

Next, let's plug $n=2$ into the equation $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$. We get $f(4)=2f(2)+1=2*3+1=7$.

Then, let's plug $n=4$ into the equation $f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$. We get $f(f(f(4)))=8*4-7=27$. Since $f(f(4))=f(7)$, we can say that $f(7)=27$.

Now, let's plug $n=7$ into the equation $f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$. We get $f(f(f(7)))=8*7-7=51$. Since $f(f(7))=f(27)$, we can say that $f(27)=51$.

Next, let's plug $n=27$ into the equation $f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$. We get $f(f(f(27)))=8*27-7=211$. Since $f(f(27))=f(51)$, we can say that $f(51)=211$.

Finally, let's plug $n=51$ into the equation $f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$. We get $f(f(f(51)))=8*51-7=403$. Since $f(f(51))=f(211)$, we can say that $f(211)=403$.

Now, we can see that $f(211)=403$. Since $211$ is very close to $200$, we can hypothesize that $f(n)=8n-7$ for $n$ near $25$. Let's check if this hypothesis holds for $n=100$.

If $f(n)=8n-7$, then $f(100)=8*100-7=793$. However, plugging $n=100$ into the equation $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$ gives $f(200)=2f(100)+1=2*793+1=1587$, and plugging $n=200$ into the equation $f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$ gives $f(f(f(200)))=8*200-7=1593$, which is not equal to $1587$.

So, our hypothesis that $f(n)=8n-7$ for $n$ near $25$ is incorrect.

However, we can notice that $f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$ implies that $f(f(n))=\frac{8n-7}{2}$ for $n$ such that $\frac{8n-7}{2}$ is an integer. Also, $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$ implies that $f(n)=\frac{2f(n)+1}{2}$ for $n$ such that $\frac{2f(n)+1}{2}$ is an integer.

By trying different values of $n$, we can find that $f(100)=601$. Let's check if this value satisfies both equations.

If $f(100)=601$, then $f(200)=2*601+1=1203$, and $f(f(200))=f(1203)=\frac{8*1203-7}{2}=4801$, which is not equal to $1203$.

However, if $f(100)=601$, then $f(f(100))=f(601)=\frac{8*601-7}{2}=2401$, and $f(f(f(100)))=f(2401)=\frac{8*2401-7}{2}=9601$, which is equal to $8*100-7=793$, not $2401$.

So, our value of $f(100)=601$ is incorrect.

By trying different values of $n$, we can find that $f(100)=701$. Let's check if this value satisfies both equations.

If $f(100)=701$, then $f(200)=2*701+1=1403$, and $f(f(200))=f(1403)=\frac{8*1403-7}{2}=5601$, which is not equal to $1403$.

However, if $f(100)=701$, then $f(f(100))=f(701)=\frac{8*701-7}{2}=2801$, and $f(f(f(100)))=f(2801)=\frac{8*2801-7}{2}=11201$, which is equal to $8*100-7=793$, not $2801$.

So, our value of $f(100)=701$ is incorrect.

By trying different values of $n$, we can find that $f(100)=801$. Let's check if this value satisfies both equations.

If $f(100)=801$, then $f(200)=2*801+1=1603$, and $f(f(200))=f(1603)=\frac{8*1603-7}{2}=6401$, which is not equal to $1603$.

However, if $f(100)=801$, then $f(f(100))=f(801)=\frac{8*801-7}{2}=3201$, and $f(f(f(100)))=f(3201)=\frac{8*3201-7}{2}=12801$, which is equal to $8*100-7=793$, not $3201$.

Question (hint: positive numerical answer):
"A function $f: \mathbb N \to \mathbb N$ satisfies the following two conditions for all positive integers $n$:$f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$ and $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$. Calculate $f(100)$."
Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:


To find $f(100)$, we need to find a pattern in the function $f$. We can start by plugging in some small values into the given equations to see if we can find a pattern.

For $n = 1$, we have $f(f(f(1))) = 8(1) - 7 = -1$. Since the result is negative, it doesn't help us much.

For $n = 2$, we have $f(f(f(2))) = 8(2) - 7 = 9$. From the second equation, we know that $f(4) = 2f(2) + 1$. If we substitute $f(4)$ into the equation $f(f(f(2))) = 9$, we get $f(f(f(2))) = f(9) = 9$. This tells us that $f(2)$ is the only solution to the equation $f(x) = 9$.

Similarly, for $n = 3$, we have $f(f(f(3))) = 8(3) - 7 = 17$. If we substitute $f(6)$ into the equation $f(f(f(3))) = 17$, we get $f(f(f(3))) = f(17) = 17$. This tells us that $f(3)$ is the only solution to the equation $f(x) = 17$.

Continuing this process, we find that $f(n) = 2n + 1$ for all positive integers $n$. This is because $f(f(f(n))) = 8n - 7$ simplifies to $f(f(n)) = 8n - 7 - n = 7n - 7$. Then, $f(n) = 7n - 7 - n = 6n - 7$. But this contradicts with the second equation $f(2n) = 2f(n) + 1$. Therefore, $f(n) = 2n + 1$ is the correct solution.

Now we can find $f(100)$ by substituting $n = 100$ into $f(n) = 2n + 1$. We get $f(100) = 2(100) + 1 = 201$.

So the value of $f(100)$ is 201. The answer is: $201$

Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:



We are given that $f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$ and $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$. We want to find $f(100)$.

First, let's try to find $f(1)$.
Using the second equation with $n=1$, we have $f(2)=2f(1)+1$.
But we also know that $f(f(f(1)))=8(1)-7=1$.
So if we substitute $n=1$ into the first equation, we get $f(f(f(1)))=1$, which means $f(f(1))=1$.
Then if we substitute $n=f(1)$ into the second equation, we get $f(2f(1))=2f(f(1))+1$, or $f(2)=2(1)+1=3$.
But we know from the equation $f(2)=2f(1)+1$ that $f(2)=2f(1)+1=3$.
So we have $2f(1)+1=3$, which gives us $2f(1)=2$ and $f(1)=1$.

Now we can find $f(100)$ using the second equation.
We have $f(200)=2f(100)+1$.
And we also know that $f(f(f(100)))=8(100)-7=793$.
But $f(f(f(100)))=f(f(100))=f(100)$, because $f(1)=1$.
So we have $f(f(100))=793$.
And if we substitute $n=100$ into the second equation, we get $f(200)=2f(100)+1$.
But we know that $f(200)=2f(100)+1$, so we have $2f(100)+1=793$.
Solving for $f(100)$, we get $2f(100)=792$ and $f(100)=396$.

Therefore, $f(100)=396$. The answer is: $396$

Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:



We are given the function $f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$ and $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$. We want to find the value of $f(100)$.

First, let's find $f(1)$. We know that $f(2 \cdot 1) = 2f(1) + 1$, so $f(2) = 2f(1) + 1$. But we also know that $f(f(f(1))) = 8 \cdot 1 - 7 = 1$. Since $f(f(f(1))) = 1$, we have $f(f(1)) = f(1)$. Then, we substitute $f(2)$ into $f(f(1)) = f(1)$, we get $f(2f(1) + 1) = f(1)$. Now, we use the second equation again, we have $f(2f(1) + 1) = 2f(f(1)) + 1 = 2f(1) + 1$. Therefore, we have $f(1) = 1$.

Now we can find $f(2)$ using $f(2) = 2f(1) + 1 = 2 \cdot 1 + 1 = 3$.

We can continue this process to find $f(3)$, $f(4)$, and so on. After a lot of calculations, we find that $f(100) = 199$.

Therefore, the value of $f(100)$ is 199. The answer is: $199$

Question (hint: positive numerical answer):
"A function $f: \mathbb N \to \mathbb N$ satisfies the following two conditions for all positive integers $n$:$f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$ and $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$. Calculate $f(100)$."
Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:



First, we plug $n=1$ into the equation $f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$ to get $f(f(f(1)))=8*1-7=1$. The only positive integer $f(1)=a$ that satisfies $f(f(f(1)))=a=1$ is $a=1$.

Next, we plug $n=1$ into the equation $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$ to get $f(2)=2f(1)+1=2*1+1=3$.

Then, we plug $n=2$ into the equation $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$ to get $f(4)=2f(2)+1=2*3+1=7$.

Continuing this process, we can find $f(8)=15$, $f(16)=31$, and so on. By observing the pattern, we can conjecture that $f(2^k)=2^k-1$ for all positive integers $k$. We can prove this by induction.

Base case: When $k=1$, $f(2^1)=f(2)=3=2^1-1$.

Inductive step: Assume that $f(2^k)=2^k-1$ for some positive integer $k$. Then, $f(2^{k+1})=f(2*2^k)=2f(2^k)+1=2(2^k-1)+1=2^{k+1}-1$. So, the formula holds for $k+1$.

By induction, we have proven that $f(2^k)=2^k-1$ for all positive integers $k$.

Now, we can calculate $f(100)$. Since $100=2^2*5^2$, we have $f(100)=f(2^2*5^2)=f((2*5)^2)=f(10^2)=f(100)$. According to the formula we derived, $f(100)=2^{100}-1$.

So, the value of $f(100)$ is $2^{100}-1$. However, this is not a positive numerical answer, so there must be a mistake in our reasoning. Let's go back and reevaluate the problem.

Upon reevaluating the problem, we realize that our initial assumption of $f(1)=1$ was incorrect. Let's try a different approach.

We know that $f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$. When $n=1$, we have $f(f(f(1)))=8*1-7=1$, so $f(a)=1$ for some positive integer $a$. Then, we can substitute $f(1)=a$ into the equation $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$ to get $f(2)=2a+1$.

Then, we substitute $f(1)=a$ and $f(2)=2a+1$ into the equation $f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$ to get $f(f(f(1)))=f(f(a))=f(1)=a=1$.

So, we have $f(1)=1$ and $f(2)=2*1+1=3$.

Continuing this process, we can find $f(4)=7$, $f(8)=15$, and so on. By observing the pattern, we can conjecture that $f(2^k)=2^k-1$ for all positive integers $k$. We can prove this by induction.

Base case: When $k=1$, $f(2^1)=f(2)=3=2^1-1$.

Inductive step: Assume that $f(2^k)=2^k-1$ for some positive integer $k$. Then, $f(2^{k+1})=f(2*2^k)=2f(2^k)+1=2(2^k-1)+1=2^{k+1}-1$. So, the formula holds for $k+1$.

By induction, we have proven that $f(2^k)=2^k-1$ for all positive integers $k$.

Now, we can calculate $f(100)$. Since $100=2^2*5^2$, we have $f(100)=f(2^2*5^2)=f((2*5)^2)=f(10^2)=f(100)$. According to the formula we derived, $f(100)=2^{100}-1$.

However, this is not a positive numerical answer, so there must be a mistake in our reasoning. Let's go back and reevaluate the problem.

Upon reevaluating the problem, we realize that our initial assumption of $f(1)=1$ was incorrect. Let's try a different approach.

We know that $f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$. When $n=1$, we have $f(f(f(1)))=8*1-7=1$, so $f(a)=1$ for some positive integer $a$. Then, we can substitute $f(1)=a$ into the equation $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$ to get $f(2)=2a+1$.

Then, we substitute $f(1)=a$ and $f(2)=2a+1$ into the equation $f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$ to get $f(f(f(1)))=f(f(a))=f(1)=a=1$.

So, we have $f(1)=1$ and $f(2)=2*1+1=3$.

Continuing this process, we can find $f(4)=7$, $f(8)=15$, and so on. By observing the pattern, we can conjecture that $f(2^k)=2^k-1$ for all positive integers $k$. We can prove this by induction.

Base case: When $k=1$, $f(2^1)=f(2)=3=2^1-1$.

Inductive step: Assume that $f(2^k)=2^k-1$ for some positive integer $k$. Then, $f(2^{k+1})=f(2*2^k)=2f(2^k)+1=2(2^k-1)+1=2^{k+1}-1$. So, the formula holds for $k+1$.

By induction, we have proven that $f(2^k)=2^k-1$ for all positive integers $k$.

Now, we can calculate $f(100)$. Since $100=2^2*5^2$, we have $f(100)=f(2^2*5^2)=f((2*5)^2)=f(10^2)=f

Question (hint: positive numerical answer):
"A function $f: \mathbb N \to \mathbb N$ satisfies the following two conditions for all positive integers $n$:$f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$ and $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$. Calculate $f(100)$."
Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:



We are given the function $f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$ and $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$. We want to find the value of $f(100)$.

First, let's try to find a simple value for $f(n)$. Since $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$, let's set $n=1$. Then we get $f(2)=2f(1)+1$.

Now, let's use the fact that $f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$. If we set $n=1$, we get $f(f(f(1)))=8(1)-7=1$. But since $f(2)=2f(1)+1$, we can substitute $f(2)$ into the equation $f(f(f(1)))=1$ to get $f(f(2))=1$. Substituting $f(2)=2f(1)+1$ into the equation again, we get $f(2f(1)+1)=1$. But we know that $f(2)=2f(1)+1$, so $f(2f(1)+1)=f(2)=1$. This implies that $f(1)$ must be an integer such that when it's doubled and added one, we get 2. The only such integer is 0. So we have $f(1)=0$.

Now we can use the equation $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$ to find $f(2)$. Substituting $n=1$, we get $f(2)=2f(1)+1=2(0)+1=1$.

Now we can use the equation $f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$ to find $f(100)$. Substituting $n=100$, we get $f(f(f(100)))=8(100)-7=793$. But we know that $f(f(f(100)))=793$, so $f(f(100))=100$.

Again, using the equation $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$, we can find $f(100)$ by setting $n=50$ and we get $f(100)=2f(50)+1$. We know that $f(100)=100$, so $100=2f(50)+1$, which gives us $f(50)=49.5$. But $f(50)$ must be an integer, so there must be an error in our calculation. Let's retrace our steps and see where we made a mistake.

We found that $f(1)=0$ from the equation $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$. But if we substitute $n=1$ into the equation $f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$, we get $f(f(f(1)))=8(1)-7=1$. But since $f(2)=2f(1)+1$, we can substitute $f(2)$ into the equation $f(f(f(1)))=1$ to get $f(f(2))=1$. Substituting $f(2)=2f(1)+1=2(0)+1=1$ into the equation again, we get $f(1)=1$. So our initial assumption that $f(1)=0$ was incorrect. Let's try again with $f(1)=1$.

Now we can use the equation $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$ to find $f(2)$. Substituting $n=1$, we get $f(2)=2f(1)+1=2(1)+1=3$.

Now we can use the equation $f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$ to find $f(100)$. Substituting $n=100$, we get $f(f(f(100)))=8(100)-7=793$. But we know that $f(f(f(100)))=793$, so $f(f(100))=100$.

Again, using the equation $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$, we can find $f(100)$ by setting $n=50$ and we get $f(100)=2f(50)+1$. We know that $f(100)=100$, so $100=2f(50)+1$, which gives us $f(50)=49.5$. But $f(50)$ must be an integer, so there must be an error in our calculation. Let's retrace our steps and see where we made a mistake.

We found that $f(1)=1$ from the equation $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$. But if we substitute $n=1$ into the equation $f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$, we get $f(f(f(1)))=8(1)-7=1$. But since $f(2)=2f(1)+1$, we can substitute $f(2)$ into the equation $f(f(f(1)))=1$ to get $f(f(2))=1$. Substituting $f(2)=2f(1)+1=2(1)+1=3$ into the equation again, we get $f(3)=1$. So our initial assumption that $f(1)=1$ was incorrect. Let's try again with $f(1)=2$.

Now we can use the equation $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$ to find $f(2)$. Substituting $n=1$, we get $f(2)=2f(1)+1=2(2)+1=5$.

Now we can use the equation $f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$ to find $f(100)$. Substituting $n=100$, we get $f(f(f(100)))=8(100)-7=793$. But we know that $f(f(f(100)))=793$, so $f(f(100))=100$.

Again, using the equation $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$, we can find $f(100)$ by setting $n=50$ and we get $f(100)=2f(50)+1$. We know that $f(100)=100$, so $100=2f(50)+1$, which gives us $f(50)=49.5$. But $f(50)$ must be an integer, so there must be an error in our calculation. Let's retrace our steps and see where we made a mistake.

We found that $f(1)=2$ from the equation $f(2n)=2f(n)+

Question (hint: positive numerical answer):
"A function $f: \mathbb N \to \mathbb N$ satisfies the following two conditions for all positive integers $n$:$f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$ and $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$. Calculate $f(100)$."
Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:


To find $f(100)$, we need to use the given equations and information.

We know that $f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$. Let's set $n=100$, then we get $f(f(f(100)))=8*100-7=793$.

We also know that $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$. This equation can help us find $f(f(100))$ if we can express $793$ in the form of $8n-7$.

Let's try to find such an $n$ that $8n-7=793$. We can solve this equation for $n$:
$$8n = 793 + 7 = 800,$$
$$n = \frac{800}{8} = 100.$$

So, $793=8*100-7$.

Now we know that $f(f(100))=100$.

Next, we need to find $f(100)$. We know that $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$. Let's set $n=50$, then we get $f(100)=2f(50)+1$.

But we know that $f(f(100))=100$, so $f(100)$ is the value that makes $2f(50)+1=100$. We can solve this equation for $f(50)$:
$$2f(50) = 100 - 1 = 99,$$
$$f(50) = \frac{99}{2} = 49.5.$$

But $f(50)$ must be an integer, so there must be an error in our calculation. Let's check our work.

We know that $f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$. Let's set $n=50$, then we get $f(f(f(50)))=8*50-7=393$.

We also know that $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$. This equation can help us find $f(f(50))$ if we can express $393$ in the form of $8n-7$.

Let's try to find such an $n$ that $8n-7=393$. We can solve this equation for $n$:
$$8n = 393 + 7 = 400,$$
$$n = \frac{400}{8} = 50.$$

So, $393=8*50-7$.

Now we know that $f(f(50))=50$.

Next, we need to find $f(50)$. We know that $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$. Let's set $n=25$, then we get $f(50)=2f(25)+1$.

But we know that $f(f(50))=50$, so $f(50)$ is the value that makes $2f(25)+1=50$. We can solve this equation for $f(25)$:
$$2f(25) = 50 - 1 = 49,$$
$$f(25) = \frac{49}{2} = 24.5.$$

Again, $f(25)$ must be an integer, so there must be an error in our calculation.

Let's try another approach.

We know that $f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$. Let's set $n=1$, then we get $f(f(f(1)))=8*1-7=1$.

We also know that $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$. This equation can help us find $f(f(1))$ if we can express $1$ in the form of $8n-7$.

Let's try to find such an $n$ that $8n-7=1$. We can solve this equation for $n$:
$$8n = 1 + 7 = 8,$$
$$n = \frac{8}{8} = 1.$$

So, $1=8*1-7$.

Now we know that $f(f(1))=1$.

Next, we need to find $f(1)$. We know that $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$. Let's set $n=0.5$, then we get $f(1)=2f(0.5)+1$.

But we know that $f(f(1))=1$, so $f(1)$ is the value that makes $2f(0.5)+1=1$. We can solve this equation for $f(0.5)$:
$$2f(0.5) = 1 - 1 = 0,$$
$$f(0.5) = \frac{0}{2} = 0.$$

But $f(0.5)$ must be an integer, so there must be an error in our calculation.

Let's try another approach.

We know that $f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$. Let's set $n=2$, then we get $f(f(f(2)))=8*2-7=9$.

We also know that $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$. This equation can help us find $f(f(2))$ if we can express $9$ in the form of $8n-7$.

Let's try to find such an $n$ that $8n-7=9$. We can solve this equation for $n$:
$$8n = 9 + 7 = 16,$$
$$n = \frac{16}{8} = 2.$$

So, $9=8*2-7$.

Now we know that $f(f(2))=2$.

Next, we need to find $f(2)$. We know that $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$. Let's set $n=1$, then we get $f(2)=2f(1)+1$.

But we know that $f(f(2))=2$, so $f(2)$ is the value that makes $2f(1)+1=2$. We can solve this equation for $f(1)$:
$$2f(1) = 2 - 1 = 1,$$
$$f(1) = \frac{1}{2} = 0.5.$$

But $f(1)$ must be an integer, so there must be an error in our calculation.

Let's try another approach.

We know that $f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$. Let's set $n=3$, then we get $f(f(f(3)))=8*3-7=17

Question (hint: positive numerical answer):
"A function $f: \mathbb N \to \mathbb N$ satisfies the following two conditions for all positive integers $n$:$f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$ and $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$. Calculate $f(100)$."
Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:



First, let's substitute $n=1$ into the equation $f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$. We get $f(f(f(1)))=8*1-7=1$. Since $f(1)$ is also a positive integer, we can set $f(1)=a$ for some positive integer $a$. Then the equation becomes $f(f(a))=1$.

Now let's substitute $n=2$ into the equation $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$. We get $f(4)=2f(2)+1$. If we substitute $f(2)=2f(1)+1=2a+1$, we get $f(4)=2(2a+1)+1=4a+3$.

Similarly, let's substitute $n=4$ into the equation $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$. We get $f(8)=2f(4)+1$. If we substitute $f(4)=4a+3$, we get $f(8)=2(4a+3)+1=8a+7$.

Now, let's substitute $n=1$ into the equation $f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$. We get $f(f(f(1)))=8*1-7=1$. We already know that $f(1)=a$, so we have $f(f(a))=1$. If we substitute $f(a)=2a+1$, we get $f(2a+1)=1$.

Now, let's substitute $n=2a+1$ into the equation $f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$. We get $f(f(f(2a+1)))=8(2a+1)-7=16a+9$. But we know that $f(2a+1)=1$, so we have $f(1)=1$.

Now, let's substitute $n=1$ into the equation $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$. We get $f(2)=2f(1)+1=2*1+1=3$. Since $f(2)=3$, we have $a=1$.

Finally, let's substitute $n=100$ into the equation $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$. We get $f(200)=2f(100)+1$. If we substitute $f(100)=x$, we get $f(200)=2x+1$.

But we know that $f(200)=8*100-7=793$. So we have $2x+1=793$. Solving for $x$, we get $x=\frac{793-1}{2}=396$.

So $f(100)=396$. The answer is: $396$

"A function $f: \mathbb N \to \mathbb N$ satisfies the following two conditions for all positive integers $n$:$f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$ and $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$. Calculate $f(100)$."
Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:


We are given that $f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$ and $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$. We want to find $f(100)$.
First, let's find $f(1)$ using the second equation. Since $2 \cdot 1 = 2$, we have $f(2) = 2f(1) + 1$.
Then, let's find $f(2)$ using the second equation again. Since $2 \cdot 2 = 4$, we have $f(4) = 2f(2) + 1$.
Continuing this pattern, we can find $f(4)$, $f(8)$, $f(16)$, and so on.
Notice that $f(f(f(1))) = f(f(1)) = f(1) = 1$ since $f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$ and we want to find $f(1)$.
So, we have $f(1) = 1$.
Using the second equation, we find $f(2) = 2f(1) + 1 = 2(1) + 1 = 3$.
Then, $f(4) = 2f(2) + 1 = 2(3) + 1 = 7$.
Continuing this pattern, we find $f(8) = 15$, $f(16) = 31$, and so on.
We notice that $f(2^k) = 2^k - 1$ for all positive integers $k$.
Now, we want to find $f(100)$. Since $100 = 2^2 \cdot 5^2$, we can use the second equation to find $f(100)$.
We have $f(100) = 2f(50) + 1$. Since $50 = 2 \cdot 25$, we have $f(50) = 2f(25) + 1$.
Continuing this pattern, we find $f(25) = 2f(12.5) + 1$. But $12.5$ is not a positive integer, so we cannot continue this pattern.
However, we notice that $25 = 5^2$, so $f(25) = 2^5 - 1 = 31$.
Therefore, $f(50) = 2f(25) + 1 = 2(31) + 1 = 63$.
Finally, $f(100) = 2f(50) + 1 = 2(63) + 1 = 127$.
So, $f(100) = 127$.
The answer is: $127$

Question (hint: positive numerical answer):
"A function $f: \mathbb N \to \mathbb N$ satisfies the following two conditions for all positive integers $n$:$f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$ and $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$. Calculate $f(100)$."
Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:


We are given that $f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$ and $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$. We want to find $f(100)$.
First, let's try to find a few values of the function using the second equation.
$f(2) = 2f(1) + 1$.
$f(4) = 2f(2) + 1 = 2(2f(1) + 1) + 1 = 4f(1) + 3$.
$f(8) = 2f(4) + 1 = 2(4f(1) + 3) + 1 = 8f(1) + 7$.
$f(16) = 2f(8) + 1 = 2(8f(1) + 7) + 1 = 16f(1) + 15$.
And so on.
We can see a pattern here: $f(2^n) = 2^n f(1) + 2^n - 1$.
Now, let's use this pattern to find $f(100)$.
$100 = 2^6 \cdot 5^2$.
So, $f(100) = f(2^6 \cdot 5^2) = 2^6 f(1) + 2^6 - 1 = 64f(1) + 63$.
To find $f(1)$, we can use the first equation with $n=1$: $f(f(f(1))) = 8(1) - 7 = 1$.
Since $f(f(f(1)))=1$, we know that $f(1)$ is a number such that when it is substituted into the equation $f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$, the result is 1.
Let's try a few values to find the value of $f(1)$.
If $f(1) = 1$, then $f(f(f(1))) = f(f(1)) = f(1) = 1$, which is not equal to 1.
If $f(1) = 2$, then $f(f(f(1))) = f(f(2)) = f(2f(1)+1) = f(3)$, but we don't know the value of $f(3)$.
If $f(1) = 3$, then $f(f(f(1))) = f(f(3)) = f(2f(1)+1) = f(7)$, but we don't know the value of $f(7)$.
Continuing this process, we find that $f(1) = 3$ works because $f(f(f(1))) = f(f(3)) = f(2f(1)+1) = f(7) = 8(1)-7 = 1$.
So, $f(1) = 3$.
Now, we can find $f(100) = 64f(1) + 63 = 64(3) + 63 = 192 + 63 = 255$.
Therefore, $f(100) = 255$. The answer is: $255$

Question (hint: positive numerical answer):
"A function $f: \mathbb N \to \mathbb N$ satisfies the following two conditions for all positive integers $n$:$f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$ and $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$. Calculate $f(100)$."
Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:


We are given that $f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$ and $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$.
We want to find $f(100)$.
Let's start by plugging in $n=50$ into the second equation:
$f(100) = 2f(50) + 1$.
Now we need to find $f(50)$.
Again, using the second equation, we have:
$f(100) = 2(2f(25) + 1) + 1 = 4f(25) + 3$.
Now we need to find $f(25)$.
Using the second equation again:
$f(50) = 2f(25) + 1$.
We can substitute this into our previous equation for $f(100)$:
$f(100) = 4(2f(12.5) + 1) + 3 = 8f(12.5) + 7$.
Now we need to find $f(12.5)$.
But notice that $12.5$ is not a positive integer, so we can't use the given equations directly.
However, we can use the first equation to find something useful.
If we plug in $n=12.5$ into the first equation, we get:
$f(f(f(12.5))) = 8(12.5) - 7 = 100 - 7 = 93$.
Since $f(f(f(12.5))) = 93$, we know that $f(12.5)$ must be a value such that when we apply the function $f$ three times, we get 93.
By trial and error or by inspection, we can find that $f(12.5) = 12$.
Now we can substitute this back into our equation for $f(100)$:
$f(100) = 8(12) + 7 = 96 + 7 = 103$.
So, $f(100) = 103$.
The value of $f(100)$ is 103. The answer is: $103$

"A function $f: \mathbb N \to \mathbb N$ satisfies the following two conditions for all positive integers $n$:$f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$ and $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$. Calculate $f(100)$."
Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:


We start by evaluating the function at $n=1$.
Using the second condition, we have $f(f(f(1)))=f(f(1))=8(1)-7=1$.
This implies that $f(1)$ must be an input that gives an output of 1 when fed into the function $f$.
Now let's try to find such an input.
We know that $f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$.
If we set $n=1$, we get $f(f(f(1)))=8(1)-7=1$.
So $f(f(1))=1$.
Again using the second condition, we have $f(2(1))=2f(1)+1$.
This simplifies to $f(2)=2f(1)+1$.
But we know that $f(1)$ is the input we are looking for, so we have $f(2)=2f(1)+1=1$.
This implies that $f(1)=0$.
Now we can use the second condition again to find $f(2)$.
We have $f(2)=2f(1)+1=2(0)+1=1$.
This means that our input of 1 indeed gives an output of 1 when fed into the function $f$.
Now we can use the first condition to find $f(100)$.
We have $f(f(f(100)))=8(100)-7=793$.
Since we know that $f(f(1))=1$, we can set up the equation $f(f(f(100)))=f(f(100))=793$.
This implies that $f(100)$ must be an input that gives an output of 793 when fed into the function $f$.
Again using the first condition, we have $f(f(f(100)))=8(100)-7=793$.
So $f(f(100))=793$.
Now let's try to find such an input.
We know that $f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$.
If we set $n=100$, we get $f(f(f(100)))=8(100)-7=793$.
So $f(f(100))=793$.
Again using the first condition, we have $f(2(100))=2f(100)+1$.
This simplifies to $f(200)=2f(100)+1$.
But we know that $f(100)$ is the input we are looking for, so we have $f(200)=2f(100)+1=793$.
This implies that $f(100)=\frac{f(200)-1}{2}=\frac{793-1}{2}=396$.
Therefore, $f(100)=396$.
The value of $f(100)$ is 396. The answer is: $396$

Question (hint: positive numerical answer):
"A function $f: \mathbb N \to \mathbb N$ satisfies the following two conditions for all positive integers $n$:$f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$ and $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$. Calculate $f(100)$."
Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:


To find $f(100)$, we need to use the given equations.

First, we know that $f(f(f(100)))=8(100)-7=793$.

Now, we need to find a number $x$ such that $f(x)=100$. To do this, we can substitute $x$ into the equation $f(f(f(x)))=793$ and solve for $x$.

Let's set $x=f(y)$, then we have $f(f(f(y)))=f(f(x))=f(100)$. So the equation becomes $f(f(f(y)))=793$ becomes $f(f(x))=793$.

Again, let's set $y=f(z)$, then we have $f(f(f(z)))=f(f(y))=f(x)=100$. So the equation becomes $f(f(f(z)))=793$ becomes $f(f(100))=793$.

From the second condition $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$, we know that $f(100)$ must be an even number plus 1. And from the equation $f(f(100))=793$, we know that $793$ is an odd number. The only way for $f(f(100))$ to be equal to $793$ is if $f(100)$ is an even number. So $f(100)=2k+1$ for some integer $k$.

We can substitute $f(100)=2k+1$ into the equation $f(f(100))=793$, we get $f(2k+1)=793$. From the second condition $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$, we know that $f(2k+1)=2f(k)+1$. So we have $2f(k)+1=793$. Solving this equation, we get $2f(k)=792$, $f(k)=396$.

Now, we can substitute $k$ into the equation $f(100)=2k+1$, we get $f(100)=2*396+1=793$. But this result contradicts with our previous result that $f(100)$ must be an even number plus 1. So we made a mistake in our previous steps.

Let's go back and retrace our steps. We found that $f(100)$ must be an even number plus 1 from the second condition $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$. And we know that $f(f(f(100)))=793$. So let's set $f(100)=2k$ for some integer $k$.

Substituting $f(100)=2k$ into the equation $f(f(f(100)))=793$, we get $f(f(2k))=793$. From the second condition $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$, we know that $f(2k)=2f(k)+1$. So we have $f(2f(k)+1)=793$. But we don't know the value of $f(k)$, so we can't solve this equation directly.

However, we know that $f(f(f(100)))=793$, so $f(f(2k))=793$ becomes $f(f(2k))=f(f(100))$. This implies that $2k=100$, so $k=50$.

Substituting $k=50$ into $f(100)=2k$, we get $f(100)=100$.

So we have found that $f(100)=100$.

Therefore, $f(100)=100$. The answer is: $\boxed{100}$
