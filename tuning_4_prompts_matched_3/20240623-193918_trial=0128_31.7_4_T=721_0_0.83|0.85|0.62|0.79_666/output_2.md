Below is a math problem you are to solve (positive numerical answer!):
"For how many positive integers $m$ does the equation \[\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}\] have $4$ distinct solutions?"
Analyze this problem and think step by step to come to a solution with programs. After solving the problem, output the final numerical answer within \boxed{}.

Assistant:

 The number of distinct solutions of the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ is equal to $4$ if and only if $\frac{m}{100} = 2$.
To see this, note that the expression $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert$ is a piecewise linear function with $4$ distinct slopes.
When $\frac{m}{100} = 2$, the function becomes a constant function with a single slope, which gives us exactly $4$ distinct solutions.
Therefore, we have $\frac{m}{100} = 2$, which implies $m = 200$. So the number of positive integers $m$ that satisfy the condition is $1$. The answer is: $1$

 The number of distinct solutions of the equation $||x-1|-2|=\frac{m}{100}$ is equal to 4 if and only if $\frac{m}{100}=1$. Therefore, we have $m=100$. So the number of positive integers $m$ for which the equation has 4 distinct solutions is 1. The answer is: $1$

Assistant:

 The number of distinct solutions of the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ is equal to $4$ if and only if $\frac{m}{100} = 1$. This is because the function $f(x) = \vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert$ has a graph that is a "V" shape with the maximum point at $(1,2)$, and the distance from the maximum point to the $x$-axis is $2$. If we set $\frac{m}{100}$ to be less than $2$, the equation will have less than $4$ solutions. If we set $\frac{m}{100}$ to be greater than $2$, the equation will have more than $4$ solutions. Therefore, the only value of $m$ that works is $m = 200$. So the number of positive integers $m$ that make the equation have $4$ distinct solutions is $1$. The answer is: $1$

"For how many positive integers $m$ does the equation \[\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}\] have $4$ distinct solutions?"

Assistant:

 The number of distinct solutions to the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ is equal to 4 if and only if $\frac{m}{100}=1$.
This is because the expression $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert$ takes on the value of 1 exactly 4 times.
So, we need to solve the equation $\frac{m}{100}=1$ for $m$.

```python


INTERMEDIATE OUT :

from sympy import symbols, Eq, solve

def find_m():
    m = symbols('m')
    equation = Eq(m/100, 1)
    solution = solve(equation, m)
    return solution[0]

result = find_m()
print(result)
```

CODE RESULTS 100

INTERMEDIATE OUT :
```output
100
```
The solution to the equation $\frac{m}{100}=1$ is $m=100$. Therefore, there is only 1 positive integer $m$ for which the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has 4 distinct solutions. The answer is: $1$
