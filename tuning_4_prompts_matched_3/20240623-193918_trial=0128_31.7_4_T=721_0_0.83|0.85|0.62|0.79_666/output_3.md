Below is a math problem you are to solve (positive numerical answer!):
"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"
Analyze this problem and think step by step to come to a solution with programs. After solving the problem, output the final numerical answer within \boxed{}.

Assistant:

 The given equation is a product of two terms equal to zero, so either the first term is zero or the second term is zero.

The first term is $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)$, which equals to zero if and only if both $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. This means that the points $(x, y)$ are on the lines $x + y = 10$ and $x - y = 10$, or $x + y = -10$ and $x - y = -10$. These lines form a square with side length $10\sqrt{2}$.

The second term is $((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2)$, which equals to zero if and only if both $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$. This means that the points $(x, y)$ are on the lines $x = 8$ and $x = -8$, or $y = 8$ and $y = -8$. These lines form a square with side length $16$.

The area of the convex polygon is the sum of the areas of these two squares. The area of a square with side length $a$ is $a^2$, so the area of the first square is $(10\sqrt{2})^2 = 200$, and the area of the second square is $16^2 = 256$. Therefore, the total area of the convex polygon is $200 + 256 = 456$.

```python


INTERMEDIATE OUT :

from sympy import sqrt

def area_of_polygon():
    """The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"""
    side_length1 = 10*sqrt(2)
    side_length2 = 16
    area1 = side_length1**2
    area2 = side_length2**2
    total_area = area1 + area2
    return total_area

result = area_of_polygon()
print(result)
```

CODE RESULTS 456

INTERMEDIATE OUT :
```output
456
```
The area of the convex polygon is $456$. The answer is: $456$.

 The given equation is a product of two terms equal to zero. Therefore, either the first term is zero, or the second term is zero. 

If the first term is zero, we have $\vert x + y \vert - 10 = 0$ and $\vert x - y \vert - 10 = 0$, which implies $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. This means that $x + y = \pm 10$ and $x - y = \pm 10$. Solving these four equations, we get the vertices of the polygon as $(0, 10), (0, -10), (10, 0), (-10, 0)$.

If the second term is zero, we have $\vert x \vert - 8 = 0$ and $\vert y \vert - 8 = 0$, which implies $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$. This means that $x = \pm 8$ and $y = \pm 8$. Solving these four equations, we get the vertices of the polygon as $(8, 8), (8, -8), (-8, 8), (-8, -8)$.

Therefore, the polygon is a square with side length 10. The area of a square is side length squared, so the area of this square is $10^2 = 100$.

The answer is: $100$

Below is a math problem you are to solve (positive numerical answer!):
"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"

Assistant:

 The given equation is $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$. For the product of two numbers to be zero, one of them must be zero. Therefore, either $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$.

If $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$, then $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$, which implies that $x + y = \pm 10$ and $x - y = \pm 10$. Solving these equations, we get the vertices of the polygon as $(0, 10), (0, -10), (10, 0), (-10, 0)$.

If $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$, then $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$, which implies that $x = \pm 8$ and $y = \pm 8$. Adding these points to our list of vertices, we get $(0, 8), (0, -8), (8, 0), (-8, 0)$.

So, the vertices of the polygon are $(0, 10), (0, -10), (10, 0), (-10, 0), (0, 8), (0, -8), (8, 0), (-8, 0)$. This is a square with side length 10. The area of the square is $10^2 = 100$. The answer is: $100$

"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"
Analyze this problem and think step by step to come to a solution with programs. After solving the problem, output the final numerical answer within \boxed{}.

Assistant:

 The given equation is a product of two terms equal to zero, which means either of the terms must be zero. Therefore, we have two sets of equations:

1. $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ and $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$
2. $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ and $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$

From the first set of equations, we have $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. This implies that $x + y = \pm 10$ and $x - y = \pm 10$. Solving these equations, we get the points $(5, 5), (5, -5), (-5, 5), (-5, -5)$.

From the second set of equations, we have $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$. This implies that $x = \pm 8$ and $y = \pm 8$. Solving these equations, we get the points $(8, 8), (8, -8), (-8, 8), (-8, -8)$.

The points $(5, 5), (5, -5), (-5, 5), (-5, -5), (8, 8), (8, -8), (-8, 8), (-8, -8)$ form a square with side length $10$. The area of this square is $10^2 = 100$.
The answer is: $100$

Below is a math problem you are to solve (positive numerical answer!):
"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"
Analyze this problem and think step by step to come to a solution with programs. After solving the problem, output the final numerical answer within \boxed{}.

Assistant:

 The given equation is a product of two expressions equal to zero, so either the first expression is zero or the second expression is zero.

The first expression is $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)$, and this equals zero if and only if both $\vert x + y \vert - 10 = 0$ and $\vert x - y \vert - 10 = 0$, which means $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$.

The second expression is $((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2)$, and this equals zero if and only if both $\vert x \vert - 8 = 0$ and $\vert y \vert - 8 = 0$, which means $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$.

The solutions to the first system of equations are the points $(x, y)$ such that $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. These are the points that lie on a square with side length 10.

The solutions to the second system of equations are the points $(x, y)$ such that $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$. These are the points that lie on a square with side length 16.

The intersection of these two squares is the convex polygon that is the solution to the given problem. The side length of this square is the smaller of the two side lengths, which is 10.

The area of a square with side length $s$ is $s^2$, so the area of the convex polygon is $10^2 = 100$. The answer is: $100$.
