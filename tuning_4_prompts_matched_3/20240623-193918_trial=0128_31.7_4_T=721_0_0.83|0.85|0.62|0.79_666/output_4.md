"A function $f: \mathbb N \to \mathbb N$ satisfies the following two conditions for all positive integers $n$:$f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$ and $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$. Calculate $f(100)$."

To solve this problem, we need to find the value of $f(100)$ based on the given conditions.

First, let's use the second condition $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$ to find the value of $f(100)$.

Since $100 = 2 \times 50$, we can apply the second condition to get $f(100) = 2f(50) + 1$.

Now we need to find the value of $f(50)$. Using the same approach, we can write $50 = 2 \times 25$, so $f(50) = 2f(25) + 1$.

Continuing this process, we can find that $25 = 5 \times 5$, so $f(25) = 2f(5) + 1$.

Finally, we can find the value of $f(5)$ using the first condition $f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$. Setting $n = 5$, we get $f(f(f(5)))=8 \times 5 - 7 = 33$, so $f(f(5)) = 33$.

Now we need to find the value of $f(5)$. Using the same approach, we can write $f(5) = 2f(2.5) + 1$. However, $2.5$ is not a positive integer, so we cannot use the second condition directly.

But we can use the first condition $f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$ again. Setting $n = 2.5$, we get $f(f(f(2.5)))=8 \times 2.5 - 7 = 13$, so $f(f(2.5)) = 13$.

Now we can find the value of $f(2.5)$. Using the same approach, we can write $f(2.5) = 2f(1.25) + 1$. Again, $1.25$ is not a positive integer, so we cannot use the second condition directly.

But we can use the first condition $f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$ once more. Setting $n = 1.25$, we get $f(f(f(1.25)))=8 \times 1.25 - 7 = 3$, so $f(f(1.25)) = 3$.

Now we can find the value of $f(1.25)$. Using the same approach, we can write $f(1.25) = 2f(0.625) + 1$. But $0.625$ is not a positive integer, so we cannot use the second condition directly.

However, we can notice that $f(1) = 1$ from the first condition $f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$ when $n = 1$. Therefore, $f(0.625) = 1$ because $0.625 < 1$.

Now we can find the value of $f(0.625) = 1$.

Going back to $f(1.25) = 2f(0.625) + 1 = 2 \times 1 + 1 = 3$.

Then $f(2.5) = 2f(1.25) + 1 = 2 \times 3 + 1 = 7$.

And finally, $f(5) = 2f(2.5) + 1 = 2 \times 7 + 1 = 15$.

Now we can find the value of $f(25) = 2f(5) + 1 = 2 \times 15 + 1 = 31$.

Then $f(50) = 2f(25) + 1 = 2 \times 31 + 1 = 63$.

And finally, $f(100) = 2f(50) + 1 = 2 \times 63 + 1 = 127$.

So, $f(100) = 127$. The answer is: $127$

 To solve this problem, we need to find the value of $f(100)$ based on the given conditions.

Let's start by finding the value of $f(1)$ using the second condition with $n=1$:
$$f(2 \cdot 1) = 2f(1) + 1 \Rightarrow f(2) = 2f(1) + 1.$$
Now, we know that $f(f(f(1))) = 8 \cdot 1 - 7 = 1$, so $f(f(1)) = 1$.
Using the second condition again with $n=f(1)$:
$$f(2f(1)) = 2f(f(1)) + 1 \Rightarrow f(2) = 2 \cdot 1 + 1 = 3.$$
Substituting this into the equation $f(2) = 2f(1) + 1$, we get:
$$3 = 2f(1) + 1 \Rightarrow 2f(1) = 2 \Rightarrow f(1) = 1.$$

Now we can find $f(100)$ using the second condition:
$$f(2 \cdot 100) = 2f(100) + 1.$$
We also know that $f(f(f(100))) = 8 \cdot 100 - 7 = 793$.

Unfortunately, this problem is not easily solvable using a straightforward programming approach, as it requires a deep understanding of the function and its properties. However, we can use a recursive approach to find $f(100)$ by starting from $f(1)$ and iteratively applying the second condition. Here's a Python function to do this:

```python


INTERMEDIATE OUT :

def find_f_100():
    def f(n):
        if n == 1:
            return 1
        else:
            return 2 * f(n // 2) + 1

    return f(100)

result = find_f_100()
print(result)
```

CODE RESULTS 127

INTERMEDIATE OUT :
```output
127
```
The value of $f(100)$ is $127$. The answer is: $127$

This problem is a bit tricky to solve directly using a programming approach because it involves recursive functions and the second equation only applies to specific cases (when $n$ is a power of 2). However, we can make some observations and use them to our advantage.

From the first equation, we know that $f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$. If we set $n=1$, we get $f(f(f(1)))=8*1-7=1$, which implies that $f(1)=1$.

Now, let's use this result in the second equation. If we set $n=1$, we get $f(2)=2f(1)+1=2*1+1=3$.

Now, if we set $n=2$ in the second equation, we get $f(4)=2f(2)+1=2*3+1=7$.

Continuing this process, we find that $f(8)=15$, $f(16)=31$, $f(32)=63$, and so on. We can see a pattern here: $f(2^k)=2^k-1$ for all positive integers $k$.

Now, we want to find $f(100)$. Since $100=2^2*5^2$, we can use the second equation repeatedly to find $f(100)$. We know that $f(50)=2f(25)+1$, $f(25)=2f(12.5)+1$, and so on. Eventually, we reach $f(2^8)=2^8-1=255$. Now we can use the second equation to find $f(100)$: $f(100)=2f(50)+1=2(2f(25)+1)+1=2(2(2f(12.5)+1)+1)+1=2(2(2(2f(6.25)+1)+1)+1)+1=2(2(2(2(2f(3.125)+1)+1)+1)+1)+1=2(2(2(2(2(2f(1.5625)+1)+1)+1)+1)+1)+1=2(2(2(2(2(2(2f(0.78125)+1)+1)+1)+1)+1)+1)+1=2(2(2(2(2(2(2*1+1)+1)+1)+1)+1)+1)+1=2(2(2(2(2(3)+1)+1)+1)+1)+1=2(2(2(2(7)+1)+1)+1)+1=2(2(2(15)+1)+1)+1=2(2(31)+1)+1=2(63)+1=127$.

So, $f(100)=127$. The answer is: $127$
