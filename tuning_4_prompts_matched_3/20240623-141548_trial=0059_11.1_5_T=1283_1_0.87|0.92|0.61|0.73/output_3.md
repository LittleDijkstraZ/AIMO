Interesting, let's analyze step by step:



First, note that the expression equals zero if either of the two factors equals zero. This gives us two equations:
1. $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + (\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$
2. $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + (\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$

From equation 1, we have $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. This implies that the points $(x, y)$ lie on a square with side length 20.

From equation 2, we have $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$. This implies that the points $(x, y)$ lie on a square with side length 16.

The intersection of these two squares is a smaller square with side length 8.

The area of this square is $8^2 = 64$.

Therefore, the area of the convex polygon is 64 square units. The answer is: $64$

Interesting, let's analyze step by step:



The expression is $0$ if and only if both $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2$ and $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2$ are $0$, or both $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2$ and $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2$ are $0$.

This gives us four systems of equations:

1. $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$.
2. $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x \vert = 8$.
3. $\vert x - y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x \vert = 8$.
4. $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$.

Let's solve these systems:

1. From $\vert x + y \vert = 10$, we have $x + y = \pm 10$. Similarly, from $\vert x - y \vert = 10$, we have $x - y = \pm 10$. Solving these two systems of equations, we get the points $(5,5)$, $(5,-5)$, $(-5,5)$, and $(-5,-5)$.

2. From $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x \vert = 8$, we have $x = \pm 8$. Substituting these values into the equation $x + y = \pm 10$, we get the points $(8, -2)$, $(8, 2)$, $(-8, -2)$, and $(-8, 2)$.

3. Similarly to 2., from $\vert x - y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x \vert = 8$, we have $x = \pm 8$. Substituting these values into the equation $x - y = \pm 10$, we get the points $(8, -6)$, $(8, 6)$, $(-8, -6)$, and $(-8, 6)$.

4. From $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$, we have $x = \pm 8$ and $y = \pm 8$. This gives us the points $(8, 8)$, $(8, -8)$, $(-8, 8)$, and $(-8, -8)$.

Combining all these points, we get a total of 16 points. These points form a square with side length 10, so the area of the convex polygon is $10^2 = 100$. The value is positive and an integer, as required.
The answer is: $100$

"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"

Interesting, let's analyze step by step:



1. We have the equation $ ((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0 $.

2. For the product of two factors to be zero, either one or both of them must be zero. So we have two cases:
   a) $ ((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2) = 0 $
   b) $ ((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0 $

3. For the first case, $ ((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2) = 0 $, it means both $ (\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0 $ and $ (\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0 $. This implies $ \vert x + y \vert = 10 $ and $ \vert x - y \vert = 10 $. Solving these equations gives us the vertices of a square with side length 10.

4. For the second case, $ ((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0 $, it means both $ (\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0 $ and $ (\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0 $. This implies $ \vert x \vert = 8 $ and $ \vert y \vert = 8 $. Solving these equations gives us the vertices of a square with side length 16.

5. The area of the convex polygon enclosed by these points is the sum of the areas of the two squares. The area of a square with side length $a$ is $a^2$, so the area of the first square is $10^2 = 100$ and the area of the second square is $16^2 = 256$.

6. The total area of the convex polygon is $100 + 256 = 356$.

The problem asks for a positive integer as the area of the polygon. We have found that the area is indeed a positive integer, $356$. The answer is: $356$.

Interesting, let's analyze step by step:



The equation given is $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$.

This equation is satisfied if either of the two factors is zero. This translates to:

1. $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ and $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ and $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$.
2. $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ and $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$.

From the above, we can see that the points $(x, y)$ that satisfy the equation are either of the form:

1. $(x, y) = (8, 8)$
2. $(x, y) = (10, 10)$ or $(x, y) = (-10, -10)$ or $(x, y) = (10, -10)$ or $(x, y) = (-10, 10)$

Plotting these points on a graph, we find that they form a square with side length $20$. The area of this square is $20^2 = 400$.

So, the area of the convex polygon is $400$.
The answer is: $400$

Interesting, let's analyze step by step:



The equation $AB=0$ is equivalent to $A=0$ or $B=0$. This means that the points that satisfy the given equation are those that satisfy either $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$, $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$, $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$, or $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$.

The solutions to $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ are the points on the line $x + y = 10$.

The solutions to $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ are the points on the line $x - y = 10$.

The solutions to $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ are the points on the lines $x = 8$ and $x = -8$.

The solutions to $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ are the points on the lines $y = 8$ and $y = -8$.

The intersection of these lines forms a square with side length 10. The area of this square is $10^2 = 100$. So the area of the convex polygon is 100.

The answer is: $100$

Interesting, let's analyze step by step:



The expression is equal to zero when either $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$.

If $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$, then $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ which means $x + y = \pm 10$.

If $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$, then $\vert x - y \vert = 10$ which means $x - y = \pm 10$.

If $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$, then $\vert x \vert = 8$ which means $x = \pm 8$.

If $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$, then $\vert y \vert = 8$ which means $y = \pm 8$.

The points that satisfy these conditions are:

$(8, 8)$, $(-8, 8)$, $(8, -8)$, $(-8, -8)$, $(10, 0)$, $(-10, 0)$, $(0, 10)$, $(0, -10)$.

These points form a square with side length $16$, so the area is $16^2 = 256$.

Thus, the area of the convex polygon is 256 square units.
The answer is: $256$.

Interesting, let's analyze step by step:



The product of two numbers equals zero if at least one of the numbers is zero. Therefore, we have two cases:

1. $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$.
2. $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$.

For the first case, we have $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ or $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. This gives us the lines $x + y = 10$, $x + y = -10$, $x - y = 10$, and $x - y = -10$.

For the second case, we have $\vert x \vert = 8$ or $\vert y \vert = 8$. This gives us the lines $x = 8$, $x = -8$, $y = 8$, and $y = -8$.

The intersection of these lines forms a square with side length 10 (since the distance between the lines $x + y = 10$ and $x + y = -10$ is 10, and similarly for the other two pairs of lines).

The area of this square is $10^2 = 100$.
The answer is: $100$

The product of two numbers is zero if and only if at least one of them is zero. Therefore, we have two cases to consider:

Case 1: $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$. This implies $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ or $\vert x - y \vert = 10$.

Case 2: $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$. This implies $\vert x \vert = 8$ or $\vert y \vert = 8$.

For Case 1, we have four lines: $x + y = 10$, $x + y = -10$, $x - y = 10$, and $x - y = -10$. For Case 2, we have four lines: $x = 8$, $x = -8$, $y = 8$, and $y = -8$.

Plotting these lines, we find that they form a square with side length 16. To find the area of the square, we simply square the side length: $16^2 = 256$.

The area of the convex polygon is 256.
The answer is: $256$

Interesting, let's analyze step by step:



1. The equation given is $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + (\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + (\vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$.

2. For the product of two expressions to be zero, either one or both expressions must be zero. Therefore, we have two cases:

   Case 1: $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + (\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$. This implies that $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. This means that the points $(x, y)$ lie on a square with side length $20$ centered at the origin.

   Case 2: $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + (\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$. This implies that $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$, which means that the points $(x, y)$ lie on a square with side length $16$ centered at the origin.

3. The intersection of these two cases is the square with side length $16$ (Case 2), which is fully contained within the square with side length $20$ (Case 1).

4. The area of the convex polygon formed by the intersection of these two cases is the area of the square with side length $16$, which is $16^2 = 256$.

So, the area of the convex polygon is $256$. Since $256$ is a positive integer, we can conclude that our answer is correct. The answer is: $256$
