Interesting, let's analyze step by step:



The equation has 4 distinct solutions. It's obvious that $m$ has to be a multiple of $100$ because the right hand side is $\frac{m}{100}$. Let's denote $m=100n$. Thus we have
\[\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=n.\]

The expression inside the absolute value, $\vert x-1 \vert -2$, can take three values: $-n, 0, n$. That's because the absolute value can be either positive or negative.

Now let's consider each case:

1. When $\vert x-1 \vert -2 = -n$, we have $\vert x-1 \vert = 2-n$. Thus $x-1 = 2-n$ or $x-1 = -(2-n)$, which gives $x = 3-n$ or $x = n-1$.

2. When $\vert x-1 \vert -2 = 0$, we have $\vert x-1 \vert = 2$. Thus $x-1 = 2$ or $x-1 = -2$, which gives $x = 3$ or $x = -1$.

3. When $\vert x-1 \vert -2 = n$, we have $\vert x-1 \vert = 2+n$. Thus $x-1 = 2+n$ or $x-1 = -(2+n)$, which gives $x = 3+n$ or $x = -n-1$.

For the equation to have 4 distinct solutions, the four solutions from the above cases must be distinct. That is, $3-n \neq -1$, $3-n \neq 3+n$, $3-n \neq -n-1$, $3+n \neq -1$, $3+n \neq 3-n$, and $3+n \neq -n-1$.

Solving these inequalities, we find that $n = 1$. Thus $m = 100n = 100$.

So the only value of $m$ that makes the equation have 4 distinct solutions is $m = 100$.

Now let's verify that $m = 100$ is a positive integer:

It's obvious that $m = 100$ is a positive integer.

Therefore, the number of positive integers $m$ such that the equation has 4 distinct solutions is 1. The answer is: $1$

Interesting, let's analyze step by step:



The equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has $4$ distinct solutions. The number $\frac{m}{100}$ must be positive, and we know that the expression $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert$ can take only values in the interval $[0, 3]$. Therefore, the value of $\frac{m}{100}$ must be in the interval $(0, 3]$. So, $0 < \frac{m}{100} \leq 3$ which gives $0 < m \leq 300$. The problem asks for how many positive integers $m$ satisfy this condition, so the number of such $m$ is $300$. However, we are asked for the number of positive integers $m$ such that the equation has exactly four distinct solutions.

This equation can have four distinct solutions when $\frac{m}{100} = 1$ or $\frac{m}{100} = 2$. So we need to find the number of positive integers $m$ such that $\frac{m}{100} = 1$ or $\frac{m}{100} = 2$.

If $\frac{m}{100} = 1$, then $m = 100$.
If $\frac{m}{100} = 2$, then $m = 200$.

Therefore, there are only two values of $m$ (100 and 200) for which the equation has exactly four distinct solutions.

Therefore, the number of positive integers $m$ that make the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ have $4$ distinct solutions is $2$.

So, the answer is $\boxed{2}$.

Interesting, let's analyze step by step:



The equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has 4 distinct solutions. This means that the right hand side of the equation, $\frac{m}{100}$, should be set to a value such that it produces 4 distinct solutions for the absolute value equation.

Let's start by setting $\frac{m}{100}=k$, where $k$ is a positive constant.

Then the equation becomes $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=k$.

For this equation to have 4 distinct solutions, $k$ must be set to a value such that the graph of $y=\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert$ intersects the line $y=k$ at exactly 4 points.

The graph of $y=\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert$ is a "hockey stick" graph, with the "sticks" at $y=0$ and $y=4$. Thus, for the line $y=k$ to intersect this graph at exactly 4 points, $k$ must be set to a value in the interval $(0, 4)$.

Therefore, the possible values of $k$ are the 99 positive integers from 1 to 99, divided by 100.

So, the number of possible values of $m$ is 99.

The answer is: $99$

Assistant:

Interesting, let's analyze step by step:



We want to solve the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ for $4$ distinct solutions. This means that the right side of the equation, $\frac{m}{100}$, must be greater than $2$ (the absolute value on the left side can't be negative). So we have $\frac{m}{100} > 2$, which gives us $m > 200$.

Now let's try to solve the equation step by step:

1. First, we need to solve the absolute value equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$. This equation has four cases to consider:

   - Case 1: $\vert x-1 \vert -2 = \frac{m}{100}$, and $\vert x-1 \vert -2 \geq 0$. This gives us the equation $\vert x-1 \vert = 2 + \frac{m}{100}$, and since $\vert x-1 \vert \geq 0$, we have $2 + \frac{m}{100} \geq 0$, which gives us $m \geq -200$. But we already know that $m > 200$, so this case doesn't give us any solutions.
   
   - Case 2: $\vert x-1 \vert -2 = \frac{m}{100}$, and $\vert x-1 \vert -2 < 0$. This gives us the equation $\vert x-1 \vert = 2 - \frac{m}{100}$, and since $\vert x-1 \vert \geq 0$, we have $2 - \frac{m}{100} \geq 0$, which gives us $m \leq 200$. But we already know that $m > 200$, so this case doesn't give us any solutions either.
   
   - Case 3: $-\vert x-1 \vert -2 = \frac{m}{100}$, and $\vert x-1 \vert +2 \geq 0$. This gives us the equation $-\vert x-1 \vert = 2 + \frac{m}{100}$, and since $-\vert x-1 \vert \leq 0$, we have $2 + \frac{m}{100} \leq 0$, which gives us $m \leq -200$. But we know that $m > 200$, so this case doesn't give us any solutions either.
   
   - Case 4: $-\vert x-1 \vert -2 = \frac{m}{100}$, and $\vert x-1 \vert +2 < 0$. This gives us the equation $-\vert x-1 \vert = 2 - \frac{m}{100}$. Then we have $\vert x-1 \vert = \frac{m}{100} - 2$. Since $\vert x-1 \vert \geq 0$, we have $\frac{m}{100} - 2 \geq 0$, which gives us $m \geq 200$. This is exactly what we need.

2. Now we need to solve the equation $\vert x-1 \vert = \frac{m}{100} - 2$. This equation has two cases to consider:

   - Case 4.1: $x-1 = \frac{m}{100} - 2$, and we have $x = 1 + \frac{m}{100} - 2 = \frac{m}{100} - 1$.
   
   - Case 4.2: $-(x-1) = \frac{m}{100} - 2$, and we have $x = 1 - \frac{m}{100} + 2 = 3 - \frac{m}{100}$.

3. Now we need to find the values of $m$ for which these two equations have 4 distinct solutions. This happens when the two solutions are different and each of them has two different values of $m$. This means we need to solve the equations $\frac{m}{100} - 1 = 3 - \frac{m}{100}$ and $\frac{m}{100} - 1 = 1 - \frac{m}{100}$.

The first equation gives us $2\frac{m}{100} = 4$, which gives us $m = 200$. The second equation gives us $2\frac{m}{100} = 2$, which gives us $m = 100$. So the values of $m$ we need are $m = 100$ and $m = 200$.

4. Finally, we need to find the number of positive integer solutions for $m$. The only positive integer solutions are $m = 100$ and $m = 200$, so there are 2 positive integer solutions.

So the number of positive integers $m$ for which the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has 4 distinct solutions is 2. The answer is: $2$

Interesting, let's analyze step by step:


The equation $| |x - 1| - 2 | = \frac{m}{100}$ has 4 distinct solutions. This means that the right side $\frac{m}{100}$ must be equal to 2.
This gives us $m = 200$.
To verify this, we substitute $m = 200$ into the equation and check if it has 4 distinct solutions.

```python

from sympy import symbols, Eq, Abs, solveset, S

def find_m():
    x = symbols('x')
    m = 200
    equation = Eq(Abs(Abs(x - 1) - 2), m / 100)
    solutions = solveset(equation, x, domain=S.Reals)
    return len(solutions) == 4

result = find_m()

```

However, this solution does not work because it does not give us 4 distinct solutions.
We need to reconsider the equation.
The equation $| |x - 1| - 2 | = \frac{m}{100}$ can be rewritten as $| |x - 1| - 2 | = 2$.
This equation has 4 distinct solutions:

For $|x - 1| - 2 = 2$, we have $|x - 1| = 4$, which gives us two solutions: $x - 1 = 4$ or $x - 1 = -4$.
Solving these gives us $x = 5$ and $x = -3$.

For $-(|x - 1| - 2) = 2$, we have $|x - 1| - 2 = -2$, which simplifies to $|x - 1| = 0$.
This gives us one solution: $x = 1$.

So, the 4 distinct solutions are $x = 5$, $x = -3$, and $x = 1$.

Now, we substitute $m = 200$ into the equation and check if it has 4 distinct solutions.

However, we made a mistake in our previous calculations.
The equation $| |x - 1| - 2 | = 2$ has four distinct solutions, not three.
We need to reconsider the equation and try to solve it correctly.

The equation $| |x - 1| - 2 | = 2$ can be rewritten as $|x - 1| - 2 = 2$ or $|x - 1| - 2 = -2$.

For $|x - 1| - 2 = 2$, we have $|x - 1| = 4$, which gives us two solutions: $x - 1 = 4$ or $x - 1 = -4$.
Solving these gives us $x = 5$ and $x = -3$.

Interesting, let's analyze step by step:


The equation \[\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}\] has 4 distinct solutions.
The right-hand side of the equation is a fraction with denominator 100, and the value of m is a positive integer.
Since the absolute value function is nonnegative, the left-hand side of the equation is also nonnegative.
Therefore, the value of the right-hand side, $\frac{m}{100}$, must be nonnegative as well. This implies that $m$ is a positive integer.

The equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has 4 distinct solutions, which means that the graph of $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert$ intersects the line $y=\frac{m}{100}$ at 4 points.
The graph of $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert$ is a V-shape with vertices at $x=1\pm2$, i.e., at $x=-1$ and $x=3$.
To have 4 intersections, the line $y=\frac{m}{100}$ must lie strictly between the two V-shapes, i.e., between the lines $y=0$ and $y=4$.
Therefore, $0 < \frac{m}{100} < 4$, which implies $0 < m < 400$.
The positive integer values of $m$ that satisfy this inequality are $1, 2, 3, \dots, 399$.
The number of these positive integers is 399.
However, we need to find the number of these values that make the equation have 4 distinct solutions.
By analyzing the graph of $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert$, we find that the equation has 4 distinct solutions for $m$ values in the range $100 < m < 300$.
The number of positive integers in this range is $300-100-1=199$.
Therefore, there are 199 positive integer values of $m$ that make the equation have 4 distinct solutions.

However, this is not the final answer. We need to find the number of positive integer values of $m$ such that the equation has exactly 4 distinct solutions.
By analyzing the graph of $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert$, we find that the equation has exactly 4 distinct solutions for $m$ values in the range $100 < m < 300$ with a step of 100.
The number of positive integer values in this range with a step of 100 is $\frac{300-100}{100}+1=2+1=3$.
Therefore, there are 3 positive integer values of $m$ such that the equation has exactly 4 distinct solutions.
These values are $150$, $200$, and $250$.

Hence, the number of positive integer values of $m$ such that the equation has exactly 4 distinct solutions is 3.
The answer is: $3$

Interesting, let's analyze step by step:



1. We have the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$, and we want to find out for how many positive integers $m$ this equation has 4 distinct solutions.
2. To start solving this problem, let's first consider the right side of the equation, $\frac{m}{100}$. Since $m$ is a positive integer, $\frac{m}{100}$ must be a positive number.
3. Now, let's consider the left side of the equation, $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert$. This expression is equal to a positive number, which we'll call $k$ (since $k = \frac{m}{100}$). The absolute value function makes the expression nonnegative, so $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=k$ has four distinct solutions if and only if $0 < k \leq 1$.
4. In other words, we need to find the number of positive integers $m$ such that $0 < \frac{m}{100} \leq 1$. This simplifies to $0 < m \leq 100$.
5. The number of positive integers $m$ in this range is simply 100. Therefore, there are 100 positive integers $m$ for which the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has four distinct solutions.
6. The answer is $\boxed{1}$.

Remember, when dealing with these types of problems, it's important to carefully analyze the conditions and constraints given in the problem. Then, use your mathematical knowledge and logical reasoning to solve the problem. The sympy library is a great tool, but in this case, it wasn't necessary because the problem didn't require any symbolic computation.

Interesting, let's analyze step by step:



The equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has 4 distinct solutions.

We know that the absolute value function has a V-shape, and the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ will have 4 distinct solutions if the right side $\frac{m}{100}$ is equal to the distance between the two V's in the absolute value function.

The distance between the two V's in the absolute value function is 2, so we have $\frac{m}{100} = 2$, which implies $m = 200$.

Therefore, there is only one positive integer $m$ that makes the equation have 4 distinct solutions, and that is $m = 200$. The answer is: $1$

Interesting, let's analyze step by step:



The equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has 4 distinct solutions. It's clear that the right side of the equation, $\frac{m}{100}$, must be a positive number because of the absolute values on the left side, which create a V-shaped graph.

Now let's look at the solutions. When the equation is equal to $\frac{m}{100}$, it means the distance from the two sides of the V to the middle line is $\frac{m}{100}$. That means the maximum height of the V is $2*\frac{m}{100} = \frac{m}{50}$.

However, because the maximum value of the absolute value function is 1, we have $\frac{m}{50} \leq 1$, which gives $m \leq 50$. 

On the other hand, if we want the equation to have 4 distinct solutions, we know from the graph that the height of the V, $\frac{m}{50}$, must be greater than 1 (otherwise there will only be 2 solutions). So we have $1 < \frac{m}{50} \leq 1$, which gives $50 < m \leq 50$. This is a contradiction and we must have made a mistake in our reasoning.

The mistake was that we didn't consider the equation equal to $-\frac{m}{100}$ (the distance below the middle line of the V is also $\frac{m}{100}$). That means the total "height" of the V is $2*\frac{m}{100} = \frac{m}{50}$, and the total "width" of the V (the distance from the two sides of the V to the middle line when the equation equals either $\frac{m}{100}$ or $-\frac{m}{100}$) is $4*\frac{m}{100} = \frac{m}{25}$.

Therefore, we have $\frac{m}{50} \leq 1$ (the maximum height of the V is 1) and $\frac{m}{25} > 1$ (the width of the V is greater than 1), which gives $25 < m \leq 50$.

Now we need to find how many positive integer solutions $m$ there are in this range. We can simply count them: 26, 27, ..., 50. The number of such $m$ is $50 - 26 + 1 = 25$.

Therefore, there are 25 positive integer values of $m$ for which the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has 4 distinct solutions. The answer is: $25$.

We verify that 25 is indeed a positive integer, so the answer is $\boxed{25}$.
The value of $m$ for which the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has 4 distinct solutions is 25.

The answer is: $25$.

Interesting, let's analyze step by step:



\[\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}\]

This equation has 4 distinct solutions when $m = 200$.

Therefore, there is only one positive integer $m$ for which the equation has 4 distinct solutions, and that is $m = 200$. So the answer is $\boxed{1}$.

However, this solution doesn't match the expected format of the problem, which asks for a positive integer number of solutions. Let's try a different approach.

We can start by observing that the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has 4 distinct solutions when $\frac{m}{100} = 2$. This is because the function $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert$ reaches its maximum value of 2, and therefore equals 2 when it has 4 distinct solutions.

From this, we can solve for $m$:
\[m = 100 \cdot 2 = 200.\]

Therefore, the only positive integer $m$ for which the equation has 4 distinct solutions is $m = 200$. So the answer is still $\boxed{1}$.

Now, let's check if $m = 200$ is a positive integer:

$m = 200$ is indeed a positive integer. Therefore, the correct answer is $\boxed{1}$.
The answer is: $1$
