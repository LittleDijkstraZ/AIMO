Interesting, let's analyze step by step:



The equation is given as:
$$((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$$

This equation equals zero if either of the two factors equals zero. This gives us two systems of equations:

1. $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ and $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$
2. $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ and $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$

For the first system, we have $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$. This implies $-8 \leq x, y \leq 8$.

For the second system, we have $\vert x - y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$. This implies $-8 \leq x, y \leq 8$.

So in both cases, we have $-8 \leq x, y \leq 8$. The points $(x, y)$ that satisfy the equation form a square with side length 16. The area of this square is $16^2 = 256$.

Therefore, the area of the convex polygon is 256. The answer is: $256$

Interesting, let's analyze step by step:



The equation is a product of two terms equal to zero, which means that either the first term is zero, or the second term is zero. 

The first term is $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)$, and the second term is $((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2)$. 

Setting each term to zero gives us the following four equations:

1. $\vert x + y \vert = 10$
2. $\vert x - y \vert = 10$
3. $\vert x \vert = 8$
4. $\vert y \vert = 8$

The solutions to these equations are the vertices of the polygon. 

To find the vertices, we can consider all possible combinations of the absolute value equations. 

For example, if we have $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x \vert = 8$, we can substitute the second equation into the first to get $\vert 8 + y \vert = 10$. This gives us two possible equations: $8 + y = 10$ or $8 + y = -10$. Solving these equations gives us the points $(8, 2)$ and $(8, -18)$.

We can do this for all combinations of the equations, and then plot the points to find the vertices of the polygon.

Once we have the vertices, we can calculate the area of the polygon using the shoelace formula.

The area of the polygon is 256 square units.

The answer is: $256$

Below is a math problem you are to solve (positive numerical answer):
"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"

Interesting, let's analyze step by step:



The equation is given as:
$$((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$$

This equation equals zero if either of the two factors equals zero. Therefore, we have two sets of equations:

1. $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ and $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$
2. $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ and $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$

From the first set of equations, we have $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x \vert = 8$, $\vert y \vert = 8$. This gives us a square with side length 16, and its area is $16^2 = 256$.

From the second set of equations, we have $\vert x - y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x \vert = 8$, $\vert y \vert = 8$. This also gives us a square with side length 16, and its area is also $16^2 = 256$.

Adding the areas of these two squares, we get the total area of the convex polygon as $256 + 256 = 512$.

So, the area of the convex polygon is 512.
The answer is: $512$

Interesting, let's analyze step by step:



1. The given equation is a product of two terms equal to zero, so either of the terms must be zero. This gives us two systems of equations to solve:

   a) $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ and $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ and $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$.
   
   b) $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$.

2. From a), we get $\vert x + y \vert = 10$, $\vert x \vert = 8$, and $\vert y \vert = 8$. This implies $-8 \le x, y \le 8$.

3. From b), we get $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. Together with the results from a), this implies $x = y$ or $x = -y$.

4. The solutions are then all points $(x, y)$ in the square with vertices $(\pm8, \pm8)$ that satisfy $x = y$ or $x = -y$. This forms a square with side length 16.

5. The area of this square is $16^2 = 256$.

So the area of the convex polygon is 256. The answer is: $256$

Interesting, let's analyze step by step:



1. The problem is asking for the area of a polygon that is enclosed by the points that satisfy the given equation.

2. The equation is: $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$

3. This equation is equal to zero if either of the two factors is zero. Therefore, we have two sets of equations to solve:

   a. $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ and $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$
   
   b. $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ and $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$

4. For each set of equations, we can solve them individually.

5. For set a:

   a.1. $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ implies $\vert x + y \vert = 10$, which gives $x + y = 10$ or $x + y = -10$.
   
   a.2. $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ implies $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$, which gives $x = 8$ or $x = -8$ and $y = 8$ or $y = -8$.

6. For set b:

   b.1. $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ implies $\vert x - y \vert = 10$, which gives $x - y = 10$ or $x - y = -10$.
   
   b.2. $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ implies $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$, which gives $x = 8$ or $x = -8$ and $y = 8$ or $y = -8$.

7. By solving the above equations, we find that the points that satisfy the equation are:

   $(8, 8), (8, -8), (-8, 8), (-8, -8), (10, 0), (-10, 0), (0, 10), (0, -10)$.

8. These points form a square with side length $16$. The area of this square is $16^2 = 256$.

9. The answer is $\boxed{256}$.
