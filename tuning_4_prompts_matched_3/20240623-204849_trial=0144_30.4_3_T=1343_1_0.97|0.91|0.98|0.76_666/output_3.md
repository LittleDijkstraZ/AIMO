Interesting, let's analyze step by step:


The condition $AB = 0$ means that either $A=0$ or $B=0$. So, the given equation is satisfied if either of the following conditions holds:
1. $(|x+y|-10)^2 = 0$ and $(|x|-8)^2 = 0$ or $(|y|-8)^2 = 0$
2. $(|x-y|-10)^2 = 0$ and $(|x|-8)^2 = 0$ or $(|y|-8)^2 = 0$

From the first condition, we have $|x+y| = 10$ and $|x| = 8$ or $|y| = 8$. This gives us the lines $x+y = 10, x+y = -10, x = 8, x = -8, y = 8,$ and $y = -8$.

From the second condition, we have $|x-y| = 10$ and $|x| = 8$ or $|y| = 8$. This gives us the lines $x-y = 10, x-y = -10, x = 8, x = -8, y = 8,$ and $y = -8$.

The lines $x = 8, x = -8, y = 8,$ and $y = -8$ form a square with side length 16. The lines $x+y = 10, x+y = -10, x-y = 10,$ and $x-y = -10$ form a square with side length $\sqrt{200}$. The area of the convex polygon is the sum of the areas of these two squares, which is $16^2 + (\sqrt{200})^2 = 256 + 200 = 456$.

The area of the convex polygon is 456. However, this is not a positive integer, which contradicts the problem statement.

Upon revisiting the steps, I realized that I made a mistake in the second condition. The correct second condition should be $|x-y| = 10$ and $(|x|-8)^2 = 0$ or $(|y|-8)^2 = 0$. This gives us the lines $x-y = 10, x-y = -10, x = 8,$ and $y = 8$.

The lines $x = 8, y = 8$ form a square with side length 8. The lines $x+y = 10, x+y = -10, x-y = 10,$ and $x-y = -10$ form a square with side length $\sqrt{200}$. The area of the convex polygon is the sum of the areas of these two squares, which is $8^2 + (\sqrt{200})^2 = 64 + 200 = 264$.

The area of the convex polygon is 264, which is a positive integer as required.

Therefore, the area of the convex polygon is 264. The answer is $\boxed{264}$.

Interesting, let's analyze step by step:



The equation given is:
$$((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$$
This equation is equal to zero if either of the two terms are equal to zero. This gives us two sets of equations:

1) $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ and $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 \neq 0$
2) $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ and $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 \neq 0$

For the first set of equations, we have:
$$\vert x + y \vert = 10$$
$$\vert x \vert \neq 8$$
$$\vert y \vert \neq 8$$

This means the points $(x, y)$ must lie on the square with vertices at $(8, 8)$, $(-8, 8)$, $(-8, -8)$, and $(8, -8)$.

For the second set of equations, we have:
$$\vert x - y \vert = 10$$
$$\vert x \vert \neq 8$$
$$\vert y \vert \neq 8$$

This means the points $(x, y)$ must lie on the square with vertices at $(8, -8)$, $(-8, -8)$, $(-8, 8)$, and $(8, 8)$.

Combining both sets of equations, we see that the points $(x, y)$ must lie on a square with side length $16$. The area of this square is $16^2 = 256$. So the area of the convex polygon is $256$. The answer is: $256$

Interesting, let's analyze step by step:



The equation given is $ ((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$. This equation is equal to zero if either of the two factors is equal to zero. This gives us two systems of equations to solve:

1. $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ and $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$.
2. $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ and $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$.

From the first system, we have $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x \vert = 8, \vert y \vert = 8$. This implies that $x = 8, -8$ and $y = 8, -8$. So the points are $(8, 8), (8, -8), (-8, 8), (-8, -8)$.

From the second system, we have $\vert x - y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x \vert = 8, \vert y \vert = 8$. This implies that $x = 8, -8$ and $y = 8, -8$. So the points are the same as from the first system.

So the points are $(8, 8), (8, -8), (-8, 8), (-8, -8)$. These points form a square with side length 16. The area of the square is $16^2 = 256$.

So the area of the convex polygon is 256. To confirm this is a positive integer, let's check:

```python


INTERMEDIATE OUT :

from sympy import symbols, Eq, solve, Abs

def calculate_area():
    # Variables
    x, y = symbols('x y')

    # Equation
    equation = (Abs(x + y) - 10)**2 * (Abs(x) - 8)**2 + (Abs(y) - 8)**2

    # Solve for x = 8, -8 and y = 8, -8
    solutions1 = solve(equation.subs({x: 8, y: 8}), y)
    solutions2 = solve(equation.subs({x: 8, y: -8}), y)
    solutions3 = solve(equation.subs({x: -8, y: 8}), y)
    solutions4 = solve(equation.subs({x: -8, y: -8}), y)

    # Get the unique solutions
    solutions = list(set(solutions1 + solutions2 + solutions3 + solutions4))

    # Calculate the side length of the square
    side_length = max(solutions) - min(solutions)

    # Calculate the area of the square
    area = side_length**2

    return area

result = calculate_area()
print(result)
```

CODE RESULTS Traceback: line 24, in calculate_area
    side_length = max(solutions) - min(solutions)
ValueError: max() arg is an empty sequence

FAIL


INTERMEDIATE OUT :
```output
Traceback: line 24, in calculate_area
    side_length = max(solutions) - min(solutions)
ValueError: max() arg is an empty sequence

FAIL

```

The above code fails to calculate the area because it doesn't find any solutions for y in the given x values. This indicates that the equations may be incorrect or the approach taken is not suitable for this problem.

Let's revisit the problem and try to solve it in a different way.

From the given equation $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$, we can see that the second factor, $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$, implies that $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$, which means $x = 8, -8$ and $y = 8, -8$.

This means that the points that satisfy the equation are $(8, 8), (8, -8), (-8, 8), (-8, -8)$, which form a square with side length 16.

The area of this square is $16^2 = 256$.

So, the area of the convex polygon is 256. This is a positive integer. The output should be:

```
256
```
The answer is: $256$.

Interesting, let's analyze step by step:



The equation is $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + (\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + (\vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$. 

For the product of two numbers to be zero, either the first number is zero or the second number is zero. That is, either $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + (\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + (\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$. 

In the first case, we have $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$, which gives us four lines in the plane: $x + y = 10$, $x + y = -10$, $x - y = 10$, and $x - y = -10$. These lines form a rectangle with side lengths of 20 units.

In the second case, we have $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$, which gives us four lines in the plane: $x = 8$, $x = -8$, $y = 8$, and $y = -8$. These lines form a square with side lengths of 16 units.

The intersection of the two cases forms a square with side length 10 units (the smaller one), so the area of the convex polygon is $10^2 = 100$.

So the answer is $\boxed{100}$.

$$((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$$

The product of two numbers is zero if and only if one or both of them are zero. So, the points that satisfy this equation are those that make either:
$$(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0 \quad \text{or} \quad (\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0 \quad \text{or} \quad (\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0 \quad \text{or} \quad (\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$$

This gives us four lines in the plane:
$$x + y = 10, \quad x + y = -10, \quad x - y = 10, \quad x - y = -10, \quad x = 8, \quad x = -8, \quad y = 8, \quad y = -8.$$

These lines form a rectangle with vertices at:
$$(8, 8), (8, -8), (-8, 8), (-8, -8).$$

The area of this rectangle is:
$$\text{Area} = (8 - (-8)) \times (8 - (-8)) = 16 \times 16 = 256.$$

Since 256 is a positive integer, we can conclude that the area of the convex polygon is 256 square units. The answer is: $256$.

Below is a math problem you are to solve (positive numerical answer):
"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"

- List the variables and known values from the problem.
- Outline the steps using sympy to solve the problem:

Interesting, let's analyze step by step:



1. First, we identify the variables and known values from the problem. The variables are x and y. The known values are 10 and 8.

2. Second, we outline the steps using sympy to solve the problem:
   * Identify the sympy functions required for each step.
   * Implement these functions step-by-step, commenting each line for clarity.

   The given equation is a product of two expressions equal to zero. This means that either the first expression equals zero or the second expression equals zero.

   The first expression is $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)$ and the second expression is $((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2)$.

   Setting the first expression equal to zero gives $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. This implies that $x + y = 10$ or $x + y = -10$, and $x - y = 10$ or $x - y = -10$. Solving these four equations gives us the coordinates of the vertices of the polygon.

   Setting the second expression equal to zero gives $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$. This implies that $x = 8$ or $x = -8$, and $y = 8$ or $y = -8$. This gives us the four lines that form the boundary of the polygon.

   By analyzing these equations, we find that the polygon is a square with side length 16.

3. Calculate the final answer and verify it's a positive integer.

   The area of a square is side length squared, so the area of this square is $16^2 = 256$.

4. Output the result within the correct format.

The area of the convex polygon is $256$. The answer is: $256$
