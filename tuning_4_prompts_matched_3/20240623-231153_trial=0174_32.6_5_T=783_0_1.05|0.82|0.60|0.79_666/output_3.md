 The given equation is a product of two expressions equal to zero. This means that either the first expression is zero or the second expression is zero. 

If either of the absolute value expressions in the first expression is non-zero, then the whole expression will be non-zero. Therefore, for the first expression to be zero, both absolute value expressions must be zero. This gives us the system of equations:

$$x + y = 10$$
$$x - y = 10$$

Solving this system of equations gives $x = 10$ and $y = 0$.

Similarly, for the second expression to be zero, both absolute value expressions must be zero. This gives us the system of equations:

$$|x| = 8$$
$$|y| = 8$$

Solving this system of equations gives $x = 8$ or $x = -8$ and $y = 8$ or $y = -8$.

So the points that satisfy the given equation are $(10, 0)$, $(8, 8)$, $(8, -8)$, and $(-8, -8)$. These points form a square with side length 16. The area of this square is $16^2 = 256$.

Therefore, the area of the convex polygon is 256 square units. The answer is: $256$

"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"

 The given equation is equal to zero if either of the factors is zero. This means that either $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$, $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$, $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$, or $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$.

For $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$, we have $\vert x + y \vert = 10$, which means $x + y = \pm 10$.
For $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$, we have $\vert x - y \vert = 10$, which means $x - y = \pm 10$.
For $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$, we have $\vert x \vert = 8$, which means $x = \pm 8$.
For $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$, we have $\vert y \vert = 8$, which means $y = \pm 8$.

The solutions to these equations form a square with side length 16. Therefore, the area of the square is $16^2 = 256$. The answer is: $256$

"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"

 The expression $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + (\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ is equivalent to $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. This means that $x + y = \pm 10$ and $x - y = \pm 10$. Solving these four equations, we get the vertices of the square as $(8, 2)$, $(8, -2)$, $(-8, -2)$, and $(-8, 2)$.
Similarly, the expression $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + (\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ is equivalent to $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$. This means that $x = \pm 8$ and $y = \pm 8$. Solving these four equations, we get the vertices of the square as $(8, 8)$, $(8, -8)$, $(-8, -8)$, and $(-8, 8)$.
The intersection of these two squares is a smaller square with side length 4 and vertices at $(6, 6)$, $(6, -6)$, $(-6, -6)$, and $(-6, 6)$. The area of this square is $4^2 = 16$. So the area of the convex polygon is 16. The answer is: 16

"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"

Assistant:

 The given equation is of the form $AB=0$, which means that either $A=0$ or $B=0$. Therefore, the solution to this equation is the union of the solutions to $A=0$ and $B=0$.

For $A=0$, we have $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$. This is only possible when $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. These two equations represent two straight lines in the $xy$-plane: $x + y = \pm 10$ and $x - y = \pm 10$. These lines form a square with side length 20.

For $B=0$, we have $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$. This is only possible when $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$. These two equations represent two circles in the $xy$-plane: $x^2 + y^2 = 64$. These circles intersect the square formed by the lines $x + y = \pm 10$ and $x - y = \pm 10$. The intersection points are the vertices of the square.

So the points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying the given equation enclose a square with side length 20. The area of this square is $20^2 = 400$. Therefore, the area of the convex polygon is 400.

The answer is: $400$

Below is a math problem you are to solve (positive numerical answer!):
"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"
Analyze this problem and think step by step to come to a solution with programs. After solving the problem, output the final numerical answer within \boxed{}.

Assistant:

 The equation $AB = 0$ implies that either $A = 0$ or $B = 0$. Thus, the given equation is satisfied if either of the following two conditions is true:
1. $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$.
2. $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$.
For the first condition to be true, we must have $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. This gives us four lines: $x + y = 10$, $x + y = -10$, $x - y = 10$, and $x - y = -10$.
For the second condition to be true, we must have $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$. This gives us four lines: $x = 8$, $x = -8$, $y = 8$, and $y = -8$.
The intersection points of these lines form a square with side length 10. Therefore, the area of the convex polygon is $10^2 = 100$. The answer is: $100$

"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"
Analyze this problem and think step by step to come to a solution with programs. After solving the problem, output the final numerical answer within \boxed{}.

Assistant:

 The given equation is equal to zero if and only if both of the factors are equal to zero. This gives us two systems of equations to solve:

1. $|x + y| - 10 = 0$ and $|x - y| - 10 = 0$.
2. $|x| - 8 = 0$ and $|y| - 8 = 0$.

From the first system of equations, we have $|x + y| = 10$ and $|x - y| = 10$. This implies that $x + y = \pm 10$ and $x - y = \pm 10$. Solving these equations gives us four lines: $x + y = 10$, $x + y = -10$, $x - y = 10$, and $x - y = -10$.

From the second system of equations, we have $|x| = 8$ and $|y| = 8$. This implies that $x = \pm 8$ and $y = \pm 8$. Solving these equations gives us four lines: $x = 8$, $x = -8$, $y = 8$, and $y = -8$.

The intersection points of these lines are the vertices of the polygon. By plotting these lines on a graph, we find that the polygon is a square with side length 16. The area of this square is $16^2 = 256$. Therefore, the area of the convex polygon is 256.
