Below is a math problem you are to solve (positive numerical answer!):
"For how many positive integers $m$ does the equation \[\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}\] have $4$ distinct solutions?"
Analyze this problem and think step by step to come to a solution with programs. After solving the problem, output the final numerical answer within \boxed{}.

 The equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has $4$ distinct solutions if and only if $\frac{m}{100}$ is equal to the value of $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert$ that results in $4$ distinct solutions.

The function $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert$ has a graph that consists of four line segments, as shown below:

[asy]
unitsize(1 cm);

draw((-1,0)--(3,0),Arrow);
draw((0,-3)--(0,3),Arrow);

real func (real x) {
  return(abs(abs(x-1)-2));
}

real xMin = -1;
real xMax = 3;
real yMin = -3;
real yMax = 3;
real plotStep = 0.01;

draw(graph(func, xMin, xMax, plotStep), linewidth(1));

label("$x$", (3.2,0), E);
label("$\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert$", (0,3), N);
[/asy]

The function equals $0$ at $x=1$, $3$ at $x=3$, and $1$ at $x=0$, $2$. Thus, the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has $4$ distinct solutions when $\frac{m}{100}$ is equal to $1$ or $3$.

Therefore, the only positive integer $m$ for which the equation has $4$ distinct solutions is $m=300$ or $m=100$. However, since we want the number of such positive integers $m$, the answer is $1$.

```python


INTERMEDIATE OUT :

def number_of_m():
    """For how many positive integers $m$ does the equation \[\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}\] have $4$ distinct solutions?"""
    return 1

result = number_of_m()
print(result)
```

The number of positive integers $m$ for which the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has $4$ distinct solutions is $1$. The answer is: $\boxed{1}$.

Below is a math problem you are to solve (positive numerical answer!):
"For how many positive integers $m$ does the equation \[\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}\] have $4$ distinct solutions?"

Assistant:

 The number of distinct solutions of the equation $| |x - 1| - 2 | = \frac{m}{100}$ is 4, which means that the right-hand side of the equation should be in the interval $(0, 3)$. Therefore, $0 < \frac{m}{100} < 3$, which gives $0 < m < 300$. The number of positive integers $m$ satisfying this inequality is 299.

So, the number of positive integers $m$ for which the equation has 4 distinct solutions is 299.
The answer is: 299

Below is a math problem you are to solve (positive numerical answer!):
"For how many positive integers $m$ does the equation \[\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}\] have $4$ distinct solutions?"

Assistant:

 The number of distinct solutions of the equation $| |x-1| - 2 | = \frac{m}{100}$ is 4 if and only if $\frac{m}{100} = 2$.
To see this, note that the function $| |x-1| - 2 |$ is a "V" shape with two "valleys" at $x = -1$ and $x = 3$.
The equation $| |x-1| - 2 | = \frac{m}{100}$ has 4 distinct solutions if and only if $\frac{m}{100} = 2$, which gives $m = 200$.

So the number of positive integers $m$ that satisfy the condition is 1, the number of solutions to the equation $m = 200$. The answer is: $1$

Below is a math problem you are to solve (positive numerical answer!):
"For how many positive integers $m$ does the equation \[\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}\] have $4$ distinct solutions?"

Assistant:

 To solve this problem, we first need to understand the structure of the equation and the conditions for it to have 4 distinct solutions. The equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ is a piecewise function that can be solved in four steps:

1. Solve the equation inside the absolute value signs when $x \geq 1$.
2. Solve the equation inside the absolute value signs when $x < 1$.
3. Find the values of $x$ that satisfy the equation for each case.
4. Count the number of distinct solutions.

The number of distinct solutions will be 4 when the value of $\frac{m}{100}$ is equal to 2. Therefore, we need to find the value of $m$ that satisfies this condition.

```python


INTERMEDIATE OUT :

def find_m():
    m = 100 * 2  # Since | ||x-1|-2|=m/100 | = 2, we have m/100 = 2
    return m

result = find_m()
print(result)
```

CODE RESULTS 200

INTERMEDIATE OUT :
```output
200
```
The value of $m$ that makes the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ have 4 distinct solutions is $200$. Therefore, the number of positive integers $m$ that satisfy the condition is 1. The answer is: $1$
