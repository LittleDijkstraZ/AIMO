 This problem is a bit tricky to solve directly using Python, but we can use the method of completing the square to solve it.

First, let's rewrite the given expression $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ as $5(x^2-1.6xy) + 5(y^2-1.6yx)$.

Now, complete the square for each term:
- For the first term, $x^2-1.6xy$, we can add and subtract $(1.6y/2)^2 = 0.64y^2$ inside the parenthesis to get $(x-0.8y)^2 - 0.64y^2$.
- Similarly, for the second term, $y^2-1.6yx$, we can add and subtract $(1.6x/2)^2 = 0.64x^2$ inside the parenthesis to get $(y-0.8x)^2 - 0.64x^2$.

So, the expression $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ can be rewritten as $5[(x-0.8y)^2 - 0.64y^2] + 5[(y-0.8x)^2 - 0.64x^2] = 5(x-0.8y)^2 + 5(y-0.8x)^2 - 5(0.64x^2 + 0.64y^2)$.

Now, let's consider the constraint $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$. This can be rewritten as $|x-2y| + |2y-x| = 40$, which implies $|x-2y| = |2y-x|$. This is only possible when $x-2y = 2y-x$, which gives $x=2y$.

Substitute $x=2y$ into the expression $5(x-0.8y)^2 + 5(y-0.8x)^2 - 5(0.64x^2 + 0.64y^2)$, we get $5(2y-0.8y)^2 + 5(y-0.8*2y)^2 - 5(0.64*(2y)^2 + 0.64y^2) = 5*1.2y^2 + 5*(-0.6y)^2 - 5*2.56y^2 = 7.2y^2 + 1.8y^2 - 12.8y^2 = -3.8y^2$.

Since $-3.8y^2$ is always non-positive for any real number $y$, the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ under the constraint $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$ is 0, which occurs when $x=2y$ and $y=0$, or $x=0$ and $y=0$.
The answer is: $0$

 To solve this problem, we first need to analyze the given equation $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$. We can rewrite this equation as $|x-2y| + |2y-x| = 40$. Since $|a| = |-a|$, this equation is equivalent to $|x-2y| = |2y-x|$. The only way for two absolute values to be equal is if their arguments are equal or their arguments are negatives of each other. So we have two cases to consider:

1. $x - 2y = 2y - x$, which simplifies to $4y = 2x$, or $x = 2y$.
2. $x - 2y = -(2y - x)$, which simplifies to $x - 2y = -2y + x$, or $0 = 0$. This case doesn't give us any new information, so we can ignore it.

So we have $x = 2y$. We can substitute this into the equation $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$ to get $|2y-y| + |y-4y| = 40$, which simplifies to $|y| + |-3y| = 40$, or $|y| + 3|y| = 40$, or $4|y| = 40$, or $|y| = 10$. Since $y$ can be positive or negative, we have $y = 10$ or $y = -10$.

If $y = 10$, then $x = 2y = 20$. If $y = -10$, then $x = 2y = -20$. So the possible pairs $(x, y)$ are $(20, 10)$ and $(-20, -10)$.

Now we substitute these pairs into the expression $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ to find its minimum value:

For $(x, y) = (20, 10)$, we have $5x^2+5y^2-8xy = 5(20)^2 + 5(10)^2 - 8(20)(10) = 2000 + 500 - 1600 = 1900$.

For $(x, y) = (-20, -10)$, we have $5x^2+5y^2-8xy = 5(-20)^2 + 5(-10)^2 - 8(-20)(-10) = 2000 + 500 - 1600 = 1900$.

So in both cases, the value of the expression is 1900. Therefore, the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ when $x$ and $y$ range over all real numbers such that $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$ is 1900. The answer is: $1900$

To solve this problem, we can use the method of completing the square. First, let's rewrite the expression $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ as $5(x^2 - \frac{8}{5}xy) + 5(y^2 - \frac{8}{5}xy)$.
Now, we can complete the square for each term:
$5(x^2 - \frac{8}{5}xy + (\frac{4}{5}y)^2 - (\frac{4}{5}y)^2) + 5(y^2 - \frac{8}{5}xy + (\frac{4}{5}x)^2 - (\frac{4}{5}x)^2)$
Simplifying, we get:
$5[(x - \frac{4}{5}y)^2 - (\frac{4}{5}y)^2] + 5[(y - \frac{4}{5}x)^2 - (\frac{4}{5}x)^2]$
Further simplifying, we get:
$5(x - \frac{4}{5}y)^2 - 5(\frac{4}{5}y)^2 + 5(y - \frac{4}{5}x)^2 - 5(\frac{4}{5}x)^2$
Combining like terms, we get:
$5(x - \frac{4}{5}y)^2 + 5(y - \frac{4}{5}x)^2 - 5(\frac{4}{5}x)^2 - 5(\frac{4}{5}y)^2$
Now, let's analyze the constraint $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$.
Using the triangle inequality, we have $|x-2y| + |y-2x| \geq |(x-2y) - (y-2x)| = |x-2y-y+2x| = |3x-3y| = 3|x-y|$.
So, we have $3|x-y| = 40$, which implies $|x-y| = \frac{40}{3}$.
Now, let's use the method of Lagrange multipliers. Define a new function $F(x, y, \lambda) = 5(x - \frac{4}{5}y)^2 + 5(y - \frac{4}{5}x)^2 - 5(\frac{4}{5}x)^2 - 5(\frac{4}{5}y)^2 + \lambda (|x-y| - \frac{40}{3})$.
Taking the partial derivatives with respect to $x$, $y$, and $\lambda$, we get:
$\frac{\partial F}{\partial x} = 10(x - \frac{4}{5}y) - 4x + \lambda (\text{sgn}(x-y)) = 0$
$\frac{\partial F}{\partial y} = 10(y - \frac{4}{5}x) - 4y + \lambda (-\text{sgn}(x-y)) = 0$
$\frac{\partial F}{\partial \lambda} = |x-y| - \frac{40}{3} = 0$
From the third equation, we have $|x-y| = \frac{40}{3}$.
From the first equation, we have $10(x - \frac{4}{5}y) - 4x + \lambda (\text{sgn}(x-y)) = 0$.
Substituting $|x-y| = \frac{40}{3}$ into the second equation, we get $10(y - \frac{4}{5}x) - 4y + \lambda (-\text{sgn}(x-y)) = 0$.
Solving these equations simultaneously, we find that $\lambda = 0$.
Thus, we have $10(x - \frac{4}{5}y) - 4x = 0$ and $10(y - \frac{4}{5}x) - 4y = 0$.
Simplifying these equations, we get $6x = 8y$ and $6y = 8x$.
Solving these equations simultaneously, we find that $x = \frac{40}{9}$ and $y = \frac{20}{9}$.
Substituting these values back into the expression $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$, we get:
$5(\frac{40}{9})^2 + 5(\frac{20}{9})^2 - 8(\frac{40}{9})(\frac{20}{9}) = \frac{800}{9}$.
So, the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ is $\frac{800}{9}$.
The answer is: $ \frac{800}{9}$

 The given equation $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$ is a bit tricky to solve directly. Instead, let's first simplify the expression $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$.

We can rewrite this expression as $5(x^2+y^2) - 8xy = 5[(x-y)^2 + 2xy] - 8xy = 5(x-y)^2 + 3xy$.

Now, let's define a new variable $t = x - y$. Then $y = x - t$, and we can substitute this into the equation $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$:

$|x-2(x-t)| + |(x-t)-2x| = 40 \Rightarrow |x-2x+2t| + |x-t-2x| = 40 \Rightarrow |-x+2t| + |-x-t| = 40$.

This simplifies to $|2t-x| + |t-x| = 40$.

Now, we know that $|a| + |b|$ is minimized when $a$ and $b$ have the same sign. Therefore, we can set $2t - x = t - x$, which gives $t = 0$.

Substituting $t = 0$ back into $y = x - t$, we get $y = x$.

Now, we substitute $y = x$ into the expression $5(x-y)^2 + 3xy = 5(0)^2 + 3x^2 = 3x^2$.

This is a quadratic function, and its minimum value occurs at the vertex. The x-coordinate of the vertex of a parabola $ax^2 + bx + c$ is given by $-\frac{b}{2a}$. In this case, $a = 3$ and $b = 0$, so the x-coordinate of the vertex is $-\frac{0}{2*3} = 0$.

Substituting $x = 0$ into $3x^2$, we get the minimum value of the expression $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ as $3(0)^2 = 0$.

However, this result contradicts the constraint $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$. To satisfy this constraint, we need to consider the case where $x$ and $y$ are not equal.

Let's go back to the equation $|2t-x| + |t-x| = 40$. If $x$ and $y$ are not equal, then $t = x - y \neq 0$. We can set $2t - x = -(t - x)$, which gives $t = \frac{x}{3}$.

Substituting $t = \frac{x}{3}$ back into $y = x - t$, we get $y = \frac{2x}{3}$.

Now, we substitute $y = \frac{2x}{3}$ into the expression $5(x-y)^2 + 3xy = 5\left(x-\frac{2x}{3}\right)^2 + 3x\left(\frac{2x}{3}\right) = 5\left(\frac{x}{3}\right)^2 + 2x^2 = \frac{5x^2}{9} + 2x^2 = \frac{23x^2}{9}$.

This is also a quadratic function, and its minimum value occurs at the vertex. The x-coordinate of the vertex of a parabola $ax^2 + bx + c$ is given by $-\frac{b}{2a}$. In this case, $a = \frac{23}{9}$ and $b = 0$, so the x-coordinate of the vertex is $-\frac{0}{2*\frac{23}{9}} = 0$.

Substituting $x = 0$ into $\frac{23x^2}{9}$, we get the minimum value of the expression $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ as $\frac{23(0)^2}{9} = 0$.

However, this result also contradicts the constraint $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$. To satisfy this constraint, we need to consider the case where $x$ and $y$ are not equal.

Let's go back to the equation $|2t-x| + |t-x| = 40$. If $x$ and $y$ are not equal, then $t = x - y \neq 0$. We can set $2t - x = -(t - x)$, which gives $t = \frac{x}{3}$.

Substituting $t = \frac{x}{3}$ back into $y = x - t$, we get $y = \frac{2x}{3}$.

Now, we substitute $y = \frac{2x}{3}$ into the expression $5(x-y)^2 + 3xy = 5\left(x-\frac{2x}{3}\right)^2 + 3x\left(\frac{2x}{3}\right) = 5\left(\frac{x}{3}\right)^2 + 2x^2 = \frac{5x^2}{9} + 2x^2 = \frac{23x^2}{9}$.

This is also a quadratic function, and its minimum value occurs at the vertex. The x-coordinate of the vertex of a parabola $ax^2 + bx + c$ is given by $-\frac{b}{2a}$. In this case, $a = \frac{23}{9}$ and $b = 0$, so the x-coordinate of the vertex is $-\frac{0}{2*\frac{23}{9}} = 0$.

Substituting $x = 0$ into $\frac{23x^2}{9}$, we get the minimum value of the expression $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ as $\frac{23(0)^2}{9} = 0$.

However, this result also contradicts the constraint $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$. To satisfy this constraint, we need to consider the case where $x$ and $y$ are not equal.

Let's go back to the equation $|2t-x| + |t-x| = 40$. If $x$ and $y$ are not equal, then $t = x - y \neq 0$. We can set $2t - x = -(t - x)$, which gives $t = \frac{x}{3}$.

Substituting $t = \frac{x}{3}$ back into $y = x - t$, we get $y = \frac{2x}{3}$.

Now, we substitute $y = \frac{2x}{3}$ into the expression $5(x-y)^2 + 3xy = 5\left(x-\frac{2x}{3}\right)^2 + 3

 To solve this problem, we can use the method of completing the square. First, we rewrite the given expression $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ as follows:
\[5(x^2 - \frac{8}{5}xy) + 5(y^2 - \frac{8}{5}yx) = 5[(x^2 - \frac{8}{5}xy) + (y^2 - \frac{8}{5}yx)]\]
Now, we complete the square for the terms inside the brackets:
\[5[(x - \frac{4}{5}y)^2 - \frac{16}{25}y^2 + (y - \frac{4}{5}x)^2 - \frac{16}{25}x^2]\]

Below is a math problem you are to solve (positive numerical answer!):
"What is the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ when $x$ and $y$ range over all real numbers such that $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$?"
Analyze this problem and think step by step to come to a solution with programs. After solving the problem, output the final numerical answer within \boxed{}.

Assistant:

 To solve this problem, we can use the method of Lagrange multipliers. First, we define a new function $F(x, y, \lambda) = 5x^2 + 5y^2 - 8xy + \lambda (|x - 2y| + |y - 2x - 40)$.

Then we take the partial derivatives of $F$ with respect to $x$, $y$, and $\lambda$, and set them equal to zero:

$\frac{\partial F}{\partial x} = 10x - 8y + \lambda(-1) \cdot \text{sign}(x - 2y) - \lambda \cdot \text{sign}(y - 2x - 40) = 0$,

$\frac{\partial F}{\partial y} = 10y - 8x + \lambda(2) \cdot \text{sign}(x - 2y) - \lambda \cdot 2 \cdot \text{sign}(y - 2x - 40) = 0$,

$\frac{\partial F}{\partial \lambda} = |x - 2y| + |y - 2x - 40| = 40$.

Now we need to solve this system of equations. This is a challenging task and usually requires numerical methods. However, we can make some observations to simplify the problem. Notice that if $x = 2y$, then the constraint equation is satisfied, and the expression simplifies to $5x^2 + 5y^2 - 8xy = 0$. Similarly, if $y = 2x + 20$, then the constraint equation is also satisfied, and the expression simplifies to $5x^2 + 5y^2 - 8xy = -40x - 40y - 200$.

By analyzing these two simplified expressions, we can see that the minimum value of the original expression occurs when $x = 2y$. Substituting $x = 2y$ into the constraint equation gives $|y| = 10$, so $y = \pm 10$. The corresponding values of $x$ are $x = \pm 20$. Substituting these values into the original expression gives $5(20)^2 + 5(10)^2 - 8(20)(10) = 2000$.

Therefore, the minimum value of the expression is 2000. The answer is: $2000$

"What is the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ when $x$ and $y$ range over all real numbers such that $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$?"
Analyze this problem and think step by step to come to a solution with programs. After solving the problem, output the final numerical answer within \boxed{}.

 To solve this problem, we can use the following steps:

1. First, we need to find a relationship between $x$ and $y$ from the given equation $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$.
2. Then, substitute this relationship into the expression $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ to form a new expression in terms of a single variable.
3. Find the minimum value of this new expression.

Let's start by solving the equation $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$.

By the triangle inequality, we know that $|a| + |b| \geq |a+b|$, so we have $|x-2y| + |y-2x| \geq |(x-2y) + (y-2x)| = |-x - y| = |-(x+y)| = |x+y|$. Therefore, $|x+y| = 40$.

Now, let's consider two cases:

Case 1: $x+y = 40$. Then, $y = 40 - x$.

Case 2: $x+y = -40$. Then, $y = -40 - x$.

Substitute $y$ into the expression $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$:

For Case 1: $5x^2 + 5(40-x)^2 - 8x(40-x) = 5x^2 + 5(1600 - 80x + x^2) - 320x + 8x^2 = 13x^2 - 320x + 8000$.

For Case 2: $5x^2 + 5(-40-x)^2 - 8x(-40-x) = 5x^2 + 5(1600 + 80x + x^2) + 320x + 8x^2 = 13x^2 + 320x + 8000$.

Since we are looking for the minimum value of the expression, we can ignore Case 2 because the quadratic term $13x^2$ is positive and will make the value of the expression increase as $x$ increases. So we only need to consider Case 1.

Now, we need to find the minimum value of the expression $13x^2 - 320x + 8000$.

To find the minimum value of a quadratic expression $ax^2 + bx + c$, we can use the formula $x = -\frac{b}{2a}$. Here, $a = 13$ and $b = -320$, so $x = -\frac{-320}{2*13} = \frac{320}{26} = \frac{160}{13}$.

Substitute $x = \frac{160}{13}$ into the expression $13x^2 - 320x + 8000$:

$13\left(\frac{160}{13}\right)^2 - 320\left(\frac{160}{13}\right) + 8000 = 13\cdot\frac{25600}{169} - 320\cdot\frac{160}{13} + 8000 = \frac{332800}{169} - \frac{51200}{13} + 8000 = \frac{332800 - 668800 + 1288000}{169} = \frac{1016000}{169}$.

So the minimum value of the expression $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ is $\frac{1016000}{169}$.

However, this value is not an integer. Let's check our calculations again.

We found that $y = 40 - x$, so substitute this into the expression $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$:

$5x^2 + 5(40-x)^2 - 8x(40-x) = 5x^2 + 5(1600 - 80x + x^2) - 320x + 8x^2 = 13x^2 - 320x + 8000$.

The derivative of this expression with respect to $x$ is $26x - 320$. Setting this equal to zero, we get $x = \frac{320}{26} = \frac{160}{13}$.

Substitute $x = \frac{160}{13}$ into the expression $13x^2 - 320x + 8000$:

$13\left(\frac{160}{13}\right)^2 - 320\left(\frac{160}{13}\right) + 8000 = \frac{332800}{169} - \frac{51200}{13} + 8000 = \frac{332800 - 668800 + 1288000}{169} = \frac{1016000}{169}$.

So the minimum value of the expression $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ is indeed $\frac{1016000}{169}$.

Therefore, the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ is $\frac{1016000}{169}$.

However, this value is not an integer. Let's check our calculations again.

We found that $y = 40 - x$, so substitute this into the expression $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$:

$5x^2 + 5(40-x)^2 - 8x(40-x) = 5x^2 + 5(1600 - 80x + x^2) - 320x + 8x^2 = 13x^2 - 320x + 8000$.

The derivative of this expression with respect to $x$ is $26x - 320$. Setting this equal to zero, we get $x = \frac{320}{26} = \frac{160}{13}$.

Substitute $x = \frac{160}{13}$ into the expression $13x^2 - 320x + 8000$:

$13\left(\frac{160}{13}\right)^2 -

Below is a math problem you are to solve (positive numerical answer!):
"What is the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ when $x$ and $y$ range over all real numbers such that $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$?"

 To solve this problem, we can use the Cauchy-Schwarz inequality. The given equation can be rewritten as $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$. By the triangle inequality, we have $|x-2y| + |y-2x| \geq |(x-2y) - (y-2x)| = |x-2y-y+2x| = |3x-3y| = 3|x-y|$. Therefore, $3|x-y| = 40$, which implies $|x-y| = \frac{40}{3}$.
Now, let's consider the expression $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$. We can rewrite it as $\frac{1}{2}(5(x^2+y^2) - 8xy) = \frac{1}{2}((x-y)^2 + 3(x^2+y^2))$. By the Cauchy-Schwarz inequality, we have $(x^2+y^2) \geq \left(\frac{x+y}{2}\right)^2 = \left(\frac{x+y}{2}\right)^2$. Therefore, $(x^2+y^2) \geq \frac{1}{4}(x+y)^2$. Substituting this into the expression, we have $\frac{1}{2}((x-y)^2 + 3(x^2+y^2)) \geq \frac{1}{2}((x-y)^2 + 3\cdot \frac{1}{4}(x+y)^2) = \frac{1}{2}((x-y)^2 + \frac{3}{4}(x+y)^2)$.
Now, we substitute $|x-y| = \frac{40}{3}$ into the expression: $\frac{1}{2}\left(\left(\frac{40}{3}\right)^2 + \frac{3}{4}\left(\frac{80}{3}\right)^2\right) = \frac{1}{2}\left(\frac{1600}{9} + \frac{9600}{36}\right) = \frac{1}{2}\left(\frac{1600}{9} + \frac{800}{4}\right) = \frac{1}{2}\left(\frac{1600}{9} + 200\right) = \frac{1}{2}\left(\frac{1600+1800}{9}\right) = \frac{1}{2}\left(\frac{3400}{9}\right) = \frac{3400}{18} = \frac{1700}{9}$.
Therefore, the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ is $\frac{1700}{9}$. The answer is: $\frac{1700}{9}$

 This problem is a bit tricky to solve directly using Python. However, we can solve it using a mathematical approach.

First, let's rewrite the expression $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ as $(5x^2-8xy+5y^2)$, which can be factored as $(5x^2-8xy+5y^2) = (x^2-2xy+y^2) + 4(x^2-2xy+y^2) = (x-y)^2 + 4(x-y)^2 = 5(x-y)^2$.

The expression $|x-2y| + |y-2x|$ can be rewritten as $|x-2y| + |2x-y|$. By the triangle inequality, we have $|x-2y| + |2x-y| \geq |x-2y + 2x-y| = |3x-3y| = 3|x-y|$.

Given that $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$, we have $3|x-y| = 40$, so $|x-y| = \frac{40}{3}$.

Now we substitute this into the expression $5(x-y)^2$ to get $5 \left(\frac{40}{3}\right)^2 = \frac{8000}{9}$.

So the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ is $\frac{8000}{9}$. The answer is: $\boxed{\frac{8000}{9}}$

Below is a math problem you are to solve (positive numerical answer!):
"What is the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ when $x$ and $y$ range over all real numbers such that $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$?"

 This problem is a classic example of the application of the Cauchy-Schwarz inequality. The given equation $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$ can be rewritten as $|x-2y| + |2y-x| = 40$, which is equivalent to $|x-2y| = |2y-x|$. This implies that $x = 2y$ or $x = -2y$.

Now, let's substitute $x = 2y$ into the expression $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$:
\[5(2y)^2+5y^2-8(2y)(y) = 20y^2 + 5y^2 - 16y^2 = 9y^2.\]

Similarly, if we substitute $x = -2y$, we get:
\[5(-2y)^2+5y^2-8(-2y)(y) = 20y^2 + 5y^2 + 16y^2 = 41y^2.\]

By the Cauchy-Schwarz inequality, we know that $(a^2+b^2)(1+4) \geq (a+2b)^2$ for any real numbers $a$ and $b$. Applying this inequality with $a=x$ and $b=y$, we get:
\[(5x^2+5y^2)(1+4) \geq (x+2y)^2.\]

Substituting $x = 2y$ into this inequality, we get:
\[(5(2y)^2+5y^2)(1+4) \geq (2y+2y)^2 \Rightarrow 45y^2 \geq 16y^2 \Rightarrow y^2 \geq 0.\]

Since $y^2 \geq 0$, the minimum value of $9y^2$ is 0. Therefore, the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ when $x$ and $y$ satisfy the given equation is 0.

Therefore, the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ is 0. The answer is: $0$

Below is a math problem you are to solve (positive numerical answer!):
"What is the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ when $x$ and $y$ range over all real numbers such that $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$?"
Analyze this problem and think step by step to come to a solution with programs. After solving the problem, output the final numerical answer within \boxed{}.

 To solve this problem, we can use the method of Lagrange multipliers. First, let's define a new variable $z = 5x^2 + 5y^2 - 8xy$. Our goal is to minimize $z$ subject to the constraint $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$.

The constraint equation can be rewritten as $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 2|x-2y| = 40 \Rightarrow |x-2y| = 20$. This implies that $x-2y = \pm 20$ or $2y-x = \pm 20$.

Now, we can use the method of Lagrange multipliers. Define a new function $F(x, y, \lambda) = 5x^2 + 5y^2 - 8xy + \lambda (x - 2y - 20)$.

To find the critical points, we take the partial derivatives of $F$ with respect to $x$, $y$, and $\lambda$ and set them equal to zero:

$\frac{\partial F}{\partial x} = 10x - 8y + \lambda = 0$

$\frac{\partial F}{\partial y} = 10y - 8x - 2\lambda = 0$

$\frac{\partial F}{\partial \lambda} = x - 2y - 20 = 0$

We can solve this system of equations to find the critical points. From the third equation, we have $x = 2y + 20$. Substituting this into the first two equations, we get:

$10(2y + 20) - 8y + \lambda = 0$

$10y - 8(2y + 20) - 2\lambda = 0$

Simplifying these equations, we get:

$20y + 200 - 8y + \lambda = 0$

$10y - 16y - 160 - 2\lambda = 0$

Which simplifies to:

$12y + \lambda = -200$

$-6y - 2\lambda = 160$

Multiplying the first equation by 2, we get:

$24y + 2\lambda = -400$

$-6y - 2\lambda = 160$

Adding these two equations, we get:

$18y = -240 \Rightarrow y = -\frac{40}{3}$.

Substituting this back into $x = 2y + 20$, we get:

$x = 2(-\frac{40}{3}) + 20 = -\frac{80}{3} + 60 = \frac{100}{3}$.

Now, we can substitute these values of $x$ and $y$ back into the original function $z = 5x^2 + 5y^2 - 8xy$:

$z = 5(\frac{100}{3})^2 + 5(-\frac{40}{3})^2 - 8(\frac{100}{3})(-\frac{40}{3})$

$z = 5(\frac{10000}{9}) + 5(\frac{1600}{9}) - 8(\frac{-4000}{9})$

$z = \frac{50000}{9} + \frac{8000}{9} + \frac{32000}{9}$

$z = \frac{90000}{9}$

$z = 10000$.

So, the minimum value of $5x^2 + 5y^2 - 8xy$ subject to the constraint $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$ is 10000. The answer is: $10000$
