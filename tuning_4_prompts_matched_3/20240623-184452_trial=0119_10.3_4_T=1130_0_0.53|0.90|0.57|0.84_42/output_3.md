Below is a math problem you are to solve (positive numerical answer!):
"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"
Analyze this problem and think step by step to come to a solution with programs. After solving the problem, output the final numerical answer within \boxed{}.

Assistant:


The given equation is a product of two terms equal to zero. This means that either the first term is zero or the second term is zero.

The first term is $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)$, and it equals to zero if and only if $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. These two equations represent two squares with side length 10 centered at the origin. The intersection of these two squares is a square with side length 10 and area $10^2 = 100$.

The second term is $((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2)$, and it equals to zero if and only if $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$. These two equations represent two squares with side length 8 centered at the origin. The intersection of these two squares is a square with side length 8 and area $8^2 = 64$.

Since the intersection of the two squares is the convex polygon we are interested in, we can find its area by subtracting the area of the smaller square from the area of the larger square: $100 - 64 = 36$.

Therefore, the area of the convex polygon is 36 square units. The answer is: $36$

 The given equation is a product of two terms equal to zero. This means that either the first term is zero or the second term is zero. 

The first term is zero when either $|x + y| - 10 = 0$ or $|x - y| - 10 = 0$. These simplify to $|x + y| = 10$ and $|x - y| = 10$. The solutions to these equations are the lines $x + y = 10$, $x + y = -10$, $x - y = 10$, and $x - y = -10$. These lines form a rectangle.

The second term is zero when either $|x| - 8 = 0$ or $|y| - 8 = 0$. These simplify to $|x| = 8$ and $|y| = 8$. The solutions to these equations are the lines $x = 8$, $x = -8$, $y = 8$, and $y = -8$. These lines also form a rectangle.

The intersection of these two rectangles is a square with side length 10 (the distance between the lines $x + y = 10$ and $x + y = -10$, or equivalently, the distance between the lines $x - y = 10$ and $x - y = -10$).

The area of this square is the side length squared, which is $10^2 = 100$. So, the area of the convex polygon is 100.

 The given equation is a product of two terms equal to zero, so either the first term is zero or the second term is zero.

The first term is zero when $\vert x + y \vert - 10 = 0$ or $\vert x - y \vert - 10 = 0$. This implies $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ or $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. The solutions to these equations are all the points in the square with vertices at $( \pm 10, 0)$, $(0, \pm 10)$.

The second term is zero when $\vert x \vert - 8 = 0$ or $\vert y \vert - 8 = 0$. This implies $\vert x \vert = 8$ or $\vert y \vert = 8$. The solutions to these equations are all the points in the square with vertices at $( \pm 8, 0)$, $(0, \pm 8)$.

The intersection of the solutions to the two sets of equations is the square with vertices at $( \pm 8, 0)$, $(0, \pm 8)$. The area of this square is $8^2 = 64$. So the area of the convex polygon is 64 square units.

"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"
Analyze this problem and think step by step to come to a solution with programs. After solving the problem, output the final numerical answer within \boxed{}.

Assistant:

 The equation is satisfied if either $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$.
This means that either $\vert x + y \vert = 10$, $\vert x - y \vert = 10$, $\vert x \vert = 8$, or $\vert y \vert = 8$.
The absolute value equations can be split into two cases each:
1. $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ can be split into $x + y = 10$ or $x + y = -10$.
2. $\vert x - y \vert = 10$ can be split into $x - y = 10$ or $x - y = -10$.
3. $\vert x \vert = 8$ can be split into $x = 8$ or $x = -8$.
4. $\vert y \vert = 8$ can be split into $y = 8$ or $y = -8$.

By solving these equations, we find the vertices of the polygon:
$(8, 2)$, $(8, -2)$, $(-8, 2)$, $(-8, -2)$, $(2, 8)$, $(-2, 8)$, $(2, -8)$, and $(-2, -8)$.

To find the area of the polygon, we can use the Shoelace formula. The Shoelace formula states that if the vertices of a polygon are $(x_1, y_1), (x_2, y_2), \ldots, (x_n, y_n)$, then the area of the polygon is given by:
$$\frac{1}{2} \left| (x_1y_2 + x_2y_3 + \cdots + x_ny_1) - (y_1x_2 + y_2x_3 + \cdots + y_nx_1) \right|.$$

Applying the Shoelace formula to the vertices $(8, 2)$, $(8, -2)$, $(-8, 2)$, $(-8, -2)$, $(2, 8)$, $(-2, 8)$, $(2, -8)$, and $(-2, -8)$, we find that the area of the polygon is $256$.
The answer is: $256$

 The equation $A \cdot B = 0$ implies that either $A = 0$ or $B = 0$. Therefore, the given equation is equivalent to either $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$, $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$, $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$, or $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$.

The solutions to these equations are:
1. $\vert x + y \vert = 10$, which gives us the lines $x + y = 10$ and $x + y = -10$.
2. $\vert x - y \vert = 10$, which gives us the lines $x - y = 10$ and $x - y = -10$.
3. $\vert x \vert = 8$, which gives us the lines $x = 8$ and $x = -8$.
4. $\vert y \vert = 8$, which gives us the lines $y = 8$ and $y = -8$.

These lines form a rectangle with side lengths 16 and 20. Therefore, the area of the rectangle is $16 \times 20 = 320$. The answer is: $320$

Assistant:

 The equation $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ implies that $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. This means that $x + y = \pm 10$ and $x - y = \pm 10$. Solving these equations gives us the vertices of the square: $(8, 2)$, $(8, -2)$, $(-8, -2)$, and $(-8, 2)$.

Similarly, the equation $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ implies that $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$. This means that $x = \pm 8$ and $y = \pm 8$. So the vertices of the square are also $(8, 8)$, $(8, -8)$, $(-8, -8)$, and $(-8, 8)$.

The intersection of these two squares is a square with side length 8. The area of this square is $8^2 = 64$. So the area of the convex polygon is 64. The answer is: $64$

Below is a math problem you are to solve (positive numerical answer!):
"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"
Analyze this problem and think step by step to come to a solution with programs. After solving the problem, output the final numerical answer within \boxed{}.

Assistant:

 The given equation is equal to zero if and only if both of the factors are equal to zero. Therefore, we have two systems of equations to solve:

1. $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ and $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$.
2. $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ and $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$.

For the first system, we have $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x \vert = 8$. This gives us four equations:

1. $x + y = 10$ and $x = 8$.
2. $x + y = -10$ and $x = 8$.
3. $x + y = 10$ and $-x = 8$.
4. $x + y = -10$ and $-x = 8$.

Solving these equations, we find the vertices of the polygon: $(8, 2), (8, -18), (-8, 10), (-8, -10)$.

For the second system, we have $\vert x - y \vert = 10$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$. This gives us four more equations:

1. $x - y = 10$ and $y = 8$.
2. $x - y = -10$ and $y = 8$.
3. $x - y = 10$ and $-y = 8$.
4. $x - y = -10$ and $-y = 8$.

Solving these equations, we find the same vertices: $(8, 2), (8, -18), (-8, 10), (-8, -10)$.

Thus, the polygon is a square with side length $10\sqrt{2}$. The area of the square is $(10\sqrt{2})^2 = 200$. The answer is: $200$

Assistant:

 The given equation is a product of two expressions equal to zero, so either the first expression is zero or the second expression is zero.

The first expression is $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)$, and this equals zero if and only if both $\vert x + y \vert - 10 = 0$ and $\vert x - y \vert - 10 = 0$. This implies that $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. The solutions to these equations are all points of the form $(x, y)$ where the distance between the points $(x, y)$ and $(0, 0)$ is 10. This forms a square with side length 20.

The second expression is $((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2)$, and this equals zero if and only if both $\vert x \vert - 8 = 0$ and $\vert y \vert - 8 = 0$. This implies that $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$. The solutions to these equations are all points of the form $(x, y)$ where the distance between the points $(x, y)$ and the origin $(0, 0)$ is 8. This forms a square with side length 16.

The convex polygon formed by the intersection of these two squares is a smaller square with side length 20 - 8 = 12. The area of this square is $12^2 = 144$. Therefore, the area of the convex polygon is 144 square units. The answer is: $144$

Assistant:

 The given equation is a product of two terms equal to zero, which means that either one of the terms is zero or both terms are zero. This gives us four conditions to consider:

1. $|x+y| - 10 = 0$ and $|x-y| - 10 = 0$.
2. $|x+y| - 10 = 0$ and $|x| - 8 = 0$.
3. $|x-y| - 10 = 0$ and $|y| - 8 = 0$.
4. $|x| - 8 = 0$ and $|y| - 8 = 0$.

For each condition, we can solve the absolute value equations to find the points that satisfy the conditions. Then we can plot these points on a coordinate plane and connect them to form the vertices of the polygon. Finally, we can calculate the area of the polygon.

The area of the polygon is $128$. The answer is: $128$

This means that $\vert x + y \vert = 10$, $\vert x \vert = 8$, $\vert x - y \vert = 10$, and $\vert y \vert = 8$.

The solutions to these equations are the points $(x, y)$ that satisfy:

The points that satisfy all these equations are the vertices of a square with side length 10. The area of this square is $10^2 = 100$. So the area of the convex polygon is 100.
