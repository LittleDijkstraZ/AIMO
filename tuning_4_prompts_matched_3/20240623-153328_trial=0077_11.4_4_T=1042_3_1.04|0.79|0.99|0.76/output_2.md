Approach:


We know that the equation $| |x - 1| - 2| = \frac{m}{100}$ has 4 distinct solutions, and we need to find the number of positive integers $m$ for which this is true.

Consider the graph of $y = ||x - 1| - 2|$. The graph will have 4 distinct solutions if and only if the value of $\frac{m}{100}$ falls into a specific range.

From the graph, we can see that the function $y = ||x - 1| - 2|$ oscillates between 0 and 4. So, for the equation to have 4 distinct solutions, $\frac{m}{100}$ must be between 0 and 4.

This gives us the inequality $0 < \frac{m}{100} < 4$.

Multiplying all sides by 100, we get $0 < m < 400$.

The positive integers $m$ that satisfy this inequality are the integers from 1 to 399. So, there are 399 positive integers $m$ for which the equation has 4 distinct solutions.
The answer is: $399$

Approach:


The equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has $4$ distinct solutions means that the value of $\frac{m}{100}$ must be such that the graph of $y=\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert$ intersects the line $y=\frac{m}{100}$ exactly $4$ times.

We can solve this problem by analyzing the graph of $y=\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert$.

The graph of $y=\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert$ is a "V" shape with the vertex at $(1,2)$. The "V" shape has a width of $4$ units. This means that the line $y=\frac{m}{100}$ intersects the graph of $y=\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert$ exactly $4$ times when $2-\frac{m}{100}< \frac{m}{100} < 2+\frac{m}{100}$.

Simplifying the inequality gives $2-\frac{m}{100}< \frac{m}{100} < 2+\frac{m}{100}$, which simplifies further to $2-\frac{m}{100}< \frac{m}{100}$ and $\frac{m}{100} < 2+\frac{m}{100}$.

Solving these inequalities gives $m<200$ and $m>0$, which means $0<m<200$.

The positive integers $m$ that satisfy this condition are $1, 2, ..., 199$.

Therefore, there are $199$ positive integers $m$ such that the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has $4$ distinct solutions.

However, we need to find the number of such $m$ for which $\frac{m}{100}$ is strictly between $2-\frac{m}{100}$ and $2+\frac{m}{100}$. This means that $0<m<200$ and $2-\frac{m}{100}< \frac{m}{100}$.

Solving the inequality $2-\frac{m}{100}< \frac{m}{100}$ gives $m<100$.

Therefore, the number of positive integers $m$ that satisfy all these conditions is the number of positive integers $m$ such that $0<m<100$, which is $99$.
The answer is: 99

Solve the following problem with a Python Script (positive numerical answer):
"For how many positive integers $m$ does the equation \[\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}\] have $4$ distinct solutions?"
Write comments to indicate the steps you take. Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Approach:


The equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has 4 distinct solutions, we need to find the value of $m$ for which this is true.

Step 1: Understand the properties of the absolute value function
The absolute value function $\vert x \vert$ is a piecewise function defined as:
\[
\vert x \vert =
\begin{cases}
x & \text{if } x \geq 0 \\
-x & \text{if } x < 0
\end{cases}
\]
This means that the graph of the absolute value function is a V-shape, where the value inside the absolute value is positive (or zero) for $x \geq 0$, and negative for $x < 0$.

Step 2: Consider the double absolute value function $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert$
The inner absolute value $\vert x-1 \vert$ will be positive (or zero) for $x \geq 1$, and negative for $x < 1$.
Therefore, we have two cases to consider for the outer absolute value:
- If $\vert x-1 \vert \geq 2$, then $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert = \vert x-1 \vert - 2$.
- If $\vert x-1 \vert < 2$, then $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert = 2 - \vert x-1 \vert$.

Step 3: Solving the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$
- If $\vert x-1 \vert \geq 2$, then $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert = \vert x-1 \vert - 2$. So the equation becomes $\vert x-1 \vert - 2 = \frac{m}{100}$, or $\vert x-1 \vert = 2 + \frac{m}{100}$.
This gives us two sub-cases to consider:
  - If $x \geq 1$, then $x-1 \geq 0$, and the equation becomes $x-1 = 2 + \frac{m}{100}$, or $x = 3 + \frac{m}{100}$.
  - If $x < 1$, then $x-1 < 0$, and the equation becomes $1-x = 2 + \frac{m}{100}$, or $x = -1 - \frac{m}{100}$.
- If $\vert x-1 \vert < 2$, then $1-2 < x < 1+2$, or $-1 < x < 3$. In this case, $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert = 2 - \vert x-1 \vert$, and the equation becomes $2 - \vert x-1 \vert = \frac{m}{100}$.
This gives us two sub-cases to consider:
  - If $x \geq 1$, then $x-1 \geq 0$, and the equation becomes $2 - (x-1) = \frac{m}{100}$, or $x = 1 - \frac{200-m}{100}$.
  - If $x < 1$, then $x-1 < 0$, and the equation becomes $2 - (1-x) = \frac{m}{100}$, or $x = 1 + \frac{200-m}{100}$.

Step 4: Finding the value of $m$
For the equation $\vert x-1 \vert = 2 + \frac{m}{100}$ to have 4 distinct solutions, we need to find the value of $m$ such that the range of $x$ from both sub-cases (i.e., $3 + \frac{m}{100}$ and $-1 - \frac{m}{100}$) and the range of $x$ from both sub-cases of the equation $2 - \vert x-1 \vert = \frac{m}{100}$ (i.e., $1 - \frac{200-m}{100}$ and $1 + \frac{200-m}{100}$) overlap in the interval $(-1, 3)$.

After solving the above system of equations and inequalities, we find that the only positive integer value of $m$ that satisfies all the conditions is $m = 100$.

Therefore, the value of $m$ for which the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has 4 distinct solutions is $m = 100$. The answer is: $100$

The equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has 4 distinct solutions if and only if $\frac{m}{100}$ is between 1 and 2 (exclusive). This is because the function $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert$ has a graph that is a V-shape with the "valleys" at $x=1\pm2$, and the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has 4 solutions when $\frac{m}{100}$ is in the interval $(1,2)$. Therefore, we have $1 < \frac{m}{100} < 2$, which gives $100 < m < 200$. The number of positive integers $m$ in this interval is $200 - 100 - 1 = 99$.

Python code to calculate the number of positive integers m:

```python


INTERMEDIATE OUT :

def count_m():
    lower_bound = 100
    upper_bound = 200
    return upper_bound - lower_bound - 1

result = count_m()
print(result)
```

CODE RESULTS 99

99
```
The number of positive integers $m$ for which the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has 4 distinct solutions is $99$.
The answer is: $99$

Approach:


The equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has $4$ distinct solutions,
it means that $\frac{m}{100}$ must be less than $2$ but greater than $0$.
So we have $0 < \frac{m}{100} < 2$.
Multiplying all sides of the inequality by $100$, we get $0 < m < 200$.
Since $m$ is a positive integer, the possible values of $m$ are $1, 2, \dots, 199$.
Counting the number of integers in this range, we find that there are $199$ possible values for $m$.

Python script to find the number of integers in the range $(0, 200)$:

```python


INTERMEDIATE OUT :

def count_integers():
    return len([i for i in range(1, 200)])

result = count_integers()
print(result)
```

CODE RESULTS 199

INTERMEDIATE OUT :
```output
199
```
The number of positive integers $m$ for which the equation has $4$ distinct solutions is $199$. The answer is: $199$

Approach:


We start by analyzing the equation \[\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}\]

This equation has 4 distinct solutions when the right side, $\frac{m}{100}$, is equal to 2. So, we set $\frac{m}{100}=2$, which gives $m=200$.

Therefore, there is only one value of $m$ for which the equation has 4 distinct solutions, and that is $m=200$.

Therefore, the number of positive integers $m$ that satisfy the equation is 1.
The answer is: 1

Approach:


We need to find the number of positive integers $m$ such that the equation $| |x - 1| - 2 | = \frac{m}{100}$ has 4 distinct solutions.
This equation can be rewritten as $| |x - 1| - 2 | = \frac{m}{100}$.

First, we need to find the number of times the right side of the equation equals the left side.
The left side of the equation is a piecewise function, and it equals 0 when $|x - 1| - 2 = 0$, which gives us $|x - 1| = 2$, so $x - 1 = 2$ or $x - 1 = -2$. Solving these gives us $x = 3$ or $x = -1$.
Similarly, the left side of the equation equals $\frac{m}{100}$ when $|x - 1| - 2 = \frac{m}{100}$, so $|x - 1| = 2 + \frac{m}{100}$ or $|x - 1| = 2 - \frac{m}{100}$.

For the first case, $|x - 1| = 2 + \frac{m}{100}$, we have $x - 1 = 2 + \frac{m}{100}$ or $x - 1 = -(2 + \frac{m}{100})$. Solving these gives us $x = 3 + \frac{m}{100}$ or $x = -1 - \frac{m}{100}$.
For the second case, $|x - 1| = 2 - \frac{m}{100}$, we have $x - 1 = 2 - \frac{m}{100}$ or $x - 1 = -(2 - \frac{m}{100})$. Solving these gives us $x = 3 - \frac{m}{100}$ or $x = -1 + \frac{m}{100}$.

The four distinct solutions are $x = 3 + \frac{m}{100}$, $x = 3 - \frac{m}{100}$, $x = -1 - \frac{m}{100}$, and $x = -1 + \frac{m}{100}$.

For these four solutions to be distinct, we require that $3 + \frac{m}{100} \neq 3 - \frac{m}{100}$, $3 + \frac{m}{100} \neq -1 - \frac{m}{100}$, $3 + \frac{m}{100} \neq -1 + \frac{m}{100}$, $3 - \frac{m}{100} \neq -1 - \frac{m}{100}$, $3 - \frac{m}{100} \neq -1 + \frac{m}{100}$, and $-1 - \frac{m}{100} \neq -1 + \frac{m}{100}$.

Simplifying these inequalities gives us $m \neq 0$, $m \neq -200$, $m \neq 200$, $m \neq 300$, and $m \neq -100$.

So, the only values of $m$ that satisfy these conditions are $m = 100$, $m = 200$, and $m = 300$.

Therefore, there are 3 positive integers $m$ such that the equation $| |x - 1| - 2 | = \frac{m}{100}$ has 4 distinct solutions. The answer is: 3

"For how many positive integers $m$ does the equation \[\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}\] have $4$ distinct solutions?"
Write comments to indicate the steps you take. Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Assistant:

Approach:


The number of distinct solutions of the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ is determined by the value of $\frac{m}{100}$.
The absolute value equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=k$ (where $k$ is a positive number) has $4$ distinct solutions if and only if $1<k<2$. Therefore, we need to find the number of positive integers $m$ such that $1<\frac{m}{100}<2$.

Solution:
Multiplying all sides of the inequalities by $100$, we get $100<m<200$. The positive integers $m$ that satisfy this inequality are the integers from $101$ to $199$, inclusive. To find the number of these integers, we subtract the smallest integer in the range from the largest integer in the range and add $1$. So, the number of such integers is $199-101+1=99$.

Therefore, the number of positive integers $m$ for which the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has $4$ distinct solutions is $99$. The answer is: $99$
