"A function $f: \mathbb N \to \mathbb N$ satisfies the following two conditions for all positive integers $n$:$f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$ and $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$. Calculate $f(100)$."
Write comments to indicate the steps you take. Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Approach:


To find $f(100)$, we need to first understand the given functional equations. The first equation $f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$ tells us that applying the function $f$ three times to any number $n$ gives $8n-7$. The second equation $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$ tells us that applying the function $f$ to twice any number $n$ gives twice the value of $f(n)$ plus one.

Let's try to find the value of $f(1)$ using the second equation:
$$f(2) = 2f(1) + 1.$$
Now, let's apply the first equation to $f(1)$:
$$f(f(f(1))) = 8*1 - 7 = -1.$$
Since $f(f(f(1))) = -1$, we have:
$$f(f(1)) = 1.$$
Now, let's apply the second equation to $f(1)$:
$$f(2) = 2f(1) + 1.$$
But we know that $f(2) = 1$ (from $f(f(1)) = 1$), so:
$$1 = 2f(1) + 1.$$
Solving for $f(1)$, we get:
$$f(1) = 0.$$

Now we can use the second equation to find $f(n)$ for other values of $n$:
$$f(2) = 2f(1) + 1 = 2*0 + 1 = 1.$$
$$f(3) = 2f(1.5) + 1 = 2*f(1) + 1 = 2*0 + 1 = 1.$$
$$f(4) = 2f(2) + 1 = 2*1 + 1 = 3.$$
$$f(5) = 2f(2.5) + 1 = 2*f(2) + 1 = 2*1 + 1 = 3.$$
$$f(6) = 2f(3) + 1 = 2*1 + 1 = 3.$$
$$f(7) = 2f(3.5) + 1 = 2*f(3) + 1 = 2*1 + 1 = 3.$$
$$f(8) = 2f(4) + 1 = 2*3 + 1 = 7.$$
$$f(9) = 2f(4.5) + 1 = 2*f(4) + 1 = 2*3 + 1 = 7.$$
$$f(10) = 2f(5) + 1 = 2*3 + 1 = 7.$$
And so on. We can see a pattern here: $f(n) = 1$ if $n$ is odd, and $f(n) = 2k - 1$ if $n = 2k$.

Now we can use this pattern to find $f(100)$. Since $100 = 2*50$, we have:
$$f(100) = 2*50 - 1 = 99.$$
So, $f(100) = 99$.
The answer is: $99$

Solve the following problem with a Python Script (positive numerical answer):
"A function $f: \mathbb N \to \mathbb N$ satisfies the following two conditions for all positive integers $n$:$f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$ and $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$. Calculate $f(100)$."

Approach:



To find $f(100)$, we can use the second condition of the function $f$. The second condition is $f(2n) = 2f(n) + 1$. This condition allows us to express $f(100)$ in terms of $f(50)$ and then express $f(50)$ in terms of $f(25)$. We can continue this process until we reach a value we can easily calculate.

First, we find $f(50)$ using the second condition:
$$f(100) = 2f(50) + 1.$$
Then we find $f(25)$:
$$f(50) = 2f(25) + 1.$$
Substituting this into the equation for $f(100)$:
$$f(100) = 2(2f(25) + 1) + 1 = 4f(25) + 3.$$

Now we need to find $f(25)$. We can use the first condition of the function $f$: $f(f(f(n))) = 8n - 7$. Let's set $n = 25$:
$$f(f(f(25))) = 8 \cdot 25 - 7 = 200 - 7 = 193.$$

We know that $f(f(f(25))) = 193$, so we can set up the equation:
$$f(f(f(25))) = f(f(x)) = 193.$$
Let's set $f(x) = y$, then $f(y) = 193$. From the second condition, we have $f(2y) = 2f(y) + 1$, so:
$$f(2x) = 2f(x) + 1 = 2y + 1.$$
We know that $f(2x) = f(f(f(25))) = 193$, so:
$$193 = 2y + 1,$$
$$192 = 2y,$$
$$y = 96.$$

So $f(x) = 96$, then we can substitute $x = 25$ into this equation:
$$f(25) = 96.$$

Finally, we substitute $f(25) = 96$ into the equation for $f(100)$:
$$f(100) = 4f(25) + 3 = 4 \cdot 96 + 3 = 384 + 3 = 387.$$

So $f(100) = 387$. The answer is: $387$

Solve the following problem with a Python Script (positive numerical answer):
"A function $f: \mathbb N \to \mathbb N$ satisfies the following two conditions for all positive integers $n$:$f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$ and $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$. Calculate $f(100)$."

Approach:



To solve this problem, we need to find the value of $f(100)$ using the given functional equations. We can start by trying to find a pattern or simplify the equations.

Let's first look at the second equation, $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$. This equation tells us that if we double an input, the function output is doubled and then incremented by 1.

Now let's try to find $f(100)$ using this equation. We can start by finding $f(50)$ first:
$$f(100) = 2f(50) + 1.$$

To find $f(50)$, we can use the equation again:
$$f(50) = 2f(25) + 1.$$

Continuing this process, we can keep breaking down the numbers until we reach a number that is easy to compute directly using the first equation $f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$.

Let's keep going:
$$f(25) = 2f(12.5),$$
but $12.5$ is not an integer, so we cannot use the second equation directly. However, we can use the first equation. If we let $n=13$, we get
$$f(f(f(13))) = 8*13 - 7 = 97.$$
Now we know that $f(f(f(13))) = 97$, so we can find $f(13)$:
$$f(13) = \frac{97 + 7}{8} = 13.$$
Now we can find $f(25)$:
$$f(25) = 2f(13) + 1 = 2*13 + 1 = 27.$$
And finally, we can find $f(50)$:
$$f(50) = 2f(25) + 1 = 2*27 + 1 = 55.$$
And now we can find $f(100)$:
$$f(100) = 2f(50) + 1 = 2*55 + 1 = 111.$$

So, the value of $f(100)$ is $111$.

The Python script to compute $f(100)$ is as follows:
```python

def f(n):
    if n == 13:
        return 13

        return (8*n - 7) // 8

Solve the following problem with a Python Script (positive numerical answer):
"A function $f: \mathbb N \to \mathbb N$ satisfies the following two conditions for all positive integers $n$:$f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$ and $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$. Calculate $f(100)$."
Write comments to indicate the steps you take. Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Approach:


We are given two functional equations to work with. The first equation, $f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$, is a recursive equation that we can use to find the value of $f(n)$ for some specific values of $n$. The second equation, $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$, helps us simplify the calculation when $n$ is an even number.

Let's start by calculating $f(100)$ using the given functional equations.

Step 1: Since $100$ is an even number, we can apply the second equation to simplify the calculation. We have $f(2 \cdot 50) = 2f(50) + 1$.

Step 2: Now, we need to find the value of $f(50)$. To do this, we can apply the second equation again. We have $f(2 \cdot 25) = 2f(25) + 1$.

Step 3: Next, we need to find the value of $f(25)$. We can apply the first equation with $n = 25$. We have $f(f(f(25))) = 8 \cdot 25 - 7 = 200 - 7 = 193$.

Step 4: Now, we need to find the value of $f(f(25))$. We can apply the second equation. We have $f(2 \cdot 12.5) = 2f(12.5) + 1$. However, $12.5$ is not an integer, so we cannot apply the second equation directly.

Step 5: Let's go back to the first equation with $n = 12.5$. We have $f(f(f(12.5))) = 8 \cdot 12.5 - 7 = 100 - 7 = 93$. But this doesn't help us much since we cannot find the value of $f(f(12.5))$ directly.

Step 6: Let's try to find the value of $f(12.5)$ using the second equation. We have $f(2 \cdot 6.25) = 2f(6.25) + 1$. However, $6.25$ is not an integer, so we cannot apply the second equation directly.

Step 7: Let's try to find the value of $f(6.25)$ using the first equation. We have $f(f(f(6.25))) = 8 \cdot 6.25 - 7 = 50 - 7 = 43$. But this doesn't help us much since we cannot find the value of $f(f(6.25))$ directly.

Step 8: Let's try to find the value of $f(6.25)$ using the second equation. We have $f(2 \cdot 3.125) = 2f(3.125) + 1$. However, $3.125$ is not an integer, so we cannot apply the second equation directly.

Step 9: Let's try to find the value of $f(3.125)$ using the first equation. We have $f(f(f(3.125))) = 8 \cdot 3.125 - 7 = 25 - 7 = 18$. But this doesn't help us much since we cannot find the value of $f(f(3.125))$ directly.

Step 10: Let's try to find the value of $f(3.125)$ using the second equation. We have $f(2 \cdot 1.5625) = 2f(1.5625) + 1$. However, $1.5625$ is not an integer, so we cannot apply the second equation directly.

Step 11: Let's try to find the value of $f(1.5625)$ using the first equation. We have $f(f(f(1.5625))) = 8 \cdot 1.5625 - 7 = 12.5 - 7 = 5$. But this doesn't help us much since we cannot find the value of $f(f(1.5625))$ directly.

Step 12: Let's try to find the value of $f(1.5625)$ using the second equation. We have $f(2 \cdot 0.78125) = 2f(0.78125) + 1$. However, $0.78125$ is not an integer, so we cannot apply the second equation directly.

Step 13: Let's try to find the value of $f(0.78125)$ using the first equation. We have $f(f(f(0.78125))) = 8 \cdot 0.78125 - 7 = 6.25 - 7 = -0.75$. But this doesn't make sense since function values should be non-negative integers.

At this point, we need to go back and reconsider our steps. We made a mistake in our initial assumption that we can apply the second equation directly when $n$ is not an integer. The second equation is valid only for integer values of $n$. So, we need to find another approach to solve this problem.

Notice that in the first equation, $f(f(f(n))) = 8n - 7$, the right-hand side is a linear function of $n$. This suggests that the function $f$ itself might be a linear function. Let's assume $f(n) = an + b$ for some constants $a$ and $b$. Then we have:

$$f(f(f(n))) = f(f(an + b)) = f(a(an + b) + b) = f(a^2n + ab + b) = a(a^2n + ab + b) + b = a^3n + a^2b + ab + b.$$

Comparing this with the given $8n - 7$, we have:

$$a^3 = 8 \Rightarrow a = 2.$$

Then,

$$a^2b + ab + b = -7 \Rightarrow 4b + 2b + b = -7 \Rightarrow 7b = -7 \Rightarrow b = -1.$$

So, we have $f(n) = 2n - 1$. Now we can calculate $f(100)$:

$$f(100) = 2 \cdot 100 - 1 = 200 - 1 = 199.$$

So, $f(100) = 199$.
The value of $f(100)$ is $199$. The answer is: $199$

Approach:



We will try to find the value of $f(100)$ using the given functional equations.

First, we use the second equation to find $f(100)$: $f(2 \cdot 50) = 2f(50) + 1$.

We don't know the value of $f(50)$ yet, so we'll need to find it. We can use the second equation again to find $f(50)$: $f(2 \cdot 25) = 2f(25) + 1$.

Again, we don't know the value of $f(25)$, so we'll need to find it. We can use the second equation one more time to find $f(25)$: $f(2 \cdot 12.5) = 2f(12.5) + 1$.

But $12.5$ is not a positive integer, so we can't use the second equation anymore. We need to use the first equation instead. We notice that if we plug in $n = 12.5$ into the first equation, we get $f(f(f(12.5))) = 8 \cdot 12.5 - 7 = 93$.

Now we need to find the value of $f(12.5)$ that makes $f(f(f(12.5))) = 93$. Let's denote $f(12.5) = x$. Then $f(x) = 93$. From the first equation, we have $f(f(x)) = 8x - 7$. So $f(93) = 8 \cdot 12.5 - 7 = 93$. This means that $x = 12.5$ is a solution to the equation $f(x) = 93$.

Now we can substitute $x = 12.5$ back into the equation $f(2 \cdot 12.5) = 2f(12.5) + 1$ to find $f(25)$: $f(25) = 2 \cdot 12.5 + 1 = 26$.

Substituting $f(25) = 26$ back into the equation $f(2 \cdot 50) = 2f(50) + 1$ to find $f(50)$: $f(50) = \frac{f(2 \cdot 50) - 1}{2}$.

Again, we don't know the value of $f(100)$, so we'll need to find it. We can use the second equation one more time to find $f(100)$: $f(2 \cdot 50) = 2f(50) + 1$.

We already know that $f(50) = 26$, so we can substitute this into the equation to find $f(100)$: $f(100) = 2 \cdot 26 + 1 = 53$.

So, $f(100) = 53$. The answer is: $\boxed{53}$.

Approach:


We can start by applying the second equation to find $f(100)$. We know that $f(2n) = 2f(n) + 1$. So, if we let $n = 50$, we get $f(100) = 2f(50) + 1$.

Now, we need to find $f(50)$. We can use the second equation again, letting $n = 25$, so $f(50) = 2f(25) + 1$.

We can continue this process to find $f(25)$, $f(12.5)$, and so on. However, we notice that $f(n)$ is always a natural number, so we must have reached a point where the value we are trying to find, $f(n)$, is 1. 

This is because if we continue this process, we will eventually reach a value of $n$ such that $f(n) = 1$. Then, using the first equation, we can find $f(1) = 0$.

Now, we can work our way back up. We know that $f(2) = 2f(1) + 1 = 2(0) + 1 = 1$. Then, $f(4) = 2f(2) + 1 = 2(1) + 1 = 3$, $f(8) = 2f(4) + 1 = 2(3) + 1 = 7$, and so on.

By continuing this process, we find that $f(50) = 79$, and thus $f(100) = 2f(50) + 1 = 2(79) + 1 = 159$.

Therefore, $f(100) = 159$. The answer is: $159$

Approach:



We are given two equations to work with:

1. $f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$
2. $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$

We want to find the value of $f(100)$.

From the second equation, we can find that $f(100) = 2f(50) + 1$.

But we still don't know the value of $f(50)$. We can find it by using the second equation again: $f(50) = 2f(25) + 1$.

Again, we don't know the value of $f(25)$. But we can find it by using the first equation: $f(f(f(25)))=8*25-7=193$.

Since $f(f(f(25)))=193$, and we know that $f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$, we can set $n=25$ in the first equation and solve for $f(25)$: $f(f(25))=193$, and so $f(25) = \frac{193+7}{8} = 25$.

Substituting $f(25) = 25$ into the equation $f(50) = 2f(25) + 1$, we get $f(50) = 2*25 + 1 = 51$.

Finally, substituting $f(50) = 51$ into the equation $f(100) = 2f(50) + 1$, we get $f(100) = 2*51 + 1 = 103$.

So, $f(100) = 103$.

The value of $f(100)$ is $103$. The answer is: $\boxed{103}$

Write comments to indicate the steps you take. Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Approach:


We will try to find the value of $f(100)$ by using the given functional equations.

First, we know that $f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$. Let's set $n=1$, then we have $f(f(f(1)))=8*1-7=1$. Since $f(f(f(1)))=1$, we have $f(1)=1$.

Then we know that $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$. Let's set $n=1$, then we have $f(2)=2f(1)+1=2*1+1=3$.

Now we can find $f(3)$ using the equation $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$. Let's set $n=\frac{3}{2}$, then we have $f(3)=2f(\frac{3}{2})+1$. But we know $f(1)=1$, so $f(\frac{3}{2})=f(1)=1$. Substituting this into the equation gives $f(3)=2*1+1=3$.

Now we can find $f(6)$ using the equation $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$. Let's set $n=3$, then we have $f(6)=2f(3)+1=2*3+1=7$.

Now we can find $f(7)$ using the equation $f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$. Let's set $n=1$, then we have $f(f(f(1)))=8*1-7=1$, so $f(7)=1$.

Finally, we can find $f(100)$ using the equation $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$. Let's set $n=50$, then we have $f(100)=2f(50)+1$. But we know $f(3)=3$ and $f(6)=7$, so we can find $f(50)$ using the equation $f(3n)=f(2n)+f(n)$. Let's set $n=16$, then we have $f(48)=f(32)+f(16)$. Repeatedly using this equation, we find that $f(50)=f(48)+f(2)=f(48)+3$. We can continue this process to find that $f(48)=f(24)+f(16)=f(24)+7=f(12)+f(8)=f(12)+f(4)+f(2)=f(6)+f(4)+3=7+3+3=13$. So $f(50)=13+3=16$. Substituting this into the equation $f(100)=2f(50)+1$ gives $f(100)=2*16+1=33$.

So the value of $f(100)$ is 33. The answer is: $\boxed{33}$

Solve the following problem with a Python Script (positive numerical answer):

Approach:



We are given two equations for the function $f(n)$: $f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$ and $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$. We are asked to find $f(100)$.

We can start by trying to find a pattern in the function $f(n)$ by plugging in some values.

For example, we can start with $n=1$:

Using the equation $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$, we can find that $f(2) = 2f(1) + 1$.

Then, using the equation $f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$, we can substitute $n=1$ to get $f(f(f(1)))=8(1)-7=1$.

Since $f(f(f(1)))=1$, and we know that $f(2) = 2f(1) + 1$, we can substitute $f(2)$ into the equation to get $f(1)$.

Let's solve $f(2) = 2f(1) + 1$ for $f(1)$:

$f(2) - 1 = 2f(1)$

$\frac{f(2) - 1}{2} = f(1)$

Now we can substitute $f(2)$ with $f(f(1))$:

$\frac{f(f(1)) - 1}{2} = f(1)$

We know that $f(f(1)) = 1$, so:

$\frac{1 - 1}{2} = f(1)$

$0 = f(1)$

This doesn't make sense, as $f(n)$ is a function from $\mathbb N$ to $\mathbb N$, so it cannot output zero.

Let's try another value of $n$.

For $n=2$:

Using the equation $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$, we can find that $f(4) = 2f(2) + 1$.

Then, using the equation $f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$, we can substitute $n=2$ to get $f(f(f(2)))=8(2)-7=9$.

Since $f(f(f(2)))=9$, and we know that $f(4) = 2f(2) + 1$, we can substitute $f(4)$ into the equation to get $f(2)$.

Let's solve $f(4) = 2f(2) + 1$ for $f(2)$:

$f(4) - 1 = 2f(2)$

$\frac{f(4) - 1}{2} = f(2)$

Now we can substitute $f(4)$ with $f(f(f(2)))$:

$\frac{f(f(f(2))) - 1}{2} = f(2)$

We know that $f(f(f(2)))=9$, so:

$\frac{9 - 1}{2} = f(2)$

$4 = f(2)$

Now we can use the equation $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$ to find $f(1)$:

$f(2) = 2f(1) + 1$

$4 = 2f(1) + 1$

$3 = 2f(1)$

$\frac{3}{2} = f(1)$

This still doesn't make sense, as $f(n)$ is a function from $\mathbb N$ to $\mathbb N$, so it cannot output a fraction.

We can continue this process for different values of $n$, but it seems that we are not getting any useful information.

However, we can notice that the equation $f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$ is very similar to the equation $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$. This suggests that the function $f(n)$ might be related to doubling or halving the input.

Let's try to find a function that satisfies both equations.

Consider the function $f(n) = 2n - 1$. We can check that it satisfies both equations:

For $f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$:

$f(f(f(n))) = f(f(2n-1)) = f(2(2n-1) - 1) = f(4n-3) = 2(4n-3) - 1 = 8n - 7$.

For $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$:

$f(2n) = 2(2n-1) + 1 = 4n - 2 + 1 = 4n - 1$

$2f(n) + 1 = 2(2n-1) + 1 = 4n - 2 + 1 = 4n - 1$

So the function $f(n) = 2n - 1$ satisfies both equations.

Now we can use this function to find $f(100)$:

$f(100) = 2(100) - 1 = 200 - 1 = 199$.
The value of $f(100)$ is 199.
The answer is: $\boxed{199}$

Approach:


To solve this problem, we will use the given conditions to find the value of $f(100)$.

First, we know that $f(f(f(100)))=8(100)-7=793$.

Now, we need to find a value of $n$ such that $f(n)=100$.

Using the second condition, we have $f(2(50))=2f(50)+1$, which simplifies to $f(100)=2f(50)+1$.

Again using the second condition, we have $f(2(25))=2f(25)+1$, which simplifies to $f(50)=2f(25)+1$.

And again using the second condition, we have $f(2(12.5))=2f(12.5)+1$, which simplifies to $f(25)=2f(12.5)+1$.

And finally, using the first condition, we have $f(f(f(12.5)))=8(12.5)-7=73$.

Since $f(f(f(12.5)))=73$, and $f(12.5)=12.5$, we can substitute this into the equation $f(25)=2f(12.5)+1$ to get $f(25)=2(12.5)+1=26$.

Substituting $f(25)=26$ into the equation $f(50)=2f(25)+1$, we get $f(50)=2(26)+1=53$.

And finally, substituting $f(50)=53$ into the equation $f(100)=2f(50)+1$, we get $f(100)=2(53)+1=107$.

However, this value does not satisfy the equation $f(f(f(100)))=793$.

Let's try another approach.

From the equation $f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$, we can see that $f(f(f(n)))$ is always odd.

From the equation $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$, we can see that $f(2n)$ is always odd.

This suggests that $f(n)$ is always odd for all positive integers $n$.

Let's try $f(1)=1$.

Then from the second condition, $f(2)=2f(1)+1=3$.

From the second condition again, $f(4)=2f(2)+1=7$.

And from the first condition, $f(f(f(4)))=f(7)=8(4)-7=23$.

This does not match with the given condition $f(f(f(4)))=793$.

Let's try another value for $f(1)$.

Let's try $f(1)=3$.

Then from the second condition, $f(2)=2f(1)+1=7$.

From the second condition again, $f(4)=2f(2)+1=15$.

And from the first condition, $f(f(f(4)))=f(15)=8(4)-7=27$.

This does not match with the given condition $f(f(f(4)))=793$.

Let's try $f(1)=7$.

Then from the second condition, $f(2)=2f(1)+1=15$.

From the second condition again, $f(4)=2f(2)+1=31$.

And from the first condition, $f(f(f(4)))=f(31)=8(4)-7=39$.

This does not match with the given condition $f(f(f(4)))=793$.

Let's try another value for $f(1)$.

Let's try $f(1)=9$.

Then from the second condition, $f(2)=2f(1)+1=19$.

From the second condition again, $f(4)=2f(2)+1=39$.

And from the first condition, $f(f(f(4)))=f(39)=8(4)-7=55$.

This does not match with the given condition $f(f(f(4)))=793$.

Let's try another value for $f(1)$.

Let's try $f(1)=11$.

Then from the second condition, $f(2)=2f(1)+1=23$.

From the second condition again, $f(4)=2f(2)+1=47$.

And from the first condition, $f(f(f(4)))=f(47)=8(4)-7=63$.

This does not match with the given condition $f(f(f(4)))=793$.

Let's try another value for $f(1)$.

Let's try $f(1)=13$.

Then from the second condition, $f(2)=2f(1)+1=27$.

From the second condition again, $f(4)=2f(2)+1=55$.

Approach:


We can start by applying the second equation from the problem statement to find $f(100)$: $f(200) = 2f(100) + 1$.
Then, we can apply the first equation from the problem statement to find $f(f(f(100)))$: $f(f(f(100))) = 8 \cdot 100 - 7 = 793$.
Now we have $f(f(f(100))) = 793$, and we can substitute $f(200) = 2f(100) + 1$ into this equation: $f(793) = 2f(100) + 1$.

Unfortunately, this equation does not give us a direct way to find $f(100)$. However, we can notice that the function $f$ seems to be defined in a recursive way. Let's try to find a pattern by calculating some values of $f$.

We know that $f(f(f(100))) = 793$, so $f(100)$ must be such a number that $f(f(f(100))) = 793$. Let's try to find such a number.

We can start with $f(1) = 1$, then $f(f(f(1))) = f(1) = 1$, but $1 \neq 793$.
Let's try $f(2) = 3$, then $f(f(f(2))) = f(3) = 5$, but $5 \neq 793$.
Let's try $f(3) = 5$, then $f(f(f(3))) = f(5) = 9$, but $9 \neq 793$.
We can continue this process, but it seems to be very time-consuming.

However, we can notice that if we try $f(4) = 7$, then $f(f(f(4))) = f(7) = 13$, and $13 \neq 793$.
But if we try $f(5) = 9$, then $f(f(f(5))) = f(9) = 15$, and $15 \neq 793$.
If we try $f(6) = 11$, then $f(f(f(6))) = f(11) = 21$, and $21 \neq 793$.
If we try $f(7) = 13$, then $f(f(f(7))) = f(13) = 23$, and $23 \neq 793$.
If we try $f(8) = 15$, then $f(f(f(8))) = f(15) = 27$, and $27 \neq 793$.
If we try $f(9) = 17$, then $f(f(f(9))) = f(17) = 31$, and $31 \neq 793$.
If we try $f(10) = 19$, then $f(f(f(10))) = f(19) = 33$, and $33 \neq 793$.
If we try $f(11) = 21$, then $f(f(f(11))) = f(21) = 39$, and $39 \neq 793$.
If we try $f(12) = 23$, then $f(f(f(12))) = f(23) = 41$, and $41 \neq 793$.
If we try $f(13) = 25$, then $f(f(f(13))) = f(25) = 45$, and $45 \neq 793$.
If we try $f(14) = 27$, then $f(f(f(14))) = f(27) = 49$, and $49 \neq 793$.
If we try $f(15) = 29$, then $f(f(f(15))) = f(29) = 51$, and $51 \neq 793$.
If we try $f(16) = 31$, then $f(f(f(16))) = f(31) = 57$, and $57 \neq 793$.
If we try $f(17) = 33$, then $f(f(f(17))) = f(33) = 59$, and $59 \neq 793$.
If we try $f(18) = 35$, then $f(f(f(18))) = f(35) = 63$, and $63 \neq 793$.
If we try $f(19) = 37$, then $f(f(f(19))) = f(37) = 65$, and $65 \neq 793$.
If we try $f(20) = 39$, then $f(f(f(20))) = f(39) = 71$, and $71 \neq 793$.

We will use the second given equation to simplify the first equation. Let's start with $f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$.

We know that $f(f(f(n)))=f(f(2f(n)+1))$. Now, using the second equation, we substitute $2f(n)+1$ into the function $f$. So we get $f(f(2f(n)+1))=f(2(2f(n)+1)+1)=f(4f(n)+3)$.

Now, using the second equation again, we substitute $4f(n)+3$ into the function $f$. So we get $f(4f(n)+3)=2(4f(n)+3)+1=8f(n)+7$.

Now, we equate this to $8n-7$: $8f(n)+7=8n-7$. Solving for $f(n)$, we get $f(n)=n-1$.

Now, we can substitute $n=100$ into $f(n)=n-1$ to find $f(100)$. So $f(100)=100-1=99$.

So the value of $f(100)$ is 99. The answer is: $99$

Approach:


To solve this problem, we need to find the value of $f(100)$ using the given functional equations. The first equation $f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$ tells us that applying the function three times will result in $8n-7$. The second equation $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$ tells us that doubling the argument of the function will result in the function of the original argument doubled plus 1.

We can start by trying to find a few values of $f(n)$ using the second equation. For example, if we plug in $n=1$, we get $f(2)=2f(1)+1$. Similarly, $f(4)=2f(2)+1$, and so on.

However, the second equation alone is not sufficient to directly compute $f(100)$. So we need to use the first equation to find a pattern that can help us compute $f(100)$.

Let's try plugging in $n=1$ into the first equation: $f(f(f(1)))=8*1-7=1$. This means $f(f(1))=1$, and since $f(2)=2f(1)+1$, we can substitute $f(1)$ to get $f(2)=3$.

Now we can plug in $n=2$ into the second equation to find $f(4)=2f(2)+1=2*3+1=7$. Then, plugging in $n=4$ into the first equation gives $f(f(f(4)))=8*4-7=23$, and since $f(f(4))=23$, we have $f(7)=23$.

Continuing this process, we can find more values of $f(n)$. After a few steps, we notice a pattern: $f(n)=2n+1$ for all positive integers $n$.

Now that we have found the pattern, we can easily compute $f(100)=2*100+1=201$.

So, the value of $f(100)$ is 201. The answer is: $201$.

Solve the following problem with a Python Script (positive numerical answer):
"A function $f: \mathbb N \to \mathbb N$ satisfies the following two conditions for all positive integers $n$:$f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$ and $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$. Calculate $f(100)$."

Approach:


We can start by plugging in $n = 100$ into the second equation to find $f(200)$. Then we can plug in $f(200)$ into the second equation to find $f(f(200))$, and finally plug in $f(f(200))$ into the first equation to find $f(100)$.

Solution:

Step 1: Use the second equation to find $f(200)$.
$$f(2n) = 2f(n) + 1 \implies f(200) = 2f(100) + 1.$$

Step 2: Use the second equation to find $f(f(200))$.
$$f(f(200)) = 2f(f(100)) + 1.$$

Step 3: Use the first equation to find $f(100)$.
$$f(f(f(n))) = 8n - 7 \implies f(f(f(100))) = 8(100) - 7 = 793.$$

So we have $f(f(f(100))) = 793$, which means $2f(f(100)) + 1 = 793$. Solving this equation for $f(f(100))$ gives
$$f(f(100)) = \frac{793 - 1}{2} = 396.$$

Now we can substitute $f(f(100)) = 396$ into the equation from Step 2 to find $f(200)$:
$$f(200) = 2(396) + 1 = 793.$$

Finally, we substitute $f(200) = 793$ into the equation from Step 1 to find $f(100)$:
$$f(100) = \frac{793 - 1}{2} = 396.$$

So $f(100) = 396$. The answer is: $\boxed{396}$.

To solve this problem, we will try to find a pattern in the function $f(n)$ by applying the given conditions step by step.

1. From the first condition $f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$, we can see that applying the function three times to any number will result in $8n-7$.

2. From the second condition $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$, we can see that applying the function to any number multiplied by 2 results in twice the value of the function of the original number plus 1.

Now let's apply these conditions to find $f(100)$:

3. We know that $f(f(f(100)))=8*100-7=793$.

4. Let's denote $f(100)$ as $x$. Then we have $f(f(f(100)))=f(f(x))=f(y)=793$.

5. Now let's apply the second condition to $f(y)=793$. We know that $f(2y)=2f(y)+1=2*793+1=1587$.

6. Since $2y=100$, we can find $y=50$.

7. Now let's apply the second condition to $f(y)=f(50)=50$. We have $f(2*50)=2f(50)+1$, which simplifies to $f(100)=2*50+1=101$.

So the value of $f(100)$ is 101. The answer is: $\boxed{101}$.

Approach:


We will start by using the second equation to find $f(100)$.
Since $f(2n) = 2f(n) + 1$, we can find $f(50)$ first.
$f(50) = 2f(25) + 1$.
Now we need to find $f(25)$.
Again using the second equation, $f(25) = 2f(12.5) + 1$.
But $12.5$ is not a natural number, so we cannot use the second equation directly.
So we need to use the first equation to find a way out.
We know that $f(f(f(n))) = 8n - 7$.
Setting $n = 12.5$, we get $f(f(f(12.5))) = 8(12.5) - 7 = 93$.
Now we can set $n = f(12.5)$ in the second equation.
$f(2f(12.5)) = 2f(f(12.5)) + 1$.
But we know that $2f(12.5) = 50$, so we can substitute this in.
$f(50) = 2f(f(12.5)) + 1$.
Now we can substitute $f(50)$ from the equation we found earlier.
$2f(25) + 1 = 2f(f(12.5)) + 1$.
Simplifying this gives $2f(25) = 2f(f(12.5))$.
Dividing both sides by 2 gives $f(25) = f(f(12.5))$.
Now we can substitute $f(25)$ into the equation for $f(50)$.
$f(50) = 2f(25) + 1 = 2f(f(12.5)) + 1$.
Again using the first equation, we know that $f(f(12.5)) = 12.5$.
So we can substitute this in.
$f(50) = 2(12.5) + 1 = 26$.
Now we can substitute $f(50)$ into the equation for $f(25)$.
$f(25) = 2f(12.5) + 1$.
Again using the second equation, we know that $f(12.5) = 2f(6.25) + 1$.
But $6.25$ is not a natural number, so we cannot use the second equation directly.
So we need to use the first equation again.
We know that $f(f(f(n))) = 8n - 7$.
Setting $n = 6.25$, we get $f(f(f(6.25))) = 8(6.25) - 7 = 42.5$.
Now we can set $n = f(6.25)$ in the second equation.
$f(2f(6.25)) = 2f(f(6.25)) + 1$.
But we know that $2f(6.25) = 25$, so we can substitute this in.
$f(25) = 2f(f(6.25)) + 1$.
Now we can substitute $f(25)$ from the equation we found earlier.
$26 = 2f(f(6.25)) + 1$.
Simplifying this gives $25 = 2f(f(6.25))$.
Dividing both sides by 2 gives $12.5 = f(f(6.25))$.
Now we can substitute $f(f(6.25))$ into the equation for $f(12.5)$.
$f(12.5) = 2f(6.25) + 1$.
Again using the second equation, we know that $f(6.25) = 2f(3.125) + 1$.
But $3.125$ is not a natural number, so we cannot use the second equation directly.
So we need to use the first equation again.
We know that $f(f(f(n))) = 8n - 7$.
Setting $n = 3.125$, we get $f(f(f(3.125))) = 8(3.125) - 7 = 16.5$.
Now we can set $n = f(3.125)$ in the second equation.
$f(2f(3.125)) = 2f(f(3.125)) + 1$.
But we know that $2f(3.125) = 6.25$, so we can substitute this in.
$f(6.25) = 2f(f(3.125)) + 1$.
Now we can substitute $f(6.25)$ from the equation we found earlier.
$12.5 = 2f(f(3.125)) + 1$.
Simplifying this gives $11.5 = 2f(f(3.125))$.
Dividing both sides by 2 gives $5.75 = f(f(3.125))$.
Now we can substitute $f(f(3.125))$ into the equation for $f(6.25)$.
$f(6.25) = 2f(3.125) + 1$.
Again using the second equation, we know that $f(3.125) = 2f(1.5625) + 1$.
But $1.5625$ is not a natural number, so we cannot use the second equation directly.
So we need to use the first equation again.
We know that $f(f(f(n))) = 8n - 7$.
Setting $n = 1.5625$, we get $f(f(f(1.5625))) = 8(1.5625) - 7 = 4.5$.
Now we can set $n = f(1.5625)$ in the second equation.
$f(2f(1.5625)) = 2f(f(1.5625)) + 1$.
But we know that $2f(1.5625) = 3.125$, so we can substitute this in.
$f(3.125) = 2f(f(1.5625)) + 1$.
Now we can substitute $f(3.125)$ from the equation we found earlier.
$5.75 = 2f(f(1.5625)) + 1$.
