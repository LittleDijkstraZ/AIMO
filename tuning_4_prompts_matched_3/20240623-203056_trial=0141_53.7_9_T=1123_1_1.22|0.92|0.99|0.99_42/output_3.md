Interesting, let's analyze step by step:


1. $0 \cdot a = 0$, therefore either the first factor equals to zero or the second one.
2. Both expressions in the absolute values should be zero for the first factor to be true, meaning:
   $$|x+y| = 10,$$
   $$|x-y| = 10.$$
   It means either $x+y=10$ or $x+y=-10$, and either $x-y=10$ or $x-y=-10$.
   These are lines on the plane and they form a square with side length of 10. The area of the square is $10 \cdot 10 = 100$.
   For the second factor to be true it means that
   $$|x| = 8,$$
   $$|y| = 8,$$
   which also forms a square with side length 8, having the area of $8 \cdot 8 = 64$.
3. Therefore the wanted area is the sum of these 2 areas, hence we have $100 + 64 = 164$. The positive integer is 164.

To solve this problem, we don't need to use sympy since we are dealing with basic algebra. The key is to recognize that if $ab = 0$, then $a = 0$ or $b = 0$. Applying this to the given equation, we find that either the first factor or the second factor must be zero. Setting each factor equal to zero and solving for the variables will give us the coordinates of the vertices of the polygon. Then we can calculate the area of the polygon.

The area of the square formed by $x+y=10$, $x+y=-10$, $x-y=10$, and $x-y=-10$ is 100.
The area of the square formed by $|x| = 8$ and $|y| = 8$ is 64.
Therefore, the total area of the convex polygon is $100 + 64 = 164$. The positive integer is 164.

The answer is: $164$

Interesting, let's analyze step by step:



The condition given is $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + (\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + (\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$. The expression will be zero if either of the two terms are zero.

1. The first term being zero happens when $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. This gives us four lines: $x + y = 10$, $x + y = -10$, $x - y = 10$ and $x - y = -10$.
2. The second term being zero happens when $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$. This gives us four lines: $x = 8$, $x = -8$, $y = 8$ and $y = -8$.

These eight lines form a rectangle with side lengths of 16 and 20. Therefore, the area of the polygon is $16 \times 20 = 320$. Hence, the area of the polygon is 320 square units.

The answer is: $320$

Interesting, let's analyze step by step:



We have two product terms in the equation:
$$((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0.$$
The product of two numbers is zero if and only if at least one of them is zero. Therefore, the solution to the equation is any points $(x, y)$ that make either term zero. 

The first term is zero if and only if both $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ and $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$. The second term is zero if and only if $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ and $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$. 

For $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$, we have $\vert x + y \vert = 10$, which means $x + y = \pm 10$. For $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$, we have $\vert x - y \vert = 10$, which means $x - y = \pm 10$. For $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$, we have $\vert x \vert = 8$, which means $x = \pm 8$. For $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$, we have $\vert y \vert = 8$, which means $y = \pm 8$. 

Combining these, we get the vertices of the polygon: $(8, 8), (8, -8), (-8, 8), (-8, -8), (10, 0), (0, 10), (-10, 0), (0, -10)$.

If we plot these points on a graph and connect them, we get a square with side length 16. The area of this square is $16^2 = 256$. The value 256 is indeed a positive integer.

The area of the convex polygon is $\boxed{256}$. Here is a graphical representation of the square:

[insert diagram of the square here]
```python


INTERMEDIATE OUT :

from sympy import symbols, Rational, simplify

def area_of_polygon():
    # The side length of the square is 16
    side_length = 16

    # The area of the square is side_length^2
    area = side_length**2

    return area

result = area_of_polygon()
print(result)
```

CODE RESULTS 256

INTERMEDIATE OUT :
```output
256
```
The area of the convex polygon is $\boxed{256}$.

Note: The actual graphical representation of the square would show that the points $(8, 8), (8, -8), (-8, 8), (-8, -8)$ form the vertices of a square with side length 16, and the points $(10, 0), (0, 10), (-10, 0), (0, -10)$ are the vertices of another square with side length 20. The overall shape of the region is indeed a square with side length 16, and its area is 256. The square with side length 20 does not belong to the region enclosed by the points satisfying the given equation.The area of the convex polygon is 256 square units. The answer is: 256

Interesting, let's analyze step by step:



If the product of two numbers is zero, one or both of them must be zero:
\[((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2) = 0 \text{ or } ((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0.\]
The second term will be zero if and only if $(x, y) = (8, 8)$ or $(x, y) = (-8, -8)$.
The first term will be zero if and only if $(|x + y| = 10)$ and $(|x - y| = 10)$.
These two equations simplify to $x + y = \pm 10$ and $x - y = \pm 10$.
Solving these system of equations, we find four more points:
$(x, y) = (5, -5), (-5, 5), (5, 5), (-5, -5)$.
So, the polygon is a square with side length $10\sqrt{2}$, and its area is $(10\sqrt{2})^2 = 200$. The answer is: $200$

Interesting, let's analyze step by step:



The condition given in the problem is $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$. 

This condition is true if and only if either 

1. $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$, or 
2. $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$.

Each of the above four conditions implies that either $|x+y|=10$, $|x-y|=10$, $|x|=8$, or $|y|=8$. These are all lines in the $xy$-plane. Their intersection will form a octagon. 

The lines $|x+y|=10$, $|x-y|=10$, $|x|=8$, and $|y|=8$ form a square with side length 8, centered at the origin. The vertices of this square are $(\pm8, 0)$, $(0, \pm8)$, and $(\pm4, \pm4)$. 

The area of this square is $8^2 = 64$.

Hence, the area of the convex polygon formed by the intersection of the above lines is 64 square units. The answer is: $64$

Interesting, let's analyze step by step:



The given equation is: 

$$((|x + y| - 10)^2 + (|x - y| - 10)^2)((|x| - 8)^2 + (|y| - 8)^2) = 0$$

For the product of two terms to be zero, one of the terms must be zero. This means that either 

1. $(|x + y| - 10)^2 = 0$ or $(|x - y| - 10)^2 = 0$, or
2. $(|x| - 8)^2 = 0$ or $(|y| - 8)^2 = 0$.

In the first case, $|x + y| = 10$ or $|x - y| = 10$. This gives us the conditions for a square with side length 10 units. In the second case, $|x| = 8$ or $|y| = 8$. This gives us a square with side length 16 units.

The intersection of these two squares is a smaller square with side length 8 units. Thus, the area of the convex polygon is the area of the larger square minus the area of the smaller square.

The area of a square with side length $a$ is $a^2$. Therefore, the area of the larger square is $10^2 = 100$ square units, and the area of the smaller square is $8^2 = 64$ square units.

Finally, subtracting the areas gives the area of the convex polygon: $100 - 64 = 36$ square units.

Since the output is a positive integer, we can confirm our solution.

The area of the convex polygon is 36 square units. The answer is: $\boxed{36}$.

Interesting, let's analyze step by step:



The condition $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ encloses a polygon. The expression is equal to zero when one of the following conditions hold:

1. $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$, or
2. $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$

1. For the first condition, we have two absolute value terms, which simplifies to two cases: 
   - $x + y = 10$ and $x - y = 10$, solving this gives $x = 10$, $y = 0$.
   - $x + y = -10$ and $x - y = -10$, solving this gives $x = -10$, $y = 0$.

2. For the second condition, we again have two absolute value terms, which simplifies to two cases:
   - $x = 8$ and $y = 8$, which gives a single point at (8, 8).
   - $x = -8$ and $y = -8$, which gives a single point at (-8, -8).

So, the vertices of the polygon are (10, 0), (-10, 0), (8, 8), and (-8, -8). These form a rectangle with side lengths of 20 and 16.

Finally, the area of the rectangle is $20 \times 16 = 320$. The value is positive and an integer, so we can be confident in our solution.

The area of the convex polygon is 320 square units. The answer is: $320$

Assistant:

Interesting, let's analyze step by step:


The expression is a product of two terms equal to zero. This means that either the first term is zero or the second term is zero. 

The first term is $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)$. This term equals to zero if and only if $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. This forms a square with side length 20.

The second term is $((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2)$. This term equals to zero if and only if $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$. This forms a square with side length 16.

The intersection of these two squares is the convex polygon we are looking for. This polygon is also a square with side length equal to the shorter side of the two squares, which is 16.

The area of the square is then $16^2 = 256$.

Therefore, the area of the convex polygon is $\boxed{256}$.

Interesting, let's analyze step by step:



The equation given: $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$. For the product of two numbers to be zero, either of them has to be zero. So, either $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$.

If $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$, then both $\vert x + y \vert - 10 = 0$ and $\vert x - y \vert - 10 = 0$, which gives $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. This means $x + y = \pm10$ and $x - y = \pm10$. Solving these equations, we get the lines $x + y = 10$, $x + y = -10$, $x - y = 10$, and $x - y = -10$. These lines form a rectangle with vertices at $(0,10)$, $(10,0)$, $(0,-10)$, and $(-10,0)$.

If $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$, then both $\vert x \vert - 8 = 0$ and $\vert y \vert - 8 = 0$, which gives $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$. This means $x = \pm8$ and $y = \pm8$. So the points are at $(8,8)$, $(8,-8)$, $(-8,8)$, and $(-8,-8)$. These points form a square with side length 16.

The convex polygon is formed by both the rectangle and the square. To find its area, we can simply sum the areas of the rectangle and the square. The rectangle has length 20 and width 10, so its area is $20 \times 10 = 200$. The square with side length 16 has area $16^2 = 256$. Adding these two areas together, we get $200 + 256 = 456$.

So the area of the convex polygon is 456. And as you can see, it's a positive integer.

The answer is: $456$

Step 1: Variables and known values
We don't actually need any variable names because we're not solving for a numeric value in this question. We need to analyze the problem and identify the result based on the given conditions.

Step 2: Outline the steps using sympy to solve the problem
Step 2a: Identify the sympy functions required for each step
- We don't actually need sympy for this problem since it's a simple geometric problem.

Step 2b: Implement these functions step-by-step, commenting each line for clarity
- Analyze the equation: $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$
- This equation equals to zero if either of the two terms equals zero.
- The first term equals zero when $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$.
- The second term equals zero when $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$.
- These four equations define the sides of a square with side length 10 (from $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$) and centered at (8, 8) (from $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$).

Step 2c: Calculate the final answer and verify it's a positive integer
- The area of this square is the square of the side length, which is $10^2 = 100$. Since it's a positive integer, we're good to go.

It seems like we're dealing with absolute value expressions and squared differences. To solve this problem, let's use the definition of absolute value, which is $|x| = \begin{cases} x, & \text{if } x \geq 0, \\ -x, & \text{if } x < 0. \end{cases}$

If either of the factors in the product is zero, then the entire product is zero. Hence, the points satisfying this equation must satisfy either $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$.

This is equivalent to $\vert x + y \vert = 10$, $\vert x - y \vert = 10$, $\vert x \vert = 8$, or $\vert y \vert = 8$. Solving these absolute value equations gives the following conditions:

1. $x + y = 10$ or $x + y = -10$.
2. $x - y = 10$ or $x - y = -10$.
3. $x = 8$ or $x = -8$.
4. $y = 8$ or $y = -8$.

These conditions give us a total of 16 different point pairs $(x, y)$, and they form a square with side length 16.

To find the area of this square, we simply square the side length: $Area = side^2 = 16^2 = 256$.

Therefore, the area of the convex polygon is 256 square units.

Note that the use of absolute values and squared differences leads to a square region in the coordinate plane with side length 16. As the area of a square is side length squared, the area is calculated as follows: $\text{Area} = side^2 = 16^2 = 256$. We can check that 256 is a positive integer. Therefore, the area of the convex polygon is 256.
The answer is: $256$.
