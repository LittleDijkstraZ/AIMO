Approach:



1. First, let's rewrite the equation as a compound inequality: \[\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}\] can be written as \[ - \frac{m}{100} \le \vert x-1 \vert -2 \le \frac{m}{100}\].
2. Now, let's add $2$ to each part of the compound inequality to isolate the absolute value term: \[ 2 - \frac{m}{100} \le \vert x-1 \vert \le 2 + \frac{m}{100}\].
3. The absolute value term $\vert x-1 \vert$ represents the distance between $x$ and $1$ on the number line. This inequality represents the interval $(1 - 2 - \frac{m}{100}, 1 - 2 + \frac{m}{100})$, or $(1 - 2 - \frac{m}{100}, 1 + \frac{m}{100})$.
4. For the equation to have $4$ distinct solutions, the length of the interval must be equal to $4$. So we have $1 + \frac{m}{100} - (1 - 2 - \frac{m}{100}) = 4$. Simplifying, we get $1 + \frac{m}{100} - 1 + 2 + \frac{m}{100} = 4$, which simplifies further to $\frac{2m}{100} = 2$.
5. Solving for $m$ gives us $m = 100$. Therefore, there is only $1$ value of $m$ for which the equation has $4$ distinct solutions.

However, we have to check if this value of $m$ works. Let's substitute $m = 100$ into the inequality: \[ 2 - \frac{100}{100} \le \vert x-1 \vert \le 2 + \frac{100}{100}\], which simplifies to $1 \le \vert x-1 \vert \le 3$.
The absolute value of a real number is always non-negative, so we must split the inequality into two cases: $x-1 \ge 0$ and $x-1 < 0$.
For $x-1 \ge 0$, the inequality becomes $1 \le x-1 \le 3$, or $2 \le x \le 4$. For $x-1 < 0$, the inequality becomes $1 \le -(x-1) \le 3$, or $ -2 \le -x+1 \le 3$, which simplifies to $-1 \le -x \le 2$, or $1 \ge x \ge -2$.
The solutions of the inequality are the union of the solutions of the two cases: $x \in [-2, 4]$. There are indeed $4$ distinct solutions.
So the number of positive integers $m$ for which the equation has $4$ distinct solutions is $1$. The answer is: 1

"For how many positive integers $m$ does the equation \[\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}\] have $4$ distinct solutions?"

Approach:

 

First, we need to analyze the given equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$. We know that the number of distinct solutions for $x$ depends on the value of $\frac{m}{100}$. 

The left side of the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert$ is a positive value that is always greater than or equal to 0, so we need the right side, $\frac{m}{100}$, to be a positive value too. This means $m$ must be a positive integer.

The equation will have 4 distinct solutions if $\frac{m}{100}$ is set to the value of 2 in the equation. That is, we need $\frac{m}{100} = 2$, which gives us $m = 200$.

We also need to verify that setting $\frac{m}{100}$ to any value less than 2 will not yield 4 distinct solutions. If we set $\frac{m}{100}$ to a value less than 2, the number of distinct solutions will be less than 4.

For instance, if we set $\frac{m}{100} = 1$, we have a single solution for $x$.

Similarly, if we set $\frac{m}{100}$ to a value greater than 2, the number of distinct solutions will also be less than 4.

For instance, if we set $\frac{m}{100} = 3$, we have only 2 distinct solutions for $x$.

Therefore, the only value of $m$ that makes the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ have 4 distinct solutions is $m = 200$.

The answer is: $1$

The equation $||x-1|-2|=\frac{m}{100}$ has 4 distinct solutions if and only if $\frac{m}{100}$ is equal to $2$.

Explanation:
The expression $| | x - 1 | - 2 |$ is a modulus of a modulus, and can have three forms:

1. For $|x-1| < 2$, i.e., $-2 < x-1 < 2$, i.e., $-1 < x < 3$, $| | x - 1 | - 2 | = 2 - (x - 1) = 3 - x$.

2. For $|x-1| = 2$, i.e., $x - 1 = \pm 2$, i.e., $x = 3, -1$, $| | x - 1 | - 2 | = 0$.

3. For $|x-1| > 2$, i.e., $x-1 < -2$ or $x-1 > 2$, i.e., $x < -1$ or $x > 3$, $| | x - 1 | - 2 | = (x - 1) - 2 = x - 3$.

The equation $| | x - 1 | - 2 | = \frac{m}{100}$ has four distinct solutions if and only if $\frac{m}{100} = 2$.
Therefore, we set $\frac{m}{100} = 2$ and solve for $m$ to get $m = 200$. Thus, there is only one positive integer value for $m$ such that the equation has four distinct solutions. Therefore, the value of the unknown $m$ is $200$.
The answer is: 1

Approach:

 We can start by analyzing the structure of the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$. The left side of the equation is always between 0 and 2 (inclusive), as the absolute value of a real number is always non-negative and the absolute value of a number subtracted by another number is always between the two numbers. Thus, for the equation to have 4 distinct solutions, $\frac{m}{100}$ must be between 0 and 2. That is $0 \leq \frac{m}{100} \leq 2$.

Next, we multiply all sides by 100 to clear the fraction, resulting in $0 \leq m \leq 200$. 

Then we need to find how many positive integers $m$ fall into this range. The positive integers from 1 to 200, inclusive, are exactly the integers we are looking for. 

Counting these integers gives the number of positive integers $m$ that make the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ have 4 distinct solutions.

```python


INTERMEDIATE OUT :

def count_positive_integers():
    return len(range(1, 201))

result = count_positive_integers()
print(result)
```

CODE RESULTS 200

INTERMEDIATE OUT :
```output

```

The number of positive integers $m$ such that the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has 4 distinct solutions is 200. 

Therefore, the value of unknown variable $m$ in this problem is 200. The answer is: $200$

Approach:


We know that the function $|\vert x - 1 \vert - 2|$ is a "V" shaped graph that peaks at 2 and has its bottom points at 1 and 3. This graph "opens" upwards as its slope changes sign at $x = 2$. The value of the function for $x$ in the interval $[1,3]$ is in the interval $[0,1]$. Hence, $\frac{m}{100}$ should be in the interval $[0,1]$ for the equation to have 4 distinct solutions. The only way this is possible is if $m$ is in the interval $[0,100]$. For each value of $m$ in this interval, the equation will have 4 distinct solutions. So the number of such integers is 100. The answer is: 100

Approach:


The equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ is a piecewise function with 4 possible expressions within absolute value. For each of these expressions, we need to find when the equation equals to $\frac{m}{100}$. This will give us four intervals for $x$ where the equation holds true. We need to count how many of these intervals have lengths of exactly 1. This will be the number of values of $m$ for which the equation has 4 distinct solutions.

The equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has four distinct solutions when the right side of the equation is between 0 and 3 (since the left side of the equation is always non-negative and its maximum value is 3). Thus, we need to find the number of values of $m$ for which $0 < \frac{m}{100} < 3$, or equivalently $0 < m < 300$.

The number of positive integers $m$ in this range is simply $300 - 1 = 299$. However, we must be careful here. When the equation is equal to 0 or 3, it will not have 4 distinct solutions. Therefore, we need to subtract the number of times the equation is equal to 0 or 3 from 299.

When the equation equals to 0, $\frac{m}{100} = 0$, so $m = 0$. When the equation equals to 3, $\frac{m}{100} = 3$, so $m = 300$. However, these values were already excluded from our range ($0 < m < 300$) since the equation should not have 4 distinct solutions when $m = 0$ or $m = 300$.

So, there are no other values of $m$ for which the equation has 4 distinct solutions. Therefore, the total number of positive integers $m$ for which the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has 4 distinct solutions is 299 - 2 = 297.
The answer is: 297

Approach:

 We know that $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has $4$ distinct solutions. The graph of $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert$ is a triangular wave with amplitude $\frac{m}{100}$. The graph intersects the x-axis four times if and only if the amplitude is greater than $\frac{1}{2}$ and less than $1$, that is $\frac{1}{2}<\frac{m}{100}<1$. Solving these inequalities gives $\frac{50}{m}<1$ and $\frac{m}{100}<\frac{1}{2}$, which simplifies to $50<m$ and $m<50$. But this is a contradiction, so we must have made an error.

We look back and realize that we have misunderstood the problem. The equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has $4$ distinct solutions means that the graph of $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert$ intersects the horizontal line $y = \frac{m}{100}$ at $4$ points. Therefore, the horizontal line $y = \frac{m}{100}$ must lie strictly between the maximum and minimum values of $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert = 1$. That is, $0 < \frac{m}{100} < 1$, which simplifies to $0 < m < 100$.

The positive integers that satisfy this inequality are all the integers from $1$ to $99$. Therefore, there are $99$ such integers $m$. The answer is: $\boxed{99}$.

We are given the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$. The equation will have 4 distinct solutions when $\frac{m}{100} = 2$. Therefore, we have $m = 200$.

However, we are asked to find the number of positive integers $m$ that satisfy this condition. Since $m$ must be a positive integer, the only possibility is $m = 200$. So, there is only one positive integer $m$ that makes the equation have 4 distinct solutions.

The answer is: $\boxed{1}$.
