Interesting, let's analyze step by step:



The product of two numbers is zero if and only if at least one of the numbers is zero. So, the given equation is equivalent to the system of equations:

$$((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2) = 0,$$
$$((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0.$$

From the first equation, we have:
$$\vert x + y \vert = 10,$$
$$\vert x - y \vert = 10.$$

This implies that $x + y = \pm 10$ and $x - y = \pm 10$. Solving these system of equations, we get the vertices of the square:
$$(5, 5), (5, -5), (-5, 5), (-5, -5).$$

From the second equation, we have:
$$\vert x \vert = 8,$$
$$\vert y \vert = 8.$$

This implies that $x = \pm 8$ and $y = \pm 8$. Solving these system of equations, we get the vertices of the square:
$$(8, 8), (8, -8), (-8, 8), (-8, -8).$$

The convex polygon formed by the union of these two squares is a $8 \times 10$ rectangle. The area of this rectangle is $8 \times 10 = 80$. So, the area of the convex polygon is 80.

The answer is: $80$.

The expression $ ((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ is true if and only if at least one of the following two conditions is true:

1. $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2) = 0$
2. $((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$

From condition 1, we have $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. These are the equations of two lines in the plane, forming a rectangle.

From condition 2, we have $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$. These are the equations of two more lines in the plane, also forming a rectangle.

The intersection of these two rectangles is the convex polygon we are looking for. The vertices of this polygon are the points where the lines intersect.

The side lengths of the rectangles are $20$ and $16$, so the area of the convex polygon is the product of its side lengths divided by two, which is $20 \times 16 / 2 = 160$.

Therefore, the area of the convex polygon is $160$.

The answer is: $160$

Interesting, let's analyze step by step:



First, let's understand the given equation:
$$((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$$

This equation equals to zero if and only if either of the two factors equals to zero. So, we have two cases:

Case 1: $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ or $\vert x + y \vert = 10$
Case 2: $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ or $\vert x - y \vert = 10$
Case 3: $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ or $\vert x \vert = 8$
Case 4: $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ or $\vert y \vert = 8$

In each case, we get a square with side length of 16 units. The area of a square is side length squared, so each square has an area of $16^2 = 256$ square units.

The total area of the polygon is the sum of the areas of these four squares, which is $4 \times 256 = 1024$ square units.

Now, let's confirm that the result is a positive integer:

```python


INTERMEDIATE OUT :

from sympy import Integer

result = 1024

# Convert the result to an integer object
result_integer = Integer(result)

# Check if the result is a positive integer
if result_integer.is_positive and result_integer.is_integer:
    print(result_integer)
else:
    print("Error: The result is not a positive integer.")
```
```output

CODE RESULTS 1024

INTERMEDIATE OUT :

1024
```
The result is a positive integer, so the area of the convex polygon is $1024$ square units. The answer is: $1024$

Interesting, let's analyze step by step:



The expression is equal to zero if and only if both $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$, $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$, $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$, and $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$.

This implies that $\vert x + y \vert = 10$, $\vert x - y \vert = 10$, $\vert x \vert = 8$, and $\vert y \vert = 8$.

The solutions are then: $x + y = \pm 10$, $x - y = \pm 10$, $x = \pm 8$, and $y = \pm 8$.

This gives us a total of 16 solutions.

The solutions $(x, y) = (8, 8)$, $(-8, 8)$, $(8, -8)$, and $(-8, -8)$ form a square with side length 16.

The solutions $(x, y) = (10, 0)$, $(-10, 0)$, $(0, 10)$, and $(0, -10)$ form a square with side length 20.

The union of these two squares is the convex polygon we are looking for.

To find the area of this polygon, we simply add the areas of the two squares:

Area = $(16)^2 + (20)^2 = 256 + 400 = 656$.

Therefore, the area of the convex polygon is 656.
The answer is: $656$

Interesting, let's analyze step by step:



The equation given is $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + (\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + (\vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$.

The only way this equation can be zero is if both terms are zero. So we have two systems of equations to solve:

1. $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ and $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + (\vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$.
2. $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ and $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + (\vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$.

From the first system of equations, we get $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x \vert = 8$, $\vert y \vert = 8$. This gives us the vertices of the square as $(8,0), (0,8), (-8,0), (0,-8)$.

From the second system of equations, we get $\vert x - y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x \vert = 8$, $\vert y \vert = 8$. This gives us the vertices of the square as $(8,8), (8,-8), (-8,8), (-8,-8)$.

So the points that satisfy the equation are the vertices of a square with side length 8. The area of a square is given by the square of the side length, so the area of this square is $8^2 = 64$.

Therefore, the area of the convex polygon is 64 square units. The answer is: $64$

Interesting, let's analyze step by step:



The equation given is a product of two terms equal to zero. This means that either the first term is zero or the second term is zero. 

The first term is $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)$. This term equals zero if and only if $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. This implies that $x + y = \pm 10$ and $x - y = \pm 10$. Solving these equations, we get the vertices of the polygon as $(0, 10)$, $(0, -10)$, $(10, 0)$, $(-10, 0)$.

The second term is $((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2)$. This term equals zero if and only if $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$. This implies that $x = \pm 8$ and $y = \pm 8$. Solving these equations, we get the vertices of the polygon as $(8, 8)$, $(8, -8)$, $(-8, 8)$, $(-8, -8)$.

The convex polygon formed by these vertices is a square with side length 10. The area of a square is side length squared, so the area of this square is $10^2 = 100$.

So the area of the convex polygon is 100.
The answer is: $100$

Interesting, let's analyze step by step:



The given equation is $0 = ((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2)$.

This equation equals zero if either of the two terms equals zero. This gives us two systems of equations:

1. $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ and $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$.
2. $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ and $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$.

For the first system, we have $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$. This implies $-8 \leq x, y \leq 8$.

For the second system, we have $\vert x - y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$. This implies $-8 \leq x, y \leq 8$.

So the points $\left(x, y\right)$ that satisfy the given equation are those that lie in the square with vertices $\left(-8, -8\right)$, $\left(8, -8\right)$, $\left(8, 8\right)$, and $\left(-8, 8\right)$.

The area of this square is $(8 - (-8))^2 = 16^2 = 256$.

Since the area is a positive integer, the answer is $\boxed{256}$.

Interesting, let's analyze step by step:



The equation is given as:

$$((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$$

This equation equals zero if and only if either of the two terms equals zero. That is:

$$((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2) = 0 \text{ or } ((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$$

The first term equals zero when $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. The second term equals zero when $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$.

The first condition gives us a square with side length $20$, and the second condition gives us a square with side length $16$.

The area of the convex polygon is the sum of the areas of these two squares:

$$Area = (20)^2 + (16)^2 = 400 + 256 = 656$$

So the area of the convex polygon is $656$.

Interesting, let's analyze step by step:



The given equation is:
\[((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0.\]
This equation is satisfied if either of the following two conditions is true:

1. $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$.
2. $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$.

From the first condition, we have $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ or $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. This implies that the points $(x, y)$ lie on a square with side length $10\sqrt{2}$.

From the second condition, we have $\vert x \vert = 8$ or $\vert y \vert = 8$. This implies that the points $(x, y)$ lie on a square with side length $16$.

The intersection of these two squares forms a smaller square with side length $10\sqrt{2} - 2*8 = 10\sqrt{2} - 16$.

The area of this square is $(10\sqrt{2} - 16)^2$.

Let's calculate it:

```python


INTERMEDIATE OUT :

from sympy import sqrt

def calculate_area():
    side_length = 10*sqrt(2) - 16
    area = side_length**2
    return area

result = calculate_area()
print(result)
```

CODE RESULTS (-16 + 10*sqrt(2))**2

INTERMEDIATE OUT :
```output
(-16 + 10*sqrt(2))**2
```

This is the symbolic result. Now, let's simplify it:

```python


INTERMEDIATE OUT :

from sympy import simplify

def simplify_result():
    area = (-16 + 10*sqrt(2))**2
    simplified_area = simplify(area)
    return simplified_area

simplified_result = simplify_result()
print(simplified_result)
```

CODE RESULTS 456 - 320*sqrt(2)

INTERMEDIATE OUT :

This is the simplified result. Now, let's check if it's a positive integer:

```python


INTERMEDIATE OUT :

from sympy import is_positive, is_integer

def check_positive_integer():
    area = 456 - 320*sqrt(2)
    is_pos = is_positive(area)
    is_int = is_integer(area)
    return is_pos and is_int

```

The simplified result is not a positive integer. Let's check if the original result is a positive integer:

```python


INTERMEDIATE OUT :

from sympy import is_positive, is_integer

def check_positive_integer():
    area = (10*sqrt(2) - 16)**2
    is_pos = is_positive(area)

FAIL

```

The original result is also not a positive integer. It seems we have made a mistake in our calculations. Let's retrace our steps and check our work.

The given equation is:
\[((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0.\]
This equation is satisfied if either of the following two conditions is true:

1. $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$.
2. $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$.

From the first condition, we have $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ or $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. This implies that the points $(x, y)$ lie on a square with side length $10\sqrt{2}$.

From the second condition, we have $\vert x \vert = 8$ or $\vert y \vert = 8$. This implies that the points $(x, y)$ lie on a square with side length $16$.

The intersection of these two squares forms a smaller square with side length $10\sqrt{2} - 16$.

However, we made a mistake here. The side length of the smaller square should be $10\sqrt{2} - 8$, not $10\sqrt{2} - 16$. Let's correct this and calculate the area again.

```python


INTERMEDIATE OUT :

from sympy import sqrt

def calculate_area():
    side_length = 10*sqrt(2) - 8
    area = side_length**2
    return area

result = calculate_area()
print(result)
``````output

CODE RESULTS (-8 + 10*sqrt(2))**2

INTERMEDIATE OUT :

```

This is the symbolic result. Now, let's simplify it:

```python


INTERMEDIATE OUT :

from sympy import simplify

def simplify_result():
    area = (-8 + 10*sqrt(2))**2
    simplified_area = simplify(area)
    return simplified_area

simplified_result = simplify_result()
print(simplified_result)
``````output

CODE RESULTS 264 - 160*sqrt(2)

INTERMEDIATE OUT :

```

This is the simplified result. Now, let's check if it's a positive integer:

```python


INTERMEDIATE OUT :

from sympy import is_positive, is_integer

def check_positive_integer():
    area = 264 - 160*sqrt(2)
    is_pos = is_positive(area)
    is_int = is_integer(area)
    return is_pos and is_int

result = check_positive_integer()

Interesting, let's analyze step by step:



The given equation is:
$$((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$$

For the product of two terms to be zero, either of the terms must be zero. Therefore, we have two cases:

Case 1: $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$
Case 2: $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$

In Case 1, both $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2$ and $( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2$ must be zero, which means $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. This implies that $x + y = \pm 10$ and $x - y = \pm 10$, which are the equations of four lines. The intersection points of these lines form a square with side length 10.

In Case 2, both $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2$ and $( \vert y \vert - 8)^2$ must be zero, which means $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$. This implies that $x = \pm 8$ and $y = \pm 8$, which are the equations of four lines. The intersection points of these lines form a square with side length 16.

The area of the convex polygon is the sum of the areas of the two squares. The area of a square with side length $a$ is $a^2$, so the area of the first square is $10^2 = 100$ and the area of the second square is $16^2 = 256$. Therefore, the area of the convex polygon is $100 + 256 = 356$.

The area of the convex polygon is 356. Since the problem asks for a positive numerical answer, the solution is $\boxed{356}$.

Now, let's verify that the answer is a positive integer: The sum of two positive integers is always a positive integer. Therefore, the area of the convex polygon is a positive integer.
The answer is: $356$

Interesting, let's analyze step by step:



1. The problem is asking for the area of a polygon enclosed by the set of points $(x, y)$ that satisfy the equation $ ((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$.

2. The equation is equal to zero if either of the two factors is zero. So, we have two sets of points to consider:
   - Set 1: $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ and $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ and $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$.
   - Set 2: $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ and $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ and $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$.

3. For Set 1, we have $\vert x + y \vert = 10$, $\vert x \vert = 8$, and $\vert y \vert = 8$. This means $-8 \leq x, y \leq 8$, and $x + y = \pm 10$. The possible combinations are $(x, y) = (5, 5)$, $(5, -5)$, $(-5, 5)$, and $(-5, -5)$. This forms a square with side length 10, so its area is $10^2 = 100$.

4. For Set 2, we have $\vert x - y \vert = 10$, $\vert x \vert = 8$, and $\vert y \vert = 8$. This means $-8 \leq x, y \leq 8$, and $x - y = \pm 10$. The possible combinations are $(x, y) = (5, -5)$, $(5, 5)$, $(-5, 5)$, and $(-5, -5)$. This also forms a square with side length 10, so its area is also $10^2 = 100$.

5. The area of the convex polygon formed by the union of Set 1 and Set 2 is the sum of their areas, which is $100 + 100 = 200$.

So, the area of the convex polygon is 200.
The answer is: $200$

Interesting, let's analyze step by step:



The equation is given as:
$$((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$$

This equation equals to zero if and only if at least one of the two factors equals to zero. This gives us two separate cases to analyze:

1. $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$
2. $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$

For the first case, we have:
$$\vert x + y \vert = 10$$
$$\vert x - y \vert = 10$$
This implies that $x = 0$ and $y = 0$.

For the second case, we have:
$$\vert x \vert = 8$$
$$\vert y \vert = 8$$
This implies that $-8 \leq x \leq 8$ and $-8 \leq y \leq 8$.

Combining these two cases, we find that the points $(x, y)$ that satisfy the equation are those that lie in the square with vertices at $(-8, -8), (-8, 8), (8, 8), (8, -8)$.

The area of this square is $8^2 * 2^2 = 256$.

Therefore, the area of the convex polygon formed by the points $(x, y)$ that satisfy the equation is 256.

The answer is: $256$

Interesting, let's analyze step by step:



The equation given is $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$. This equation equals to zero if either of the two expressions equals to zero.

The first expression is $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2) = 0$. This expression equals to zero if both $(\vert x + y \vert - 10) = 0$ and $(\vert x - y \vert - 10) = 0$. This implies that $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. The solutions to these equations are all points on the lines $x + y = 10$ and $x - y = 10$.

The second expression is $((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$. This expression equals to zero if both $(\vert x \vert - 8) = 0$ and $(\vert y \vert - 8) = 0$. This implies that $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$. The solutions to these equations are all points on the lines $x = 8$ and $y = 8$.

The intersection of these lines form a square with side length 10. The area of this square is $10^2 = 100$.

Therefore, the area of the convex polygon is 100. Since 100 is a positive integer, the result is valid.
The answer is: $100$

Interesting, let's analyze step by step:



The product of two numbers is zero if and only if at least one of the numbers is zero. Therefore, the given equation is satisfied if and only if either $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$.

If $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$, then $\vert x + y \vert = 10$, which means $x + y = 10$ or $x + y = -10$.

If $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$, then $\vert x - y \vert = 10$, which means $x - y = 10$ or $x - y = -10$.

If $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$, then $\vert x \vert = 8$, which means $x = 8$ or $x = -8$.

If $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$, then $\vert y \vert = 8$, which means $y = 8$ or $y = -8$.

Combining all these conditions, we find that the points $(x, y)$ satisfying the given equation are:

$(8, 2)$, $(8, -2)$, $(-8, 2)$, $(-8, -2)$, $(2, 8)$, $(2, -8)$, $(-2, 8)$, and $(-2, -8)$.

These points form a square with side length 8. The area of this square is $8^2 = 64$.

Therefore, the area of the convex polygon is 64 square units.

The result is $\boxed{64}$.

Interesting, let's analyze step by step:



The given equation is a product of two expressions equal to zero, so either the first expression is zero or the second expression is zero.

The first expression is $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)$, and this equals to zero if and only if both $\vert x + y \vert - 10 = 0$ and $\vert x - y \vert - 10 = 0$.

This implies that $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$, which means $x + y = \pm 10$ and $x - y = \pm 10$.

Solving these four equations, we get the vertices of the polygon as $(0, 10), (0, -10), (10, 0), (-10, 0)$.

The second expression is $((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2)$, and this equals to zero if and only if both $\vert x \vert - 8 = 0$ and $\vert y \vert - 8 = 0$.

This implies that $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$, which means $x = \pm 8$ and $y = \pm 8$.

But this condition is never satisfied simultaneously with the condition from the first expression. So, the only possible solutions are from the first expression.

Now, we can calculate the area of the polygon formed by these vertices. It's a square with side length 10, so its area is $10^2 = 100$.

Therefore, the area of the convex polygon is 100.

The answer is: $100$

Interesting, let's analyze step by step:



We have the equation:
\[((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0.\]

This equation is equal to zero if and only if either of the two factors is equal to zero. Thus, we have two sets of equations to solve:

1. $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ and $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$.
2. $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ and $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$.

For the first set of equations:
- $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ implies $\vert x + y \vert = 10$, which means $x + y = 10$ or $x + y = -10$.
- $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ implies $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$, which means $x = 8$ or $x = -8$ and $y = 8$ or $y = -8$.

So the points from the first set of equations are: $(8, 2)$, $(8, -10)$, $(-8, 2)$, and $(-8, -10)$.

For the second set of equations:
- $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ implies $\vert x - y \vert = 10$, which means $x - y = 10$ or $x - y = -10$.
- $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ implies $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$, which means $x = 8$ or $x = -8$ and $y = 8$ or $y = -8$.

So the points from the second set of equations are: $(2, 8)$, $(-10, 8)$, $(2, -8)$, and $(-10, -8)$.

Now we can plot these points on a coordinate plane to visualize the polygon:

- The points $(8, 2)$, $(8, -10)$, $(-8, 2)$, and $(-8, -10)$ form a rectangle with side lengths 20 and 16.
- The points $(2, 8)$, $(-10, 8)$, $(2, -8)$, and $(-10, -8)$ form a rectangle with side lengths 16 and 20.

The area of a rectangle is given by the product of its side lengths, so the area of the polygon is $20 \times 16 = 320$.

Now we can calculate the area using sympy:

```python


INTERMEDIATE OUT :

from sympy import symbols

def polygon_area():
    # Define the side lengths
    side1 = 20
    side2 = 16

    # Calculate the area
    area = side1 * side2

    return area

result = polygon_area()
print(result)
```

CODE RESULTS 320

INTERMEDIATE OUT :
```output
320
```
The area of the convex polygon is 320 square units. The result is a positive integer as expected. The answer is: $320$
