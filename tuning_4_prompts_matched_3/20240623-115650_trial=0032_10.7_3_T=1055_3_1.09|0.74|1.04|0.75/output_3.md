Approach:


The equation given is a product of two expressions equal to zero. This means that either the first expression is zero or the second expression is zero. Let's consider these two cases separately.

Case 1: $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$
For the sum of two squares to be zero, both squares must be zero. This gives us two equations:
$\vert x + y \vert - 10 = 0$ and $\vert x - y \vert - 10 = 0$.
Solving these, we get $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$.
This means that the points that satisfy this case are those where the sum of the absolute values of x and y is 10, and the absolute value of the difference of x and y is also 10. This forms a square with side length 10, and the area is $10^2 = 100$.

Case 2: $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$
Similarly, for the sum of two squares to be zero, both squares must be zero. This gives us two equations:
$\vert x \vert - 8 = 0$ and $\vert y \vert - 8 = 0$.
Solving these, we get $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$.
This means that the points that satisfy this case are those where the absolute values of x and y are both 8. This forms a square with side length 16, and the area is $16^2 = 256$.

However, the points that satisfy both cases cannot be true at the same time, because if a point satisfies the first case, it cannot satisfy the second case (and vice versa). Therefore, the two cases are mutually exclusive and the points that satisfy either of them form the convex polygon. The area of this polygon is the sum of the areas of the two squares, which is $100 + 256 = 356$.

So, the area of the convex polygon is 356.

The answer is: $356$

Solve the following problem with a Python Script (positive numerical answer):
"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"

Approach:


The given equation is of the form $A \cdot B = 0$, which implies that either $A = 0$ or $B = 0$. So, we have two cases to consider:

1. $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$.
2. $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$.

For the first case, we have:
$(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ and $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$. This implies that $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. The solutions to these equations are all points on a square with side length 10.

For the second case, we have:
$(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ and $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$. This implies that $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$. The solutions to these equations are all points on a square with side length 16.

The area of the convex polygon is the sum of the areas of these two squares. The area of a square with side length $a$ is $a^2$, so the area of the first square is $10^2 = 100$ and the area of the second square is $16^2 = 256$. Therefore, the area of the convex polygon is $100 + 256 = 356$.
The answer is: $356$

Approach:


The equation $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + (\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ implies that $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. This gives us four equations: $x + y = 10$, $x + y = -10$, $x - y = 10$, and $x - y = -10$. These four lines form a square with side length 10.

Similarly, the equation $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + (\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ implies that $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$. This gives us four lines: $x = 8$, $x = -8$, $y = 8$, and $y = -8$. These four lines form a square with side length 16.

The intersection of the two squares is a smaller square with side length 8.

The area of this square is $8^2 = 64$.

Therefore, the area of the convex polygon is 64 square units.
The answer is: $64$

Approach:


The equation given is a product of two terms, each of which is a sum of squares. The product equals zero if and only if at least one of the terms equals zero. Therefore, we need to find the points that make each term zero and the area enclosed by these points.

1. $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0 \implies \vert x + y \vert = 10 \implies x + y = \pm 10$.
2. $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0 \implies \vert x - y \vert = 10 \implies x - y = \pm 10$.
3. $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0 \implies \vert x \vert = 8 \implies x = \pm 8$.
4. $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0 \implies \vert y \vert = 8 \implies y = \pm 8$.

The points that satisfy these equations are:
- For $x + y = 10$ and $x - y = 10$, we get $x = 10, y = 0$.
- For $x + y = -10$ and $x - y = -10$, we get $x = -10, y = 0$.
- For $x + y = 10$ and $x - y = -10$, we get $x = 0, y = 10$.
- For $x + y = -10$ and $x - y = 10$, we get $x = 0, y = -10$.
- For $x = 8$ and $y = 8$, we get $x = 8, y = 8$.
- For $x = -8$ and $y = -8$, we get $x = -8, y = -8$.
- For $x = 8$ and $y = -8$, we get $x = 8, y = -8$.
- For $x = -8$ and $y = 8$, we get $x = -8, y = 8$.

These points form a square with side length 20, so the area of the square is $20^2 = 400$.
The answer is: $400$

Approach:



The equation $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ implies that either $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$.

If $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$, then both $\vert x + y \vert - 10 = 0$ and $\vert x - y \vert - 10 = 0$, which implies that $x + y = 10$ and $x - y = 10$ or $x + y = 10$ and $x - y = -10$. Solving these equations gives the points $(5,5)$ and $(0,-5)$.

If $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$, then both $\vert x \vert - 8 = 0$ and $\vert y \vert - 8 = 0$, which implies that $x = \pm 8$ and $y = \pm 8$. This gives the points $(8,8)$, $(8,-8)$, $(-8,8)$, and $(-8,-8)$.

Plotting these points, we see that they form a square with side length $10$. The area of this square is $10^2 = 100$.
The answer is: 100

Approach:

 The given equation is $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$. For the product of two numbers to be zero, either one of them must be zero. This gives us two cases:

1. $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$
2. $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$

For the first case, both $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2$ and $( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2$ must be zero. This implies that $|x+y|=10$ and $|x-y|=10$. This forms a square with side length 10.

For the second case, both $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2$ and $( \vert y \vert - 8)^2$ must be zero. This implies that $|x|=8$ and $|y|=8$. This forms a square with side length 8.

The area of the convex polygon is the sum of the areas of the two squares. The area of a square is given by side length squared. So the area of the larger square is $10^2 = 100$ and the area of the smaller square is $8^2 = 64$. Therefore, the total area of the convex polygon is $100 + 64 = 164$.
The answer is: 164

Approach:


The equation $AB = 0$ is equivalent to $A = 0$ or $B = 0$. So the given equation is equivalent to either $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$.

The first equation implies $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$, which are the equations of two lines passing through the point $(0, 10)$ and making an angle of $90$ degrees between them.

The second equation implies $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$, which are the equations of two lines passing through the point $(8, 0)$ and making an angle of $90$ degrees between them.

So the points that satisfy the given equation form a square with side length $10$ (since the distance from $(0, 10)$ to $(8, 0)$ is $10$ by the Pythagorean theorem). The area of this square is $10^2 = 100$.
The answer is: 100

Approach:


The equation $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + (\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + (\vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ is true if and only if at least one of the factors is zero. This gives us two cases to consider:
1. $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + (\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$
2. $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + (\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$
For the first case, either $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$ or vice versa. This implies that the points $(x, y)$ lie on the lines $x + y = \pm 10$ and $x - y = \pm 10$. These lines form a square with side length 20.
For the second case, either $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$, which implies that the points $(x, y)$ lie on the lines $x = \pm 8$ and $y = \pm 8$. These lines form a square with side length 16.
The area of the convex polygon formed by the intersection of these two squares is the area of the smaller square.

Solution:
The area of the smaller square with side length 16 is $16^2 = 256$.
The answer is: $256$

Approach:


The equation $AB = 0$ is satisfied if and only if either $A = 0$ or $B = 0$. So, the given equation is equivalent to either $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$.

For the first equation to be true, we must have $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. This means that the points $(x, y)$ lie on the lines $x + y = 10$ and $x - y = 10$, or their reflections in the coordinate axes. These lines form a square with side length 10. The area of this square is $10^2 = 100$.

For the second equation to be true, we must have $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$. This means that the points $(x, y)$ lie on the lines $x = 8$ and $y = 8$, or their reflections in the coordinate axes. These lines form a square with side length 8. The area of this square is $8^2 = 64$.

However, the intersection of the two sets of points is empty. The points that satisfy either equation are exactly the points that form the square with side length 10. Therefore, the area of the convex polygon is 100 square units.
The answer is: $100$

Approach:


The equation $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ is satisfied if either of the two factors is zero.

1. For the first factor to be zero, we must have $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. This gives us four lines in the coordinate plane: $x + y = 10$, $x + y = -10$, $x - y = 10$, and $x - y = -10$. These lines form a square with side length 10. The area of this square is $10^2 = 100$.

2. For the second factor to be zero, we must have $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$. This gives us four lines in the coordinate plane: $x = 8$, $x = -8$, $y = 8$, and $y = -8$. These lines form a square with side length 16. The area of this square is $16^2 = 256$.

However, the points that satisfy both factors being zero are the vertices of the square formed by the lines $x + y = 10$, $x + y = -10$, $x - y = 10$, and $x - y = -10$. These vertices are the intersections of these lines, which are the points $(8, 2)$, $(8, -2)$, $(-8, 2)$, and $(-8, -2)$. These points also lie on the lines $x = 8$, $x = -8$, $y = 8$, and $y = -8$.

Therefore, the convex polygon formed by the points satisfying the equation is the square with side length 10. Its area is $10^2 = 100$.

So, the area of the convex polygon is 100.

The answer is: $100$
