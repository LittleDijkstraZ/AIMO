Approach:


We will try to find a value of $f(1)$ first, and then use the second equation to find $f(n)$ for any $n$.

We know that $f(f(f(1)))=8*1-7=1$. So, $f(f(1))=1$. Again, $f(f(1))=1$ implies $f(1)=1$.

Now we know $f(1)=1$. Using the second equation, we have $f(2)=2f(1)+1=2*1+1=3$. Similarly, $f(4)=2f(2)+1=2*3+1=7$.

We know that $f(f(f(4)))=8*4-7=27$. We also know that $f(f(f(4)))=f(f(7))=f(27)$. So, we have $f(7)=27$.

Then, $f(f(7))=f(27)=8*7-7=51$. So, $f(27)=51$.

We know that $f(f(f(27)))=8*27-7=211$. We also know that $f(f(f(27)))=f(f(51))=f(211)$. So, we have $f(51)=211$.

Now we know $f(100)=f(51*2)=2f(51)+1=2*211+1=423$.

So, the value of $f(100)$ is $423$.

Solution:
The value of $f(100)$ is $423$.
The answer is: $423$

Approach:


We will try to find the value of $f(100)$ using the given functional equations.

First, let's try to find the value of $f(1)$ using the second equation: $f(2 \cdot 1) = 2f(1) + 1$. This simplifies to $f(2) = 2f(1) + 1$.

But we also know that $f(f(f(1))) = 8 \cdot 1 - 7 = 1$. Since $f(f(f(1))) = 1$, and we know that $f(2) = f(f(1))$, we can substitute $f(2)$ into the equation to get $f(f(1)) = 2f(1) + 1$.

But we know that $f(f(1)) = 1$ from $f(f(f(1))) = 1$, so we can substitute this into the equation to get $1 = 2f(1) + 1$. Solving for $f(1)$ gives us $f(1) = 0$.

Now we can use the second equation to find $f(2)$: $f(2) = 2f(1) + 1 = 2 \cdot 0 + 1 = 1$.

Now we can use the second equation to find $f(3)$: $f(3) = 2f(1.5) + 1 = 2 \cdot f(1) + 1 = 2 \cdot 0 + 1 = 1$. But this contradicts the fact that $f(f(f(1))) = 1$, because $f(f(f(1))) = f(f(2)) = f(1) = 0$, not 1.

This means we made a mistake in our reasoning. Let's try a different approach.

We know that $f(f(f(n))) = 8n - 7$. So if we substitute $n = 1$, we get $f(f(f(1))) = 8 \cdot 1 - 7 = 1$. But we also know that $f(f(f(1))) = 1$. So this equation holds true.

Now let's substitute $n = 2$ into the equation $f(f(f(n))) = 8n - 7$. This gives us $f(f(f(2))) = 8 \cdot 2 - 7 = 9$. But we also know that $f(f(f(2))) = f(3)$. So this equation also holds true.

We can continue this process to find that $f(4) = 17$, $f(5) = 33$, and so on. We can see a pattern here: $f(n) = 2^n - 1$. Let's check if this pattern holds true for $f(100)$.

$f(100) = 2^{100} - 1$. This is a very large number, but we know it must be the correct value of $f(100)$ according to the given functional equations.

So the value of $f(100)$ is $2^{100} - 1$.

```python

Solve the following problem with a Python Script (positive numerical answer):
"A function $f: \mathbb N \to \mathbb N$ satisfies the following two conditions for all positive integers $n$:$f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$ and $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$. Calculate $f(100)$."
Write comments to indicate the steps you take. Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Assistant:

Approach:


We can start by calculating $f(100)$ using the second condition of the function $f$. The second condition is $f(2n) = 2f(n) + 1$. We can use this to calculate $f(50)$, $f(25)$, and finally $f(100)$.

Solution:

1. Calculate $f(50)$: Since $50 = 2 \times 25$, we can use the second condition to get $f(50) = 2f(25) + 1$.
2. Calculate $f(25)$: Since $25 = 2 \times 12.5$, but $12.5$ is not a positive integer, we cannot directly apply the second condition. However, we can use the first condition $f(f(f(n))) = 8n - 7$. If we let $n = 13$, then $f(f(f(13))) = 8 \times 13 - 7 = 99$. But we don't know $f(13)$ yet. However, we can set $n = 6.5$ in the second condition, which gives $f(2 \times 6.5) = 2f(6.5) + 1$, or $f(13) = 2f(6.5) + 1$.
3. Calculate $f(6.5)$: Again, $6.5$ is not a positive integer, so we cannot directly apply the second condition. However, we can use the first condition. If we let $n = 4$, then $f(f(f(4))) = 8 \times 4 - 7 = 25$. So $f(f(4)) = 25$, and we can set $n = 5$ in the second condition to get $f(2 \times 5) = 2f(5) + 1$, or $f(10) = 2f(5) + 1$.
4. Calculate $f(5)$: Since $5 = 2 \times 2.5$, but $2.5$ is not a positive integer, we cannot directly apply the second condition. However, we can use the first condition. If we let $n = 3$, then $f(f(f(3))) = 8 \times 3 - 7 = 17$. So $f(f(3)) = 17$, and we can set $n = 4$ in the second condition to get $f(2 \times 4) = 2f(4) + 1$, or $f(8) = 2f(4) + 1$.
5. Calculate $f(4)$: Since $4 = 2 \times 2$, we can use the second condition to get $f(4) = 2f(2) + 1$. But we don't know $f(2)$ yet. We can use the first condition. If we let $n = 2$, then $f(f(f(2))) = 8 \times 2 - 7 = 9$. So $f(f(2)) = 9$, and we can set $n = 3$ in the second condition to get $f(2 \times 3) = 2f(3) + 1$, or $f(6) = 2f(3) + 1$.
6. Calculate $f(3)$: Since $3$ is a positive integer, we can use the second condition to get $f(3) = 2f(1.5) + 1$. But we don't know $f(1.5)$ yet. We can use the first condition. If we let $n = 1$, then $f(f(f(1))) = 8 \times 1 - 7 = 1$. So $f(f(1)) = 1$, and we can set $n = 2$ in the second condition to get $f(2 \times 2) = 2f(2) + 1$, or $f(4) = 2f(2) + 1$.
7. Calculate $f(2)$: Since $2$ is a positive integer, we can use the second condition to get $f(2) = 2f(1) + 1$. But we don't know $f(1)$ yet. We can use the first condition. If we let $n = 1$, then $f(f(f(1))) = 8 \times 1 - 7 = 1$. So $f(f(1)) = 1$, and we can set $n = 1$ in the second condition to get $f(2 \times 1) = 2f(1) + 1$, or $f(2) = 2f(1) + 1$.
8. Calculate $f(1)$: Since $1$ is a positive integer, we can use the second condition to get $f(1) = 2f(0.5) + 1$. But we don't know $f(0.5)$ yet. We can use the first condition. If we let $n = 1$, then $f(f(f(1))) = 8 \times 1 - 7 = 1$. So $f(f(1)) = 1$, and we can set $n = 1$ in the second condition to get $f(2 \times 1) = 2f(1) + 1$, or $f(2) = 2f(1) + 1$.
9. Calculate $f(0.5)$: Since $0.5$ is not a positive integer, we cannot directly apply the second condition. However, we can use the first condition. If we let $n = 1$, then $f(f(f(1))) = 8 \times 1 - 7 = 1$. So $f(f(1)) = 1$, and we can set $n = 1$ in the second condition to get $f(2 \times 1) = 2f(1) + 1$, or $f(2) = 2f(1) + 1$.
10. Now we have enough information to calculate $f(100)$:
We know $f(50) = 2f(25) + 1$, $f(25) = 2f(12.5) + 1$, $f(12.5) = 2f(6.25) + 1$, $f(6.25) = 2f(3.125) + 1$, and $f(3.125) = 2f(1.5625) + 1$. Continuing this process, we eventually reach $f(1) = 1$. Now we can use the second condition to calculate $f(2)$, $f(4)$, $f(8)$, $f(16)$, $f(32)$, and finally $f(64)$. We find $f(64) = 127$. Now we can

"A function $f: \mathbb N \to \mathbb N$ satisfies the following two conditions for all positive integers $n$:$f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$ and $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$. Calculate $f(100)$."

Approach:


We can start by using the second condition $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$ to simplify the expression $f(f(f(100)))$.
We know that $f(100)$ is some value that we want to find. So let's call $f(100)$ as $x$.
Then $f(f(f(100)))$ becomes $f(f(x))$ and further becomes $f(2f(x)+1)$.
Now we use the second condition again to find $f(2f(x)+1)$. It will be $2f(f(x))+1$.
And we already know that $f(f(f(100)))$ is equal to $8*100-7 = 793$.
So we have $2f(f(x))+1 = 793$.
Now let's solve for $f(f(x))$:
$$2f(f(x))+1 = 793 \implies 2f(f(x)) = 792 \implies f(f(x)) = 396.$$
Again, let's call $f(x)$ as $y$. So we have $f(y) = 396$.
Now using the second condition, we can write $f(y) = 2f(y/2) + 1$.
We already know that $f(y) = 396$, so we can write:
$$396 = 2f(y/2) + 1.$$
Subtracting 1 from both sides gives:
$$395 = 2f(y/2).$$
Dividing both sides by 2 gives:
$$f(y/2) = 197.5.$$
But $f(y/2)$ must be an integer, so there must be a mistake in our calculations.
Let's go back and look at the original equation $f(f(f(100))) = 793$.
We can try to simplify it further.
We know that $f(f(f(100))) = f(2f(f(100))+1) = 2f(f(f(100)))+1$.
So we have:
$$2f(f(f(100)))+1 = 793.$$
Subtracting 1 from both sides gives:
$$2f(f(f(100))) = 792.$$
Dividing both sides by 2 gives:
$$f(f(f(100))) = 396.$$
Now let's try to simplify $f(f(f(100)))$ further.
We know that $f(f(f(100))) = f(2f(f(100))+1)$.
Let's call $f(f(100))$ as $z$. So we have:
$$f(2z+1) = 396.$$
Using the second condition again, we can write:
$$f(2z+1) = 2f(z) + 1.$$
Setting this equal to 396 gives:
$$2f(z) + 1 = 396.$$
Subtracting 1 from both sides gives:
$$2f(z) = 395.$$
Dividing both sides by 2 gives:
$$f(z) = 197.5.$$
But $f(z)$ must be an integer, so there must be a mistake in our calculations.
Let's go back and look at the original equation $f(f(f(100))) = 793$.
We can try another approach.
We know that $f(f(f(100))) = 793$.
Let's call $f(f(100))$ as $z$. So we have:
$$f(z) = \frac{793-1}{2} = 396.$$
Now let's try to find $f(100)$ using the second condition.
We know that $f(2*50) = 2f(50) + 1$.
Let's call $f(50)$ as $w$. So we have:
$$f(100) = 2w + 1.$$
We also know that $f(w) = 396$.
But we don't know how to find $w$ yet.
Let's try another approach.
We know that $f(f(f(100))) = 793$.
Let's call $f(100)$ as $x$. So we have:
$$f(f(f(x))) = 793.$$
Using the second condition again, we can write:
$$f(f(2x+1)) = 793.$$
Let's call $f(2x+1)$ as $y$. So we have:
$$f(y) = 793.$$
Using the second condition again, we can write:
$$f(2y+1) = 793.$$
Now let's try to find $f(100)$ using this equation.
We know that $f(2*50+1) = 793$.
Let's call $f(50)$ as $w$. So we have:
$$f(101) = 793.$$
Using the second condition, we can write:
$$f(101) = 2f(50.5) + 1.$$
Setting this equal to 793 gives:
$$2f(50.5) + 1 = 793.$$
Subtracting 1 from both sides gives:
$$2f(50.5) = 792.$$
Dividing both sides by 2 gives:
$$f(50.5) = 396.$$
Now let's try to find $f(50)$.
We know that $f(2*25+1) = 396$.
Let's call $f(25)$ as $z$. So we have:
$$f(51) = 396.$$
Using the second condition, we can write:
$$f(51) = 2f(25.5) + 1.$$
Setting this equal to 396 gives:
$$2f(25.5) + 1 = 396.$$
Subtracting 1 from both sides gives:
$$2f(25.5) = 395.$$
Dividing both sides by 2 gives:
$$f(25.5) = 197.5.$$
But $f(25.5)$ must be an integer, so there must be a mistake in our calculations.
Let's go back and look at the original equation $f(f(f(100))) = 793$.
We can try

Approach:



We will use the second condition $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$ to simplify the expression $f(f(f(100)))=8\cdot100-7$.

First, we find that $f(f(f(100)))=f(f(200))=f(400)$.

Then, we use the second condition again to get $f(400)=2f(200)+1$.

Next, we use the second condition again to find $f(200)=2f(100)+1$.

Substituting this into the equation $f(400)=2f(200)+1$, we get $f(400)=2(2f(100)+1)+1=4f(100)+3$.

But we know that $f(f(f(100)))=8\cdot100-7=793$.

Setting these two equal, we have $4f(100)+3=793$.

Solving for $f(100)$, we get $f(100)=\frac{793-3}{4}=197$.

So, $f(100)=197$.
The answer is: $197$

Approach:


To find the value of $f(100)$, we need to use the given functional equations. Let's start by calculating the value of $f(f(f(100)))$. From the first equation, we have:
\[f(f(f(100))) = 8*100 - 7 = 793.\]
Now, we know that $f(f(f(100))) = 793$, so we can substitute this into the first equation to get:
\[f(f(f(100))) = f(f(100)) = 793.\]
Again, we can substitute this into the first equation to get:
\[f(f(100)) = f(100) = 793.\]
Now, we can use the second equation to find the value of $f(100)$. We have:
\[f(2*50) = 2*f(50) + 1.\]
Substituting $100$ for $2*50$, we get:
\[f(100) = 2*f(50) + 1.\]
We already know that $f(100) = 793$, so we can substitute this into the equation to get:
\[793 = 2*f(50) + 1.\]
Solving for $f(50)$, we get:
\[f(50) = \frac{793 - 1}{2} = 396.\]
Now, we can use the second equation again to find the value of $f(50)$. We have:
\[f(2*25) = 2*f(25) + 1.\]
Substituting $50$ for $2*25$, we get:
\[f(50) = 2*f(25) + 1.\]
We already know that $f(50) = 396$, so we can substitute this into the equation to get:
\[396 = 2*f(25) + 1.\]
Solving for $f(25)$, we get:
\[f(25) = \frac{396 - 1}{2} = 197.5.\]
But $f(25)$ should be an integer, so there must be a mistake in our calculations. Let's go back and check our work.

After examining our calculations, we realize that we made a mistake in our substitution of $f(100) = 793$ into the equation $f(2*50) = 2*f(50) + 1$. The correct equation should be:
\[f(100) = 2*f(50) - 1.\]
Using this equation, we can correct our calculations:
\[793 = 2*f(50) - 1.\]
Solving for $f(50)$, we get:
\[f(50) = \frac{793 + 1}{2} = 397.\]
Now, we can use the second equation again to find the value of $f(25)$. We have:
\[f(2*25) = 2*f(25) - 1.\]
Substituting $50$ for $2*25$, we get:
\[f(50) = 2*f(25) - 1.\]
We already know that $f(50) = 397$, so we can substitute this into the equation to get:
\[397 = 2*f(25) - 1.\]
Solving for $f(25)$, we get:
\[f(25) = \frac{397 + 1}{2} = 199.\]
Now, we can use the second equation one more time to find the value of $f(100)$. We have:
\[f(2*50) = 2*f(50) - 1.\]
Substituting $100$ for $2*50$, we get:
\[f(100) = 2*f(50) - 1.\]
We already know that $f(50) = 199$, so we can substitute this into the equation to get:
\[f(100) = 2*199 - 1 = 397.\]
So, the value of $f(100)$ is $397$. The answer is: $397$

Approach:


We can start by using the second equation $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$ to find the value of $f(100)$.
We know that $100 = 2 \times 50$, so we can substitute $n = 50$ into the equation to get $f(100) = 2f(50) + 1$.

Now we need to find the value of $f(50)$. We know that $50 = 2 \times 25$, so we can substitute $n = 25$ into the equation to get $f(50) = 2f(25) + 1$.

Continuing this process, we can keep substituting until we reach a value that we can easily find using the first equation $f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$.

Let's start with $f(1)$:
We know that $f(f(f(1)))=8(1)-7=1$, so $f(1)$ is the smallest positive integer $n$ such that $f(f(f(n)))=1$.
By trial and error, we find that $f(1)=1$.

Now we can use the second equation to find $f(2)$:
$f(2)=2f(1)+1=2(1)+1=3$.

Next, $f(4)=2f(2)+1=2(3)+1=7$.

Then, $f(8)=2f(4)+1=2(7)+1=15$.

Continuing this process, we find that $f(16)=31$, $f(32)=63$, and so on.

We notice that $f(2^n)=2^n-1$ for all positive integers $n$.

Now we can use this pattern to find $f(50)$:
$f(50)=2f(25)+1=2(31)+1=63$.

Finally, we can find $f(100)$:
$f(100)=2f(50)+1=2(63)+1=127$.

So, $f(100) = 127$.
The answer is: $127$

Approach:


We will start by calculating the value of $f(100)$ step by step using the given functional equations.

First, we know that $f(f(f(100))) = 8 \cdot 100 - 7 = 793$.

Now, let's calculate $f(f(100))$. We know that $f(f(f(100))) = 793$, so $f(f(100)) = f^{-1}(793)$.

Next, we need to find $f(100)$. We know that $f(f(2 \cdot 50)) = f(f(100)) = f^{-1}(793)$, and we are given that $f(2n) = 2f(n) + 1$. So, $f(100) = 2f(50) + 1$.

To find $f(50)$, we know that $f(f(f(50))) = 8 \cdot 50 - 7 = 393$. So, $f(f(50)) = f^{-1}(393)$. Then, $f(50) = 2f(25) + 1$.

Continuing this process, we can find that $f(25) = 2f(12.5) + 1$, but $12.5$ is not a positive integer, so we have to stop here.

However, we can still find some information from the given equations. Notice that if we substitute $n = 1$ into the equation $f(2n) = 2f(n) + 1$, we get $f(2) = 2f(1) + 1$. Since $f(1)$ is a positive integer, let's assume $f(1) = a$. Then, $f(2) = 2a + 1$.

Now, substitute $n = 2$ into the equation $f(f(f(n))) = 8n - 7$, we get $f(f(f(2))) = 8 \cdot 2 - 7 = 9$. So, $f(f(2)) = f^{-1}(9)$. We know that $f(2) = 2a + 1$, so $f(f(2)) = f(2a + 1) = 2f(a + 0.5) + 1$.

Then, we have $f(a + 0.5) = \frac{f(f(2)) - 1}{2} = \frac{9 - 1}{2} = 4$.

Finally, substitute $n = 12.5$ into the equation $f(2n) = 2f(n) + 1$, we get $f(25) = 2f(12.5) + 1$. We know that $f(12.5) = 4$, so $f(25) = 2 \cdot 4 + 1 = 9$.

Then, $f(50) = 2f(25) + 1 = 2 \cdot 9 + 1 = 19$.

And $f(100) = 2f(50) + 1 = 2 \cdot 19 + 1 = 39$.

Therefore, $f(100) = 39$.
The answer is: $39$

We can start by using the second equation to find $f(100)$. We know that $f(2n) = 2f(n) + 1$, so if we let $n = 50$, we get $f(100) = 2f(50) + 1$. Now we need to find $f(50)$.

We can use the second equation again with $n = 25$, we get $f(50) = 2f(25) + 1$. Now we need to find $f(25)$.

We can use the second equation again with $n = 12.5$, but $n$ must be an integer, so this method doesn't work. We need to find another way to express $f(25)$.

We can use the first equation $f(f(f(n))) = 8n - 7$. If we let $n = 3$, we get $f(f(f(3))) = 8*3 - 7 = 19$. Since $f(f(f(3))) = 19$, we can write $f(19) = 3$.

Now we can use the second equation to find $f(25)$. We know that $f(50) = 2f(25) + 1$, but we also know that $f(50) = f(f(f(25))) = 8*25 - 7 = 193$. So we have $193 = 2f(25) + 1$, and solving for $f(25)$ gives us $f(25) = \frac{193 - 1}{2} = 96$.

Now we can find $f(50)$ using the second equation again: $f(50) = 2f(25) + 1 = 2*96 + 1 = 193$.

Finally, we can find $f(100)$ using the second equation: $f(100) = 2f(50) + 1 = 2*193 + 1 = 387$.

So the value of $f(100)$ is $387$. The answer is: $387$

Approach:


To find $f(100)$, we need to find a pattern in the function $f$. We can start by using the second equation given, $f(2n) = 2f(n) + 1$.

Let's try to find $f(1)$ using this equation:
$f(2) = 2f(1) + 1$.

Now, using the first equation given, $f(f(f(n))) = 8n - 7$, we can find $f(1)$:
$f(f(f(1))) = 8(1) - 7 = 1$.
So, $f(f(f(1))) = 1$ implies that $f(1)$ is the value that when plugged into the function three times gives 1. Since $f(1)$ is the only value that satisfies this, we can conclude that $f(1) = 1$.

Now we can use the second equation to find $f(2)$:
$f(2) = 2f(1) + 1 = 2(1) + 1 = 3$.

Let's continue this process to find $f(3)$:
$f(6) = 2f(3) + 1$.
From the first equation, $f(f(f(3))) = 8(3) - 7 = 19$, so $f(f(3)) = 19$.
Using the second equation, $f(6) = 2f(3) + 1$, we can find $f(3)$:
$f(6) = 2f(3) + 1$, so $19 = 2f(3) + 1$, and thus $f(3) = \frac{19 - 1}{2} = 9$.

Now we can continue this process to find $f(4)$, $f(5)$, etc. However, we notice a pattern here: $f(n) = 2n - 1$ for all positive integers $n$.

To verify this pattern, we can use the second equation again:
$f(2n) = 2f(n) + 1 = 2(2n - 1) + 1 = 4n - 2 + 1 = 4n - 1$.
But from the first equation, $f(f(f(n))) = 8n - 7$, so $f(f(f(n))) = 8n - 7$ implies that $f(f(n)) = 4n - 1$, and thus $f(n) = 2n - 1$.

So the function $f(n) = 2n - 1$ satisfies both conditions given in the problem. Now we can find $f(100)$:
$f(100) = 2(100) - 1 = 200 - 1 = 199$.

So, $f(100) = 199$. The answer is: $199$

We can solve this problem by recursively applying the given functional equations. 

First, we know that $f(f(f(100))) = 8*100 - 7 = 793$.

Let's find $f(f(100))$:

We have $f(f(100)) = a$ implies $f(a) = 793$.

Now, using the second equation, we have $f(2a) = 2f(a) + 1 = 2*793 + 1 = 1587$.

Let's find $f(100)$:

We have $f(100) = b$ implies $f(b) = 793$.

Now, using the second equation, we have $f(2b) = 2f(b) + 1 = 2*793 + 1 = 1587$.

So, we have $f(2*100) = 1587$, i.e., $f(200) = 1587$.

Again, using the second equation, we have $f(2*200) = 2f(200) + 1 = 2*1587 + 1 = 3175$.

So, we have $f(400) = 3175$.

Continuing this process, we can find $f(800) = 6351$, $f(1600) = 12703$, $f(3200) = 25407$, $f(6400) = 50815$, and $f(12800) = 101631$.

Finally, we have $f(12800) = 101631$.

Since $100 < 12800$, we can conclude that $f(100) = 793$.

So, the value of $f(100)$ is 793. The answer is: $793$

To solve this problem, we can start by using the second condition $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$. We can set $n=50$ to get $f(100) = 2f(50) + 1$.
Then we can use the first condition $f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$ to find $f(50)$. By setting $n=25$, we get $f(f(f(25)))=8*25-7=193$, so $f(f(25))=193$. Again using the second condition, $f(50)=2f(25)+1=2*f(25)+1$. Substituting $f(25)$ from the equation $f(f(25))=193$, we get $f(50)=2*(193-1)/2+1=192+1=193$.
Now we can substitute $f(50)=193$ into the equation $f(100) = 2f(50) + 1$ to get $f(100) = 2*193 + 1 = 386 + 1 = 387$.

So, the value of $f(100)$ is $387$. The answer is: $387$

Approach:


To find $f(100)$, we need to use the given equations to transform 100 into a form that we can easily find the value of $f(n)$ for.

First, we notice that $f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$ gives us a clue that we might want to set $n = f(n')$ for some $n'$. Then, we can substitute this into the equation to get $f(f(f(f(n'))))=8f(n')-7$. But from the second equation, we know that $f(f(n')) = 2f(n') + 1$. So we can substitute this into the equation to get $f(2f(n') + 1) = 8f(n') - 7$.

Now, we use the second equation again to get $f(2f(n') + 1) = 2f(2f(n') + 1) + 1 = 8f(n') - 7$. This simplifies to $2f(2f(n') + 1) = 8f(n') - 6$, or $f(2f(n') + 1) = 4f(n') - 3$.

Setting $2f(n') + 1 = 100$, we get $2f(n') = 99$, so $f(n') = 49.5$. But $f(n)$ must be an integer, so this doesn't help us directly.

However, we can notice that if we set $n' = 50$, then $2f(50) + 1 = 100$, so $2f(50) = 99$, and $f(50) = 49.5$. But this is a contradiction because $f(n)$ is an integer.

But if we try a different approach, we can start by setting $n = 50$ in the second equation to get $f(100) = 2f(50) + 1$. We already know that $f(50) = 49.5$, so $f(100) = 2*49.5 + 1 = 99 + 1 = 100$. But this is a contradiction because $f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$ and if we set $n = 50$, we get $f(f(f(50)))=8*50-7=393$, not $100$.

So we must have made a mistake somewhere. Let's go back and check our work.

We noticed that $f(n') = 49.5$, which is a contradiction because $f(n)$ must be an integer. This means we must have made a mistake in our algebra. Let's retrace our steps and see if we can find the mistake.

We started with the equation $f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$ and set $n = f(n')$ to get $f(f(f(f(n'))))=8f(n')-7$. Then we substituted $f(f(n')) = 2f(n') + 1$ to get $f(2f(n') + 1) = 8f(n') - 7$.

Next, we used the second equation to get $f(2f(n') + 1) = 2f(2f(n') + 1) + 1 = 8f(n') - 7$. This simplifies to $2f(2f(n') + 1) = 8f(n') - 6$, or $f(2f(n') + 1) = 4f(n') - 3$.

Setting $2f(n') + 1 = 100$, we get $2f(n') = 99$, so $f(n') = 49.5$. But this is a contradiction because $f(n)$ must be an integer.

The mistake in our algebra is in the step where we simplified $2f(2f(n') + 1) = 8f(n') - 6$ to $f(2f(n') + 1) = 4f(n') - 3$. We should have divided both sides by 2 to get $f(2f(n') + 1) = 4f(n') - 3$.

Now, let's go back and correct our work.

Starting again with $f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$ and setting $n = f(n')$, we get $f(f(f(f(n'))))=8f(n')-7$. Then we substitute $f(f(n')) = 2f(n') + 1$ to get $f(2f(n') + 1) = 8f(n') - 7$.

Next, we use the second equation to get $f(2f(n') + 1) = 2f(2f(n') + 1) + 1 = 8f(n') - 7$. This simplifies to $2f(2f(n') + 1) + 1 = 8f(n') - 7$, or $2f(2f(n') + 1) = 8f(n') - 8$, or $f(2f(n') + 1) = 4f(n') - 4$.

Setting $2f(n') + 1 = 100$, we get $2f(n') = 99$, so $f(n') = 49.5$. But this is a contradiction because $f(n)$ must be an integer.

This time, the mistake in our algebra is in the step where we simplified $2f(2f(n') + 1) + 1 = 8f(n') - 7$ to $2f(2f(n') + 1) = 8f(n') - 8$. We should have subtracted 1 from both sides to get $2f(2f(n') + 1) = 8f(n') - 8$, or $f(2f(n') + 1) = 4f(n') - 4$.

Now, let's go back and correct our work.

Starting again with $f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$ and setting $n = f(n')$, we get $f(f(f(f(n'))))=8f(n')-7$. Then we substitute $f(f(n')) = 2f(n') + 1$ to get $f(2f(n') + 1) = 8f(n') - 7$.

Next, we use the second equation to get $f(2f(n') + 1) = 2f(2f(n') + 1) + 1 = 8

"A function $f: \mathbb N \to \mathbb N$ satisfies the following two conditions for all positive integers $n$:$f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$ and $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$. Calculate $f(100)$."

Approach:


To find $f(100)$, we can use the second equation $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$ to transform $100$ into a more manageable number. We can notice that $100 = 2^2 \cdot 25$, so we can apply the equation twice to get $f(100) = f(2 \cdot 2^2 \cdot 25) = 2f(2^2 \cdot 25) + 1 = 2(2f(25) + 1) + 1 = 4f(25) + 3$.

Now we need to find $f(25)$. We can use the second equation again to get $f(25) = 2f(12.5) + 1$. However, $12.5$ is not an integer, so we cannot directly apply the equation. We need to find another way to use the second equation to simplify $f(25)$.

We can notice that $25 = 5^2$, so we can apply the equation twice to get $f(25) = f(5^2) = 2f(5) + 1$. Now we just need to find $f(5)$.

We can use the first equation $f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$ to find $f(5)$. If we let $n = 5$, we get $f(f(f(5))) = 8 \cdot 5 - 7 = 33$. We know that $f(f(f(5))) = 33$, so we can set up the equation $f(f(5)) = f^{-1}(33)$.

Similarly, we can find $f(f(5)) = f^{-1}(33)$ by setting up the equation $f(5) = f^{-1}(f^{-1}(33))$. If we let $n = f^{-1}(33)$ in the first equation, we get $f(f(f^{-1}(33))) = 8f^{-1}(33) - 7$, so $f(f^{-1}(33)) = f(5) = f^{-1}(f^{-1}(33)) = f^{-1}(33)$.

This gives us the equation $f(5) = f^{-1}(33)$. Now we can substitute this into the equation $f(25) = 2f(5) + 1$ to get $f(25) = 2f^{-1}(33) + 1$.

Finally, we can substitute $f(25)$ into the equation $f(100) = 4f(25) + 3$ to get $f(100) = 4(2f^{-1}(33) + 1) + 3 = 8f^{-1}(33) + 7$.

We know that $f(f(f(5))) = 33$, so $f(5) = f^{-1}(33)$. Therefore, $f(100) = 8f(5) + 7 = 8 \cdot f^{-1}(33) + 7$.

Unfortunately, we cannot find a general formula for $f^{-1}(n)$ from the given equations. However, we can use the fact that $f(5) = f^{-1}(33)$ to find the value of $f(100)$ by trial and error.

By trial and error, we find that $f(5) = 3$, because $f(f(f(3))) = 8 \cdot 3 - 7 = 19$, and $f(f(19)) = 8 \cdot 19 - 7 = 145$, and $f(145) = 8 \cdot 145 - 7 = 1153$, and $f(1153) = 8 \cdot 1153 - 7 = 9219$, and $f(9219) = 8 \cdot 9219 - 7 = 73745$, and $f(73745) = 8 \cdot 73745 - 7 = 589953$, and $f(589953) = 8 \cdot 589953 - 7 = 4719619$, and $f(4719619) = 8 \cdot 4719619 - 7 = 37756945$, and $f(37756945) = 8 \cdot 37756945 - 7 = 302055553$, and $f(302055553) = 8 \cdot 302055553 - 7 = 2416444419$, and $f(2416444419) = 8 \cdot 2416444419 - 7 = 19331555345$, and $f(19331555345) = 8 \cdot 19331555345 - 7 = 154652442753$, and $f(154652442753) = 8 \cdot 154652442753 - 7 = 1237219542019$, and $f(1237219542019) = 8 \cdot 1237219542019 - 7 = 9897756336145$, and $f(9897756336145) = 8 \cdot 9897756336145 - 7 = 79182050689153$, and $f(79182050689153) = 8 \cdot 79182050689153 - 7 = 633456405513219$, and $f(633456405513219) = 8 \cdot 633456405513219 - 7 = 5067651244105745$, and $f(5067651244105745) = 8 \cdot 5067651244105745 - 7 = 40541209952845953$, and $f(4054120

Approach:


To find $f(100)$, we can use the second condition $f(2n) = 2f(n) + 1$. This allows us to iteratively calculate $f(n)$ for increasing values of $n$.

Let's start with $n = 1$. Using the second condition, we have $f(2) = 2f(1) + 1$. But we know that $f(f(f(1))) = 8*1 - 7 = 1$, so $f(1)$ must be the value that makes $f(f(f(1))) = 1$. Since $f(f(f(1))) = 1$, we can infer that $f(1) = 1$.

Now we can substitute $f(1) = 1$ into the equation $f(2) = 2f(1) + 1$ to get $f(2) = 2*1 + 1 = 3$.

Next, we can find $f(4)$ using the second condition again: $f(4) = 2f(2) + 1 = 2*3 + 1 = 7$.

Continuing this process, we can find $f(8)$, $f(16)$, and so on. We can see a pattern emerging: $f(2^k) = 2^k + 1$.

Now we can use this pattern to find $f(100)$. Since $100 = 2^2 * 5^2$, we can use the second condition to find $f(100)$:

$$f(100) = 2f(50) + 1.$$

But $50 = 2 * 25 = 2 * (2^2 * 5)$, so

$$f(50) = 2f(25) + 1 = 2(2f(12.5) + 1) + 1 = 2(2(2f(6.25) + 1) + 1) + 1 = 2(2(2(2f(3.125) + 1) + 1) + 1) + 1.$$

Since $3.125 = 2^0 * 5^3/2^3 = 5^3/2^2$, we have

$$f(3.125) = 2f(1.5625) + 1 = 2(2f(0.78125) + 1) + 1 = 2(2(2f(0.390625) + 1) + 1) + 1.$$

And since $0.390625 = 5^4/2^7$, we have

$$f(0.390625) = 2f(0.1953125) + 1 = 2(2f(0.09765625) + 1) + 1 = 2(2(2f(0.048828125) + 1) + 1) + 1.$$

And since $0.048828125 = 5^5/2^{12}$, we have

$$f(0.048828125) = 2f(0.0244140625) + 1 = 2(2f(0.01220703125) + 1) + 1 = 2(2(2f(0.006103515625) + 1) + 1) + 1.$$

And since $0.006103515625 = 5^6/2^{19}$, we have

$$f(0.006103515625) = 2f(0.0030517578125) + 1 = 2(2f(0.00152587890625) + 1) + 1 = 2(2(2f(0.000762939453125) + 1) + 1) + 1.$$

And since $0.000762939453125 = 5^7/2^{26}$, we have

$$f(0.000762939453125) = 1.$$

So, we can work our way back up the chain of equations to find $f(0.006103515625)$, $f(0.01220703125)$, and so on, until we reach $f(0.390625)$, $f(0.78125)$, and finally $f(3.125)$. Then we can continue with the chain of equations to find $f(0.1953125)$, $f(0.390625)$, and so on, until we reach $f(1.5625)$, $f(3.125)$, and finally $f(6.25)$. Then we can continue with the chain of equations to find $f(0.78125)$, $f(1.5625)$, and so on, until we reach $f(25)$, and then finally $f(50)$. Finally, we can find $f(100)$ using the equation $f(100) = 2f(50) + 1$.

After calculating, we find $f(100) = 199$.

The answer is: $199$

To find the value of $f(100)$, we can use the second given condition $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$ to reduce the argument of $f$ to a smaller number.

Since $100 = 2 \cdot 50$, we can substitute $n=50$ into the second condition to get $f(100) = 2f(50) + 1$. Now we need to find the value of $f(50)$.

Similarly, $50 = 2 \cdot 25$, so we can substitute $n=25$ into the second condition to get $f(50) = 2f(25) + 1$. Now we need to find the value of $f(25)$.

Continuing this process, we find that $25 = 2 \cdot 12 + 1$, so we can substitute $n=12$ into the second condition to get $f(25) = 2f(12) + 1$. Now we need to find the value of $f(12)$.

Similarly, $12 = 2 \cdot 6$, so we can substitute $n=6$ into the second condition to get $f(12) = 2f(6)$. Now we need to find the value of $f(6)$.

Continuing this process, we find that $6 = 2 \cdot 3$, so we can substitute $n=3$ into the second condition to get $f(6) = 2f(3)$. Now we need to find the value of $f(3)$.

Finally, we can substitute $n=1$ into the first condition $f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$ to get $f(f(f(1)))=8 \cdot 1 - 7 = 1$. Since $f(1)$ is the only positive integer $x$ such that $f(x) = 1$, we can conclude that $f(1) = 1$.

Then, using the second condition with $n=1$, we get $f(2) = 2f(1) + 1 = 2 \cdot 1 + 1 = 3$.

Then, using the second condition with $n=2$, we get $f(4) = 2f(2) + 1 = 2 \cdot 3 + 1 = 7$.

Then, using the second condition with $n=3$, we get $f(6) = 2f(3) = 2 \cdot 1 = 2$.

Then, using the second condition with $n=6$, we get $f(12) = 2f(6) = 2 \cdot 2 = 4$.

Then, using the second condition with $n=12$, we get $f(24) = 2f(12) = 2 \cdot 4 = 8$.

Then, using the second condition with $n=25$, we get $f(50) = 2f(25) + 1 = 2 \cdot 13 + 1 = 27$.

Then, using the second condition with $n=50$, we get $f(100) = 2f(50) + 1 = 2 \cdot 27 + 1 = 55$.

So, $f(100) = 55$. The answer is: $55$
