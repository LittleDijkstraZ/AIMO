Approach:



First, let's understand the equation \[\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}.\]

This equation has 4 distinct solutions, which means the right-hand side, $\frac{m}{100}$, must be equal to 2. This is because the absolute value function $|\cdot|$ has a value of 2 at 4 points, and the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ will have 4 distinct solutions when $\frac{m}{100}=2$.

Solving the equation $\frac{m}{100}=2$ for $m$ gives $m=200$.

So, the only positive integer $m$ that makes the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ have 4 distinct solutions is $m=200$.
The answer is: $1$

Approach:


We want to find the number of positive integers $m$ such that the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has $4$ distinct solutions.
This equation represents a piecewise function with four cases to consider, based on the absolute value inside the absolute value.
We will solve each case and find the corresponding value of $m$.

Case 1: $x-1 \ge 2$, so $x \ge 3$. The equation becomes $\vert x-3 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$.
This gives two sub-cases:
Case 1.1: $x-3 \ge 0$, so $x \ge 3$. The equation becomes $x-3=\frac{m}{100}$, or $x=3+\frac{m}{100}$.
Case 1.2: $x-3 < 0$, so $x < 3$. The equation becomes $-(x-3)=\frac{m}{100}$, or $x=3-\frac{m}{100}$.
For this case, we want the two solutions to be distinct, which means $3+\frac{m}{100} > 3-\frac{m}{100}$, or $\frac{m}{100} > -\frac{m}{100}$. This implies $m > 0$.

Case 2: $1 \le x-1 < 2$, so $1 \le x < 3$. The equation becomes $\vert -(x-3)-2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$, or $\vert -x+1 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$.
This gives two sub-cases:
Case 2.1: $-x+1 \ge 0$, so $x \le 1$. The equation becomes $-x+1=\frac{m}{100}$, or $x=1-\frac{m}{100}$.
Case 2.2: $-x+1 < 0$, so $x > 1$. The equation becomes $-( -x+1 )=\frac{m}{100}$, or $x=1+\frac{m}{100}$.
For this case, we want the two solutions to be distinct, which means $1-\frac{m}{100} < 1+\frac{m}{100}$, or $-\frac{m}{100} < \frac{m}{100}$. This implies $m > 0$.

Case 3: $x-1 < 1$, so $x < 2$. The equation becomes $\vert -(x-1)-2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$, or $\vert -x-1 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$.
This gives two sub-cases:
Case 3.1: $-x-1 \ge 0$, so $x \le -1$. The equation becomes $-x-1=\frac{m}{100}$, or $x=-1-\frac{m}{100}$.
Case 3.2: $-x-1 < 0$, so $x > -1$. The equation becomes $-( -x-1 )=\frac{m}{100}$, or $x=-1+\frac{m}{100}$.
For this case, we want the two solutions to be distinct, which means $-1-\frac{m}{100} < -1+\frac{m}{100}$, or $-\frac{m}{100} < \frac{m}{100}$. This implies $m > 0$.

Case 4: $x-1 \le 0$, so $x \le 1$. The equation becomes $\vert -(x-1)-2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$, or $\vert -x-1 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$.
This gives two sub-cases:
Case 4.1: $-x-1 \ge 0$, so $x \le -1$. The equation becomes $-x-1=\frac{m}{100}$, or $x=-1-\frac{m}{100}$.
Case 4.2: $-x-1 < 0$, so $x > -1$. The equation becomes $-( -x-1 )=\frac{m}{100}$, or $x=-1+\frac{m}{100}$.
For this case, we want the two solutions to be distinct, which means $-1-\frac{m}{100} < -1+\frac{m}{100}$, or $-\frac{m}{100} < \frac{m}{100}$. This implies $m > 0$.

From the above analysis, we see that for each case, the value of $m$ must be positive. Therefore, the number of positive integers $m$ that satisfy the equation is the number of positive integers $m$ such that the equation has 4 distinct solutions.
By checking the value of $m$ for each case, we find that the possible values of $m$ are $1, 2, 3, ..., 100$. Therefore, the number of positive integers $m$ is $100$. The answer is: $\boxed{100}$

Solve the following problem with a Python Script (positive numerical answer):
"For how many positive integers $m$ does the equation \[\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}\] have $4$ distinct solutions?"

Approach:


The given equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has 4 distinct solutions. This means that the expression inside the absolute value, $\vert x-1 \vert -2$, will be equal to $\frac{m}{100}$, $-\frac{m}{100}$, $\frac{m}{100}$ and $-\frac{m}{100}$ in four different cases.

Let's consider each case:

1. $\vert x-1 \vert -2 = \frac{m}{100}$:
   Adding 2 to both sides gives $\vert x-1 \vert = \frac{m}{100} + 2$.
   This equation will have two solutions if $\frac{m}{100} + 2 > 0$, i.e., $m > -200$.

2. $\vert x-1 \vert -2 = -\frac{m}{100}$:
   Adding 2 to both sides gives $\vert x-1 \vert = 2 - \frac{m}{100}$.
   This equation will have two solutions if $2 - \frac{m}{100} > 0$, i.e., $m < 200$.

3. $\vert x-1 \vert -2 = \frac{m}{100}$:
   Adding 2 to both sides gives $\vert x-1 \vert = \frac{m}{100} + 2$.
   This equation will have two solutions if $\frac{m}{100} + 2 < 0$, i.e., $m < -200$.

4. $\vert x-1 \vert -2 = -\frac{m}{100}$:
   Adding 2 to both sides gives $\vert x-1 \vert = 2 - \frac{m}{100}$.
   This equation will have two solutions if $2 - \frac{m}{100} < 0$, i.e., $m > 200$.

Combining all these conditions, we find that the value of $m$ should be in the range $200 < m < 200$, which is not possible. So, there must be some overlap between the solutions of the different cases.

From the analysis above, we can see that the only way for the equation to have 4 distinct solutions is if $\frac{m}{100} + 2 = 2 - \frac{m}{100}$, which gives $\frac{m}{100} = 0$. However, this is not possible as $m$ should be a positive integer.

Therefore, there must be some overlap between the solutions of the different cases. The only way for this to happen is if the solutions of the first and third cases or the second and fourth cases overlap.

Let's consider the first and third cases. The equation $\vert x-1 \vert -2 = \frac{m}{100}$ has two solutions if $\frac{m}{100} + 2 > 0$, i.e., $m > -200$. The equation $\vert x-1 \vert -2 = -\frac{m}{100}$ has two solutions if $2 - \frac{m}{100} > 0$, i.e., $m < 200$. So, the overlap occurs when $-200 < m < 200$, which is not possible as $m$ should be a positive integer.

Now, let's consider the second and fourth cases. The equation $\vert x-1 \vert -2 = -\frac{m}{100}$ has two solutions if $2 - \frac{m}{100} > 0$, i.e., $m < 200$. The equation $\vert x-1 \vert -2 = \frac{m}{100}$ has two solutions if $\frac{m}{100} + 2 < 0$, i.e., $m < -200$. So, the overlap occurs when $-200 < m < 200$, which is not possible as $m$ should be a positive integer.

Therefore, the only possible way for the equation to have 4 distinct solutions is if the solutions of the first and second cases overlap. This happens when $m = 200$.

So, the only positive integer $m$ for which the equation has 4 distinct solutions is $m = 200$. Therefore, the answer is $\boxed{1}$.

The value of $m$ for which the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has $4$ distinct solutions is $m = 200$. So, the answer is $\boxed{200}$.
The answer is $\boxed{200}$.

Solve the following problem with a Python Script (positive numerical answer):
"For how many positive integers $m$ does the equation \[\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}\] have $4$ distinct solutions?"

Approach:


We start by analyzing the equation \[\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}.\] The right-hand side $\frac{m}{100}$ must be nonnegative, so $m$ must be nonnegative. The left-hand side is the absolute value of an absolute value, so it is always nonnegative. Therefore, for the equation to have a solution, the right-hand side must also be nonnegative, which gives us $m \geq 0$.

Next, we consider the number of solutions of the equation. The equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has four distinct solutions if and only if the equation $\vert x-1 \vert -2 = \frac{m}{100}$ has two distinct solutions on each of the intervals $(1-2, 1+2) = (-1, 3)$ and $(1-2, 1+2) = (-3, 5)$.

Let's analyze the equation $\vert x-1 \vert -2 = \frac{m}{100}$ on the interval $(-1, 3)$. The equation can be rewritten as $\vert x-1 \vert = 2 + \frac{m}{100}$. The left-hand side $\vert x-1 \vert$ is nonnegative, so the right-hand side must also be nonnegative, which gives us $2 + \frac{m}{100} \geq 0$. This simplifies to $m \geq -200$.

Now, consider the equation $\vert x-1 \vert = 2 + \frac{m}{100}$ on the interval $(-1, 3)$. This equation has two distinct solutions if and only if $0 < 2 + \frac{m}{100} < 4$, which simplifies to $-200 < m < 200$.

Similarly, we can analyze the equation on the interval $(-3, 5)$, and we get the same condition $-200 < m < 200$.

Therefore, the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has four distinct solutions if and only if $0 \leq m < 200$. The positive integers $m$ that satisfy this condition are the integers from $1$ to $199$. To count these integers, we can subtract the smallest integer from the largest integer and add $1$: $199 - 1 + 1 = 199$.
The answer is: $199$

To solve the problem, we need to find the number of positive integers $m$ for which the equation \[\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}\] has exactly four distinct solutions.

The equation \[\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}\] represents a piecewise function with four cases depending on the value of $x$.

We can analyze the cases and find that the equation has four distinct solutions when $0 < m < 400$.

The number of positive integers $m$ in this range is $400 - 1 = 399$.

So, the number of positive integers $m$ for which the equation has four distinct solutions is $399$.

The answer is: $399$

Approach:



The equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has 4 distinct solutions means that the value of $\frac{m}{100}$ is the distance between two consecutive vertical asymptotes of the function $f(x) = \vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert$. This function is a piecewise function with four linear pieces. The vertical asymptotes of $f(x)$ occur at the points where the function changes from increasing to decreasing or vice versa.

The function $f(x) = \vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert$ has four distinct solutions when $\frac{m}{100}$ is equal to $1$. This is because the distance between any two consecutive vertical asymptotes of $f(x)$ is $1$.

Therefore, we need to find the value of $m$ such that $\frac{m}{100} = 1$. Solving this equation gives $m = 100$.

Therefore, there is only one positive integer $m$ for which the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has 4 distinct solutions. That value is $m = 100$. The answer is: $1$

The equation $| |x-1| - 2| = \frac{m}{100}$ has 4 distinct solutions if and only if $\frac{m}{100}$ is strictly between $1$ and $2$. This is because the function $| |x-1| - 2|$ has a maximum of $2$ and a minimum of $1$, and the equation will have 4 distinct solutions when the right hand side is strictly between these two values. Therefore, we have $1 < \frac{m}{100} < 2$, which gives $100 < m < 200$. The number of positive integers in this range is $200 - 100 - 1 = 99$. So, there are $99$ positive integers $m$ for which the equation has $4$ distinct solutions.

Solution:
The number of positive integers $m$ for which the equation $| |x-1| - 2| = \frac{m}{100}$ has $4$ distinct solutions is $99$. The answer is: $99$

Approach:



To have 4 distinct solutions, the right side of the equation, $\frac{m}{100}$, must be equal to 2. This is because the absolute value function $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert$ reaches its maximum value of 2, and the only way for it to have 4 distinct solutions is if it equals a constant that is less than 2. In this case, that constant is $\frac{m}{100}$.

Setting $\frac{m}{100}$ equal to 2, we can solve for $m$:
\[ \frac{m}{100} = 2 \implies m = 200.\]

Therefore, there is only one positive integer $m$ that makes the equation have 4 distinct solutions, and that is $m = 200$. The answer is: $1$

To solve the problem, we need to find the value of $m$ such that the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has $4$ distinct solutions.

First, we can simplify the equation by multiplying both sides by $100$ to get rid of the fraction: $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=m$.

The equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=m$ has $4$ distinct solutions if and only if $m$ is an integer between $200$ and $299$ inclusive. This is because the value inside the absolute value, $\vert x-1 \vert -2$, ranges from $-2$ to $2$ when $x$ varies over all real numbers. Therefore, $m$ must be in the range of $200$ to $299$ to allow for $4$ distinct solutions.

To find the number of integers in this range, we can subtract the smallest value from the largest value and add $1$: $299 - 200 + 1 = 100$.

So the number of positive integers $m$ for which the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=m$ has $4$ distinct solutions is $100$.

The answer is: $100$.

Approach:


We know that the equation $| |x-1|-2|=\frac{m}{100}$ has 4 distinct solutions. This equation is equivalent to two separate cases: $|x-1|-2=\frac{m}{100}$ and $-(|x-1|-2)=\frac{m}{100}$.

Let's solve the first case $|x-1|-2=\frac{m}{100}$:
$|x-1|=2+\frac{m}{100}$, then $x-1=2+\frac{m}{100}$ or $x-1=-(2+\frac{m}{100})$.

For the first equation $x-1=2+\frac{m}{100}$, we get $x=3+\frac{m}{100}$.
For the second equation $x-1=-(2+\frac{m}{100})$, we get $x=-1-\frac{m}{100}$.

So for the first case, we have two solutions: $x=3+\frac{m}{100}$ and $x=-1-\frac{m}{100}$.

Now let's solve the second case $-(|x-1|-2)=\frac{m}{100}$:
$-|x-1|+2=\frac{m}{100}$, then $-|x-1|=2-\frac{m}{100}$, which implies $|x-1|=-\left(2-\frac{m}{100}\right)$.

But the absolute value of a number cannot be negative, so there are no solutions for the second case.

Therefore, the only valid solutions are those from the first case, which means the equation $| |x-1|-2|=\frac{m}{100}$ has 4 distinct solutions when the right side $\frac{m}{100}$ is equal to the absolute difference between 3 and -1, which is 4.

So we have $\frac{m}{100}=4$, and solving for $m$ gives $m=400$.

So there is only one positive integer $m$ that makes the equation have 4 distinct solutions, and that is $m=400$.
The answer is: 1
