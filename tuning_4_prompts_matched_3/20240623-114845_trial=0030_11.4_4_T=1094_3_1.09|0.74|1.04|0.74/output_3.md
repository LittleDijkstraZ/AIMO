Solve the following problem with a Python Script (positive numerical answer):
"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"

Approach:


The equation $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ is satisfied only when either $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$.

For the first case, $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$, it implies that both $\vert x + y \vert - 10 = 0$ and $\vert x - y \vert - 10 = 0$, which further implies that $x + y = 10$ and $x - y = 10$ or $x + y = 10$ and $x - y = -10$. Solving these equations gives us the vertices of the polygon as $(5,5)$, $(10,0)$, $(0,10)$, $(-5,5)$, $(-10,0)$, $(0,-10)$, $(5,-5)$, and $(10,0)$.

For the second case, $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$, it implies that both $\vert x \vert - 8 = 0$ and $\vert y \vert - 8 = 0$, which further implies that $x = \pm 8$ and $y = \pm 8$. This gives us the vertices of the polygon as $(8,8)$, $(8,-8)$, $(-8,8)$, and $(-8,-8)$.

Now, we can plot these points on a coordinate plane and observe that they form a square with side length 10 units. The area of this square is $10^2 = 100$ square units.

So, the area of the convex polygon is 100 square units. The answer is: $100$

Approach:

 The given equation is a product of two expressions equal to zero. This means that either the first expression is zero or the second expression is zero. 

We can analyze each expression separately:

1. $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$:
This expression is a sum of squares and is equal to zero if and only if both squares are zero. This means $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. The absolute value equations can be split into two cases each:
- Case 1: $x + y = 10$ and $x - y = 10$
- Case 2: $x + y = -10$ and $x - y = -10$
Solving these cases, we get the lines $y = 0$ and $x = 10$ for both cases.

2. $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$:
Similarly, this expression is a sum of squares and is equal to zero if and only if both squares are zero. This means $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$. The absolute value equations can be split into four cases:
- Case 1: $x = 8$ and $y = 8$
- Case 2: $x = 8$ and $y = -8$
- Case 3: $x = -8$ and $y = 8$
- Case 4: $x = -8$ and $y = -8$

Putting it all together, the four lines $y = 0$, $x = 10$, $x = 8$, and $y = 8$ form a rectangle with vertices at $(8,0)$, $(8,8)$, $(10,0)$, and $(10,8)$. The area of this rectangle is $(10 - 8) \times 8 = 16$.

So the area of the convex polygon enclosed by the points is 16 square units.

The answer is: $16$

Approach:

 The equation $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ implies that $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. This means that $x + y = \pm 10$ and $x - y = \pm 10$. Solving these four equations gives the vertices of the square as $(8, 2)$, $(8, -2)$, $(-8, -2)$, and $(-8, 2)$.

Similarly, the equation $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ implies that $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$. This means that $x = \pm 8$ and $y = \pm 8$. Solving these four equations gives the vertices of the square as $(8, 8)$, $(8, -8)$, $(-8, -8)$, and $(-8, 8)$.

Combining the vertices from both equations, we find that the vertices of the convex polygon are $(8, 2)$, $(8, -2)$, $(-8, -2)$, $(-8, 2)$, $(8, 8)$, $(8, -8)$, $(-8, -8)$, and $(-8, 8)$. These eight points form a square with side length $10$. The area of this square is therefore $10^2 = 100$. The answer is: $100$

Approach:


The equation $A \cdot B = 0$ implies that either $A = 0$ or $B = 0$. Therefore, we have two cases to consider:

Case 1: $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$
This implies that $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. The solutions to these equations are $x + y = \pm 10$ and $x - y = \pm 10$. These lines are the diagonals of a square.

Case 2: $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$
This implies that $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$. The solutions to these equations are $x = \pm 8$ and $y = \pm 8$. These lines are the sides of a square.

The intersection of the two squares is a smaller square with side length 6 (since the diagonals of the larger square have length 10 and the sides of the smaller square have length 8). Therefore, the area of the convex polygon is $6^2 = 36$. The answer is: $\boxed{36}$

Approach:


The equation $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + (\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + (\vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ is satisfied if either $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + (\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + (\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$.
The first equation implies $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$, which are the equations of two lines passing through the origin making an angle of 90 degrees.
The second equation implies $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$, which are the equations of two circles centered at the origin with radius 8.
The intersection of these lines and circles form a square with side length 16.
Therefore, the area of the convex polygon is $16^2 = 256$. The answer is: $256$

The equation given is a product of two terms equals to zero, so either of the terms must be zero. Therefore, we have two cases to consider:
1. $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$
2. $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$

For the first case, both $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2$ and $( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2$ must be zero. This implies that $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. This forms a square with side length 10, so its area is $10^2 = 100$.

For the second case, both $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2$ and $( \vert y \vert - 8)^2$ must be zero. This implies that $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$. This forms a square with side length 8, so its area is $8^2 = 64$.

Therefore, the area of the convex polygon is the sum of the areas of the two squares, which is $100 + 64 = 164$.
The answer is: $164$

Approach:

 The given equation is equal to zero, which implies that either of the factors must be zero. So we have two cases to consider:
1. $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$
2. $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$

For the first case, either $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ or $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. These are the equations of two squares with side length 20. The vertices of the squares are the points where the absolute values are equal to 10. So the vertices of the square are $(10,0), (0,10), (-10,0), (0,-10)$ for the first square and $(8,0), (0,8), (-8,0), (0,-8)$ for the second square. The intersection of these two squares forms a square with side length 8.

The area of this square is $8^2 = 64$. So the area of the convex polygon is 64 square units.
The answer is: $64$

Approach:



The given equation is a product of two expressions equal to zero. This means that either the first expression is zero or the second expression is zero. 

The first expression is $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)$ and the second expression is $((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2)$. 

If the first expression is zero, then both $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2$ and $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2$ must be zero. This means that $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. This results in a square with side length 10 units.

If the second expression is zero, then both $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2$ and $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2$ must be zero. This means that $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$. This results in a square with side length 16 units.

The area of the convex polygon is the sum of the areas of these two squares. The area of a square is given by side length squared, so the area of the first square is $10^2 = 100$ square units and the area of the second square is $16^2 = 256$ square units.

Therefore, the area of the convex polygon is $100 + 256 = 356$ square units.
The answer is: $356$

Approach:

 The equation $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ is true if and only if at least one of the factors is zero. This means that either $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$.

The first equation is true if and only if $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. This implies that $x + y = \pm 10$ and $x - y = \pm 10$. Solving these equations gives us the vertices of the square: $(8, 2)$, $(8, -2)$, $(-8, -2)$, and $(-8, 2)$.

The second equation is true if and only if $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$. This implies that $x = \pm 8$ and $y = \pm 8$. So, we have four more vertices: $(8, 8)$, $(8, -8)$, $(-8, -8)$, and $(-8, 8)$.

Therefore, the points satisfying the equation enclose a square with side length 16. The area of a square is the square of the length of its side, so the area of the square is $16^2 = 256$.
The answer is: 256

The area of the convex polygon is the sum of the areas of the two squares. The side length of the first square is 10, so its area is $10^2 = 100$. The side length of the second square is 8, so its area is $8^2 = 64$. Therefore, the total area of the convex polygon is $100 + 64 = 164$. The answer is: $164$

The equation given in the problem is a product of two terms, and for the product to be zero, one of the terms must be zero. This gives us two cases to consider:

1. $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$
2. $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$

Case 1: $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$
For the sum of two squares to be zero, both squares must be zero. This gives us:
$\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$
This means that $x + y = \pm 10$ and $x - y = \pm 10$
Solving these equations, we get the four lines: $x + y = 10$, $x + y = -10$, $x - y = 10$, and $x - y = -10$
These lines form a square with side length 10 and vertices at $(0, 10)$, $(0, -10)$, $(10, 0)$, and $(-10, 0)$.

Case 2: $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$
For the sum of two squares to be zero, both squares must be zero. This gives us:
$\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$
This means that $x = \pm 8$ and $y = \pm 8$
This forms a square with side length 16 and vertices at $(8, 8)$, $(8, -8)$, $(-8, 8)$, and $(-8, -8)$.

The intersection of these two squares is the convex polygon we are looking for. The side length of this polygon is the shorter side of the two squares, which is 10. The area of a square is given by the side length squared, so the area of the convex polygon is $10^2 = 100$.
The answer is: $100$

The equation $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ is satisfied if either of the two factors is zero.
If the first factor is zero, then $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. This implies that $x + y = \pm 10$ and $x - y = \pm 10$. Solving these equations, we get the points $(0, 10)$, $(0, -10)$, $(10, 0)$, and $(-10, 0)$.
If the second factor is zero, then $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$. This implies that $x = \pm 8$ and $y = \pm 8$. Solving these equations, we get the points $(8, 0)$, $(-8, 0)$, $(0, 8)$, and $(0, -8)$.
The points $(0, 10)$, $(0, -10)$, $(10, 0)$, and $(-10, 0)$ form a square with side length 10, and the points $(8, 0)$, $(-8, 0)$, $(0, 8)$, and $(0, -8)$ form a square with side length 8.
The area of the convex polygon is the sum of the areas of these two squares. The area of a square is given by side length squared, so the area of the square with side length 10 is $10^2 = 100$, and the area of the square with side length 8 is $8^2 = 64$. Therefore, the area of the convex polygon is $100 + 64 = 164$. The answer is: $164$

Approach:

 The equation $AB=0$ implies that either $A=0$ or $B=0$. Therefore, the given equation implies that either $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$.

For the first equation to be zero, we must have $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. This implies that $x + y = \pm 10$ and $x - y = \pm 10$. Solving these equations, we get the vertices of the polygon as $(0, 10)$, $(0, -10)$, $(10, 0)$, and $(-10, 0)$.

For the second equation to be zero, we must have $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$. This implies that $x = \pm 8$ and $y = \pm 8$. Solving these equations, we get the vertices of the polygon as $(8, 8)$, $(8, -8)$, $(-8, 8)$, and $(-8, -8)$.

The polygon formed by these vertices is a square with side length 10. The area of a square is given by the square of its side length. Therefore, the area of the square is $10^2 = 100$.
The answer is: $100$
