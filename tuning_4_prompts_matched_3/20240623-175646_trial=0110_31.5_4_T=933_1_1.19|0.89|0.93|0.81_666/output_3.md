Interesting, let's analyze step by step:


The expression $A \cdot B = 0$ implies that either $A = 0$ or $B = 0$. In other words, either the first set of absolute value expressions equal zero or the second set of absolute value expressions equal zero.
The first set of absolute value expressions are $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2$ and $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2$. If either of these equals zero, then $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ or $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. This implies that the points lie on a square with side length 10, centered at the origin.
The second set of absolute value expressions are $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2$ and $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2$. If either of these equals zero, then $\vert x \vert = 8$ or $\vert y \vert = 8$, which means the points lie on a square with side length 16, also centered at the origin.
The intersection of these two sets of points is the convex polygon formed by the intersection of the two squares. This is a square with side length equal to the smaller of the two lengths, which is 10. So the area of the convex polygon is $10^2 = 100$. Since we have a positive integer, our answer is correct. The area of the convex polygon is $\boxed{100}$.
The answer is: $100$

Interesting, let's analyze step by step:



1. The conditions in the equation $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ can only hold when both terms are zero:
   $$ ((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2) = 0 $$
   and
   $$ ((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0 $$
2. The first equation implies $|x+y|=10$ and $|x-y|=10$. These conditions hold when $x+y = \pm 10$ and $x-y = \pm 10$. The four resulting equations are:
   a. $x + y = 10$, $x - y = 10$
   b. $x + y = 10$, $x - y = -10$
   c. $x + y = -10$, $x - y = 10$
   d. $x + y = -10$, $x - y = -10$
3. Solving these four systems of equations, we get the vertices of the polygon as (5,5), (5,-5), (-5,5) and (-5,-5).
4. The polygon is a square with side length 10.
5. The area of the square is side length squared, or $10^2 = 100$.

So, the area of the convex polygon is $100$. The answer is: $100$

Interesting, let's analyze step by step:


The product of two numbers is zero if and only if at least one of them is zero. Therefore, either $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$.

This leads to the following four cases:

1. $\vert x + y \vert = 10$, which implies $x + y = \pm 10$.
2. $\vert x - y \vert = 10$, which implies $x - y = \pm 10$.
3. $\vert x \vert = 8$, which implies $x = \pm 8$.
4. $\vert y \vert = 8$, which implies $y = \pm 8$.

Solving these equations, we find that the points $(x, y)$ are the vertices of a square with side length 16. The area of this square is $16^2 = 256$.
The answer is: $256$.

Interesting, let's analyze step by step:



The given equation is $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + (\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + (\vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$. 

Now we know that for a product to be zero, either of the terms should be zero. So we get two cases:

Case 1: $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + (\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$. From this equation, it's clear that $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. The solution of these two equations gives us the vertices of a square with side length 10.

Case 2: $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + (\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$. From this equation, we find that $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$. So the vertices of the square are at $(8,8)$, $(-8,8)$, $(-8,-8)$ and $(8,-8)$.

So the points that satisfy the equation form a square with side length 10 units. Therefore, the area of the square is side_length^2 = $10^2 = 100$.

Since 100 is a positive integer, the answer is $\boxed{100}$.

Please note that this problem is a theoretical one and does not require any sympy implementation as the calculations are simple and straightforward. The Python code to compute the area of the square is as follows:

```python


INTERMEDIATE OUT :

def square_area():
    side_length = 10
    area = side_length ** 2
    return area

result = square_area()
print(result)
```

CODE RESULTS 100

INTERMEDIATE OUT :
```output
100
```
```output

CODE RESULTS 100

INTERMEDIATE OUT :

100
```
The area of the convex polygon is 100 square units. The answer is $\boxed{100}$.
