Interesting, let's analyze step by step:



The equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has 4 distinct solutions. This implies that $\frac{m}{100}$ must be equal to $1$, because the function $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert$ can only take the values from 0 to 3. 

So, $m = 100$. However, we are asked to find how many positive integers $m$ satisfy the condition, so $m = 100$ is only one solution.

Therefore, there is only $1$ positive integer $m$ that satisfies the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ having $4$ distinct solutions.

So the answer is $1$.
The answer is: $1$

Interesting, let's analyze step by step:



First, we need to know that the function $|x - 1| - 2$ has two "kinks" at $x = 1$, where the absolute value changes.
We consider the three cases: $x < 1$, $1 \leq x \leq 3$, and $x > 3$.

1. If $x < 1$, then $|x - 1| = 1 - x$, so $|x - 1| - 2 = -x - 1$.
2. If $1 \leq x \leq 3$, then $|x - 1| = x - 1$, so $|x - 1| - 2 = x - 3$.
3. If $x > 3$, then $|x - 1| = x - 1$, so $|x - 1| - 2 = x - 3$.

Thus, the function $| |x - 1| - 2|$ is a V-shape with vertices at $x = 1$ and $x = 3$.
The equation $| |x - 1| - 2| = \frac{m}{100}$ has 4 distinct solutions if and only if $\frac{m}{100}$ is equal to the height of the V-shape, which is 2.
So, $m = 200$.

However, we need to check if the number of solutions for $m = 200$ is indeed 4.
The equation becomes $| |x - 1| - 2| = 2$, which gives us four equations:

1. $x - 1 - 2 = 2$, which simplifies to $x - 3 = 2$, and has the solution $x = 5$.
2. $-(x - 1) - 2 = 2$, which simplifies to $-x + 1 - 2 = 2$, and has the solution $x = -3$.
3. $-(x - 1) - 2 = -2$, which simplifies to $-x + 1 + 2 = 2$, and has the solution $x = 1$.
4. $x - 1 - 2 = -2$, which simplifies to $x - 3 = -2$, and has the solution $x = 1$.

Therefore, the equation $| |x - 1| - 2| = 2$ has 4 distinct solutions $x = -3$, $x = 1$, $x = 1$, and $x = 5$.

Hence, the value of $m$ that makes the equation have 4 distinct solutions is $m = 200$. Since $200$ is a positive integer, the answer is:

$$ \boxed{1} $$

Interesting, let's analyze step by step:



Step 1: List the variables and known values from the problem.

The only known value is $m$, and we want to find the number of positive integer values of $m$ such that the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has $4$ distinct solutions.

Step 2: Outline the steps using sympy to solve the problem.

We know that the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has $4$ distinct solutions, which means that $\frac{m}{100}$ is the difference between two consecutive elements of the sequence $0, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, \dots$, which is the Fibonacci sequence starting from $0$.

We need to find the value of $m$ such that $\frac{m}{100}$ is the difference between two consecutive elements of the Fibonacci sequence. The differences between consecutive elements of the Fibonacci sequence are $2, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, \dots$, which are the values of the Fibonacci sequence starting from $1$.

To find the value of $m$, we need to find two consecutive Fibonacci numbers and multiply them by $100$. The pair of consecutive Fibonacci numbers that give us the maximum value of $m$ less than or equal to $1000$ are $21$ and $34$. So, $m = 100 \times (34 - 21) = 1300$.

Now we need to check if there is a smaller value of $m$ that gives us $4$ distinct solutions. The pair of consecutive Fibonacci numbers that give us the next smaller value of $m$ are $13$ and $21$. So, $m = 100 \times (21 - 13) = 800$.

Now we need to check if there is a smaller value of $m$ that gives us $4$ distinct solutions. The pair of consecutive Fibonacci numbers that give us the next smaller value of $m$ are $8$ and $13$. So, $m = 100 \times (13 - 8) = 500$.

Now we need to check if there is a smaller value of $m$ that gives us $4$ distinct solutions. The pair of consecutive Fibonacci numbers that give us the next smaller value of $m$ are $5$ and $8$. So, $m = 100 \times (8 - 5) = 300$.

Now we need to check if there is a smaller value of $m$ that gives us $4$ distinct solutions. The pair of consecutive Fibonacci numbers that give us the next smaller value of $m$ are $3$ and $5$. So, $m = 100 \times (5 - 3) = 200$.

Now we need to check if there is a smaller value of $m$ that gives us $4$ distinct solutions. The pair of consecutive Fibonacci numbers that give us the next smaller value of $m$ are $2$ and $3$. So, $m = 100 \times (3 - 2) = 100$.

Now we need to check if there is a smaller value of $m$ that gives us $4$ distinct solutions. The pair of consecutive Fibonacci numbers that give us the next smaller value of $m$ are $1$ and $2$. So, $m = 100 \times (2 - 1) = 100$.

So, the possible values of $m$ are $100, 300, 500, 800,$ and $1300$. However, we are asked to find the number of positive integer values of $m$, so we only consider the distinct values.

Therefore, there are $5$ positive integer values of $m$ such that the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has $4$ distinct solutions.

Step 3: Calculate the final answer and verify it's a positive integer.

The final answer is $5$, which is a positive integer.

Step 4: Output the result within the correct format.

The number of positive integer values of $m$ such that the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has $4$ distinct solutions is $\boxed{5}$. The answer is: 5

Assistant:

Interesting, let's analyze step by step:



The equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has 4 distinct solutions. The right side $\frac{m}{100}$ is a positive value. To get 4 distinct solutions, the absolute value expression on the left side must be a number between 0 and 2. This means $0 < \frac{m}{100} \leq 2$.

Solving these inequalities:
1. $0 < \frac{m}{100}$ gives $m > 0$.
2. $\frac{m}{100} \leq 2$ gives $m \leq 200$.

So the possible values for $m$ are the integers from 1 to 200.

Now we need to find out for how many of these values the equation has exactly 4 distinct solutions. This can be done by trial and error, checking each value of $m$ one by one. However, there is a much faster way to do this using a mathematical property of absolute value equations.

Consider the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$. The right side $\frac{m}{100}$ is a positive value. The left side $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert$ is equal to a positive value exactly 4 times if and only if $0 < 2 < \frac{m}{100} \leq 4$.

Solving these inequalities:
1. $0 < 2$ is always true.
2. $2 < \frac{m}{100}$ gives $m > 200$.
3. $\frac{m}{100} \leq 4$ gives $m \leq 400$.

So the possible values for $m$ are the integers from 201 to 400.

To count the number of these integers, we subtract the smallest value from the largest value and add 1: $400 - 201 + 1 = 199 + 1 = 200$.

Therefore, there are 200 values of $m$ for which the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has exactly 4 distinct solutions. However, we only want the positive integer values of $m$. Since all the values of $m$ from 1 to 200 are positive integers, the number of positive integer values of $m$ for which the equation has 4 distinct solutions is 200.

So the final answer is 200. To verify it's a positive integer, it's clear that it's a positive integer and greater than 0. Thus, it's a valid solution to the problem. The output is: $\boxed{200}$.
The answer is: $200$

Assistant:

Interesting, let's analyze step by step:



The equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has 4 distinct solutions. This implies that the value of $\frac{m}{100}$ must be 2. This is because the expression $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert$ can only be 2 for 4 distinct solutions. 

So, $m=200$. But we need to verify that $m$ is a positive integer. So, $m=200$ is indeed a positive integer.

Now, we have the solution, which is $m=200$. We can output the result:

```python


INTERMEDIATE OUT :

def solve_equation():
    m = 200
    return m

result = solve_equation()
print(result)
```

CODE RESULTS 200

INTERMEDIATE OUT :
```output
200
```
The value of $m$ that makes the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ have 4 distinct solutions is $200$.

Therefore, the value of $m$ is $200$. This is a positive integer, so we can conclude that $m=200$ is the solution to the problem.
The answer is: $\boxed{200}$

Step 1: For how many positive integers $m$ does the equation \[\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}\] have $4$ distinct solutions?

Step 2: To solve this problem, we need to find the value of $m$ such that the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has four distinct solutions.

Step 3: The equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has four distinct solutions when $\frac{m}{100}$ is equal to $2$. Therefore, we can set $\frac{m}{100}=2$ and solve for $m$.

Step 4: Multiplying both sides by $100$ gives $m=200$.

Step 5: We need to check if $m=200$ is a positive integer. It is, so $m=200$.

Step 6: The problem asks for the number of positive integers $m$ that satisfy the condition. Since there is only one value of $m$ (which is $200$) that results in four distinct solutions, the answer is $1$.

The answer is: $1$

For the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ to have 4 distinct solutions, $\frac{m}{100}$ must equal to 2. Hence, $m=200$.

But wait a second, let's see if $m=200$ is the only solution.

If $\frac{m}{100} > 2$, the equation will have less than 4 solutions. If $\frac{m}{100} < 2$, the equation will have more than 4 solutions.

So, the only possible value for $m$ is $200$.

The value of $m$ is 200. To confirm that it is a positive integer, we can see that it is both positive and an integer.

Therefore, the number of positive integers $m$ for which the equation has 4 distinct solutions is 1. The answer is: $1$
