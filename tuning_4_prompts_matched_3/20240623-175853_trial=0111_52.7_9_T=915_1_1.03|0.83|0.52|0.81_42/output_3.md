Interesting, let's analyze step by step:



The condition $A \cdot B = 0$ implies that at least one of the factors must be zero. So, we have two cases:

Case 1: $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0 \Rightarrow \vert x + y \vert = 10$. This is the equation of two lines $y = -x + 10$ and $y = -x - 10$.

Case 2: $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0 \Rightarrow \vert x - y \vert = 10$. This is the equation of two lines $y = x + 10$ and $y = x - 10$.

Case 3: $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0 \Rightarrow \vert x \vert = 8$. This is the equation of two lines $x = 8$ and $x = -8$.

Case 4: $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0 \Rightarrow \vert y \vert = 8$. This is the equation of two lines $y = 8$ and $y = -8$.

Now, we need to find the intersection points of these lines to get the vertices of the polygon. By analyzing the intersections, we find that the polygon is a square with side length 16.

The area of this square is $16^2 = 256$.
The answer is: $256$

Interesting, let's analyze step by step:



We are given the equation:
$$((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0.$$

For the product of two numbers to be zero, either one of them must be zero. Hence, we have two cases to consider:

1. $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$.
2. $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$.

In the first case, both $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2$ and $( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2$ must be zero. This implies $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. Solving these absolute value equations gives us $x + y = \pm 10$ and $x - y = \pm 10$. Adding these two equations gives $x = \pm 10$ and subtracting gives $y = \pm 10$. So the points in the first case are $(10, 10)$, $(10, -10)$, $(-10, 10)$, and $(-10, -10)$.

In the second case, both $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2$ and $( \vert y \vert - 8)^2$ must be zero. This implies $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$. Solving these absolute value equations gives us $x = \pm 8$ and $y = \pm 8$. So the points in the second case are $(8, 8)$, $(8, -8)$, $(-8, 8)$, and $(-8, -8)$.

The intersection of these two cases gives us the points that satisfy the original equation: $(10, 10)$, $(10, -10)$, $(-10, 10)$, $(-10, -10)$, $(8, 8)$, $(8, -8)$, $(-8, 8)$, and $(-8, -8)$. These points form a square with side length $16$ (the distance between $(8, 8)$ and $(8, -8)$, or $(10, 10)$ and $(10, -10)$), so the area of the square is $16^2 = 256$. The area of the convex polygon is therefore $256$.

The answer is: $256$

Interesting, let's analyze step by step:



The equation we have is a product of two terms equal to zero, so either one of the terms must be zero. This gives us two cases to consider:

1. $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$.
2. $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$.

For the first case, this means that $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ or $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. For the second case, it means that $\vert x \vert = 8$ or $\vert y \vert = 8$. 

Solving these equations, we find that the points that satisfy these conditions are:

- For the first case, the points are $(x, y)$ where $x + y = \pm 10$ or $x - y = \pm 10$. This gives us a square with side length 20.
- For the second case, the points are $(x, y)$ where $x = \pm 8$ or $y = \pm 8$. This gives us a square with side length 16.

The area of the convex polygon formed by the intersection of these two squares is the product of their side lengths, which is $20 \times 16 = 320$.

So the area of the convex polygon is 320.
The answer is: $320$

Interesting, let's analyze step by step:



The equation is $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + (\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + (\vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$.

The product of two numbers is zero if and only if at least one of the numbers is zero. Therefore, we must have either:

1. $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$, which implies $\vert x + y \vert = 10$, or
2. $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$, which implies $\vert x - y \vert = 10$, or
3. $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$, which implies $\vert x \vert = 8$, or
4. $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$, which implies $\vert y \vert = 8$.

These equations represent the equations of four lines in the coordinate plane:

1. $x + y = \pm 10$,
2. $x - y = \pm 10$,
3. $x = \pm 8$,
4. $y = \pm 8$.

The intersection of these lines form a square with side length 16. The area of this square is $16^2 = 256$. Therefore, the area of the convex polygon is 256.

Now, let's verify that the answer is a positive integer:

The area of the square is a positive integer, so our answer is correct.

The answer is: $256$

Interesting, let's analyze step by step:



The condition $A \cdot B = 0$ is equivalent to $A = 0$ or $B = 0$. So the given equation implies that either $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$. 

The solutions are given by:

1) $\vert x + y \vert = 10 \Rightarrow x + y = \pm 10$ or $x + y = 0$.
2) $\vert x - y \vert = 10 \Rightarrow x - y = \pm 10$ or $x - y = 0$.
3) $\vert x \vert = 8 \Rightarrow x = \pm 8$.
4) $\vert y \vert = 8 \Rightarrow y = \pm 8$.

These lines form a square with side length $16$. The area of this square is $16^2 = 256$. So, the area of the convex polygon is $256$. Since the problem asked for a positive numerical answer, the answer is $\boxed{256}$. The answer is: $256$
