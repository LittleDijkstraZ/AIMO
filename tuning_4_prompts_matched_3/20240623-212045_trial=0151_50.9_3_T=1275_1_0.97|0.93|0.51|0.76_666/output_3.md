Interesting, let's analyze step by step:


The equation $AB = 0$ is satisfied if and only if $A = 0$ or $B = 0$. So, the given equation implies that either $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$.
This translates to: $\vert x + y \vert = 10$, $\vert x - y \vert = 10$, $\vert x \vert = 8$ or $\vert y \vert = 8$.
The first two equations give the lines $x + y = 10$, $x + y = -10$, $x - y = 10$ and $x - y = -10$. The last two equations give the lines $x = 8$ and $x = -8$, $y = 8$ and $y = -8$. The points that satisfy all these conditions are the vertices of a square with side length 10. So, the area of the square is $10^2 = 100$. The answer is: $100$

Interesting, let's analyze step by step:



The expression $A \cdot B = 0$ is true if either $A = 0$ or $B = 0$. Therefore, the given equation is equivalent to the union of two sets of points:
1. The set of points $(x, y)$ that satisfy $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + (\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$.
2. The set of points $(x, y)$ that satisfy $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + (\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$.

From the first set, we have $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. This implies that the points $(x, y)$ lie on the square with vertices at $(10, 0), (-10, 0), (0, 10), (0, -10)$.

From the second set, we have $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$. This implies that the points $(x, y)$ lie on the square with vertices at $(8, 8), (-8, 8), (8, -8), (-8, -8)$.

The union of these two squares is a 8x10 rectangle, so its area is $8 \cdot 10 = 80$. 

Therefore, the area of the convex polygon is 80. The answer is: $\boxed{80}$

Interesting, let's analyze step by step:



Given the equation $ ((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$, the product of two terms equals zero if and only if at least one of the terms is zero. Hence, either $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$, $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$, $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$, or $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$. Each of these equations implies that $\vert x + y \vert = 10$, $\vert x - y \vert = 10$, $\vert x \vert = 8$, or $\vert y \vert = 8$.

For $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$, we get a square with side length $10$ (by the Pythagorean theorem), and thus an area of $100$.

For $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$, we get a square with side length $8$ and an area of $64$.

Therefore, the area of the convex polygon is the sum of these two areas, $100 + 64 = 164$. This is a positive integer, so it is the correct answer. The answer is: $164$

Interesting, let's analyze step by step:



The condition $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ is satisfied if and only if at least one of the following two conditions is satisfied:

1. $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$.
2. $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$.

In the first condition, this is possible only if $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$, which gives a square with side length $10\sqrt{2}$.

In the second condition, this is possible only if $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$, which gives a square with side length $16$.

So the total area is the sum of the areas of these two squares.

The area of a square with side length $a$ is $a^2$, so the area of the first square is $(10\sqrt{2})^2 = 200$, and the area of the second square is $16^2 = 256$.

So the total area is $200 + 256 = 456$.

So the area of the convex polygon is $\boxed{456}$. This is a positive integer, as required. The answer is: $456$

1. The given equation is a product of two terms equal to zero. This means either the first term is zero or the second term is zero.

2. The first term is $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + (\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$. This implies that $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$.

3. The second term is $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + (\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$. This implies that $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$.

4. Solving these equations, we find that the points must satisfy the conditions $x + y = \pm 10$ and $x - y = \pm 10$ and $x = \pm 8$ and $y = \pm 8$.

5. By analyzing the possible combinations, we find that the points are the vertices of a square with side length 10.

6. The area of this square is $10^2 = 100$.

Therefore, the area of the convex polygon is 100. The answer is: $\boxed{100}$

The given expression equals 0 when either of the two factors equals 0. 

1. The first factor equals 0 when $|\pm x \pm y| = 10$ and $|\pm x|$ = 8 and $|\pm y|$ = 8. 

2. The second factor equals 0 when $|\pm x \pm y|$ = 10 and $|\pm x|$ = 8 and $|\pm y|$ = 8.

These four conditions describe a square with side length 10 and inscribed in a square with side length 16. 

The area of the polygon is the area of the larger square minus the area of the smaller square. 

```python

Assistant:

Interesting, let's analyze step by step:



We have two equations: $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ and $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$, because if one of them equals zero, the whole left side of the first equation equals zero. So we have:

1. $\vert x + y \vert = 10$, which means $x + y = 10$ or $x + y = -10$.
2. $\vert x \vert = 8$, which means $x = 8$ or $x = -8$.
3. $\vert y \vert = 8$, which means $y = 8$ or $y = -8$.

Now, we need to consider all possible combinations of these equations to find the vertices of the polygon. There are 8 possible combinations:

1. $x = 8, y = 2$: This satisfies both equations.
2. $x = 8, y = -2$: This satisfies both equations.
3. $x = -8, y = 2$: This satisfies both equations.
4. $x = -8, y = -2$: This satisfies both equations.
5. $x = 8, y = 8$: This satisfies both equations.
6. $x = 8, y = -8$: This satisfies both equations.
7. $x = -8, y = 8$: This satisfies both equations.
8. $x = -8, y = -8$: This satisfies both equations.

So, the polygon is a square with side length 16. To find the area of the square, we use the formula $A = side^2$:

$$A = 16^2 = 256.$$
The answer is: $256$.

Interesting, let's analyze step by step:



The condition for the product to be zero is that at least one of the factors must be zero. So we have two cases to consider:

1. $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$
2. $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$

From the first case, we get $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$.
From the second case, we get $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$.

The solutions to the absolute value equations are:
- For $\vert x + y \vert = 10$, we have $x + y = 10$ or $x + y = -10$.
- For $\vert x - y \vert = 10$, we have $x - y = 10$ or $x - y = -10$.
- For $\vert x \vert = 8$, we have $x = 8$ or $x = -8$.
- For $\vert y \vert = 8$, we have $y = 8$ or $y = -8$.

So we have 8 pairs of solutions:
- $(x, y) = (8, 2)$, $(8, -10)$, $(-8, 2)$, $(-8, -10)$, $(2, 8)$, $(2, -8)$, $(-10, 8)$, $(-10, -8)$.

Now we plot these points on the coordinate plane. They form a square with side length 16. The area of the square is $16^2 = 256$.

Therefore, the area of the convex polygon is 256. The answer is: $256$

Assistant:

Interesting, let's analyze step by step:



The given equation is $0$ when either of the factors is $0$. That is
\[((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2) = 0\]
or
\[((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0.\]

For the first factor to be $0$, both $\vert x + y \vert - 10 = 0$ and $\vert x - y \vert - 10 = 0$, which gives $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. This implies that $x + y = \pm 10$ and $x - y = \pm 10$. Solving these equations we get the vertices of the polygon as $(0, 10)$, $(0, -10)$, $(10, 0)$ and $(-10, 0)$.

For the second factor to be $0$, both $\vert x \vert - 8 = 0$ and $\vert y \vert - 8 = 0$, which gives $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$. This implies that $x = \pm 8$ and $y = \pm 8$. Solving these equations we get the vertices of the polygon as $(8, 8)$, $(8, -8)$, $(-8, 8)$ and $(-8, -8)$.

Therefore, the vertices of the polygon are $(0, 10)$, $(0, -10)$, $(10, 0)$, $(-10, 0)$, $(8, 8)$, $(8, -8)$, $(-8, 8)$ and $(-8, -8)$. These points form a square with side length $10$.

The area of the square is given by side length squared, which is $10^2 = 100$.

Therefore, the area of the convex polygon is $100$. Since the area is a positive integer, we can conclude that the answer is indeed $\boxed{100}$.

Assistant:

Interesting, let's analyze step by step:



Step 1: First, we can clearly see that the product of two numbers is zero if and only if one or both of the numbers are zero. Thus we get two equations to solve:

$$((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2) = 0$$ 
$$((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$$ 

Step 2: From the first equation, we have:
$$(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0 \Rightarrow \vert x + y \vert = 10 \Rightarrow x + y = \pm 10$$
$$(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0 \Rightarrow \vert x - y \vert = 10 \Rightarrow x - y = \pm 10$$

Step 3: From the second equation, we have:
$$(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0 \Rightarrow \vert x \vert = 8 \Rightarrow x = \pm 8$$
$$(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0 \Rightarrow \vert y \vert = 8 \Rightarrow y = \pm 8$$

Step 4: Now we need to solve these equations:

From $x + y = \pm 10$ and $x = \pm 8$, we can substitute $x = \pm 8$ into the first equation to get $y = \pm 2$ or $y = \pm 18$. So we get four points: $(\pm 8, \pm 2)$ and $(\pm 8, \pm 18)$.

From $x - y = \pm 10$ and $x = \pm 8$, we can substitute $x = \pm 8$ into the second equation to get $y = \mp 2$ or $y = \mp 6$. So we get four more points: $(\pm 8, \mp 2)$ and $(\pm 8, \mp 6)$.

Step 5: Now we have the coordinates of the vertices of the polygon: $(\pm 8, \pm 2)$, $(\pm 8, \pm 18)$, $(\pm 8, \mp 2)$ and $(\pm 8, \mp 6)$. Plotting these points on a coordinate plane, we find that they form a square with side length $20$.

Step 6: Finally, we calculate the area of the square:
$$Area = side^2 = 20^2 = 400.$$

So the area of the convex polygon is $400$. The answer is: $400$

Interesting, let's analyze step by step:



The condition given in the problem is a product of two expressions equal to zero. This means that either one of the expressions is zero or both are zero. 

The expressions are $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2$ and $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2$.

The second expression will be zero only when both $|x|$ and $|y|$ are equal to 8, that is, when the point $(x, y)$ is in a square with side length 16 centered at the origin.

The first expression will be zero if and only if both $|x + y|$ and $|x - y|$ are equal to 10. This implies that the point $(x, y)$ must lie on a square with side length 20 centered at the origin.

Therefore, the set of all points $(x, y)$ that satisfy the condition of the problem forms the intersection of the two squares, which is a smaller square with side length 16. The area of this square is $16^2 = 256$.

Therefore, the area of the convex polygon is 256. To make sure it's a positive integer, we check the answer $256$.
The answer is: $256$

1. $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$, which implies $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. This gives us four lines: $x + y = 10$, $x + y = -10$, $x - y = 10$, and $x - y = -10$. These lines form a rectangle with vertices at $(10,0)$, $(-10,0)$, $(0,10)$, and $(0,-10)$.

2. $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + (\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$, which implies $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$. This gives us four lines: $x = 8$, $x = -8$, $y = 8$, and $y = -8$. These lines form a square with vertices at $(8,8)$, $(-8,8)$, $(-8,-8)$, and $(8,-8)$.

The convex polygon is the intersection of the rectangle and the square, which is a smaller square with side length 8 and area $8^2 = 64$. So the area of the convex polygon is 64 square units. The answer is: $64$

Below is a math problem you are to solve (positive numerical answer):
"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"

To accomplish this:
- List the variables and known values from the problem.
- Outline the steps using sympy to solve the problem:
  * Identify the sympy functions required for each step.
  * Implement these functions step-by-step, commenting each line for clarity.
- Calculate the final answer and verify it's a positive integer.
- Output the result within \boxed{}.

Interesting, let's analyze step by step:



1. We have two conditions that must be satisfied for the points $(x, y)$ to be inside the polygon:
   $$(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + (\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$$
   $$(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + (\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$$

2. From the first condition, we have:
   $$\vert x + y \vert = 10$$ and $$\vert x - y \vert = 10$$
   This implies that $x + y = \pm 10$ and $x - y = \pm 10$. Solving these system of equations, we obtain the vertices of the square as:
   $$A: (10, 0), B: (-10, 0), C: (0, 10), D: (0, -10)$$

3. From the second condition, we have:
   $$\vert x \vert = 8$$ and $$\vert y \vert = 8$$
   This implies that $x = \pm 8$ and $y = \pm 8$. So, the vertices of the square are also:
   $$E: (8, 8), F: (-8, 8), G: (-8, -8), H: (8, -8)$$

4. Therefore, the polygon formed by the intersection of these two squares is a smaller square with side length 6 (since $10 - 8 = 6$).

5. To find the area of this square, we can use the formula for the area of a square, which is the square of its side length:
   $$Area = 6^2 = 36$$

We can verify that the area is a positive integer, which is 36.

The area of the convex polygon is 36.
The answer is: $36$

We have two conditions given by the problem:
1. $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2) = 0$
2. $((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$

From the first condition, we have $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. This implies that $x + y = \pm 10$ and $x - y = \pm 10$. Solving these four equations, we get the vertices of the polygon as $(0,10)$, $(0,-10)$, $(10,0)$, and $(-10,0)$.

From the second condition, we have $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$. This implies that $x = \pm 8$ and $y = \pm 8$. Solving these four equations, we get the vertices of the polygon as $(8,8)$, $(8,-8)$, $(-8,8)$, and $(-8,-8)$.

Now, we plot these points on a graph and connect them to form the polygon. It's a square with side length $10$ units.

The area of a square is given by side length squared. Therefore, the area of this square is $10^2 = 100$.

Therefore, the area of the convex polygon is $100$ square units.
The answer is: $100$
