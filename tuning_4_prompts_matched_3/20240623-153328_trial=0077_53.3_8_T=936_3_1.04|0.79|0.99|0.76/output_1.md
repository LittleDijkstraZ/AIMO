Approach:


We can use the AM-GM inequality (Arithmetic Mean-Geometric Mean inequality) to find the minimum value of the given expression. The AM-GM inequality states that for any non-negative real numbers $a$ and $b$, we have $a+b \geq 2\sqrt{ab}$.

First, let's rewrite the given equation $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$ as $|-(2y-x)| + |-(2x-y)| = 40$, which simplifies to $|2y-x| + |2x-y| = 40$. Now, let's consider the expression $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$. We can rewrite it as $5(x^2+y^2) - 8xy = 5[(x-y)^2 + 2xy] - 8xy$.

Using the AM-GM inequality, we have $2xy \geq 2\sqrt{(x-y)^2(y-x)^2} = 2|(x-y)(y-x)| = 2|(x-y)^2| = 2(x-y)^2$. Therefore, $5[(x-y)^2 + 2xy] - 8xy \geq 5[(x-y)^2 + 2(x-y)^2] - 8(x-y)^2 = 5(3(x-y)^2) - 8(x-y)^2 = (15-8)(x-y)^2 = 7(x-y)^2$.

To minimize $7(x-y)^2$, we need to minimize $(x-y)^2$. From the equation $|2y-x| + |2x-y| = 40$, we know that $x-y$ is a constant value (in this case, $20$). Therefore, $(x-y)^2$ is also a constant value, and its minimum value is $0$.

So, the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ is $7(x-y)^2 = 7*0 = 0$. However, this result doesn't make sense in the context of the problem, because the expression $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ is always positive for any real numbers $x$ and $y$. This means that there must be a mistake in our reasoning.

Let's go back and look at the equation $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$. We can rewrite it as $|2y-x| + |2x-y| = 40$. By the triangle inequality, we know that $|a| + |b| \geq |a+b|$. Therefore, $|2y-x| + |2x-y| \geq |(2y-x) + (2x-y)| = |y| = 40$. This means that $|y| = 20$.

Now, let's substitute $y = \pm 20$ into the equation $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$. If $y = 20$, we have $|x-40| + |20-2x| = 40$. By the triangle inequality, we know that $|a| + |b| \geq |a-b|$. Therefore, $|x-40| + |20-2x| \geq |(x-40) - (20-2x)| = |x-60| = 40$. This gives us $x-60 = \pm 40$, so $x = 100$ or $x = 20$.

If $y = -20$, we have $|x+40| + |-20-2x| = 40$. By the same reasoning as above, we have $x+60 = \pm 40$, so $x = -100$ or $x = -20$.

Now, let's substitute the values of $x$ and $y$ into the expression $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$. If $x = 100$ and $y = 20$, we have $5(100)^2 + 5(20)^2 - 8*100*20 = 50000 + 2000 - 16000 = 36000$. If $x = 20$ and $y = 20$, we have $5(20)^2 + 5(20)^2 - 8*20*20 = 2000 + 2000 - 3200 = 800$. If $x = -100$ and $y = -20$, we have $5(-100)^2 + 5(-20)^2 - 8*(-100)*(-20) = 50000 + 2000 - 16000 = 36000$. If $x = -20$ and $y = -20$, we have $5(-20)^2 + 5(-20)^2 - 8*(-20)*(-20) = 2000 + 2000 - 3200 = 800$.

Therefore, the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ is $800$.

The answer is: $800$

Approach:


We will first simplify the expression $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ and then use the condition $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$ to find the minimum value.

Step 1: Simplify the expression $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$.
We can rewrite the expression as $5(x^2+y^2)-8xy$.
Now, we know that $(x^2+y^2)^2 - (2xy)^2 = (x^2+y^2-2xy)(x^2+y^2+2xy)$.
Since $x^2+y^2-2xy = (x-y)^2$ and $x^2+y^2+2xy = (x+y)^2$, we have $(x^2+y^2)^2 - (2xy)^2 = (x-y)^2(x+y)^2$.
Therefore, $5(x^2+y^2)-8xy = 5(x^2+y^2) - 4(x^2+y^2) = x^2+y^2$.

Step 2: Use the condition $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$.
We know that $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = |x-2y| + |2y-x| = 40$.
By the triangle inequality, we have $|x-2y| + |2y-x| \ge |(x-2y) + (2y-x)| = 0$, so the equality case must occur.
This means that $x-2y$ and $2y-x$ must have the same sign, or equivalently, $x$ and $y$ must have the same sign.

Step 3: Minimize $x^2+y^2$ subject to the condition $x$ and $y$ have the same sign and $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$.
By the Cauchy-Schwarz inequality, we have $(1+4)(x^2+y^2) \ge (x+2y)^2$, so $5(x^2+y^2) \ge (x+2y)^2$.
Similarly, we have $5(x^2+y^2) \ge (2x-y)^2$.
Adding these two inequalities, we get $10(x^2+y^2) \ge (x+2y)^2 + (2x-y)^2$.
By the condition $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$, we know that $x+2y = 20$ or $x+2y = -20$.
Without loss of generality, let's assume $x+2y = 20$.
Then, we have $10(x^2+y^2) \ge 20^2$, so $x^2+y^2 \ge 400/10 = 40$.
The minimum value of $x^2+y^2$ is therefore 40.

Step 4: The minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ is therefore $5 \cdot 40 = 200$.
The answer is: $200$

Approach:



We can use the inequality $|a| + |b| \geq |a+b|$ to solve this problem. First, let $a = x - 2y$ and $b = y - 2x$. Then, we have:

\[|x - 2y| + |y - 2x| \geq |(x - 2y) + (y - 2x)| = |-x - y| = |-(x + y)| = |x + y|.\]

Given that $|x - 2y| + |y - 2x| = 40$, we have $|x + y| = 40$.

Now, let's express $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ in terms of $x + y$ and $x - y$:

\[5x^2+5y^2-8xy = 5(x^2 + y^2) - 8xy = 5[(x + y)^2 - 2xy] + 5[(x - y)^2 - 2xy] = 10(x + y)^2 - 18xy.\]

We know that $x + y = 40$, so we can substitute this into the expression above:

\[10(40)^2 - 18xy = 16000 - 18xy.\]

To minimize this expression, we need to maximize the value of $xy$. By the AM-GM inequality, we have:

\[xy \leq \left(\frac{x + y}{2}\right)^2 = \left(\frac{40}{2}\right)^2 = 400.\]

Equality occurs when $x = y = 20$. Therefore, the maximum value of $xy$ is $400$.

Substituting this into the expression $16000 - 18xy$, we get:

\[16000 - 18(400) = 16000 - 7200 = 8800.\]

Therefore, the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ is $8800$.

The answer is: $8800$.

This problem involves finding the minimum value of a function under a constraint. The function is $f(x, y) = 5x^2 + 5y^2 - 8xy$ and the constraint is $|x - 2y| + |y - 2x| = 40$.

First, let's simplify the constraint equation. We have $|x - 2y| + |y - 2x| = 40$. By the property of absolute values, we can rewrite this as $|2y - x| + |2x - y| = 40$. Now, we can use the triangular inequality, which states that $|a| + |b| \geq |a + b|$, to get $|2y - x + 2x - y| \geq |(2y - x) + (2x - y)| = |y| = 40$. Simplifying the left side gives $|y| \geq 40$.

Now, let's find the minimum value of the function $f(x, y)$. We can rewrite $f(x, y)$ as $f(x, y) = 5(x^2 + y^2) - 8xy = 5[(x - y)^2 + xy]$.

By the AM-GM inequality, we have $xy \leq \frac{(x - y)^2}{4} + xy$, which implies $0 \leq \frac{(x - y)^2}{4}$. Thus, $xy \geq 0$.

When $xy \geq 0$, we can use the AM-GM inequality again to get $f(x, y) = 5[(x - y)^2 + xy] \geq 5[2\sqrt{(x - y)^2 \cdot xy}] = 10|x - y|\sqrt{xy}$.

Since $|x - 2y| + |2x - y| = 40$, we know that $|x - y| \geq \frac{40}{4} = 10$. Therefore, $f(x, y) \geq 10 \cdot 10 \sqrt{xy} = 100\sqrt{xy}$.

Now, we need to find the minimum value of $\sqrt{xy}$ under the constraint $|y| \geq 40$. Since $|y| \geq 40$, we have $y^2 \geq 1600$. Also, from the constraint equation, we have $|x - 2y| = 40 - |2x - y|$. Squaring both sides gives $(x - 2y)^2 = (40 - |2x - y|)^2$. Expanding and simplifying, we get $5x^2 - 8xy + 5y^2 = 1600$. Substituting $y^2 \geq 1600$ into this equation gives $5x^2 - 8xy + 5(1600) \geq 1600$, which simplifies to $5x^2 - 8xy \geq 0$. Therefore, $\sqrt{xy} \geq 0$.

So, the minimum value of $f(x, y)$ is achieved when $\sqrt{xy} = 0$, which implies $xy = 0$. Since $xy \geq 0$, we must have $xy = 0$, which means $x = 0$ or $y = 0$. Without loss of generality, let's consider $x = 0$. Then, from the constraint equation, we have $|y| = 20$, which implies $y = \pm 20$. When $x = 0$ and $y = 20$, we have $f(x, y) = 5(0^2 + 20^2) - 8(0)(20) = 2000$. When $x = 0$ and $y = -20$, we have $f(x, y) = 5(0^2 + (-20)^2) - 8(0)(-20) = 2000$. Therefore, the minimum value of $f(x, y)$ is 2000.

The answer is: $\boxed{2000}$

We will first rewrite the given equation $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$ and then use the inequality $|a| + |b| \geq |a+b|$ to find a relationship between $x$ and $y$.

Solution:

Step 1: Rewrite the given equation

The given equation $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$ can be rewritten as $|2y-x| + |2x-y| = 40$.

Step 2: Apply the inequality $|a| + |b| \geq |a+b|$

By applying the inequality $|a| + |b| \geq |a+b|$ to the terms $2y-x$ and $2x-y$, we get:

$|2y-x + 2x-y| \geq |(2y-x) + (2x-y)|$,

which simplifies to:

$|y| \geq |x|$.

Step 3: Substitute $y = kx$ into the expression $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$

Since $|y| \geq |x|$, we can substitute $y = kx$ into the expression $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$. This gives:

$5x^2+5(kx)^2-8x(kx) = 5x^2+5k^2x^2-8k x^2 = (5+5k^2-8k)x^2$.

Step 4: Find the minimum value of the expression

The expression $(5+5k^2-8k)x^2$ is a quadratic function in $k$. To find its minimum value, we can take the derivative with respect to $k$ and set it equal to zero:

$\frac{d}{dk} (5+5k^2-8k) = 10k - 8 = 0$.

Solving for $k$, we get $k = \frac{4}{5}$.

Step 5: Substitute $k = \frac{4}{5}$ into the expression $(5+5k^2-8k)x^2$

Substituting $k = \frac{4}{5}$ into the expression $(5+5k^2-8k)x^2$, we get:

$(5+5(\frac{4}{5})^2-8(\frac{4}{5}))x^2 = (5+5\cdot\frac{16}{25}-8\cdot\frac{4}{5})x^2 = (5+\frac{16}{5}-\frac{32}{5})x^2 = 0$.

Therefore, the minimum value of the expression $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ is 0.
The answer is: $\boxed{0}$

Solve the following problem with a Python Script (positive numerical answer):
"What is the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ when $x$ and $y$ range over all real numbers such that $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$?"

Approach:


This problem is a bit tricky, but we can solve it step by step.

First, we notice that the expression $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ can be rewritten as $(5x^2-8xy+5y^2)$, which is the square of a binomial: $(√5x - √5y)^2$. Therefore, the minimum value of $(5x^2+5y^2-8xy)$ is 0, which occurs when $x=y$.

Second, we need to find the relationship between $x$ and $y$ from the equation $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$. This equation simplifies to $|x-2y| + |x-y| = 40$.

We can split this into two cases:

Case 1: $x-2y \ge 0$ and $x-y \ge 0$. This implies $x \ge 2y$ and $x \ge y$. The equation becomes $x-2y + x-y = 40$, which simplifies to $2x-3y = 40$.

Case 2: $x-2y < 0$ and $x-y < 0$. This implies $x < 2y$ and $x < y$. The equation becomes $2y-x + y-x = 40$, which simplifies to $3y-2x = 40$.

Now we have a system of linear equations:
\[
\begin{cases}
2x-3y = 40 \\
3y-2x = 40
\end{cases}
\]

Adding these two equations gives $6y = 80$, so $y = \frac{40}{3}$. Substituting $y = \frac{40}{3}$ into the first equation gives $2x - 40 = 40$, so $2x = 80$ and $x = 40$.

Therefore, the solution to the system of equations is $x = 40$ and $y = \frac{40}{3}$. Since $x = y$ is a requirement for the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$, we can conclude that the minimum value occurs when $x = 40$ and $y = \frac{40}{3}$.

Finally, we substitute these values into the expression $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ to find the minimum value:
\[
5(40)^2 + 5\left(\frac{40}{3}\right)^2 - 8(40)\left(\frac{40}{3}\right) = 0
\]

So the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ is 0 when $x$ and $y$ range over all real numbers such that $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$. The answer is:
\[0\]

Approach:


To find the minimum value of the expression $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ subject to the constraint $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$, we can use the method of Lagrange multipliers. Let's define a new function $F(x, y, \lambda) = 5x^2+5y^2-8xy + \lambda (|x-2y| + |y-2x| - 40)$. The condition for the minimum is that the gradient of $F$ must be zero, i.e., $\nabla F(x, y, \lambda) = 0$.

We need to consider four cases corresponding to the different signs of $x-2y$ and $y-2x$:

1. $x-2y \geq 0$ and $y-2x \geq 0$. In this case, $|x-2y| = x-2y$ and $|y-2x| = y-2x$. So the constraint equation becomes $(x-2y) + (y-2x) = 40 \Rightarrow -x - y = 40$, which has no solutions.

2. $x-2y \geq 0$ and $y-2x < 0$. In this case, $|x-2y| = x-2y$ and $|y-2x| = 2x-y$. The constraint equation becomes $(x-2y) + (2x-y) = 40 \Rightarrow 3x - 3y = 40 \Rightarrow x - y = \frac{40}{3}$.

3. $x-2y < 0$ and $y-2x \geq 0$. In this case, $|x-2y| = 2y-x$ and $|y-2x| = y-2x$. The constraint equation becomes $(2y-x) + (y-2x) = 40 \Rightarrow 3y - 3x = 40 \Rightarrow y - x = \frac{40}{3}$.

4. $x-2y < 0$ and $y-2x < 0$. In this case, $|x-2y| = 2y-x$ and $|y-2x| = 2x-y$. The constraint equation becomes $(2y-x) + (2x-y) = 40 \Rightarrow x + y = 40$, which has no solutions.

So the only relevant constraint is $x - y = \frac{40}{3}$, which implies $y = x - \frac{40}{3}$.

Substituting this into the expression to be minimized, we get:

$$5x^2 + 5\left(x - \frac{40}{3}\right)^2 - 8x\left(x - \frac{40}{3}\right)$$
$$= 5x^2 + 5\left(x^2 - \frac{80x}{3} + \frac{1600}{9}\right) - 8x^2 + \frac{320x}{3}$$
$$= -3x^2 + \frac{320x}{3} + \frac{800}{3}$$

Now we need to find the minimum of this expression. Taking the derivative with respect to $x$ and setting it to zero:

$$-6x + \frac{320}{3} = 0 \Rightarrow x = \frac{160}{9}$$

Substituting this back into the equation for $y$:

$$y = \frac{160}{9} - \frac{40}{3} = \frac{40}{9}$$

Now we can substitute these values back into the expression to be minimized:

$$5\left(\frac{160}{9}\right)^2 + 5\left(\frac{40}{9}\right)^2 - 8\left(\frac{160}{9}\right)\left(\frac{40}{9}\right)$$
$$= \frac{128000}{81} + \frac{8000}{81} - \frac{51200}{81}$$
$$= \frac{128000 + 8000 - 51200}{81}$$
$$= \frac{84800}{81}$$

So the minimum value of the expression $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ subject to the constraint $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$ is $\frac{84800}{81}$.

The answer is: $\frac{84800}{81}$

Approach:


We will use the Cauchy-Schwarz inequality to solve this problem.

First, let's rewrite the expression $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ as $(x-2y)^2 + (y-2x)^2$.
Now, let's rewrite the equation $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$ as $(x-2y)^2 + (y-2x)^2 = 40^2$.

By the Cauchy-Schwarz inequality, we have
\[((1)^2 + (2)^2)((x-2y)^2 + (y-2x)^2) \geq (1(x-2y) + 2(y-2x))^2 = (x-2y-2(y-2x))^2 = (x-2y-2y+4x)^2 = (3x-4y)^2.\]

So, $(x-2y)^2 + (y-2x)^2 \geq \frac{(3x-4y)^2}{5}$.

But we know that $(x-2y)^2 + (y-2x)^2 = 40^2$.

So, $\frac{(3x-4y)^2}{5} \leq 40^2$, which implies $(3x-4y)^2 \leq 5 \cdot 40^2$.

Taking the square root of both sides, we get $|3x-4y| \leq 20\sqrt{5}$.

Now, let's consider the expression $(x-2y)^2 + (y-2x)^2 = 40^2$.

By the triangle inequality, we have $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$.

By the reverse triangle inequality, we have $|x-2y| - |y-2x| \leq |(x-2y) - (y-2x)| = |x-2y - y + 2x| = |3x - 3y| = 3|x-y|$.

So, $|x-2y| \leq 3|x-y| + |y-2x|$.

Combining this with $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$, we get $2|x-2y| \leq 40$, which implies $|x-2y| \leq 20$.

Similarly, we can show that $|y-2x| \leq 20$.

So, we have $-20 \leq 3x-4y \leq 20$, which implies $|3x-4y| \leq 20$.

Therefore, $(3x-4y)^2 \leq 400$.

So, $(x-2y)^2 + (y-2x)^2 = 40^2 \geq 400$.

Hence, the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ is achieved when $(x-2y)^2 + (y-2x)^2 = 400$.

In this case, the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ is $(3x-4y)^2$.

Let's find the minimum value of $(3x-4y)^2$ when $(x-2y)^2 + (y-2x)^2 = 400$.

By the Cauchy-Schwarz inequality, we have
\[((1)^2 + (2)^2)((x-2y)^2 + (y-2x)^2) \geq (1(x-2y) + 2(y-2x))^2 = (x-2y-2(y-2x))^2 = (x-2y-2y+4x)^2 = (3x-4y)^2.\]

So, $(1^2 + 2^2)(400) \geq (3x-4y)^2$.

Hence, $(3x-4y)^2 \leq 5 \cdot 400 = 2000$.

Therefore, the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ is $(3x-4y)^2 \geq 0$, and the maximum value is $(3x-4y)^2 \leq 2000$.

So, the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ is $0$, and the maximum value is $2000$.

Since we are looking for the minimum value, the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ is achieved when $(3x-4y)^2 = 0$, which implies $3x = 4y$.

Let's solve this equation along with the equation $(x-2y)^2 + (y-2x)^2 = 400$.

From $3x = 4y$, we get $y = \frac{3}{4}x$.

Substituting this into $(x-2y)^2 + (y-2x)^2 = 400$, we get
\[(x-2(\frac{3}{4}x))^2 + ((\frac{3}{4}x)-2x)^2 = 400.\]

Simplifying this equation, we get
\[(\frac{x}{4})^2 + ((\frac{-5}{4}x))^2 = 400.\]

This simplifies to
\[\frac{x^2}{16} + \frac{25x^2}{16} = 400.\]

Multiplying through by 16, we get
\[x^2 + 25x^2 = 6400.\]

Combining like terms, we get
\[26x^2 = 6400.\]

Dividing both sides by 26, we get
\[x^2 = \frac{6400}{26} = \frac{3200}{13}.\]

Taking the square root of both sides, we get
\[x = \sqrt{\frac{3200}{13}}.\]

Substituting this value of $x$ into $y = \frac{3}{4}x$, we get
\[y = \frac{3}{4} \sqrt{\frac{3200}{13}}.\]

Now, let's substitute these values of $x$ and $y$ into $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$.

We get
\[5(\sqrt{\frac{3200}{13}})^2 + 5(\frac{3}{4} \sqrt{\frac{3200}{13}})^2 - 8(\sqrt{\frac{3200}{13}})(\frac{3}{4} \sqrt{\frac{3200}{13}}).\]

Simplifying this expression, we get
\[5 \cdot \frac{3200}{13} + 5 \cdot \frac{2

The given problem involves finding the minimum value of a function subject to a constraint. We can use the method of Lagrange multipliers to solve this problem. Define the function $F(x, y, \lambda) = 5x^2 + 5y^2 - 8xy + \lambda(|x - 2y| + |y - 2x - 40)$. The method of Lagrange multipliers tells us that the minimum of the function subject to the constraint is achieved when the gradient of $F$ is zero. That is, $\nabla F(x, y, \lambda) = 0$. This gives us the following system of equations:

1. $\frac{\partial F}{\partial x} = 10x - 8y + \lambda(-1 + 2\delta_1) = 0$
2. $\frac{\partial F}{\partial y} = 10y - 8x + \lambda(1 - 2\delta_2) = 0$
3. $\frac{\partial F}{\partial \lambda} = |x - 2y| + |y - 2x - 40| - 40 = 0$

where $\delta_1 = \begin{cases} 1 & \text{if } x - 2y \geq 0 \\ -1 & \text{if } x - 2y < 0 \end{cases}$ and $\delta_2 = \begin{cases} 1 & \text{if } y - 2x - 40 \geq 0 \\ -1 & \text{if } y - 2x - 40 < 0 \end{cases}$.

Solving this system of equations is quite involved and requires considering different cases based on the values of $\delta_1$ and $\delta_2$. However, after solving the system, we find that the minimum value of the function is achieved at $x = 20$ and $y = 10$. Substituting these values into the function $5x^2 + 5y^2 - 8xy$, we get the minimum value to be $-100$. Therefore, the minimum value of the function $5x^2 + 5y^2 - 8xy$ subject to the constraint $|x - 2y| + |y - 2x| = 40$ is $-100$. The answer is: $-100$

To find the minimum value of the function $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ under the constraint $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$, we can use the method of Lagrange multipliers. We define a new function $F(x, y, \lambda) = 5x^2+5y^2-8xy + \lambda (|x-2y| + |y-2x| - 40)$. Then we need to find the gradient of $F$ and set it to zero. This gives us the following system of equations:

$\frac{\partial F}{\partial x} = 10x - 8y + \lambda (-1 + 2 \cdot \text{sgn}(x-2y)) = 0$

$\frac{\partial F}{\partial y} = 10y - 8x + \lambda (1 - 2 \cdot \text{sgn}(y-2x)) = 0$

$\frac{\partial F}{\partial \lambda} = |x-2y| + |y-2x| - 40 = 0$

Solving this system of equations is quite involved and requires considering different cases based on the signs of $x-2y$ and $y-2x$. After solving the system in each case, we find that the minimum value occurs at $x = 4$ and $y = 6$. Substituting these values into the original function gives us the minimum value:

$5(4)^2 + 5(6)^2 - 8(4)(6) = 80 - 96 = -16$.

So the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ is $-16$. The answer is: $-16$

We can use the method of completing the square to find the minimum value of the expression $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$.
First, we rewrite the expression as $5(x^2 - \frac{8}{5}xy) + 5(y^2 - \frac{8}{5}yx)$.
Now, we complete the square for both terms:
$5(x^2 - \frac{8}{5}xy + (\frac{4}{5}y)^2 - (\frac{4}{5}y)^2) + 5(y^2 - \frac{8}{5}yx + (\frac{4}{5}x)^2 - (\frac{4}{5}x)^2)$
$5[(x - \frac{4}{5}y)^2 - (\frac{4}{5}y)^2] + 5[(y - \frac{4}{5}x)^2 - (\frac{4}{5}x)^2]$
$5(x - \frac{4}{5}y)^2 - 5(\frac{4}{5}y)^2 + 5(y - \frac{4}{5}x)^2 - 5(\frac{4}{5}x)^2$
$5(x - \frac{4}{5}y)^2 + 5(y - \frac{4}{5}x)^2 - 5(\frac{16}{25}x^2 + \frac{16}{25}y^2)$
$5(x - \frac{4}{5}y)^2 + 5(y - \frac{4}{5}x)^2 - \frac{80}{25}(x^2 + y^2)$.
Since $x$ and $y$ satisfy the equation $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$, we know that $x^2 + y^2$ is a constant. Let's denote it as $k$.
Then the expression $5(x - \frac{4}{5}y)^2 + 5(y - \frac{4}{5}x)^2 - \frac{80}{25}k$ is a constant plus a sum of squares, so it is always greater than or equal to the constant part.
The minimum value of the expression is achieved when both $x - \frac{4}{5}y = 0$ and $y - \frac{4}{5}x = 0$, which gives $x = y = 0$.
Substituting $x = y = 0$ into the expression $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$, we get $0$.
So the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ is $0$. The answer is: $0$
