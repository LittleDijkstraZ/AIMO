"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"

Approach:

 The equation given in the problem is a product of two expressions equal to zero. This means that either the first expression is zero or the second expression is zero. 

Let's analyze the two expressions separately:

1. $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$

This equation implies that both $\vert x + y \vert - 10 = 0$ and $\vert x - y \vert - 10 = 0$. Therefore, $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. This gives us the system of equations:

$$x + y = \pm 10$$
$$x - y = \pm 10$$

Solving this system of equations, we find that the points that satisfy this equation are the points on the lines $x + y = 10$, $x + y = -10$, $x - y = 10$, and $x - y = -10$. These lines form a square with side length 10.

2. $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$

This equation implies that both $\vert x \vert - 8 = 0$ and $\vert y \vert - 8 = 0$. Therefore, $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$. This gives us the system of equations:

$$x = \pm 8$$
$$y = \pm 8$$

Solving this system of equations, we find that the points that satisfy this equation are the points on the lines $x = 8$, $x = -8$, $y = 8$, and $y = -8$. These lines form a square with side length 16.

Now, we can find the area of the convex polygon formed by the intersection of these two squares. The intersection of the two squares is another square with side length 10 (since the side length of the smaller square is the diagonal of the larger square). The area of a square is given by the square of its side length, so the area of the convex polygon is $10^2 = 100$.
The answer is: $100$

The equation given is a product of two expressions equal to zero. This means that either the first expression is zero or the second expression is zero.

Let's consider the first expression:
$$((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2) = 0.$$

This expression will be zero if and only if both terms inside the parentheses are zero, i.e., $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$.

The solutions to these equations are the lines $x + y = 10$ and $x - y = 10$, and the lines $x + y = -10$ and $x - y = -10$.

Similarly, for the second expression:
$$((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0.$$

This expression will be zero if and only if both terms inside the parentheses are zero, i.e., $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$.

The solutions to these equations are the lines $x = 8$ and $x = -8$, and the lines $y = 8$ and $y = -8$.

The intersection of these lines forms a square with side length $10$ (since the distance between the lines $x + y = 10$ and $x + y = -10$ is $10$, and similarly for the other pairs of lines).

The area of this square is $10^2 = 100$.

Therefore, the area of the convex polygon is $100$.

The answer is: $100$

Approach:

 The given equation is of the form $A \cdot B = 0$, which means either $A = 0$ or $B = 0$. So, we need to find the solutions for each part separately and then find the intersection of these solutions.

For $A = 0$, we have $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + (\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$. This is possible only if $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. This gives us four lines: $x + y = 10$, $x + y = -10$, $x - y = 10$, and $x - y = -10$.

For $B = 0$, we have $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + (\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$. This is possible only if $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$, which gives us four lines: $x = 8$, $x = -8$, $y = 8$, and $y = -8$.

Now we need to find the intersection of these lines. The intersection of $x + y = 10$ and $x = 8$ is $(8, 2)$, the intersection of $x + y = 10$ and $y = 8$ is $(2, 8)$, the intersection of $x + y = -10$ and $x = -8$ is $(-8, -2)$, and the intersection of $x + y = -10$ and $y = -8$ is $(-2, -8)$. The intersection of $x - y = 10$ and $x = 8$ is $(8, -2)$, the intersection of $x - y = 10$ and $y = 8$ is $(18, 8)$, the intersection of $x - y = -10$ and $x = -8$ is $(-8, 10)$, and the intersection of $x - y = -10$ and $y = -8$ is $(-18, -8)$.

Now we have the vertices of the polygon: $(8, 2)$, $(2, 8)$, $(-8, -2)$, $(-2, -8)$, $(8, -2)$, $(18, 8)$, $(-8, 10)$, and $(-18, -8)$. We can plot these points on a graph and see that they form a square with side length 16. The area of this square is $16^2 = 256$.
The answer is: 256

Solve the following problem with a Python Script (positive numerical answer):
"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"

Approach:



The equation given in the problem, $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$, is equivalent to the product of two terms being zero. This means that either the first term is zero or the second term is zero.

If the first term is zero, we have:

$$(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0.$$

This equation is satisfied only when both $\vert x + y \vert - 10 = 0$ and $\vert x - y \vert - 10 = 0$, which implies that $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. These two equations represent two squares with side length 10, and their intersection forms a square with side length 10.

If the second term is zero, we have:

$$(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0.$$

This equation is satisfied only when both $\vert x \vert - 8 = 0$ and $\vert y \vert - 8 = 0$, which implies that $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$. These two equations represent two squares with side length 8, and their intersection forms a square with side length 8.

Therefore, the points that satisfy the given equation form a square with side length 10, and its area is $10^2 = 100$.

```python


INTERMEDIATE OUT :

def area_of_polygon():
    side_length = 10
    area = side_length ** 2
    return area

result = area_of_polygon()
print(result)
```

CODE RESULTS 100

INTERMEDIATE OUT :
```output

The area of the convex polygon is 100 square units. The answer is $\boxed{100}$.
