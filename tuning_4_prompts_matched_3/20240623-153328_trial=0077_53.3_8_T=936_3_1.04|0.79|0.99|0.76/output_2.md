Solve the following problem with a Python Script (positive numerical answer):
"For how many positive integers $m$ does the equation \[\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}\] have $4$ distinct solutions?"
Write comments to indicate the steps you take. Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Approach:


We know that the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has 4 distinct solutions if and only if $\frac{m}{100}$ is less than 2 but greater than 0. This is because the function $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert$ oscillates between 0 and 4, and if $\frac{m}{100}$ is less than 2, then the equation will have at least 4 solutions. But if $\frac{m}{100}$ is greater than 2, then the equation will have more than 4 solutions. So, we need to find the values of $m$ such that $0 < \frac{m}{100} < 2$.

Solving for $m$:
Multiplying all sides of the inequalities by 100, we get $0 < m < 200$. Since $m$ is a positive integer, the possible values of $m$ are the integers from 1 to 199.

Counting the number of possible values:
There are 199 positive integers from 1 to 199.

So, the number of positive integers $m$ for which the equation has 4 distinct solutions is 199.
The answer is: 199

Approach:


The equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has 4 distinct solutions if and only if $\frac{m}{100}$ is less than 2 but greater than or equal to 0. This is because the function $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert$ is a "V" shape with the "valley" between 1 and 3, and the height of the "V" is 2. Therefore, $\frac{m}{100}$ must be less than 2 so that there are 4 intersections with the x-axis, and it must be greater than or equal to 0 so that the "V" is non-negative. This gives us the inequality $0 \leq \frac{m}{100} < 2$.

To find the number of positive integers $m$ that satisfy this inequality, we can solve for $m$:
\[0 \leq \frac{m}{100} < 2 \implies 0 \leq m < 200.\]

The positive integers $m$ that satisfy this inequality are the integers from 1 to 199.

So, the number of positive integers $m$ for which the equation has 4 distinct solutions is the number of integers from 1 to 199, which is 199.

The answer is: 199.

Solve the following problem with a Python Script (positive numerical answer):
"For how many positive integers $m$ does the equation \[\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}\] have $4$ distinct solutions?"

Assistant:

Approach:

 The equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has 4 distinct solutions,
which means the expression inside the absolute value, $\vert x-1 \vert -2$,
must change its sign twice in the interval where we are looking for solutions.
This happens when the value of $\frac{m}{100}$ is between 2 and 1,
so we have $1 < \frac{m}{100} < 2$, which gives $100 < m < 200$.
The positive integers $m$ in this interval are the integers from 101 to 199,
so there are $199 - 101 + 1 = 99$ such integers.

Therefore, the number of positive integers $m$ for which the equation has 4 distinct solutions is 99. The answer is: $99$

Solve the following problem with a Python Script (positive numerical answer):
"For how many positive integers $m$ does the equation \[\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}\] have $4$ distinct solutions?"
Write comments to indicate the steps you take. Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Approach:


We can start by analyzing the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$.
The number of distinct solutions depends on the value of $\frac{m}{100}$.
When $\frac{m}{100} < 2$, the equation has no solution.
When $\frac{m}{100} = 2$, the equation has two solutions.
When $2 < \frac{m}{100} < 4$, the equation has four distinct solutions.
When $\frac{m}{100} = 4$, the equation has two solutions.
When $\frac{m}{100} > 4$, the equation has no solution.
So, the value of $\frac{m}{100}$ must be in the interval $(2, 4)$ for the equation to have four distinct solutions.
Therefore, the possible values of $m$ are those integers in the interval $(200, 400)$.
We need to find how many such integers there are.

```python


INTERMEDIATE OUT :

def count_m():
    return len([m for m in range(200, 401) if 2 < m/100 < 4])

result = count_m()
print(result)
```

CODE RESULTS 199

INTERMEDIATE OUT :
```output
199
```
The number of positive integers $m$ for which the equation has four distinct solutions is $199$. The answer is: $199$
