 The equation given is equal to zero, which means either the first expression inside the first set of parentheses is zero, or the second expression inside the second set of parentheses is zero, or both are zero.

The expression $|x+y|-10=0$ simplifies to $|x+y|=10$, which means $x+y=10$ or $x+y=-10$. Similarly, $|x-y|=10$ simplifies to $x-y=10$ or $x-y=-10$, $|x|=8$ simplifies to $x=8$ or $x=-8$, and $|y|=8$ simplifies to $y=8$ or $y=-8$.

These equations represent lines in the coordinate plane. The intersection points of these lines are the vertices of the polygon. We can find these intersection points by solving the systems of equations formed by pairs of these equations. There are 8 possible combinations:

1. $x+y=10$, $x-y=10$ gives $(x,y)=(10,0)$.
2. $x+y=10$, $x-y=-10$ gives $(x,y)=(0,10)$.
3. $x+y=-10$, $x-y=10$ gives $(x,y)=(-10,0)$.
4. $x+y=-10$, $x-y=-10$ gives $(x,y)=(0,-10)$.
5. $x+y=10$, $x=-8$ gives $(x,y)=(8,2)$.
6. $x+y=10$, $y=-8$ gives $(x,y)=(-2,12)$.
7. $x+y=-10$, $x=-8$ gives $(x,y)=(-8,-2)$.
8. $x+y=-10$, $y=-8$ gives $(x,y)=(2,-12)$.

These intersection points are the vertices of the polygon. To find the area of the polygon, we can use the Shoelace formula. The Shoelace formula is a method for finding the area of a polygon given the coordinates of its vertices. The formula is given by:

\[A = \frac{1}{2} |(x_1y_2 + x_2y_3 + \cdots + x_ny_1) - (y_1x_2 + y_2x_3 + \cdots + y_nx_1)|.\]

Applying the Shoelace formula to the coordinates $(10,0)$, $(0,10)$, $(-10,0)$, $(0,-10)$, $(8,2)$, $(-2,12)$, $(-8,-2)$, $(2,-12)$, we get:

\[A = \frac{1}{2} |(0 + 0 + 0 + 0 + 16 + 16 + 16 + 16) - (0 + 0 + 0 + 0 - 16 - 16 - 16 - 16)| = 128.\]

Therefore, the area of the polygon is 128 square units. The answer is: $128$

Below is a math problem you are to solve (positive numerical answer!):
"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"

Assistant:

 The equation $A \cdot B = 0$ implies that at least one of the factors is zero. Therefore, the given equation is equivalent to the following system of equations:
1. $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$,
2. $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$,
3. $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$, and
4. $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$.

Each of these equations implies that the absolute value of a quantity is equal to 10 or 8. The solutions to these equations are the points where the absolute value equals 10 or 8. 

For example, the solutions to $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ are all points $(x, y)$ such that $x + y = 10$ or $x + y = -10$. Similarly, the solutions to $\vert x - y \vert = 10$ are all points $(x, y)$ such that $x - y = 10$ or $x - y = -10$.

The solutions to $\vert x \vert = 8$ are all points $(x, y)$ such that $x = 8$ or $x = -8$, and the solutions to $\vert y \vert = 8$ are all points $(x, y)$ such that $y = 8$ or $y = -8$.

Plotting these points in the coordinate plane, we see that they form a square with side length 16. The area of this square is $16^2 = 256$. Therefore, the area of the convex polygon is 256 square units. The answer is: 256.

Below is a math problem you are to solve (positive numerical answer!):
"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"

 The equation given in the problem is a product of two expressions equal to zero. Therefore, one of the expressions must be zero for the entire equation to be zero.

This gives us two separate cases to consider:

1. $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$
2. $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$

In the first case, for the sum of two squares to be zero, both squares must be zero:
$\vert x + y \vert - 10 = 0 \Rightarrow \vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert - 10 = 0 \Rightarrow \vert x - y \vert = 10$.
This gives us the square with side length 20 centered at the origin (0,0).

In the second case, for the sum of two squares to be zero, both squares must be zero:
$\vert x \vert - 8 = 0 \Rightarrow \vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert - 8 = 0 \Rightarrow \vert y \vert = 8$.
This gives us a square with side length 16 centered at the origin (0,0).

The intersection of these two squares is the convex polygon we are looking for. This polygon is a square with side length 10 (the smaller of the two side lengths), centered at the origin. To find the area of this square, simply square the side length: $10^2 = 100$.
The answer is: $100$

"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"

First, let's analyze the given equation:

\[((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0\]

This equation is satisfied if either of the two factors is zero. That is:

\[((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2) = 0 \text{ or } ((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0\]

The first factor is zero if both $\vert x + y \vert - 10 = 0$ and $\vert x - y \vert - 10 = 0$, which means $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. This forms a square with side length 10.

The second factor is zero if both $\vert x \vert - 8 = 0$ and $\vert y \vert - 8 = 0$, which means $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$. This forms a square with side length 8.

Therefore, the points that satisfy the given equation form two squares: one with side length 10 and the other with side length 8. The convex polygon formed by these points is the union of these two squares.

The area of a square is given by the square of its side length. Therefore, the area of the square with side length 10 is $10^2 = 100$, and the area of the square with side length 8 is $8^2 = 64$.

The area of the convex polygon formed by these points is the sum of the areas of these two squares, which is $100 + 64 = 164$.

So the area of the convex polygon is 164. The answer is: $164$

The equation $AB=0$ implies that $A=0$ or $B=0$. Therefore, either $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$. 

If $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$, then $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. This means that the points lie on the lines $x + y = \pm 10$ and $x - y = \pm 10$.

If $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$, then $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$. This means that the points lie on the lines $x = \pm 8$ and $y = \pm 8$.

The convex polygon is formed by the intersections of these lines. It is a square with side length 16. Therefore, its area is $16^2 = 256$.
The answer is: $256$

Below is a math problem you are to solve (positive numerical answer!):
"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"

Assistant:


The equation $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ is equal to zero if and only if either of the two terms is zero.
The first term is zero when $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$, which means $x + y = \pm 10$ and $x - y = \pm 10$. Solving these equations gives us the lines $y = -x \pm 10$ and $y = x \pm 10$.
The second term is zero when $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$, which means $x = \pm 8$ and $y = \pm 8$. This gives us the lines $x = \pm 8$ and $y = \pm 8$.
The points that satisfy both conditions are the intersections of these lines. The convex polygon formed by these points is a square with side length 16.
To find the area of this square, we simply square the length of one of its sides, so the area is $16^2 = 256$. The answer is: $256$

Below is a math problem you are to solve (positive numerical answer!):
"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"

 The equation is satisfied only when both $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ and $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ or both $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ and $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$.
From the first pair of equations, we have $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. This gives us four lines in the coordinate plane: $x + y = 10$, $x + y = -10$, $x - y = 10$, and $x - y = -10$. These lines form a square with side length 10 and diagonals of length $10\sqrt{2}$.
From the second pair of equations, we have $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$. This gives us four lines in the coordinate plane: $x = 8$, $x = -8$, $y = 8$, and $y = -8$. These lines form a square with side length 16 and diagonals of length $16\sqrt{2}$.
The intersection of the two squares is a smaller square with side length 10 and diagonals of length $10\sqrt{2}$.
To find the area of this square, we can use the formula for the area of a square, which is $s^2$, where $s$ is the side length of the square. The area of the square is therefore $10^2 = 100$.
So, the area of the convex polygon is 100 square units.

The given equation is equal to zero if and only if both factors are equal to zero. So we have two systems of equations:

1. $|x + y| - 10 = 0 \implies |x + y| = 10$,
2. $|x - y| - 10 = 0 \implies |x - y| = 10$,
3. $|x| - 8 = 0 \implies |x| = 8$,
4. $|y| - 8 = 0 \implies |y| = 8$.

From 3 and 4, we have $x = \pm 8$ and $y = \pm 8$. 

From 1 and 2, we have $x + y = \pm 10$ and $x - y = \pm 10$. Solving these system of equations gives us the vertices of the polygon: $(8, 2), (8, -2), (-8, 2), (-8, -2)$.

These points form a square with side length 10. The area of a square is side length squared, so the area of this square is $10^2 = 100$. The answer is: $100$
