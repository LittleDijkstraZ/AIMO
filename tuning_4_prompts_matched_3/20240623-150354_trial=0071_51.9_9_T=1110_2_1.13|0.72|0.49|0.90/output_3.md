Question (hint: positive numerical answer):
"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"
Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:


The equation $AB = 0$ is equivalent to $A = 0$ or $B = 0$. Therefore, the given equation is equivalent to either $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$.
For the first equation, $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$, both terms must be zero, which means $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. This implies that $x + y = \pm 10$ and $x - y = \pm 10$. Solving these equations gives us the vertices of the polygon: $(0, 10)$, $(0, -10)$, $(10, 0)$, and $(-10, 0)$.
For the second equation, $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$, both terms must be zero, which means $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$. This implies that $x = \pm 8$ and $y = \pm 8$. Solving these equations gives us the vertices of the polygon: $(8, 0)$, $(-8, 0)$, $(0, 8)$, and $(0, -8)$.
The polygon is a square with side length 10, so its area is $10^2 = 100$. The answer is: $100$

Question (hint: positive numerical answer):
"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"
Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:


The expression $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2)$ equals zero if and only if either $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$.

This happens if and only if either $\vert x + y \vert = 10$, $\vert x - y \vert = 10$, $\vert x \vert = 8$, or $\vert y \vert = 8$.

The equations $\vert x + y \vert = 10$, $\vert x - y \vert = 10$, $\vert x \vert = 8$, and $\vert y \vert = 8$ represent the sides of a square with side length 8.

The area of this square is $8^2 = 64$.
The answer is: $64$

Question (hint: positive numerical answer):
"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"
Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:



First, let's understand the given equation:

$$((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0.$$

This equation is true if either of the two factors is zero.

For the first factor to be zero, we must have:

$$(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0 \quad \text{or} \quad (\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0.$$

This implies that $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ or $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. These are the equations of two lines in the plane, and the points that satisfy either of these conditions form a square with side length 20.

For the second factor to be zero, we must have:

$$(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0 \quad \text{or} \quad (\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0.$$

This implies that $\vert x \vert = 8$ or $\vert y \vert = 8$. These are the equations of two lines in the plane, and the points that satisfy either of these conditions form a square with side length 16.

The intersection of these two squares is the convex polygon we are interested in. This polygon is a square with side length equal to the shorter side of the two squares, which is 16.

The area of a square with side length $s$ is $s^2$. Therefore, the area of the convex polygon is $16^2 = 256$. The answer is: $256$

"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"
Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:


The expression $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2)$ is equal to zero if and only if both of its factors are equal to zero.

The first factor is equal to zero if and only if $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ or $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. These are the equations of two lines passing through the origin at an angle of $45^\circ$ and $-45^\circ$, respectively.

The second factor is equal to zero if and only if $\vert x \vert = 8$ or $\vert y \vert = 8$. These are the equations of two lines parallel to the y-axis at a distance of 8 units from the origin and two lines parallel to the x-axis at a distance of 8 units from the origin, respectively.

The intersection points of these lines are the vertices of the polygon. By calculating these points, we find that the polygon is a square with side length 16 units.

The area of this square is $16^2 = 256$.
The answer is: $256$

Question (hint: positive numerical answer):
"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"
Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:


The product of two numbers is zero if and only if at least one of the numbers is zero. Therefore, the equation
$$((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$$
is satisfied if either
$$((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2) = 0$$
or
$$((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0.$$
The first equation is satisfied if and only if $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. These two equations represent two squares, and their intersection forms a square with side length 10.
The second equation is satisfied if and only if $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$, which represents a square with side length 16.
The points that satisfy either of these conditions form a convex polygon, which is the union of the two squares. The area of the convex polygon is the sum of the areas of the two squares, which is $10^2 + 16^2 = 100 + 256 = 356$.
Therefore, the area of the convex polygon is 356 square units. The answer is: $356$

Question (hint: positive numerical answer):
"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"
Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:



The expression $AB=0$ is equivalent to $A=0$ or $B=0$. So, the given equation is equivalent to the union of the following two equations:
\begin{align*}
(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 &= 0, \\
(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 &= 0.
\end{align*}

For the first equation, $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$, to hold, we must have $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. This means that $x + y = \pm 10$ and $x - y = \pm 10$. Solving these four equations, we get the vertices of the polygon as $(0, 10)$, $(0, -10)$, $(10, 0)$, and $(-10, 0)$.

For the second equation, $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$, to hold, we must have $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$. This means that $x = \pm 8$ and $y = \pm 8$. Solving these four equations, we get the vertices of the polygon as $(8, 0)$, $(-8, 0)$, $(0, 8)$, and $(0, -8)$.

Now, we can plot these points on a coordinate plane and connect them to form a square. The side length of the square is the distance between any two adjacent vertices, which can be found using the distance formula. For example, the distance between $(0, 10)$ and $(0, -10)$ is $20$. So, the side length of the square is 20.

The area of the square is the side length squared, which is $20^2 = 400$.

So, the area of the convex polygon is 400. The answer is: $400$

Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:



The expression $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2)$ is equal to zero if and only if either $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$, $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$, $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$, or $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$. Each of these equations implies that either $\vert x + y \vert = 10$, $\vert x - y \vert = 10$, $\vert x \vert = 8$, or $\vert y \vert = 8$.

The equation $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ defines a square with side length 10, centered at the origin, and with sides parallel to the coordinate axes. The equation $\vert x - y \vert = 10$ also defines a square with side length 10, centered at the origin, and with sides parallel to the coordinate axes. The equation $\vert x \vert = 8$ defines a square with side length 16, centered at the origin, and with sides parallel to the coordinate axes. The equation $\vert y \vert = 8$ also defines a square with side length 16, centered at the origin, and with sides parallel to the coordinate axes.

The intersection of these four squares is a square with side length 8, centered at the origin, and with sides parallel to the coordinate axes. The area of this square is $8^2 = 64$.

So the area of the convex polygon is 64. The answer is: $64$

Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:


The product of two numbers is zero if and only if at least one of the numbers is zero. So, the equation $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ is satisfied if either $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$.

If $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$, then $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. This means that $x + y = \pm 10$ and $x - y = \pm 10$. Solving these equations, we get the four lines $x + y = 10$, $x + y = -10$, $x - y = 10$, and $x - y = -10$.

If $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$, then $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$. This means that $x = \pm 8$ and $y = \pm 8$. So we get the four lines $x = 8$, $x = -8$, $y = 8$, and $y = -8$.

The intersection of these lines form a square with side length 10 (since the distance between the lines $x + y = 10$ and $x + y = -10$ is 10, and the same for the lines $x - y = 10$ and $x - y = -10$). The area of this square is $10^2 = 100$.
The answer is: $100$

"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"
Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:


The product of two numbers is zero if and only if at least one of the numbers is zero. So, we have two cases to consider:

Case 1: $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$. This means that $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. This implies that $x + y = \pm 10$ and $x - y = \pm 10$. Solving these four equations gives us the vertices of the polygon: $(8,2)$, $(8,-2)$, $(-8,2)$, and $(-8,-2)$.

Case 2: $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$. This means that $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$. This implies that $x = \pm 8$ and $y = \pm 8$. Solving these four equations gives us the same vertices as in Case 1.

So, the vertices of the polygon are $(8,2)$, $(8,-2)$, $(-8,2)$, and $(-8,-2)$. This is a square with side length 16. The area of a square is side length squared, so the area of this square is $16^2 = 256$. The answer is: $256$

Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:


The equation is satisfied if either of the factors is zero.
The first factor is zero if $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ or $\vert x - y \vert = 10$.
These are the equations of two squares with side length 10 centered at the origin.
The second factor is zero if $\vert x \vert = 8$ or $\vert y \vert = 8$.
These are the equations of two squares with side length 16 centered at the origin.
The intersection of these four squares is a convex polygon.
The area of this polygon is the sum of the areas of the four squares minus the areas of the two overlapping squares.
The area of a square with side length $a$ is $a^2$.
The side length of the first square is 10, so its area is $10^2 = 100$.
The side length of the second square is 16, so its area is $16^2 = 256$.
The overlapping square has side length 8 (the shorter of the two), so its area is $8^2 = 64$.
Therefore, the area of the convex polygon is $4(100) - 2(64) = 400 - 128 = 272$. The answer is: $272$

Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:


The expression $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2)$ is equal to zero if and only if either $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$, $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$, $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$, or $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$.
Each of these equations implies that $\vert x + y \vert = 10$, $\vert x - y \vert = 10$, $\vert x \vert = 8$, or $\vert y \vert = 8$.
The equations $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$ describe a square with side length 10, centered at the origin.
The equations $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$ describe a square with side length 16, centered at the origin.
The intersection of these two squares is the convex polygon we are looking for.
The area of this convex polygon is the area of the square with side length 10, which is $10^2 = 100$. The answer is: $100$

"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"
Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:


The expression $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ is true if and only if either of the two factors is zero.

The first factor is zero when either $\vert x + y \vert - 10 = 0$ or $\vert x - y \vert - 10 = 0$. These equations simplify to $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. The solutions to these equations form a square with side length 20.

The second factor is zero when either $\vert x \vert - 8 = 0$ or $\vert y \vert - 8 = 0$. These equations simplify to $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$. The solutions to these equations form a square with side length 16.

The intersection of the solutions to these two sets of equations is the square with side length 8, which is the inner square.

The area of the outer square is $20^2 = 400$, and the area of the inner square is $8^2 = 64$. Therefore, the area of the convex polygon enclosed by the points that satisfy the equation is $400 - 64 = 336$. The answer is: $336$

Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:


The expression equals zero if either $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$.
This means that either $\vert x + y \vert = 10$, $\vert x - y \vert = 10$, $\vert x \vert = 8$, or $\vert y \vert = 8$.
The absolute value equations $\vert x + y \vert = 10$, $\vert x - y \vert = 10$, $\vert x \vert = 8$, and $\vert y \vert = 8$ represent the equations of four lines in the coordinate plane.
The intersection points of these lines form a rectangle with side lengths 16 and 20.
The area of this rectangle is $16 \times 20 = 320$.
Therefore, the area of the convex polygon is 320. The answer is: $320$

"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"
Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:



First, we need to understand the conditions under which the product of two numbers is zero. If $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$, then either the first factor is zero or the second factor is zero.

If the first factor is zero, then both $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2$ and $( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2$ must be zero. This means that $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. This implies that $x + y = \pm 10$ and $x - y = \pm 10$. Solving these equations gives us four lines: $x + y = 10$, $x + y = -10$, $x - y = 10$, and $x - y = -10$.

If the second factor is zero, then both $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2$ and $( \vert y \vert - 8)^2$ must be zero. This means that $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$. This implies that $x = \pm 8$ and $y = \pm 8$. Solving these equations gives us four lines: $x = 8$, $x = -8$, $y = 8$, and $y = -8$.

The intersection of these lines forms a square with side length 10. The area of this square is $10^2 = 100$. Therefore, the area of the convex polygon is 100. The answer is: $100$
