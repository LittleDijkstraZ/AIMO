Question (hint: positive numerical answer):
"For how many positive integers $m$ does the equation \[\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}\] have $4$ distinct solutions?"
Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:



The equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has 4 distinct solutions.
This means that the expression inside the absolute value, $\vert x-1 \vert -2$, must be equal to $\frac{m}{100}$, $-\frac{m}{100}$, $2+\frac{m}{100}$, or $-2-\frac{m}{100}$.
We can solve each of these cases separately.

Case 1: $\vert x-1 \vert -2 = \frac{m}{100}$
Adding 2 to both sides gives $\vert x-1 \vert = 2 + \frac{m}{100}$.
This means $x-1 = 2 + \frac{m}{100}$ or $x-1 = -(2 + \frac{m}{100})$.
Solving for $x$ in each equation gives $x = 3 + \frac{m}{100}$ or $x = -1 - \frac{m}{100}$.

Case 2: $\vert x-1 \vert -2 = -\frac{m}{100}$
Adding 2 to both sides gives $\vert x-1 \vert = 2 - \frac{m}{100}$.
This means $x-1 = 2 - \frac{m}{100}$ or $x-1 = -(2 - \frac{m}{100})$.
Solving for $x$ in each equation gives $x = 3 - \frac{m}{100}$ or $x = -1 + \frac{m}{100}$.

Case 3: $\vert x-1 \vert -2 = 2 + \frac{m}{100}$
Adding 2 to both sides gives $\vert x-1 \vert = 4 + \frac{m}{100}$.
This equation has no solutions because the absolute value of a number cannot be negative.

Case 4: $\vert x-1 \vert -2 = -2 - \frac{m}{100}$
Adding 2 to both sides gives $\vert x-1 \vert = - \frac{m}{100}$.
This equation also has no solutions because the absolute value of a number cannot be negative.

So, the only possible values of $x$ are $3 + \frac{m}{100}$, $-1 - \frac{m}{100}$, $3 - \frac{m}{100}$, and $-1 + \frac{m}{100}$.
These are 4 distinct solutions if and only if the expressions $\frac{m}{100}$, $- \frac{m}{100}$, $\frac{m}{100}$, and $- \frac{m}{100}$ are all positive.
This means $m$ must be positive.

Therefore, the number of positive integers $m$ for which the equation has 4 distinct solutions is the number of positive integers $m$ such that $0 < \frac{m}{100} < 2$.
This is the same as the number of positive integers $m$ such that $0 < m < 200$.
The positive integers $m$ that satisfy this condition are 1 through 199.
So, there are 199 positive integers $m$ for which the equation has 4 distinct solutions. The answer is: $199$

Question (hint: positive numerical answer):
"For how many positive integers $m$ does the equation \[\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}\] have $4$ distinct solutions?"
Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:


The equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has 4 distinct solutions if and only if $\frac{m}{100} = 2$.
This is because the expression inside the absolute value, $\vert x-1 \vert -2$, changes its sign at $x=1$, so the equation has 4 distinct solutions when the right side of the equation equals the value that the expression inside the absolute value takes at $x=1$, which is 2.

So, we need to solve the equation $\frac{m}{100} = 2$.
Multiplying both sides by 100 gives $m = 200$.

Therefore, there is only one positive integer $m$ for which the equation has 4 distinct solutions, and that is $m = 200$. The answer is: $1$

Question (hint: positive numerical answer):
"For how many positive integers $m$ does the equation \[\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}\] have $4$ distinct solutions?"
Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:


The equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has 4 distinct solutions if and only if $\frac{m}{100}$ is equal to 2.
This is because the function $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert$ is a "V" shape with the "valleys" at $x=1\pm2$, or $x=-1$ and $x=3$.
For $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ to have 4 distinct solutions, the value of $\frac{m}{100}$ must be the height of the "V" shape, which is 2.
So, we have $\frac{m}{100}=2$, which implies $m=200$.
Therefore, there is only one positive integer $m$ that makes the equation have 4 distinct solutions, and that is $m=200$. The answer is: $1$

Question (hint: positive numerical answer):
"For how many positive integers $m$ does the equation \[\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}\] have $4$ distinct solutions?"
Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:



The equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has 4 distinct solutions.
The expression $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert$ is equal to a positive constant $\frac{m}{100}$.
This means that $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert$ must be greater than 0.
So, $\vert x-1 \vert -2 > 0$, which implies $\vert x-1 \vert > 2$.
This gives us two cases:
1) $x-1 > 2$, which implies $x > 3$.
2) $x-1 < -2$, which implies $x < -1$.
Now, we consider each case separately:

Case 1: $x > 3$
In this case, $\vert x-1 \vert = x-1$. So, the equation becomes $x-1-2 = \frac{m}{100}$, which simplifies to $x-3 = \frac{m}{100}$.
The solutions to this equation are $x = 3 + \frac{m}{100}$.

Case 2: $x < -1$
In this case, $\vert x-1 \vert = 1-x$. So, the equation becomes $1-x-2 = \frac{m}{100}$, which simplifies to $1-x-2 = \frac{m}{100}$, or $-x-1 = \frac{m}{100}$.
The solutions to this equation are $x = -1 - \frac{m}{100}$.

Now, we want the number of positive integers $m$ such that both $3 + \frac{m}{100}$ and $-1 - \frac{m}{100}$ are distinct solutions.
This means that $3 + \frac{m}{100} \neq -1 - \frac{m}{100}$.
Simplifying this inequality gives $4 = \frac{2m}{100}$, or $2m = 400$.
So, $m = 200$.
Therefore, there is only one positive integer $m$ that makes the equation have 4 distinct solutions, and that is $m = 200$.
The answer is: 1

Question (hint: positive numerical answer):
"For how many positive integers $m$ does the equation \[\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}\] have $4$ distinct solutions?"
Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:


The equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has 4 distinct solutions.
This equation represents a piecewise function with 4 cases.
Case 1: $\vert x-1 \vert -2 = \frac{m}{100}$
Case 2: $-\vert x-1 \vert +2 = \frac{m}{100}$
Case 3: $\vert x-1 \vert -2 = -\frac{m}{100}$
Case 4: $-\vert x-1 \vert +2 = -\frac{m}{100}$
For each case, we need to find the values of $m$ that give 4 distinct solutions.
Case 1: $\vert x-1 \vert = 2 + \frac{m}{100}$
The expression inside the absolute value is positive when $x > 1$, so we have $x - 1 = 2 + \frac{m}{100}$, which gives $x = 3 + \frac{m}{100}$.
The expression inside the absolute value is negative when $x < 1$, so we have $-(x - 1) = 2 + \frac{m}{100}$, which gives $x = -1 + \frac{m}{100}$.
For Case 1 to have 4 distinct solutions, the expressions $3 + \frac{m}{100}$ and $-1 + \frac{m}{100}$ must be distinct. This gives us $3 - (-1) = 4 \neq \frac{m}{100}$. So, this case does not give us the desired 4 distinct solutions.
Case 2: $\vert x-1 \vert = 2 - \frac{m}{100}$
The expression inside the absolute value is positive when $x > 1$, so we have $x - 1 = 2 - \frac{m}{100}$, which gives $x = 3 - \frac{m}{100}$.
The expression inside the absolute value is negative when $x < 1$, so we have $-(x - 1) = 2 - \frac{m}{100}$, which gives $x = -1 - \frac{m}{100}$.
For Case 2 to have 4 distinct solutions, the expressions $3 - \frac{m}{100}$ and $-1 - \frac{m}{100}$ must be distinct. This gives us $3 - (-1) = 4 \neq \frac{m}{100}$. So, this case also does not give us the desired 4 distinct solutions.
Case 3: $\vert x-1 \vert = 2 - \frac{m}{100}$
This case is the same as Case 2, and does not give us the desired 4 distinct solutions.
Case 4: $\vert x-1 \vert = 2 + \frac{m}{100}$
This case is the same as Case 1, and does not give us the desired 4 distinct solutions.
Therefore, none of the cases give us the desired 4 distinct solutions.
However, we made a mistake in our analysis. We assumed that the absolute value of a quantity cannot be negative, but this is not always true. For example, $|\frac{m}{100} - 2| = 2 - \frac{m}{100}$ when $\frac{m}{100} < 2$. So, we need to re-analyze the cases.
Case 1: $\vert x-1 \vert -2 = \frac{m}{100}$
The expression inside the absolute value is positive when $x > 1$, so we have $x - 1 - 2 = \frac{m}{100}$, which gives $x = 3 + \frac{m}{100}$.
The expression inside the absolute value is negative when $x < 1$, so we have $-(x - 1) - 2 = \frac{m}{100}$, which gives $x = -1 + \frac{m}{100}$.
For Case 1 to have 4 distinct solutions, the expressions $3 + \frac{m}{100}$ and $-1 + \frac{m}{100}$ must be distinct. This gives us $3 - (-1) = 4 \neq \frac{m}{100}$. So, this case does not give us the desired 4 distinct solutions.
However, we need to consider the case where $|\frac{m}{100} - 2| = 2 - \frac{m}{100}$ when $\frac{m}{100} < 2$. This gives us two additional solutions: $x = 1 + 2 - \frac{m}{100} = 3 - \frac{m}{100}$ and $x = 1 - 2 + \frac{m}{100} = -1 + \frac{m}{100}$.
So, for this case, we have 4 distinct solutions: $x = 3 + \frac{m}{100}$, $x = -1 + \frac{m}{100}$, $x = 3 - \frac{m}{100}$, and $x = -1 + \frac{m}{100}$.
Therefore, for this case, we have the desired 4 distinct solutions.
Case 2: $-\vert x-1 \vert +2 = \frac{m}{100}$
This case is equivalent to Case 1, and also gives us the desired 4 distinct solutions.
Case 3: $\vert x-1 \vert -2 = -\frac{m}{100}$
This case is equivalent to Case 1, and also gives us the desired 4 distinct solutions.
Case 4: $-\vert x-1 \vert +2 = -\frac{m}{100}$
This case is equivalent to Case 2, and also gives us the desired 4 distinct solutions.
Therefore, the value of $m$ that gives us the desired 4 distinct solutions is any positive integer $m$ such that $0 < \frac{m}{100} < 2$. This means $0 < m < 200$. The number of positive integers in this range is 199.
The value of $m$ that gives us the desired 4 distinct solutions is any positive integer $m$ such that $0 < \frac{m}{100} < 2$. This means $0 < m < 200$. The number of positive integers in this range is 199.
Therefore, the number of positive integers $m$ that satisfy the condition is 199. The answer is: $\boxed{199}$

Question (hint: positive numerical answer):
"For how many positive integers $m$ does the equation \[\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}\] have $4$ distinct solutions?"
Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:


The equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has $4$ distinct solutions.
We know that the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=k$ has $4$ distinct solutions when $0<k<1$.
So in our case, we have $\frac{m}{100}=k$ with $0<k<1$.
This means $0<\frac{m}{100}<1$, or equivalently, $0<m<100$.
The number of positive integers $m$ in this range is $99$.
Therefore, there are $99$ positive integers $m$ for which the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has $4$ distinct solutions.
The answer is: $99$.

"For how many positive integers $m$ does the equation \[\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}\] have $4$ distinct solutions?"
Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:


The equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has $4$ distinct solutions.
The absolute value function $\vert x \vert$ splits into two cases: $x \ge 0$ and $x < 0$.
So, we have two absolute value functions inside the absolute value function, which results in four cases to consider:
1. $x-1 \ge 0$ and $\vert x-1 \vert -2 \ge 0$. This gives us $x \ge 1$ and $\vert x-1 \vert \ge 2$, which simplifies to $x \ge 1$ and $x \ge 3$ or $x \le -1$. So, we have $x \ge 3$.
2. $x-1 \ge 0$ and $\vert x-1 \vert -2 < 0$. This gives us $x \ge 1$ and $0 \le \vert x-1 \vert < 2$, which simplifies to $x \ge 1$ and $-2 < x-1 < 2$. So, we have $1 \le x < 3$.
3. $x-1 < 0$ and $\vert x-1 \vert -2 \ge 0$. This gives us $x < 1$ and $\vert -x+1 \vert \ge 2$, which simplifies to $x < 1$ and $\vert x-1 \vert \ge 2$, which gives us $x < 1$ and $x \ge 3$ or $x \le -1$. This is not possible since $x < 1$.
4. $x-1 < 0$ and $\vert x-1 \vert -2 < 0$. This gives us $x < 1$ and $0 \le \vert -x+1 \vert < 2$, which simplifies to $x < 1$ and $-2 < -x+1 < 2$. So, we have $-1 \le x < 1$.

So, the solutions to the equation are $1 \le x < 3$ and $-1 \le x < 1$. This means the solutions are $-1 \le x < 1$ and $1 \le x < 3$. The equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has $4$ distinct solutions when $\frac{m}{100} = 1$. Thus, $m = 100$. The value of $m$ is $100$. The answer is: $1$
