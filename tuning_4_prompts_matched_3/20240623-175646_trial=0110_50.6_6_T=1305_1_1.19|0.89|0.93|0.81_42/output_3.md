Below is a math problem you are to solve (positive numerical answer):
"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"

- List the variables and known values from the problem.
- Outline the steps using sympy to solve the problem:
  * Identify the sympy functions required for each step.
  * Implement these functions step-by-step, commenting each line for clarity.
- Calculate the final answer and verify it's a positive integer.
- Output the result within \boxed{}.

Interesting, let's analyze step by step:


The product of two numbers is zero if and only if at least one of the numbers is zero. Therefore, the given equation is equivalent to two separate equations: 

1. $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2) = 0$
2. $((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$

From equation (2), we have $|x| = 8$ and $|y| = 8$, which implies $x = \pm8$ and $y = \pm8$. These give us a square with side length 16.

For equation (1), we have $|x + y| = 10$ and $|x - y| = 10$. This gives us a rhombus with vertices at $(5, 5), (-5, 5), (-5, -5), (5, -5)$.

The intersection of these two figures is a square with side length 8. So, the area of the convex polygon is $8^2 = 64$. The answer is: $64$

Interesting, let's analyze step by step:



The equation to be solved is given by:

$$((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$$

From this equation, it is clear that the area of the polygon is enclosed by the points that make either of the two factors equal to zero.

The first factor is equal to zero when:
- $\vert x + y \vert - 10 = 0$ which implies $\vert x + y \vert = 10$. This forms a square with side length 20.
- $\vert x - y \vert - 10 = 0$ which implies $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. This forms a square with side length 20.

The second factor is equal to zero when:
- $\vert x \vert - 8 = 0$ which implies $\vert x \vert = 8$. This forms a square with side length 16.
- $\vert y \vert - 8 = 0$ which implies $\vert y \vert = 8$. This forms a square with side length 16.

Now, we need to find the intersection of these squares to form the polygon. The intersection is a square with side length 8.

To find the area of this square, we use the formula for the area of a square, which is side length squared. The side length of the square is 8, so the area is $8^2 = 64$.

Since 64 is a positive integer, we have our solution.

Therefore, the area of the polygon is $\boxed{64}$ square units. The answer is: $\boxed{64}$

"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"

Interesting, let's analyze step by step:



If the product of two numbers is 0, then at least one of the numbers must be 0. This means that either $ ((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + (\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2) = 0 $ or $ ((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + (\vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0 $.

Now let's look at the second equation: $ ((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + (\vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0 $. This equation will be 0 only when both $ \vert x \vert = 8 $ and $ \vert y \vert = 8 $. This implies that the point $ (x, y) $ must be in a square with side length 16 centered at the origin.

Now let's look at the first equation: $ ((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + (\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2) = 0 $. This equation will be 0 only when both $ \vert x + y \vert = 10 $ and $ \vert x - y \vert = 10 $. This implies that the point $ (x, y) $ must be in a square with side length 20 centered at the origin.

The intersection of the two squares is a square with side length 8 (since the smaller square with side length 16 is completely contained within the larger square with side length 20). So, the area of the convex polygon formed by the points that satisfy the given equation is $ 8^2 = 64 $. The answer is $64$.

Interesting, let's analyze step by step:



Given a set of points $(x, y)$ that satisfy the equation $$((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0.$$ The problem asks to calculate the area of the convex polygon formed by these points.

This equation equals to zero if and only if either of the two factors equals to zero. This breaks down into two cases:

1. $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2) = 0$. This happens if and only if $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. This is the set of points that are at a distance of 10 from the origin in both the x+y and x-y directions. These points form a square with side length 20.

2. $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$. This happens if and only if $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$. This is the set of points that are at a distance of 8 from the origin in both the x and y directions. These points form a square with side length 16.

Now, the intersection of these two sets of points is the set of points that are at a distance of 10 from the origin in both the x+y and x-y directions, and also at a distance of 8 from the origin in both the x and y directions. This intersection is the square with side length 8 formed by the points that are at a distance of 8 from the origin in both the x and y directions.

Therefore, the area of the convex polygon formed by the points that satisfy the given equation is the area of the square with side length 8, which is $8^2 = 64$.

So, the area of the convex polygon is 64 square units.
The answer is: $64$
