"For how many positive integers $m$ does the equation \[\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}\] have $4$ distinct solutions?"

Approach:



For the absolute value equation to have 4 distinct solutions, the expression inside the absolute value must be of the form $-(x-1)^2+4$ or $(x-1)^2-4$. 

Setting up the equation gives:

1. $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert = -(x-1)^2+4$.
2. $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert = (x-1)^2-4$.

Solving these equations separately will give us the possible values of $m$.

We can start by solving the equation:

$\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert = -(x-1)^2+4$.

This simplifies to:

$\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert = -x^2+2x-1+4$.

Simplify further:

$\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert = -x^2+2x+3$.

Now we need to consider two cases:

Case 1: $|x-1 - 2| = -x^2 + 2x + 3$. This gives us two equations:
1. $x-1 - 2 = -x^2 + 2x + 3$, which simplifies to $x^2 - 2x - 6 = 0$.
2. $-(x-1 - 2) = -x^2 + 2x + 3$, which simplifies to $x^2 - 2x - 4 = 0$.

Case 2: $|x-1 + 2| = -x^2 + 2x + 3$. This gives us two equations:
1. $x-1 + 2 = -x^2 + 2x + 3$, which simplifies to $x^2 - 2x - 2 = 0$.
2. $-(x-1 + 2) = -x^2 + 2x + 3$, which simplifies to $x^2 - 2x - 8 = 0$.

Each of these equations is a quadratic equation. We can use the discriminant ($\Delta = b^2 - 4ac$) to determine when the quadratic equation has two distinct real roots.

For the equation $x^2 - 2x - 6 = 0$, the discriminant is $\Delta_1 = (-2)^2 - 4(1)(-6) = 4 + 24 = 28$, which is positive. So this equation has two distinct real roots.

For the equation $x^2 - 2x - 4 = 0$, the discriminant is $\Delta_2 = (-2)^2 - 4(1)(-4) = 4 + 16 = 20$, which is positive. So this equation has two distinct real roots.

For the equation $x^2 - 2x - 2 = 0$, the discriminant is $\Delta_3 = (-2)^2 - 4(1)(-2) = 4 + 8 = 12$, which is positive. So this equation has two distinct real roots.

For the equation $x^2 - 2x - 8 = 0$, the discriminant is $\Delta_4 = (-2)^2 - 4(1)(-8) = 4 + 32 = 36$, which is positive. So this equation has two distinct real roots.

Therefore, all four equations have 2 distinct real roots. So for this case, the equation $| \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert = -(x-1)^2+4$ has 4 distinct solutions.

Similarly, we can solve the equation:

$\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert = (x-1)^2-4$.

This simplifies to:

$\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert = x^2-2x+1-4$.

Simplify further:

$\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert = x^2-2x-3$.

Now we need to consider two cases:

Case 1: $|x-1 - 2| = x^2 - 2x - 3$. This gives us two equations:
1. $x-1 - 2 = x^2 - 2x - 3$, which simplifies to $x^2 - 3x + 2 = 0$.
2. $-(x-1 - 2) = x^2 - 2x - 3$, which simplifies to $x^2 - x - 4 = 0$.

Case 2: $|x-1 + 2| = x^2 - 2x - 3$. This gives us two equations:
1. $x-1 + 2 = x^2 - 2x - 3$, which simplifies to $x^2 - 3x - 2 = 0$.
2. $-(x-1 + 2) = x^2 - 2x - 3$, which simplifies to $x^2 - x - 6 = 0$.

Each of these equations is a quadratic equation. We can use the discriminant ($\Delta = b^2 - 4ac$) to determine when the quadratic equation has two distinct real roots.

For the equation $x^2 - 3x + 2 = 0$, the discriminant is $\Delta_1 = (-3)^2 - 4(1)(2) = 9 - 8 = 1$, which is positive. So this equation has two distinct real roots.

For the equation $x^2 - x - 4 = 0$, the discriminant is $\Delta_2 = (-1)^2 - 4(1)(-4) = 1 + 16 = 17$, which is positive. So this equation has two distinct real roots.

For the equation $x^2 - 3x - 2 = 0$, the discriminant is $\Delta_3 = (-3)^2 - 4(1)(-2) = 9 + 8 = 17$, which is positive. So this equation has two distinct real roots.

For the equation $x^2 - x - 6 = 0$, the discriminant is $\Delta_4 = (-1)^2 - 4(1)(-6) = 1 + 24 = 25$, which is positive. So this equation has two distinct real roots.

Therefore, all four equations have 2 distinct real roots. So for this case, the equation $| \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert = (x-1)^2-4$ also has 4 distinct solutions.

So in both cases, the equation $| \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert = \pm (x-1)^2-4$ has 4 distinct solutions. 

Thus, the number of positive integers $m$ for which the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has 4 distinct solutions is the number of values of $m$ for which $-(x-1)^2+4 = \frac{m}{

Approach:


The equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has 4 distinct solutions if and only if $\frac{m}{100} = 2 - k$ or $\frac{m}{100} = k - 2$ for $0 < k < 2$. This is because the absolute value function $|y|$ equals to a constant $c$ (in this case $c = 2 - k$) has two solutions $y = c$ and $y = -c$. So the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has 4 distinct solutions when $\frac{m}{100}$ equals to $2 - k$ or $k - 2$ for $0 < k < 2$.

We can find the possible values of $k$ by setting $0 < k < 2$.

So we have:
$2 - k > 0 \Rightarrow k < 2$.
$k - 2 > 0 \Rightarrow k > 2$.

However, we found that $k$ should be in the range $(0, 2)$, but we got $k > 2$ and $k < 2$, which is a contradiction. The mistake we made is that we should consider $2 - k$ and $k - 2$ separately. 

For $2 - k$, we have $0 < 2 - k < 2$, which gives $0 < k < 2$. This is exactly the range we wanted.

For $k - 2$, we have $0 < k - 2 < 2$, which gives $2 < k < 4$. However, this is not possible because $k$ should be in the range $(0, 2)$. So we only need to consider $2 - k$.

Therefore, we have $0 < k < 2$, which means $k$ is in the range $(0, 2)$. The possible values of $k$ are those that can be expressed as a decimal between 0 and 2. There is only one such value, which is $k = 1$.

So, we have $\frac{m}{100} = 2 - 1 = 1$, which gives $m = 100$.

So, there is only one positive integer $m$ that makes the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ have 4 distinct solutions, and that is $m = 100$. The answer is: $\boxed{1}$

Approach:


We need to find the number of positive integer values of $m$ such that the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has exactly four distinct solutions.
Let's start by analyzing the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$.
The right side of the equation, $\frac{m}{100}$, must be nonnegative, so $m$ must be nonnegative.
The number of distinct solutions of the equation is determined by the number of times the graph of $y = \vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert$ intersects the line $y = \frac{m}{100}$.
We can analyze the graph of $y = \vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert$ by considering the cases for the inner absolute value and the outer absolute value separately.
Case 1: $\vert x-1 \vert -2 > 0$
This means $\vert x-1 \vert > 2$.
The two cases to consider are $x-1 > 2$ and $x-1 < -2$.
For $x-1 > 2$, we have $x > 3$.
For $x-1 < -2$, we have $x < -1$.
So the solution to $\vert x-1 \vert > 2$ is $x < -1$ or $x > 3$.
Case 2: $\vert x-1 \vert -2 < 0$
This means $\vert x-1 \vert < 2$.
The two cases to consider are $x-1 < 2$ and $x-1 > -2$.
For $x-1 < 2$, we have $x < 3$.
For $x-1 > -2$, we have $x > -1$.
So the solution to $\vert x-1 \vert < 2$ is $-1 < x < 3$.
Combining the results of Case 1 and Case 2, we see that the graph of $y = \vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert$ consists of two line segments, one from $-1$ to $3$ and the other from $3$ to $\infty$ and from $-\infty$ to $-1$.
The graph intersects the line $y = \frac{m}{100}$ four times if $\frac{m}{100}$ falls strictly between the $y$-values at $x=-1$, $x=1$, $x=3$.
The $y$-value at $x=-1$ is $\vert \vert -1 -1 \vert - 2 \vert = \vert 2 - 2 \vert = 0$.
The $y$-value at $x=1$ is $\vert \vert 1 -1 \vert - 2 \vert = \vert 0 - 2 \vert = 2$.
The $y$-value at $x=3$ is $\vert \vert 3 -1 \vert - 2 \vert = \vert 2 - 2 \vert = 0$.
So the graph intersects the line $y = \frac{m}{100}$ four times if $0 < \frac{m}{100} < 2$, or equivalently, $0 < m < 200$.
Therefore, there are 199 positive integer values of $m$ for which the equation has four distinct solutions.

Answer:
199
The answer is: $199$

The equation \[\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}\] has 4 distinct solutions if and only if $\frac{m}{100}$ is less than 2 and greater than 0. Therefore, we have $0<\frac{m}{100}<2$. Multiplying all sides of the inequality by 100, we get $0<m<200$.

Since $m$ is a positive integer, the possible values of $m$ are the integers from 1 to 199. Therefore, there are 199 positive integers that make the equation have 4 distinct solutions.
The answer is: 199

To find the number of positive integers $m$ for which the equation \[\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}\] has $4$ distinct solutions, we need to analyze the equation and determine for how many positive integers $m$ does the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ have $4$ distinct solutions.

For the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ to have $4$ distinct solutions, the value of $\frac{m}{100}$ must be equal to the positive difference between two distinct real numbers. The maximum value of $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert$ is $3$, which occurs when $x$ is either $-1$ or $5$. Therefore, the value of $\frac{m}{100}$ must be a positive number less than or equal to $3$. The possible values of $\frac{m}{100}$ are $1$ and $2$.

If $\frac{m}{100} = 1$, then $m = 100$.
If $\frac{m}{100} = 2$, then $m = 200$.

Thus, there are $2$ positive integers $m$ for which the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has $4$ distinct solutions. The answer is: $2$

Approach:


The equation $| |x-1|-2|=\frac{m}{100}$ has 4 distinct solutions. This equation can be rewritten as two separate equations: $|x-1|-2=\frac{m}{100}$ and $-(|x-1|-2)=\frac{m}{100}$, or $|x-1|-2=\frac{-m}{100}$. The second equation simplifies to $|x-1|-2=-\frac{m}{100}$. 

The number of solutions of these equations depends on the value of $\frac{m}{100}$. Specifically, the equation $|x-1|-2=\frac{m}{100}$ has 2 solutions if $\frac{m}{100} > 2$, 1 solution if $0 \leq \frac{m}{100} \leq 2$, and no solutions if $\frac{m}{100} < 0$. Similarly, the equation $|x-1|-2=-\frac{m}{100}$ has 2 solutions if $\frac{-m}{100} > 2$, or $\frac{m}{100} < -2$, 1 solution if $0 \leq \frac{-m}{100} \leq 2$, or $-2 \leq \frac{m}{100} \leq 0$, and no solutions if $\frac{-m}{100} < 0$, or $\frac{m}{100} > -2$.

Therefore, the original equation has 4 solutions if $0 \leq \frac{m}{100} \leq 2$ and $-2 \leq \frac{m}{100} \leq 0$, or equivalently, $0 \leq m \leq 200$ and $-200 \leq m \leq 0$. The intersection of these two intervals is the interval $0 \leq m \leq 200$. The number of positive integers $m$ in this interval is $200$. So there are $200$ positive integers $m$ for which the equation $| |x-1|-2|=\frac{m}{100}$ has 4 distinct solutions.

Therefore, the answer is $200$.

```python


INTERMEDIATE OUT :

def count_positive_integers():
    # Define the range of m
    lower_bound = 0
    upper_bound = 200

    # Count the number of positive integers in the range
    count = upper_bound - lower_bound + 1

    return count

result = count_positive_integers()
print(result)
```

CODE RESULTS 201

INTERMEDIATE OUT :
```output
201
```
The Python code above will return the correct result, but it's incorrect because it counts the number of integers from $0$ to $200$ inclusive, which is $201$. However, the question asks for the number of positive integers from $0$ to $200$, not including $0$. To correct this, we need to subtract $1$ from the count obtained from the code. Therefore, the number of positive integers $m$ for which the equation $| |x-1|-2|=\frac{m}{100}$ has 4 distinct solutions is $200$.
The answer is $\boxed{200}$.

Approach:


The equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has 4 distinct solutions if and only if $\frac{m}{100}$ is strictly between 1 and 2. This is because the expression inside the absolute value, $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert$, oscillates between 1 and -1, and therefore the equation has 4 distinct solutions when the right hand side is strictly between 1 and 2. This means $\frac{m}{100}$ must be in the interval $(1, 2)$. So, we have $1 < \frac{m}{100} < 2$. Multiplying all sides by 100 gives $100 < m < 200$. The positive integers $m$ that satisfy this inequality are exactly the integers from 101 to 199, inclusive. The number of such integers is $199 - 101 + 1 = 99$. So, there are 99 positive integers $m$ for which the equation has 4 distinct solutions.

The answer is: $99$

We know that the equation $||x-1|-2|=\frac{m}{100}$ has four distinct solutions. Let's analyze the equation.

The expression $|x-1|-2$ can take two values: $\frac{m}{100}$ or $-\frac{m}{100}$. This gives us two cases to consider:

Case 1: $|x-1|-2 = \frac{m}{100}$.
Solving this equation, we get $|x-1| = 2+\frac{m}{100}$. This gives us two sub-equations:

Sub-case 1.1: $x-1 = 2+\frac{m}{100}$, so $x = 3+\frac{m}{100}$.
Sub-case 1.2: $x-1 = -(2+\frac{m}{100})$, so $x = -1-\frac{m}{100}$.

Case 2: $|x-1|-2 = -\frac{m}{100}$.
Solving this equation, we get $|x-1| = 2-\frac{m}{100}$. This gives us two sub-equations:

Sub-case 2.1: $x-1 = 2-\frac{m}{100}$, so $x = 3-\frac{m}{100}$.
Sub-case 2.2: $x-1 = -(2-\frac{m}{100})$, so $x = -1+\frac{m}{100}$.

So, we have a total of 4 distinct solutions: $3+\frac{m}{100}$, $-1-\frac{m}{100}$, $3-\frac{m}{100}$, and $-1+\frac{m}{100}$.

For these to be distinct, we must have $\frac{m}{100} \neq 2$ and $\frac{m}{100} \neq 4$. This gives us $m \neq 200$ and $m \neq 400$.

Also, $\frac{m}{100}$ must be positive, so $m$ must be positive.

Therefore, the positive integers $m$ for which the equation has 4 distinct solutions are those that are not equal to 200 or 400.

Now, we need to find how many such positive integers $m$ are there. We know that $1 \leq m \leq 100$, so the positive integers $m$ that we are looking for are the numbers from 1 to 100 excluding 200 and 400. The number of such positive integers $m$ is 100 - 2 = 98.

The Python code to calculate this is:

```python


INTERMEDIATE OUT :

def count_m():
    total_m = 100
    excluded_m = 2
    return total_m - excluded_m

result = count_m()
print(result)
```

INTERMEDIATE OUT :
```output

So, the number of positive integers $m$ for which the equation has 4 distinct solutions is 98. The answer is: $\boxed{98}$

We need to find the number of positive integer values of $m$ such that the equation $| |x-1|-2|=\frac{m}{100}$ has 4 distinct solutions. 

To start, we know that $| |x-1|-2|=\frac{m}{100}$ has 4 distinct solutions if and only if $\frac{m}{100}$ is strictly between 0 and 2. This is because the function $| |x-1|-2|$ is a triangular wave with amplitude 2 and period 1, and thus has 4 distinct solutions for the equation $| |x-1|-2|=c$ if and only if $0 < c < 2$. Therefore, we have $0 < \frac{m}{100} < 2$, which implies $0 < m < 200$. 

Now, we need to find the number of positive integers $m$ in the range $0 < m < 200$. The number of such integers is $200 - 1 = 199$.

So, the number of positive integer values of $m$ for which the equation $| |x-1|-2|=\frac{m}{100}$ has 4 distinct solutions is 199. The answer is: 199

Approach:

 The equation $| |x - 1| - 2 | = \frac{m}{100}$ has 4 distinct solutions if and only if $\frac{m}{100}$ is less than $2$ and greater than or equal to $0$. Therefore, $0 \leq \frac{m}{100} < 2$. This inequality implies $0 \leq m < 200$. The positive integers that satisfy this inequality are exactly the integers from $1$ to $199$. We need to count how many of these integers have 4 distinct solutions.

To do this, we can set up two cases for the equation $| |x - 1| - 2 | = \frac{m}{100}$.

Case 1: $|x - 1| - 2 = \frac{m}{100}$. This equation has 4 distinct solutions if and only if $2 - \frac{m}{100} > 0$ and $2 + \frac{m}{100} > 0$, which simplifies to $0 \leq \frac{m}{100} < 2$.

Case 2: $-(|x - 1| - 2) = \frac{m}{100}$, or $|x - 1| - 2 = -\frac{m}{100}$. This equation has 4 distinct solutions if and only if $2 - \frac{m}{100} > 0$ and $2 - \frac{m}{100} < 0$, which simplifies to $0 < \frac{m}{100} \leq 2$.

Combining the two cases, we find that the positive integers $m$ that satisfy the original equation with 4 distinct solutions are the integers from $1$ to $199$ that satisfy either $0 \leq \frac{m}{100} < 2$ or $0 < \frac{m}{100} \leq 2$. This is the same as the integers from $1$ to $199$ that satisfy $0 < \frac{m}{100} < 2$.

The number of such integers is equal to the number of integers from $1$ to $199$ that are greater than $0$ and less than $200$, but not equal to $100$. This is the same as the number of integers from $1$ to $199$ excluding $100$, which is $99$. Therefore, the number of positive integers $m$ for which the equation $| |x - 1| - 2 | = \frac{m}{100}$ has 4 distinct solutions is $99$.
The answer is: 99

Approach:



First, we need to understand that the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has 4 distinct solutions, it implies that the right side of the equation is positive (since the absolute value of a number can never be negative). This means that $\frac{m}{100} > 0$, so $m > 0$. So $m$ must be a positive integer.

Next, let's consider the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$. The number of solutions depends on the value of $\frac{m}{100}$, specifically, when $\frac{m}{100}$ equals to the distance between two lines $y = \vert x-1 \vert -2$, the number of solutions changes. Therefore, we need to find out how many times this distance equals to $\frac{m}{100}$.

Let's first draw the graph of $y = \vert x-1 \vert -2$. The graph consists of two line segments: one segment is the line $y = x - 3$ for $x \geq 1$, and the other is the line $y = -x + 3$ for $x < 1$. 

[Insert graph of $y = \vert x-1 \vert -2$ here]

Now, let's consider the distance between these two lines. The distance is $2$ for $x \geq 1$ and $2$ for $x < 1$. So the distance is always $2$.

Therefore, for the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ to have $4$ distinct solutions, $\frac{m}{100}$ must equal to $2$. Solving the equation gives $m = 200$.

However, we need to check if this value of $m$ indeed gives $4$ distinct solutions. Substituting $m = 200$ into the equation, we get $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{200}{100}=2$. This equation has $4$ distinct solutions: $x = -1, 3, 5, 7$. So $m = 200$ is a valid solution.

Therefore, there is only one positive integer $m$ such that the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has $4$ distinct solutions, and that number is $m = 200$. The answer is: $1$

Approach:

 The equation $| |x - 1| - 2 | = \frac{m}{100}$ has four distinct solutions if and only if the number $\frac{m}{100}$ is less than $2$ and greater than $0$. This is because the expression $| |x - 1| - 2 |$ oscillates between $0$ and $4$, and the equation has four solutions when $\frac{m}{100}$ falls strictly between these two extremes.

If $\frac{m}{100} \leq 0$ or $\frac{m}{100} \geq 2$, then the equation has either $2$ or $4$ solutions, but not $4$. Therefore, we must have $0 < \frac{m}{100} < 2$. This implies $0 < m < 200$. The positive integers $m$ that satisfy this inequality are the integers from $1$ to $199$.

Now, we must count how many of these integers make the equation have $4$ distinct solutions. The equation has $4$ solutions when $\frac{m}{100}$ falls strictly between $0$ and $2$. This happens when $0 < m < 200$. The number of such integers is the number of positive integers from $1$ to $199$. This can be found by subtracting the smallest integer from the largest and then adding $1$:

\[199 - 1 + 1 = 199.\]

Therefore, the number of positive integers $m$ for which the equation has $4$ distinct solutions is $199$. The answer is: $199$
