Solve the following problem with a Python Script (positive numerical answer):
"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"
Write comments to indicate the steps you take. Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Assistant:

Approach:

 The equation $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ implies that $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. This can only be true if $x = \pm 10$ and $y = \pm 10$. Similarly, $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ implies that $x = \pm 8$ and $y = \pm 8$.

The solution points are therefore at $(8,8), (8,-8), (-8,8),$ and $(-8,-8)$. These points form a square with side length 16. The area of the square is therefore $16^2 = 256$. The answer is: $256$

The given equation is a product of two expressions equal to zero. This means that either $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$.

The expression $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ implies that $|x+y| = 10$ and $|x-y| = 10$. This represents a square with side length 20, centered at the origin.

The expression $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ implies that $|x| = 8$ and $|y| = 8$. This represents a square with side length 16, centered at the origin.

Therefore, the area of the convex polygon enclosed by the points satisfying the given equation is the sum of the areas of the two squares.

The area of a square is given by the square of the length of its side. So the area of the larger square is $20^2 = 400$, and the area of the smaller square is $16^2 = 256$.

Adding these two areas together, we get the total area of the convex polygon as $400 + 256 = 656$.
The answer is: $656$

Approach:


The equation $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ is satisfied only when either of the factors is equal to zero. This gives us two conditions:

1. $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ and $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) \neq 0$
2. $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2) \neq 0$ and $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$

From condition 1, we get $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$, which gives us a square with side length 10. The area of the square is $10^2 = 100$.

From condition 2, we get $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$, which gives us a square with side length 8. The area of the square is $8^2 = 64$.

Since the two conditions are mutually exclusive, the total area of the convex polygon is the sum of the areas of the two squares, which is $100 + 64 = 164$.

So, the area of the convex polygon is 164.

The answer is: $164$

Approach:


The given equation implies that at least one of the factors must be zero in order for the product to be zero. Thus, we have two separate cases to consider:

Case 1: $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$. This means $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ or $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. These are the equations of two diagonals of a square with side length 20.

Case 2: $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$. This means $\vert x \vert = 8$ or $\vert y \vert = 8$. These are the equations of two horizontal and two vertical lines, forming a square with side length 16.

By combining both cases, we obtain a square with side length 20. The area of this square is $20^2 = 400$.

```python


INTERMEDIATE OUT :

def area_of_polygon():
    side_length = 20
    area = side_length ** 2
    return area

result = area_of_polygon()

The area of the convex polygon is 400 square units. The answer is: $\boxed{400}$

Solve the following problem with a Python Script (positive numerical answer):
"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"
Write comments to indicate the steps you take. Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Assistant:

Approach:



The equation is $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$.

For the product of two terms to be zero, either one of the terms must be zero. Thus, we have two cases:

1. $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$.
2. $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$.

For the first case, we have $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ and $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$. This implies that $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. This forms a square with side length 10. The area of this square is $10^2 = 100$.

For the second case, we have $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ and $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$. This implies that $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$. This forms a square with side length 8. The area of this square is $8^2 = 64$.

The area of the convex polygon is the sum of the areas of these two squares, which is $100 + 64 = 164$.
The answer is $\boxed{164}$.

Assistant:

Approach:


The given equation is $0$ only when one of the factors is $0$. Therefore, we have two cases to consider:
Case 1: $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$. This implies $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. This means $x + y = \pm 10$ and $x - y = \pm 10$. Solving these equations gives us the vertices of the polygon: $(0, 10), (0, -10), (10, 0), (-10, 0)$.
Case 2: $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$. This implies $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$. This means $x = \pm 8$ and $y = \pm 8$. Adding these vertices to the ones from Case 1, we have all the vertices of the polygon: $(0, 10), (0, -10), (10, 0), (-10, 0), (8, 8), (8, -8), (-8, 8), (-8, -8)$.
To find the area of the polygon, we can split it into four right triangles with legs of length $10$ and $8$. The area of each triangle is $\frac{1}{2} \times 8 \times 10 = 40$, so the total area of the polygon is $4 \times 40 = 160$.

The area of the convex polygon is $160$.
The answer is: $160$

Approach:

 The equation $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ implies that $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. These are two equations representing two lines at $45^\circ$ and $-45^\circ$ with respect to the x-axis, and passing through points of absolute value 10 on the x and y axes. So these lines are the bisectors of the first and third quadrants, and the second and fourth quadrants, respectively.

The equation $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ implies that $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$, which are two equations representing two lines at $0^\circ$ and $90^\circ$ with respect to the x-axis, and passing through points of absolute value 8 on the x and y axes. So these lines are the bisectors of the x and y axes, respectively.

The intersection of these lines forms a square with side length 10, as the square with side length 8 is entirely contained within the square with side length 10. The area of this square is $10^2 = 100$.
The answer is: $100$.

The equation given is $ ((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$. For the product of two numbers to be zero, either one of them has to be zero. So, we have two cases:

1. $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$. In this case, both $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2$ and $( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2$ have to be zero. This implies $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. These are the equations of two lines, $x + y = \pm10$ and $x - y = \pm10$.

2. $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$. In this case, both $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2$ and $( \vert y \vert - 8)^2$ have to be zero. This implies $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$. These are the equations of two circles, one centered at $(0, 0)$ with radius 8, and the other centered at $(0, 0)$ with radius 8.

The intersection of these lines and circles will give us the vertices of the polygon. The vertices are $(8, 2)$, $(8, -2)$, $(-8, 2)$, and $(-8, -2)$. This is a square with side length 16. The area of a square is given by the square of the side length, so the area of this square is $16^2 = 256$.
The answer is: $256$

The given equation implies that either $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$.
This means that either $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ or $\vert x - y \vert = 10$ or $\vert x \vert = 8$ or $\vert y \vert = 8$.

The lines $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ form a square with side length $20$, the lines $\vert x - y \vert = 10$ also form a square with side length $20$, and the lines $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$ form two squares with side length $16$.

The four squares overlap to form a larger square with side length $20$. The area of this square is $20^2 = 400$.

However, we are only interested in the area of the convex polygon formed by the intersection of the four squares. The intersection of the two larger squares is another square with side length $16$. The area of this square is $16^2 = 256$.

Therefore, the area of the convex polygon is the area of the smaller square, which is $256$.

The answer is: $256$.

1. $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ and $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 \neq 0$. In this case, we must have $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. This means that the points $(x, y)$ must lie on the square with vertices at $(10, 0), (-10, 0), (0, 10), (0, -10)$.

2. $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 \neq 0$ and $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$.

The intersection of these two squares is the convex polygon we are looking for. It is a square with side length 10 (the smaller square is contained within the larger square). The area of a square with side length $a$ is $a^2$. Therefore, the area of the convex polygon is $10^2 = 100$. The answer is: $100$

Solve the following problem with a Python Script (positive numerical answer):
"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"
Write comments to indicate the steps you take. Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Assistant:

Approach:


The expression is equal to 0 when either of the factors is 0. Therefore, we need to find the solutions for each factor separately and then find the intersection of the two sets of solutions to get the points that satisfy the equation. Then, these points will form the vertices of the polygon, and we can calculate the area using these vertices.

Step 1: Solve $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ for $(x, y)$.
This gives $\vert x + y \vert = 10$, which implies $x + y = 10$ or $x + y = -10$. These are two lines in the plane.

Step 2: Solve $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ for $(x, y)$.
This gives $\vert x - y \vert = 10$, which implies $x - y = 10$ or $x - y = -10$. These are also two lines in the plane.

Step 3: Solve $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ for $x$.
This gives $\vert x \vert = 8$, which implies $x = 8$ or $x = -8$. These are two vertical lines in the plane.

Step 4: Solve $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ for $y$.
This gives $\vert y \vert = 8$, which implies $y = 8$ or $y = -8$. These are two horizontal lines in the plane.

Step 5: Find the intersection of the solutions from steps 1-4.
The intersection of the lines $x + y = 10$ and $x - y = 10$ is the point $(10, 0)$.
The intersection of the lines $x + y = 10$ and $x - y = -10$ is the point $(0, 10)$.
The intersection of the lines $x + y = -10$ and $x - y = 10$ is the point $(-10, -20)$.
The intersection of the lines $x + y = -10$ and $x - y = -10$ is the point $(-20, 10)$.
The intersection of the lines $x = 8$ and $y = 8$ is the point $(8, 8)$.
The intersection of the lines $x = 8$ and $y = -8$ is the point $(8, -8)$.
The intersection of the lines $x = -8$ and $y = 8$ is the point $(-8, 8)$.
The intersection of the lines $x = -8$ and $y = -8$ is the point $(-8, -8)$.

Step 6: Plot the points found in step 5 and determine the shape of the polygon formed by these points.
The points form a square with side length 20.

Step 7: Calculate the area of the square.
The area of a square with side length 20 is $20^2 = 400$.

So, the area of the convex polygon is 400. The answer is: $400$

Approach:

 The equation given is $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$. For the product of two numbers to be zero, either one of the numbers must be zero. This gives us two separate conditions to work with.

1. $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$: For the sum of two squares to be zero, both squares must be zero. This gives us $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. Solving these absolute value equations gives us $x + y = 10$ and $x - y = 10$ or $x + y = -10$ and $x - y = -10$. These four equations represent the lines forming the sides of the square.

2. $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$: Similar to the first condition, for the sum of two squares to be zero, both squares must be zero. This gives us $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$. Solving these absolute value equations gives us $x = 8$ and $x = -8$ and $y = 8$ and $y = -8$. These four lines represent the sides of the square.

The intersection of these lines forms a square with side length 10 (since the distance between the lines $x + y = 10$ and $x - y = 10$ is 10 by solving the system of equations). The area of a square is given by side length squared, so the area of this square is $10^2 = 100$.

The answer is: $100$

Write comments to indicate the steps you take. Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Assistant:

Approach:


The equation $A \cdot B = 0$ is equivalent to $A = 0$ or $B = 0$. So the given equation is equivalent to either $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$.

For the first equation to be true, we must have both $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. This implies that $x + y = \pm 10$ and $x - y = \pm 10$, which gives us four lines in the plane: $x + y = 10$, $x + y = -10$, $x - y = 10$, and $x - y = -10$. These lines form a rectangle with sides of length 20 and diagonals of length 20$\sqrt{2}$.

For the second equation to be true, we must have both $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$, which implies that $x = \pm 8$ and $y = \pm 8$. This gives us four lines in the plane: $x = 8$, $x = -8$, $y = 8$, and $y = -8$. These lines form a square with side length 16 and diagonals of length 16$\sqrt{2}$.

The intersection of these two figures is the convex polygon that we are looking for. The area of the rectangle is $20 \times 20 = 400$ square units, and the area of the square is $16 \times 16 = 256$ square units. The intersection of the two figures is the square with side length 16, so its area is 256 square units.
The answer is: $256$
