Approach:


The equation $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + (\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + (\vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ is true if and only if either $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + (\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + (\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$.
The first equation is true if and only if $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$, which means $x + y = \pm 10$ and $x - y = \pm 10$. Solving these equations, we get the points $(5,5), (5,-5), (-5,5), (-5,-5)$.
The second equation is true if and only if $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$, which means $x = \pm 8$ and $y = \pm 8$. Solving these equations, we get the points $(8,8), (8,-8), (-8,8), (-8,-8)$.
Plotting these points on a coordinate plane, we see that they form a square with side length 10. The area of this square is $10^2 = 100$.
The answer is: $100$.

Approach:

 The given equation is a product of two expressions equal to zero. So, either the first expression is zero or the second expression is zero. Let's analyze these two cases separately.

Case 1: $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$
This implies that $\vert x + y \vert - 10 = 0$ and $\vert x - y \vert - 10 = 0$. Thus, $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. This gives us four equations: $x + y = 10$, $x + y = -10$, $x - y = 10$, and $x - y = -10$. Solving these equations gives us the vertices of the polygon: $(5,5)$, $(5,-5)$, $(-5,5)$, and $(-5,-5)$.

Case 2: $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$
This implies that $\vert x \vert - 8 = 0$ and $\vert y \vert - 8 = 0$. Thus, $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$. This gives us four more vertices: $(8,0)$, $(-8,0)$, $(0,8)$, and $(0,-8)$.

Now, we have all the vertices of the polygon: $(5,5)$, $(5,-5)$, $(-5,5)$, $(-5,-5)$, $(8,0)$, $(-8,0)$, $(0,8)$, and $(0,-8)$. We can plot these points on a graph to visualize the polygon. It turns out that the polygon is a square with side length 10 units.

The area of a square is given by the square of the length of its side. So, the area of this square is $10^2 = 100$ square units.
The answer is: $\boxed{100}$

Approach:



The equation given in the problem is a product of two terms equaling zero. So either the first term equals zero or the second term equals zero.

Let's analyze each term:

1. The first term is $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)$. This term equals zero when both $(\vert x + y \vert - 10) = 0$ and $(\vert x - y \vert - 10) = 0$. Solving these equations we get $x + y = 10$ and $x - y = 10$ or $x + y = 10$ and $x - y = -10$. These four lines form a square with side length 10. The area of the square is $10^2 = 100$.

2. The second term is $((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2)$. This term equals zero when both $(\vert x \vert - 8) = 0$ and $(\vert y \vert - 8) = 0$. Solving these equations we get $x = \pm 8$ and $y = \pm 8$. These four lines also form a square with side length 16. The area of the square is $16^2 = 256$.

The area of the convex polygon formed by the intersection of the two squares is the sum of the areas of the two squares minus the area of the square formed by the union of the two squares.

The union of the two squares has side length equal to the diagonal of the smaller square (10 units) which is $\sqrt{10^2 + 10^2} = \sqrt{200} = 10\sqrt{2}$ units. So the area of the square formed by the union of the two squares is $(\frac{10\sqrt{2}}{2})^2 = 50$ square units.

So the area of the convex polygon formed by the intersection of the two squares is $100 + 256 - 50 = 306$ square units.
The answer is: $306$

Approach:


The equation is of the form $(A)(B) = 0$. Therefore, either $A=0$ or $B=0$. Let's consider these two cases separately.

Case 1: $A = ((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2) = 0$
This implies that $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. Solving these two equations gives us $x = 0$ and $y = \pm10$, or $x = \pm10$ and $y = 0$. These points form a square with side length 20.

Case 2: $B = ((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$
This implies that $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$. Solving these two equations gives us $x = \pm8$ and $y = \pm8$.

Comparing the two cases, we can see that the points from Case 2 are outside the square formed by Case 1. Therefore, the area of the convex polygon is the area of the square from Case 1, which is $20^2 = 400$. The answer is: $400$

Approach:

 The equation $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ implies $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$, which means $x + y = \pm 10$ and $x - y = \pm 10$. Solving these four equations gives us the coordinates of the vertices of the polygon. Then, we can use the Shoelace formula to calculate the area of the polygon.

The equation $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ implies $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$, which means $x = \pm 8$ and $y = \pm 8$. This gives us the four vertices of a square with side length 16.

The square has vertices at $(8,8)$, $(8,-8)$, $(-8,8)$, and $(-8,-8)$. The area of the square is $16^2 = 256$.

So, the area of the convex polygon is 256 square units.
The answer is: $256$

Approach:



The equation $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + (\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + (\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ is equal to zero if and only if at least one of the terms inside the product is equal to zero. This gives us two sets of conditions:

1. $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ and $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ and $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$.
2. $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ and $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ and $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$.

Each of these conditions imply that $|x+y| = 10$, $|x| = 8$, and $|y| = 8$. The first condition gives us the rectangle with vertices at $(8, 10)$, $(-8, 10)$, $(-8, -10)$, and $(8, -10)$. The second condition gives us the rectangle with vertices at $(10, 8)$, $(-10, 8)$, $(-10, -8)$, and $(10, -8)$.

The union of these two rectangles is a 4x8 rectangle, so its area is $4 \times 8 = 32$. The answer is: $\boxed{32}$

Solve the following problem with a Python Script (positive numerical answer):
"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"

Approach:

 The equation $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + (\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ and $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + (\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ can be simplified to the conditions $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$.

For the equation $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ , we have four cases:

Case 1: $x + y = 10$
Case 2: $x + y = -10$
Case 3: $-(x + y) = 10 \implies x + y = -10$
Case 4: $-(x + y) = -10 \implies x + y = 10$

From the above, we observe that the first and the fourth cases are identical and the second and third cases are also identical. So, we just need to solve the first and second cases.

For case 1: $x + y = 10$, we can express $y = 10 - x$

For case 2: $x + y = -10$, we can express $y = -10 - x$.

For the equation $\vert x \vert = 8$, we have two cases:

Case 1: $x = 8$
Case 2: $x = -8$

Similarly, for the equation $\vert y \vert = 8$, we have two cases:

Case 1: $y = 8$
Case 2: $y = -8$

Solving all the possible combinations of these cases gives us the following vertices of the polygon: $(8, 2), (8, -18), (-8, 2), (-8, -18), (2, 8), (-18, 8), (2, -8), (-18, -8)$.

Plotting these points on a graph, we observe that these points form a square with side length $20$.

The area of this square is calculated as side length squared, which is $20^2 = 400$.

So the area of the convex polygon is $400$. The answer is: $400$

Approach:


The equation given is $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + (\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + (\vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$. For the product of two numbers to be zero, either one of the numbers has to be zero. This means that either $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + (\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2) = 0$ or $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + (\vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$.

1. If $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + (\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2) = 0$, then $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. This implies that $x + y = \pm 10$ and $x - y = \pm 10$. Solving these equations gives the vertices of the square as $(0, 10)$, $(0, -10)$, $(10, 0)$, and $(-10, 0)$.

2. If $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + (\vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$, then $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$. This implies that $x = \pm 8$ and $y = \pm 8$. Solving these equations gives the vertices of the square as $(8, 0)$, $(-8, 0)$, $(0, 8)$, and $(0, -8)$.

Therefore, the points satisfying the equation form a square with side length $10$. The area of a square is given by side length squared. Thus, the area of the convex polygon is $10^2 = 100$.
The answer is: $100$

Approach:

 The equation $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ implies that either $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2) = 0$ or $((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$.
If $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2) = 0$, then $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$, which implies $x = \pm 10$ and $y = \pm 10$.
If $((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$, then $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$, which implies $x = \pm 8$ and $y = \pm 8$.
The four points $\left( \pm 10, \pm 10 \right)$ form a square with side length 20, and the four points $\left( \pm 8, \pm 8 \right)$ form a square with side length 16.
The area of the convex polygon is the sum of the areas of these two squares.
The area of a square with side length $s$ is $s^2$, so the area of the first square is $20^2 = 400$, and the area of the second square is $16^2 = 256$.
Therefore, the area of the convex polygon is $400 + 256 = 656$. The answer is: 656

Approach:


The equation $AB = 0$ is satisfied if and only if $A = 0$ or $B = 0$. Therefore, the given equation is equivalent to either $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$.
The first equation simplifies to $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. These are the equations of two lines in the plane, and the polygon they enclose is a square with side length 20. The area of this square is $20^2 = 400$.
The second equation simplifies to $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$. These are the equations of two circles in the plane, centered at the origin with radius 8. The polygon they enclose is a square with side length 16. The area of this square is $16^2 = 256$.
Therefore, the total area of the convex polygon is the sum of the areas of these two squares, $400 + 256 = 656$.
The answer is: $\boxed{656}$.

Solve the following problem with a Python Script (positive numerical answer):
"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"

Approach:

 The equation implies that either $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$.
For the first equation to be true, we need $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. This implies that $x$ and $y$ are both $0$ or $x = y = \pm 10$.
For the second equation to be true, we need $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$, which implies that $x = y = \pm 8$.

So the points that satisfy the equation are the vertices of a square with side length $10$ and another square with side length $8$.
The area of the first square is $10^2 = 100$ and the area of the second square is $8^2 = 64$.
The area of the convex polygon is the sum of the areas of these two squares, so it is $100 + 64 = 164$. The answer is $\boxed{164}$.

Approach:

 The equation given in the problem, $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$, is true if and only if either of the two factors is equal to zero. Therefore, we have two sets of equations to solve:

1. $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ and $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + (\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$
2. $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ and $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + (\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$

For the first set of equations, from $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ we have $\vert x + y \vert = 10$, which gives us two lines: $x + y = 10$ and $x + y = -10$. From $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + (\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$, we have $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$, which gives us four lines: $x = 8$, $x = -8$, $y = 8$, and $y = -8$. The intersection of these lines forms a square with side length 10. The area of this square is $10^2 = 100$.

For the second set of equations, from $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ we have $\vert x - y \vert = 10$, which gives us two lines: $x - y = 10$ and $x - y = -10$. The intersection of these lines with the lines $x = 8$, $x = -8$, $y = 8$, and $y = -8$ also forms a square with side length 10. The area of this square is also $10^2 = 100$.

Since the two sets of equations lead to squares with the same area of 100, the area of the convex polygon formed by the union of the two sets of equations is 100. The answer is: $100$
