Approach:



We know that the absolute value function $|\cdot|$ compresses any real number to the non-negative real numbers. Hence, the equation $|\vert x-1 \vert -2|=\frac{m}{100}$ has 4 distinct solutions means that $|\vert x-1 \vert -2|$ has 4 intersection points with the line $y = \frac{m}{100}$.

First, we observe that $|\vert x-1 \vert -2|$ is a piecewise function that can be written as:

\[\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert= \begin{cases}
(\vert x-1 \vert -2), & \text{if } \vert x-1 \vert \geq 2 \\
-(\vert x-1 \vert -2), & \text{if } \vert x-1 \vert < 2
\end{cases}\]

This simplifies to:

\[\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert= \begin{cases}
(x-1-2), & \text{if } x \geq 3 \\
-(x-1-2), & \text{if } 1 \leq x < 3 \\
-(1-x-2), & \text{if } x < 1
\end{cases}\]

Simplifying further gives:

\[\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert= \begin{cases}
(x-3), & \text{if } x \geq 3 \\
-(x-3), & \text{if } 1 \leq x < 3 \\
-(3-x), & \text{if } x < 1
\end{cases}\]

Hence, the graph of $|\vert x-1 \vert -2|$ consists of three line segments, one with slope 1 to the right of $x = 3$, one with slope -1 between $x = 1$ and $x = 3$, and one with slope 1 to the left of $x = 1$. The graph intersects the line $y = \frac{m}{100}$ at four distinct points if $\frac{m}{100}$ is between 1 and 3, i.e., if $100 \leq m < 300$. So there are 200 positive integers $m$ that satisfy the equation.

So the number of positive integers $m$ that satisfy the equation is 200.
The answer is: $200$

Approach:


The equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has $4$ distinct solutions. We know that the absolute value function $\vert y \vert$ splits into two cases $y$ and $-y$. Applying this to our equation we get:

$\vert x-1 -2 \vert = \frac{m}{100}$ or $\vert x-1 - (-2) \vert = \frac{m}{100}$.

Simplifying, we get $\vert x-3 \vert = \frac{m}{100}$ or $\vert x+1 \vert = \frac{m}{100}$.

This gives us the following pairs of equations:

$x-3 = \frac{m}{100}$ or $x-3 = -\frac{m}{100}$,
$x+1 = \frac{m}{100}$ or $x+1 = -\frac{m}{100}$.

Solving these pairs of equations, we get:

$x = 3 + \frac{m}{100}$ or $x = 3 - \frac{m}{100}$,
$x = -\frac{m}{100} + 1$ or $x = \frac{m}{100} + 1$.

We want the $4$ distinct solutions, which means the solutions for the first pair should not be the same as the solutions for the second pair. This happens when:

$3 + \frac{m}{100} = -\frac{m}{100} + 1$ or $3 + \frac{m}{100} = \frac{m}{100} + 1$,
$3 - \frac{m}{100} = -\frac{m}{100} + 1$ or $3 - \frac{m}{100} = \frac{m}{100} + 1$.

Solving these equations, we get $m=50$.

Therefore, there is only one positive integer $m$ for which the equation has $4$ distinct solutions. The value of $m$ is $50$. The answer is: 1

Approach:



For the equation $|\vert x-1 \vert -2|=\frac{m}{100}$ to have 4 distinct solutions, the right hand side $\frac{m}{100}$ must be positive and less than 2. This is because the absolute value function $|\cdot|$ reaches its maximum value of 2 at $x=1$ and decreases to 0 as $x$ goes to $\pm \infty$. So, the value of $|\vert x-1 \vert -2|$ can be 2 only at $x=1$, and it decreases to 0 as $x$ goes to $\pm \infty$. 

Given that $\frac{m}{100}$ is positive, we have $0 < \frac{m}{100} < 2$, which leads to $0 < m < 200$.

The positive integers $m$ that satisfy this inequality are $1, 2, ..., 199$. So, there are 199 positive integers $m$ for which the equation has 4 distinct solutions.

However, we need to find out how many of these integers $m$ make the equation have exactly 4 distinct solutions. We know that for a given $m$, the equation will have 4 distinct solutions if and only if the right hand side $\frac{m}{100}$ splits the maximum value of 2 in two unequal parts. 

This will happen when $\frac{m}{100}$ is of the form $\frac{1}{2} - \epsilon$ or $\frac{1}{2} + \epsilon$ for some positive $\epsilon$. In other words, we need to find how many integers $m$ are of the form $50 \pm k$ for some positive integer $k$.

The first such integer is $49$ and the last is $51$, so the integers $m$ that make the equation have 4 distinct solutions are $49, 50, 51$. So, there are 3 such integers.

Therefore, the number of positive integers $m$ for which the equation has 4 distinct solutions is 3. The answer is: $\boxed{3}$

Approach:


1. Rewrite the absolute value equation as two separate cases based on the positive and negative variants of the inner absolute value expression.
2. Solve each case separately for the different values of m.
3. Count the number of distinct solutions for each case and sum them up.
4. The number of values of m that result in 4 distinct solutions is the number of values that satisfy this condition.

We start with the given equation \[\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}\]

Case 1: When $\vert x-1 \vert -2 \geq 0$, the equation becomes $\vert x-1 \vert -2 = \frac{m}{100}$.
Simplifying this gives $\vert x-1 \vert = 2 + \frac{m}{100}$, and further simplification leads to $x-1 = 2 + \frac{m}{100}$ or $x-1 = -(2 + \frac{m}{100})$.
Solving these two equations gives $x = 3 + \frac{m}{100}$ and $x = - \frac{m}{100} + 1$.

Case 2: When $\vert x-1 \vert -2 < 0$, the equation becomes $-\vert x-1 \vert +2 = \frac{m}{100}$.
Simplifying this gives $\vert x-1 \vert = 2 - \frac{m}{100}$, and further simplification leads to $x-1 = 2 - \frac{m}{100}$ or $x-1 = -(2 - \frac{m}{100})$.
Solving these two equations gives $x = 1 + \frac{m}{100}$ and $x = - \frac{m}{100} + 1$.

Now, let's count the number of distinct solutions for each case and sum them up.

For Case 1, there are 2 distinct solutions if and only if $2 + \frac{m}{100} > 0$, i.e., $m < 200$.
For Case 2, there are 2 distinct solutions if and only if $2 - \frac{m}{100} > 0$, i.e., $m < 200$.

Since the sum of the number of distinct solutions in both cases must equal 4, we conclude that there are 2 distinct solutions in each case for $0 < m < 200$.

Therefore, the number of positive integers $m$ that satisfy the condition is 200. The answer is: $200$

Approach:


The equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has 4 distinct solutions if $\frac{m}{100}$ is strictly between 1 and 2. 
This is because for each absolute value expression, there will be two cases:
1. If $ \vert x-1 \vert -2$ is positive or zero, we have $ \vert x-1 \vert -2 = \frac{m}{100}$. 
2. If $ \vert x-1 \vert -2$ is negative, we have $ -( \vert x-1 \vert -2) = \frac{m}{100}$.

For the first case, we have $ \vert x-1 \vert = 2 + \frac{m}{100}$. This gives two equations: $x-1 = 2 + \frac{m}{100}$ and $x-1 = -(2 + \frac{m}{100})$. The second equation simplifies to $x-1 = -2 - \frac{m}{100}$, or $x = -1 - \frac{m}{100}$. The first equation simplifies to $x = 3 + \frac{m}{100}$.

For the second case, we have $ \vert x-1 \vert = 2 - \frac{m}{100}$. This gives two equations: $x-1 = 2 - \frac{m}{100}$ and $x-1 = -(2 - \frac{m}{100})$. The second equation simplifies to $x-1 = -2 + \frac{m}{100}$, or $x = -1 + \frac{m}{100}$. The first equation simplifies to $x = 3 - \frac{m}{100}$.

So, the four distinct solutions are $x = -1 - \frac{m}{100}$, $x = -1 + \frac{m}{100}$, $x = 3 + \frac{m}{100}$, and $x = 3 - \frac{m}{100}$.

These solutions are valid if $-1 - \frac{m}{100} < -1 + \frac{m}{100}$, $-1 + \frac{m}{100} < 3 + \frac{m}{100}$, and $-1 + \frac{m}{100} < 3 - \frac{m}{100}$. Simplifying these inequalities gives $0 < m$, $m < 400$, and $m < 200$. Combining these inequalities, we find $0 < m < 200$.

The number of positive integers $m$ that satisfy this condition is $199$.

So, there are 199 positive integers $m$ for which the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has 4 distinct solutions.

The value of $m$ that we are looking for is 199. The answer is: $199$

Approach:

 The equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ will have 4 distinct solutions when $\frac{m}{100}$ is the maximum value that makes the expression on the left hand side non-negative. This is because the absolute value function makes the expression inside it non-negative, and we want the expression inside the absolute value to be non-negative for the equation to have 4 distinct solutions.

So, we set $\frac{m}{100} \leq 2$ and solve for $m$. Multiply both sides of the inequality by 100, we get $m \leq 200$. Therefore, $m$ can be any positive integer from $1$ to $200$. 

However, we want the number of values of $m$ for which the equation has exactly 4 distinct solutions. By observation, the value of $\frac{m}{100}$ should be equal to 2 for the equation to have exactly 4 distinct solutions. This is because the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ will have 4 distinct solutions when $\frac{m}{100}$ is equal to the distance between the two branches of the absolute value function on the left hand side. 

So, we set $\frac{m}{100} = 2$ and solve for $m$. Multiply both sides of the equation by 100, we get $m = 200$. 

Therefore, there is only 1 value of $m$, which is $200$, for which the equation has exactly 4 distinct solutions. The answer is: $1$

Approach:



To solve this problem, we need to understand that the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has 4 distinct solutions. This equation is a transformation of the so-called "double-abs" function, which has a characteristic "V" shape with two vertices. The distance between the vertices of the "V" is determined by $\frac{m}{100}$. 

Because the equation has 4 distinct solutions, the "V" must be tall enough to cross the x-axis at exactly two points, which means the height of the "V" (the value of $\frac{m}{100}$) must be greater than 2. 

Therefore, we can set up the inequality $\frac{m}{100} > 2$ and solve for $m$. 

Solution:

\[\frac{m}{100} > 2\]

Multiply both sides by 100:

\[m > 200\]

So $m$ must be greater than 200. Since $m$ is a positive integer, the least value of $m$ that satisfies the inequality is 201. 

However, the question asks for the number of positive integers $m$, so we need to find the total number of positive integers greater than 200. 

Since the largest positive integer greater than 200 is infinity, it's impossible to count the exact number of positive integers greater than 200. But since the question only asks for how many positive integers $m$, we can find the answer by subtracting 200 from the next integer, which is 201. 

So, the number of positive integers $m$ is $201 - 200 = 1$.

However, this result doesn't make sense because we know that there must be more than one positive integer $m$ that satisfies the equation. 

The error comes from the interpretation of the question. The question asks for the number of positive integers $m$ such that the equation has 4 distinct solutions. However, we have interpreted it as the value of $m$ that makes the equation have 4 distinct solutions. 

The correct interpretation is that for each positive integer $m$ greater than 200, the equation will have 4 distinct solutions. So we are actually looking for the number of positive integers greater than 200. 

The number of positive integers greater than 200 is infinity, but we can only choose a finite number of them to find the value of $m$. In this case, we need to find the integer part of the solution by subtracting 200 from the next integer, which is 201. 

However, this result also doesn't make sense because we know that there must be more than one positive integer $m$ that satisfies the equation.

Approach:


To start, we need to understand that the absolute value equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ will have four distinct solutions if and only if $\frac{m}{100}$ is strictly less than $2$ but strictly greater than $0$. This is because the graph of $y = \vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert$ has two "bends" or "kinks" at $x = 1 \pm 2$, and it increases from $0$ to $2$ as $x$ increases from $1-2$ to $1+2$. So, for the equation to have four distinct solutions, the right side of the equation, $\frac{m}{100}$, must be strictly between $0$ and $2$. In other words, $0 < \frac{m}{100} < 2$.

To solve this inequality, we can first multiply all sides by $100$ to get rid of the fraction:
$$0 < m < 200.$$

Then, the number of positive integers $m$ that satisfy this inequality is simply $200 - 1 = 199$.

Therefore, there are $199$ positive integers $m$ for which the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has four distinct solutions. The answer is: $199$

The equation $| |x-1| - 2| = \frac{m}{100}$ has 4 distinct solutions, which means the right hand side must be in the range $(0, 3)$.
So, $0 < \frac{m}{100} < 3$, which implies $0 < m < 300$.
The positive integers $m$ that satisfy this inequality are $1, 2, ..., 299$.
We want to find how many of these integers divide 300.

Approach:


This problem involves finding the value of $m$ for which the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has $4$ distinct solutions. We can start by understanding the structure of the equation. The equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ is a piecewise function with $4$ cases based on the value of $x$. We can solve the equation for each case and find the corresponding value of $m$.

Solution:
For each case, we solve the equation and find the value of $m$.

Case 1: $x-1 \geq 2$ or $x \geq 3$. The equation becomes $\vert x-1-2 \vert = \frac{m}{100}$ or $\vert x-3 \vert = \frac{m}{100}$. The two possible equations are $x-3 = \frac{m}{100}$ and $3-x = \frac{m}{100}$. Solving these equations gives $x = 3+\frac{m}{100}$ and $x = 3-\frac{m}{100}$ respectively. The condition for $x$ to have $4$ distinct solutions is $3-\frac{m}{100} < 1$ and $1 < 3+\frac{m}{100}$, which simplifies to $m < 200$ and $m > -200$. Since $m$ is a positive integer, we get $m < 200$.

Case 2: $1 \leq x < 3$. The equation becomes $\vert 1-x-2 \vert = \frac{m}{100}$ or $\vert -x-1 \vert = \frac{m}{100}$. This simplifies to $\vert x+1 \vert = \frac{m}{100}$. The two possible equations are $x+1 = \frac{m}{100}$ and $-(x+1) = \frac{m}{100}$. Solving these equations gives $x = \frac{m}{100} - 1$ and $x = -1-\frac{m}{100}$ respectively. The condition for $x$ to have $4$ distinct solutions is $\frac{m}{100} - 1 < 1$ and $1 < -1-\frac{m}{100}$, which simplifies to $m < 200$.

Case 3: $0 \leq x < 1$. The equation becomes $\vert 1-x-2 \vert = \frac{m}{100}$ or $\vert -x-1 \vert = \frac{m}{100}$. This simplifies to $\vert x+1 \vert = \frac{m}{100}$. The two possible equations are $x+1 = \frac{m}{100}$ and $-(x+1) = \frac{m}{100}$. Solving these equations gives $x = \frac{m}{100} - 1$ and $x = -1-\frac{m}{100}$ respectively. The condition for $x$ to have $4$ distinct solutions is $\frac{m}{100} - 1 < 0$ and $0 < -1-\frac{m}{100}$, which simplifies to $m > 100$.

Case 4: $x < 0$. The equation becomes $\vert -(x-1)-2 \vert = \frac{m}{100}$ or $\vert -x+1 \vert = \frac{m}{100}$. This simplifies to $\vert x-1 \vert = \frac{m}{100}$. The two possible equations are $x-1 = \frac{m}{100}$ and $1-x = \frac{m}{100}$. Solving these equations gives $x = 1+\frac{m}{100}$ and $x = 1-\frac{m}{100}$ respectively. The condition for $x$ to have $4$ distinct solutions is $1-\frac{m}{100} < 0$, which simplifies to $m > 100$.

From the above analysis, we can conclude that $m$ must be in the range $100 < m < 200$. The only positive integer $m$ in this range is $101$. Therefore, the value of $m$ for which the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has $4$ distinct solutions is $m = 101$. The answer is: 101

Approach:


The problem asks for how many positive integers $m$ the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has $4$ distinct solutions.
We can start by noting that the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ is equivalent to two separate conditions:
1. $\vert x-1 \vert -2=\frac{m}{100}$ and
2. $\vert x-1 \vert -2=-\frac{m}{100}$.

For each of these conditions, we can rewrite the absolute value equation as two separate equations:

1a. $\vert x-1 \vert = 2 + \frac{m}{100}$
1b. $\vert x-1 \vert = 2 - \frac{m}{100}$

Now, we can rewrite the absolute value equations as four separate equations:

1a1. $x - 1 = 2 + \frac{m}{100}$
1a2. $x - 1 = -(2 + \frac{m}{100})$
1b1. $x - 1 = 2 - \frac{m}{100}$
1b2. $x - 1 = -(2 - \frac{m}{100})$

Solving these equations, we find that the number of distinct solutions for each equation depends on the value of $m$.
If $m=0$, then all four equations simplify to $x=3$, $x=-1$, $x=1$, and $x=-3$, and only $x=3$ and $x=-3$ are distinct.
If $0<m<200$, then the number of distinct solutions is $4$.
If $m=200$, then only $x=1$ is a solution.
If $200<m<400$, then the number of distinct solutions is $2$.
If $m=400$, then all four equations simplify to $x=5$, $x=-3$, $x=3$, and $x=-1$, and only $x=5$ and $x=-3$ are distinct.
If $m>400$, then the number of distinct solutions is $0$.

Therefore, the only value of $m$ for which the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has $4$ distinct solutions is $m=200$.
Therefore, the number of positive integers $m$ for which the equation has $4$ distinct solutions is $1$.
The answer is: 1

Approach:

 We can start by analyzing the equation \[| |x-1|-2|=\frac{m}{100}.\]The right-hand side of the equation is a positive value, which means that the absolute value of $|x-1|-2$ must be equal to a positive value. This implies that $|x-1|-2$ must be equal to either $\frac{m}{100}$ or $-\frac{m}{100}$. So we have two equations to consider:

1. $|x-1|-2=\frac{m}{100}$.
2. $|x-1|-2=-\frac{m}{100}$.

We can solve each of these equations separately and count the number of distinct solutions for each $m$.

For equation 1:
\[|x-1|-2=\frac{m}{100} \implies |x-1|=\frac{m}{100}+2.\]This equation has two branches: $x-1=\frac{m}{100}+2$ and $x-1=-\frac{m}{100}-2$. Solving for $x$ in each branch gives:
\[x = 1 + \frac{m}{100} + 2 = \frac{m}{100} + 3\] and \[x = 1 - \frac{m}{100} - 2 = 1 - \frac{m}{100} - 2 = - \frac{m}{100} - 1.\]So the solutions for equation 1 are $x = \frac{m}{100} + 3$ and $x = - \frac{m}{100} - 1$.

For equation 2:
\[|x-1|-2=-\frac{m}{100} \implies |x-1|=2-\frac{m}{100}.\]This equation also has two branches: $x-1=2-\frac{m}{100}$ and $x-1=-(2-\frac{m}{100})$. Solving for $x$ in each branch gives:
\[x = 1 + 2 - \frac{m}{100} = 3 - \frac{m}{100}\] and \[x = 1 - (2 - \frac{m}{100}) = 1 - 2 + \frac{m}{100} = -1 + \frac{m}{100}.\]So the solutions for equation 2 are $x = 3 - \frac{m}{100}$ and $x = -1 + \frac{m}{100}$.

Now, we need to count the number of distinct solutions for each $m$. Notice that the solutions for equation 1 and equation 2 are distinct except when they are equal. This happens when \[\frac{m}{100} + 3 = 3 - \frac{m}{100} \quad \text{or} \quad \frac{m}{100} + 3 = -1 + \frac{m}{100}.\]Solving these equations gives $m=0$ or $m=0$ which is not possible since $m$ is a positive integer. Similarly, we have \[\frac{m}{100} + 3 = -1 + \frac{m}{100} \implies 3 = -1\] which is also not possible. Therefore, the solutions for equation 1 and equation 2 are always distinct.

So, for each positive integer $m$, the equation \[| |x-1|-2|=\frac{m}{100}\] has 4 distinct solutions. Therefore, the number of such positive integers $m$ is 1. The answer is: $1$
