Interesting, let's analyze step by step:



The condition $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + (\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + (\vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ is true if and only if $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$, $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$, $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$, and $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$.
These equations imply that $|x+y|=10$, $|x-y|=10$, $|x|=8$, and $|y|=8$.
The solutions for these equations are as follows:

1. $|x+y|=10$ gives $x+y=10$ or $x+y=-10$.
2. $|x-y|=10$ gives $x-y=10$ or $x-y=-10$.
3. $|x|=8$ gives $x=8$ or $x=-8$.
4. $|y|=8$ gives $y=8$ or $y=-8$.

Solving these equations simultaneously, we get the vertices of the polygon: $(8, 8)$, $(8, -8)$, $(-8, 8)$, and $(-8, -8)$. The polygon is a square with side length 16.

To calculate the area of this square, use the formula for the area of a square (side length squared):

\[Area = (side \ length)^2 = 16^2 = 256.\]

Finally, we verify that the area is a positive integer:
The calculated area is $256$, which is a positive integer.
The answer is: $256$

The condition $A \cdot B = 0$ is equivalent to either $A=0$ or $B=0$. So the given condition in the question is satisfied when at least one of the following conditions is true:
\[((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + (\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2) = 0,\]
\[((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + (\vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0.\]

The equation $A^2 = 0$ has only one solution: $A = 0$. Hence the conditions above imply that either
\[\vert x + y \vert - 10 = 0, \ \vert x - y \vert - 10 = 0, \ \vert x \vert - 8 = 0, \ \vert y \vert - 8 = 0.\]
The solutions to these equations are:
\[x+y = 10, \ x-y = 10, \ x = \pm 8, \ y = \pm 8.\]

These solutions correspond to a square with vertices at $(8,8), (-8,8), (-8,-8), (8,-8)$.

We use `sympy` to calculate its area:
```python


INTERMEDIATE OUT :

from sympy import symbols, Abs

def square_area():
    x, y = symbols('x y')

    # Calculate the side length of the square
    side_length = 2 * Abs(8)

    # Calculate the area of the square
    area = side_length**2

    return area

result = square_area()
print(result)
```

CODE RESULTS 256

INTERMEDIATE OUT :
```output
256
```

The area of the convex polygon is $256$. So the answer is $\boxed{256}$.

Interesting, let's analyze step by step:



In order for the entire product to be 0, one of the terms in the product must be 0. Therefore, we have the two conditions that either:
\[((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2) = 0\]
\[((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0\]


From the first equation:
\[\vert x + y \vert = 10 \land \vert x - y \vert = 10\]
This means that both $x+y = \pm10$ and $x-y = \pm10$  which gives us the vertices of the square: $(5,5),(-5,5),(-5,-5),(5,-5)$.

The second equation simplifies to $\vert x \vert = 8 \land \vert y \vert = 8$, so $x=\pm8$ and $y=\pm8$.  The vertices of the square in this case are $(8,8),(8,-8),(-8,-8),(-8,8)$.

By plotting these two squares, we see that their intersection forms a 8x8 square. So we just need to find its area, which is the product of its sides. That's $8^2 = 64$ square units. The area is therefore 64.

The final answer is $64$
The answer is: 64

If a product is zero, then at least one of the factors is zero. Hence

Either $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0 \Rightarrow \vert x + y \vert = 10 \Rightarrow x + y = \pm 10$ or $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0 \Rightarrow \vert x - y \vert = 10 \Rightarrow x - y = \pm 10$.

Or, $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0 \Rightarrow \vert x \vert = 8 \Rightarrow x = \pm 8$ or $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0 \Rightarrow \vert y \vert = 8 \Rightarrow y = \pm 8$.

Thus, the lines $x + y = \pm 10$, $x - y = \pm 10$, $x = \pm 8$, $y = \pm 8$ form the boundary of the polygon. Drawing these lines we can identify the polygon as a square with side length $16$. Now the area of this square is $16^2 = 256$. The answer should be a positive integer:

256
The answer is: $256$
