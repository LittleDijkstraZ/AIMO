Below is a math problem you are to solve (positive numerical answer!):
"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"
Analyze this problem and think step by step to come to a solution with programs. After solving the problem, output the final numerical answer within \boxed{}.

Assistant:

 The given equation is equal to zero if and only if both factors are equal to zero.
This means that either $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$.

From $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$, we have $\vert x + y \vert = 10$. This means that $x + y = \pm 10$.
From $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$, we have $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. This means that $x - y = \pm 10$.
From $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$, we have $\vert x \vert = 8$. This means that $x = \pm 8$.
From $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$, we have $\vert y \vert = 8$. This means that $y = \pm 8$.

The points that satisfy these conditions are: $(8, 8)$, $(-8, 8)$, $(8, -8)$, $(-8, -8)$, $(10, 0)$, $(-10, 0)$, $(0, 10)$, and $(0, -10)$. These points form a square with side length 16.

The area of this square is $16^2 = 256$.

Therefore, the area of the convex polygon is 256. The answer is: $256$

Below is a math problem you are to solve (positive numerical answer!):
"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"

This problem can be solved by noticing that the expression $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2)$ is equal to zero if and only if either $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$.
The first two conditions imply that $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$, which means that $x$ and $y$ are both $5$ or both $-5$. The last two conditions imply that $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$, which means that $x$ is in $[-8, 8]$ and $y$ is in $[-8, 8]$. Combining these conditions, we find that the points $(x, y)$ that satisfy the equation are exactly the points in the square with vertices at $(8, 8)$, $(-8, 8)$, $(-8, -8)$, and $(8, -8)$, as well as the points in the square with vertices at $(5, 5)$, $(-5, 5)$, $(-5, -5)$, and $(5, -5)$. The intersection of these two squares is a square with side length $10$, so its area is $10^2 = 100$. The answer is: $100$

Below is a math problem you are to solve (positive numerical answer!):
"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"
Analyze this problem and think step by step to come to a solution with programs. After solving the problem, output the final numerical answer within \boxed{}.

Assistant:

 The problem involves solving an equation and finding the area of the polygon enclosed by the points that satisfy the equation. The equation is
$$((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0.$$
The equation equals to zero if either of the two factors equals to zero. 

1. For the first factor, we have two cases:
   a. $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ which implies $\vert x + y \vert = 10$, or 
   b. $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ which implies $\vert x - y \vert = 10$.
   
2. For the second factor, we have two cases:
   a. $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ which implies $\vert x \vert = 8$, or
   b. $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ which implies $\vert y \vert = 8$.

These conditions define a square with vertices at $(\pm8, \pm8)$. The area of this square is $8 \times 8 = 64$. Therefore, the area of the convex polygon is 64 square units.

"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"
Analyze this problem and think step by step to come to a solution with programs. After solving the problem, output the final numerical answer within \boxed{}.

Assistant:

 The given equation is a product of two terms equal to zero. This means that either the first term is zero, the second term is zero, or both are zero.

The first term is zero when $|\pm x \pm y| - 10 = 0$, which simplifies to $|\pm x \pm y| = 10$. This gives us four equations: $|x + y| = 10$, $|x - y| = 10$, $|x| = 8$, and $|y| = 8$.

The second term is zero when $|\pm x| - 8 = 0$ or $|\pm y| - 8 = 0$, which simplifies to $|x| = 8$ or $|y| = 8$.

The solutions to these equations are the vertices of the polygon. The polygon is a square with side length 16 (since $|x| = 8$ and $|y| = 8$ give the coordinates of the vertices).

The area of a square is side length squared, so the area of this square is $16^2 = 256$.
The answer is: $256$

Below is a math problem you are to solve (positive numerical answer!):
"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"
Analyze this problem and think step by step to come to a solution with programs. After solving the problem, output the final numerical answer within \boxed{}.

Assistant:

 The equation $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ implies that $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. This means that $x + y = \pm 10$ and $x - y = \pm 10$. Solving these four equations, we find that the points are $(0, 10)$, $(0, -10)$, $(10, 0)$, and $(-10, 0)$.

Similarly, the equation $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ implies that $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$. This means that $x = \pm 8$ and $y = \pm 8$. So the points are $(8, 8)$, $(8, -8)$, $(-8, 8)$, and $(-8, -8)$.

The points $(0, 10)$, $(0, -10)$, $(10, 0)$, and $(-10, 0)$ form a square with side length $10$, so its area is $10^2 = 100$. The points $(8, 8)$, $(8, -8)$, $(-8, 8)$, and $(-8, -8)$ form a square with side length $16$, so its area is $16^2 = 256$.

Therefore, the area of the convex polygon is the sum of the areas of these two squares, which is $100 + 256 = 356$. The answer is: $356$

"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"
Analyze this problem and think step by step to come to a solution with programs. After solving the problem, output the final numerical answer within \boxed{}.

Assistant:


The equation $A \cdot B = 0$ is true if and only if either $A = 0$ or $B = 0$. So, the given equation is satisfied if either $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2) = 0$ or $((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$.

If $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2) = 0$, then $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. This implies that $x + y = \pm 10$ and $x - y = \pm 10$. Solving these equations gives us the vertices of the square: $(8, 2)$, $(8, -2)$, $(-8, -2)$, and $(-8, 2)$.

If $((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$, then $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$. This implies that $x = \pm 8$ and $y = \pm 8$. Solving these equations gives us the vertices of the square: $(8, 8)$, $(8, -8)$, $(-8, -8)$, and $(-8, 8)$.

So, the convex polygon is a square with side length $20$. The area of a square is side length squared, so the area of this square is $20^2 = 400$. The answer is: $400$.

"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"
Analyze this problem and think step by step to come to a solution with programs. After solving the problem, output the final numerical answer within \boxed{}.

Assistant:

 The problem statement implies that the points that satisfy the equation $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + (\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + (\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ are the vertices of a convex polygon.

The equation $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + (\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ is satisfied if and only if $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. This implies that $x + y = \pm 10$ and $x - y = \pm 10$, which gives us the vertices of a square with side length $10\sqrt{2}$.

The equation $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + (\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ is satisfied if and only if $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$, which implies that $x = \pm 8$ and $y = \pm 8$. This gives us a square with side length $16$.

Therefore, the convex polygon is the union of these two squares, and its area is the sum of the areas of these two squares. The area of a square with side length $a$ is $a^2$, so the area of the first square is $(10\sqrt{2})^2 = 200$, and the area of the second square is $16^2 = 256$. Thus, the total area of the convex polygon is $200 + 256 = 456$. The answer is: $456$

Analyze this problem and think step by step to come to a solution with programs. After solving the problem, output the final numerical answer within \boxed{}.

Assistant:



The given equation is equal to zero if and only if either $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$.
This means that the points $\left(x, y\right)$ must satisfy at least one of the following conditions:
1. $\vert x + y \vert = 10$
2. $\vert x - y \vert = 10$
3. $\vert x \vert = 8$
4. $\vert y \vert = 8$

The conditions 3 and 4 give us the four vertical and horizontal lines that form the boundary of the square.

The conditions 1 and 2 give us the two diagonals of the square.

So, the points $\left(x, y\right)$ that satisfy the given equation are the vertices of a square with side length 16 (since $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$ imply that the distance between any two opposite vertices of the square is $8 + 8 = 16$).

The area of this square is $16^2 = 256$.

So, the area of the convex polygon is 256. The answer is: 256

Below is a math problem you are to solve (positive numerical answer!):
"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"
Analyze this problem and think step by step to come to a solution with programs. After solving the problem, output the final numerical answer within \boxed{}.

Assistant:


The given equation is $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$. The product of two numbers is zero if and only if at least one of the numbers is zero. Therefore, either $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$. 

If $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$, then $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$, which means $x + y = \pm 10$ and $x - y = \pm 10$. Solving these equations gives us the vertices of the polygon as $(0, 10)$, $(0, -10)$, $(10, 0)$, $(-10, 0)$, $(8, 8)$, $(8, -8)$, $(-8, 8)$, and $(-8, -8)$.

If $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$, then $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$, which means $x = \pm 8$ and $y = \pm 8$. But this case doesn't give any new vertices.

So the vertices of the polygon are $(0, 10)$, $(0, -10)$, $(10, 0)$, $(-10, 0)$, $(8, 8)$, $(8, -8)$, $(-8, 8)$, and $(-8, -8)$. These points form a square with side length 10. The area of this square is $10^2 = 100$. Therefore, the area of the convex polygon is 100 square units. The answer is: $100$

Below is a math problem you are to solve (positive numerical answer!):
"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"
Analyze this problem and think step by step to come to a solution with programs. After solving the problem, output the final numerical answer within \boxed{}.

Assistant:

 The equation $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + (\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + (\vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ is satisfied if and only if at least one of the following two conditions is satisfied:

1. $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + (\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$
2. $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + (\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$

For the first condition to be satisfied, we must have $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. This implies that $x + y = \pm 10$ and $x - y = \pm 10$. Solving these equations gives us the vertices of the square: $(8, 2)$, $(8, -2)$, $(-8, -2)$, and $(-8, 2)$.

For the second condition to be satisfied, we must have $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$. This implies that $x = \pm 8$ and $y = \pm 8$. Solving these equations gives us the vertices of the square: $(8, 8)$, $(8, -8)$, $(-8, -8)$, and $(-8, 8)$.

The union of these two squares forms a larger square with side length $10\sqrt{2}$, which is the diagonal of the smaller $8 \times 8$ square. The area of this square is $(10\sqrt{2})^2 / 2 = 100$.

So, the area of the convex polygon is 100. The answer is: $100$

Analyze this problem and think step by step to come to a solution with programs. After solving the problem, output the final numerical answer within \boxed{}.

Assistant:


The given equation is a product of two terms equal to zero. This means that either the first term is zero or the second term is zero.

The first term is $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)$. This term equals to zero when $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. These two equations represent a square with side length 10 and diagonals of length 10√2.

The second term is $((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2)$. This term equals to zero when $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$. These two equations represent a square with side length 16 and diagonals of length 16√2.

Therefore, the convex polygon enclosed by the points that satisfy the given equation is the intersection of these two squares, which is a smaller square with side length 10 and diagonals of length 10√2.

The area of a square is calculated by the formula $s^2$, where $s$ is the side length of the square. So, the area of the convex polygon is $10^2 = 100$.

So the answer is: $\boxed{100}$.
