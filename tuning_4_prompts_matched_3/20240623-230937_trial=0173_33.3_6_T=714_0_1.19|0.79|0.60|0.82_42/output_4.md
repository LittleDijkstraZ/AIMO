 This problem is a challenging functional equation problem. To solve it, we need to find a function $f$ that satisfies both given conditions. 

Let's start by trying to find the value of $f(1)$. From the second condition, we have $f(2) = 2f(1) + 1$. Substituting $n = 1$ into the first condition gives $f(f(f(1))) = 8*1 - 7 = 1$. Since $f(f(f(1))) = 1$, we have $f(f(1)) = f(1)$ and thus $f(1) = 1$.

Now we can find $f(2)$ using the second condition: $f(2) = 2f(1) + 1 = 2*1 + 1 = 3$.

We can continue this process to find $f(3)$, $f(4)$, and so on. However, this approach is quite time-consuming and error-prone. A more efficient way is to guess the form of the function $f$ and check if it satisfies the given conditions.

Based on the first condition, we can guess that $f(n) = 2n - 1$. Let's check if this function satisfies both conditions:

1. For the first condition, we have $f(f(f(n))) = f(f(2n - 1)) = f(2(2n - 1) - 1) = f(4n - 3) = 2(4n - 3) - 1 = 8n - 7$, which is indeed the right-hand side of the equation.

2. For the second condition, we have $f(2n) = 2(2n) - 1 = 4n - 1 = 2f(n) + 1$.

So, the function $f(n) = 2n - 1$ is a solution to the problem. Now we can find $f(100)$ by substituting $n = 100$ into the function: $f(100) = 2*100 - 1 = 199$.

Therefore, the value of $f(100)$ is $199$. The answer is: $199$

 To solve this problem, we need to find a function $f(n)$ that satisfies the given conditions. Let's try to find the value of $f(100)$ using the given conditions.

We can start by finding $f(f(f(100)))$ using the first condition. We know that $f(f(f(100))) = 8*100 - 7 = 793$. 

Now let's set $f(f(100)) = x$ and solve the equation $f(x) = 793$.

Using the second condition, we know that $f(2n) = 2f(n) + 1$. So if we set $2n = x$, we get $f(x) = 2f(n) + 1$. But we want to find $f(x) = 793$, so we need to find a value of $n$ such that $2f(n) + 1 = 793$. Solving this equation gives us $2f(n) = 792$ and $f(n) = 396$.

Now let's set $f(100) = y$ and solve the equation $f(y) = 396$. Again using the second condition, we have $f(2n) = 2f(n) + 1$. If we set $2n = y$, we get $f(y) = 2f(n) + 1$. But we want to find $f(y) = 396$, so we need to find a value of $n$ such that $2f(n) + 1 = 396$. Solving this equation gives us $2f(n) = 395$ and $f(n) = 197.5$.

However, the function $f$ is defined on the set of natural numbers, and we cannot have a half-integer value for $f(n)$. This means we must have made a mistake in our reasoning. Let's try a different approach.

We can start by plugging in $n = 1$ into the given conditions:
1. $f(f(f(1))) = 8*1 - 7 = 1$.
2. $f(2*1) = 2f(1) + 1$. This gives us $f(2) = 2f(1) + 1$.

From the first condition, we know that $f(f(f(1))) = 1$, so $f(1) = 1$. Substituting $f(1) = 1$ into the second condition gives us $f(2) = 2*1 + 1 = 3$.

Now let's try to find $f(100)$ using these initial values. We know that $f(1) = 1$ and $f(2) = 3$. We can use the second condition to find $f(4) = 2f(2) + 1 = 2*3 + 1 = 7$. Then we can use the second condition again to find $f(8) = 2f(4) + 1 = 2*7 + 1 = 15$. Continuing this process, we can find $f(16) = 31$, $f(32) = 63$, $f(64) = 127$, and $f(128) = 255$.

We can see that the function $f(n)$ seems to be doubling the value of $n$ and subtracting 1 each time. This suggests that $f(n) = 2n - 1$. Let's check if this function satisfies the given conditions.

For the first condition, we have $f(f(f(n))) = f(f(2n - 1)) = f(2(2n - 1) - 1) = f(4n - 3) = 8n - 7$.

For the second condition, we have $f(2n) = 2(2n) - 1 = 4n - 1 = 2f(n) + 1$.

So indeed, $f(n) = 2n - 1$ is a solution to the given problem. Now we can find $f(100)$ by substituting $n = 100$ into the function: $f(100) = 2*100 - 1 = 199$.

Therefore, the value of $f(100)$ is $199$. The answer is: $199$

 To solve this problem, we need to find the value of $f(100)$ based on the given functional equations. 

First, we can try to find the value of $f(1)$ using the second equation: $f(2) = 2f(1) + 1$. Since we know $f(f(f(1))) = 8*1 - 7 = 1$, we can set $f(f(1)) = 1$ and solve for $f(1)$. From $f(2n) = 2f(n) + 1$, when $n=1$, we have $f(2) = 2f(1) + 1$. But we also know $f(f(f(1))) = 1$, and since $f(f(1)) = 2n$, we have $f(f(1)) = 2$. So we can set $f(f(1)) = 2$ and solve for $f(1)$.

By substituting $f(2) = 2f(1) + 1$ with $f(f(1)) = 2$, we get $2 = 2f(1) + 1$, which simplifies to $f(1) = \frac{1}{2}$. However, since $f(1)$ is a natural number, this result is not possible. 

Let's try another approach. We know that $f(f(f(1))) = 1$, and from the second equation, we have $f(2) = 2f(1) + 1$. If we substitute $f(2)$ with $f(f(1))$ in the second equation, we get $f(f(1)) = 2f(1) + 1$. Since we know $f(f(1)) = 2$, we can substitute that into the equation and get $2 = 2f(1) + 1$, which simplifies to $f(1) = \frac{1}{2}$. Again, this result is not possible because $f(1)$ is a natural number.

At this point, we realize that there must be a mistake in our reasoning. Let's go back to the first equation $f(f(f(n))) = 8n - 7$. When $n=1$, we have $f(f(f(1))) = 8*1 - 7 = 1$.

"A function $f: \mathbb N \to \mathbb N$ satisfies the following two conditions for all positive integers $n$:$f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$ and $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$. Calculate $f(100)$."

 To solve this problem, we need to find a function $f$ that satisfies the given conditions and then calculate $f(100)$.

The first condition $f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$ suggests that the function $f$ is an involution, meaning that applying the function three times returns the original value. 

The second condition $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$ implies that the function $f$ is linear on even numbers.

By combining these two conditions, we can guess that $f(n) = 2n - 1$ for all positive integers $n$. Let's check if this function satisfies both conditions.

For the first condition, we have:
$$f(f(f(n))) = f(f(2n-1)) = f(2(2n-1)-1) = f(4n-3) = 8n-7.$$

For the second condition, we have:
$$f(2n) = 2(2n-1) + 1 = 4n - 2 + 1 = 4n - 1, \quad \text{and} \quad 2f(n) + 1 = 2(2n-1) + 1 = 4n - 2 + 1 = 4n - 1.$$

So, the function $f(n) = 2n - 1$ satisfies both conditions.

Now we can calculate $f(100)$:
$$f(100) = 2 \cdot 100 - 1 = 200 - 1 = 199.$$

Therefore, the value of $f(100)$ is 199. The answer is: $\boxed{199}$.

Solving this problem directly is difficult due to the complexity of the function $f$. However, we can make some observations and use them to simplify the problem.

From the first equation $f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$, we can see that $f$ composed with itself three times maps every natural number to $8n-7$. This suggests that $f$ might be a bijection (one-to-one and onto), which means that for every output, there is exactly one input that maps to it.

From the second equation $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$, we can see that $f$ is an odd function, because it adds 1 to the even function $2f(n)$. This property helps us in finding a pattern in the function values.

Now, let's try to find the value of $f(1)$. Using the second equation with $n=1$, we get $f(2)=2f(1)+1$. Since $f(f(f(1)))=8*1-7=1$, we know that $f(1)$ is the only natural number such that $f(f(f(1)))=1$. Therefore, we can conclude that $f(1)=1$.

Substituting $f(1)=1$ into the equation $f(2)=2f(1)+1$, we get $f(2)=2*1+1=3$.

Continuing this way, we can find that $f(3)=5$, $f(5)=7$, $f(7)=9$, and so on. It seems that $f(n)=2n-1$ for all odd $n$.

Now, let's check if this pattern holds for even numbers. For $n=2$, we have $f(4)=2f(2)+1=2*3+1=7$. And indeed, $f(f(f(2)))=f(f(3))=f(5)=7$.

So, the function $f(n)$ seems to be $f(n)=2n-1$ for all positive integers $n$. This function satisfies both the given conditions. Therefore, $f(100)=2*100-1=199$.

```python

So, the value of $f(100)$ is 199. The answer is: $\boxed{199}$.
