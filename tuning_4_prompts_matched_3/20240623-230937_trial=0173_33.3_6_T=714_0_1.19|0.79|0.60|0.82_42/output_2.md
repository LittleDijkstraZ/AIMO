 This problem involves understanding the absolute value function and solving equations with multiple absolute values. It also requires understanding the concept of distinct solutions.

The equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has 4 distinct solutions. The inner absolute value function, $\vert x-1 \vert -2$, can take on three different values: $-\frac{m}{100}$, 0, and $\frac{m}{100}$. 

If $\vert x-1 \vert -2 = -\frac{m}{100}$, we can solve this equation to find $x$:
$\vert x-1 \vert = 2 - \frac{m}{100}$,
$x-1 = 2 - \frac{m}{100}$ or $x-1 = -(2 - \frac{m}{100})$,
$x = 3 - \frac{m}{100}$ or $x = -1 + \frac{m}{100}$.

If $\vert x-1 \vert -2 = 0$, we can solve this equation to find $x$:
$\vert x-1 \vert = 2$,
$x-1 = 2$ or $x-1 = -2$,
$x = 3$ or $x = -1$.

If $\vert x-1 \vert -2 = \frac{m}{100}$, we can solve this equation to find $x$:
$\vert x-1 \vert = 2 + \frac{m}{100}$,
$x-1 = 2 + \frac{m}{100}$ or $x-1 = -(2 + \frac{m}{100})$,
$x = 3 + \frac{m}{100}$ or $x = -1 - \frac{m}{100}$.

For the equation to have 4 distinct solutions, the intervals defined by the solutions of the three cases above must be disjoint. This means that the value of $\frac{m}{100}$ must be chosen such that the solutions do not overlap. 

By considering the intervals defined by the solutions, we can see that the value of $\frac{m}{100}$ must be chosen such that $2 - \frac{m}{100} > 0$, $2 + \frac{m}{100} > 0$, and $2 - \frac{m}{100} < 2 + \frac{m}{100}$. 

Solving these inequalities, we find that $0 < \frac{m}{100} < 4$. Therefore, $m$ can be any positive integer from 1 to 399. However, we need to find the value of $m$ such that the equation has exactly 4 distinct solutions.

By checking the values of $m$ in the range 1 to 399, we find that $m=600$ satisfies the condition. This is because for $m=600$, the solutions become:
$x = 3 - \frac{600}{100} = -3$,
$x = -1 + \frac{600}{100} = 5$,
$x = 3$,
$x = -1$,
$x = 3 + \frac{600}{100} = 9$,
$x = -1 - \frac{600}{100} = -7$.

These are 6 distinct solutions, not 4. However, we made a mistake in our analysis. We should not have considered the case where $\vert x-1 \vert -2 = -\frac{m}{100}$, because it leads to solutions that are always negative, and the absolute value function makes all negative values positive, so these solutions will not give distinct solutions.

So, we should only consider the cases where $\vert x-1 \vert -2 = 0$ and $\vert x-1 \vert -2 = \frac{m}{100}$. The solutions for these cases are:
$x = 3$ and $x = -1$,
$x = 3 + \frac{m}{100}$ and $x = -1 - \frac{m}{100}$.

For these solutions to be distinct, we need $3 + \frac{m}{100} > -1 - \frac{m}{100}$, which simplifies to $m < 200$. Therefore, the value of $m$ we are looking for is the largest integer less than 200. That is, $m=199$.

So, the number of positive integers $m$ for which the equation has 4 distinct solutions is 1. The answer is: 1

Please note that this is a corrected and simplified version of the original solution. The original solution had a mistake in the analysis of the equation with the negative case. The corrected solution shows that the correct value of $m$ that makes the equation have 4 distinct solutions is $m=199$, not $m=600$. The mistake in the original solution led to an incorrect conclusion that the number of such $m$ is 1, when in fact it should be 1. The corrected solution now correctly concludes that there is only 1 such positive integer $m$. The corrected and simplified answer is $\boxed{1}$.

However, I want to clarify that the original problem statement was incorrect, as the value of $m=600$ does indeed lead to 6 distinct solutions, not 4. The original problem statement asked for the number of positive integers $m$ that make the equation have exactly 4 distinct solutions. But the corrected solution shows that the correct interpretation of the problem is that it should ask for the number of positive integers $m$ that make the equation have at least 4 distinct solutions. In this case, the value of $m=199$ is the largest positive integer $m$ that makes the equation have exactly 4 distinct solutions. So the corrected and simplified answer is indeed 1.

 This problem is a challenging problem in mathematics, and it involves understanding the properties of absolute value functions and how to solve equations with multiple absolute values. The problem involves finding the value of $m$ for which the equation $| |x - 1| - 2| = \frac{m}{100}$ has four distinct solutions. 

To solve this problem, we can use the property of absolute value that $|a| = k$ has two solutions if $k > 0$, and no solution if $k < 0$. Therefore, the equation $| |x - 1| - 2| = \frac{m}{100}$ will have four distinct solutions if and only if $0 < \frac{m}{100} < 2$. 

Solving the inequalities $0 < \frac{m}{100} < 2$ gives $0 < m < 200$. Therefore, the number of positive integer values of $m$ that satisfy this inequality is the number of positive integers from $1$ to $199$.

To find this number, we can use the formula for the sum of an arithmetic series: $S = \frac{n}{2}(a + l)$, where $S$ is the sum of the series, $n$ is the number of terms, $a$ is the first term, and $l$ is the last term. In this case, $a = 1$ and $l = 199$, so $n = l - a + 1 = 199 - 1 + 1 = 199$.

So the number of positive integer values of $m$ that satisfy $0 < m < 200$ is $199$. Therefore, there are $199$ positive integers $m$ for which the equation $| |x - 1| - 2| = \frac{m}{100}$ has four distinct solutions.

To solve this problem in Python, we can use the following code:

```python


INTERMEDIATE OUT :

def count_m():
    # Calculate the number of positive integer values of m
    m_values = list(range(1, 200))
    return len(m_values)

result = count_m()
print(result)
```

CODE RESULTS 199

INTERMEDIATE OUT :
```output
199
```
The number of positive integers $m$ for which the equation $| |x - 1| - 2| = \frac{m}{100}$ has four distinct solutions is $199$.

So, the value of $m$ that satisfies the condition is $199$. The answer is: $199$

Assistant:

 The number of solutions of the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ depends on the value of $m$.

When $m=0$, the equation becomes $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=0$, which simplifies to $\vert x-1 \vert =2$. This gives us two solutions: $x=3$ and $x=-1$.

When $m>0$, the right side of the equation is positive, so the absolute value of the left side must be equal to a positive number. This means that the expression inside the absolute value on the left side must be equal to $k$ or $-k$ for some positive number $k$.

If we set $\vert x-1 \vert -2=k$, we get $\vert x-1 \vert =k+2$. This gives us two equations: $x-1=k+2$ and $x-1=-(k+2)$. Solving these equations gives us $x=k+3$ and $x=-k+1$.

Similarly, if we set $\vert x-1 \vert -2=-k$, we get $\vert x-1 \vert =2-k$. This gives us two equations: $x-1=2-k$ and $x-1=-(2-k)$. Solving these equations gives us $x=3-k$ and $x=k-1$.

For each value of $m$, we can find the corresponding value of $k=\frac{m}{100}$ and determine the number of distinct solutions. If $k>2$, there are no solutions. If $1<k\le2$, there are four distinct solutions: $x=k+3$, $x=-k+1$, $x=3-k$, and $x=k-1$.

Therefore, the number of positive integers $m$ for which the equation has four distinct solutions is the number of integers $m$ such that $1<m/100\le2$, or equivalently, $100<m\le200$. There are 100 such integers.

```python


INTERMEDIATE OUT :

def count_m():
    """Count the number of positive integers $m$ for which the equation \[\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}\] has four distinct solutions."""
    m_values = range(101, 201)
    return len(m_values)

result = count_m()
print(result)
```

INTERMEDIATE OUT :
```output
100
```
The number of positive integers $m$ for which the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has four distinct solutions is $100$. The answer is: $100$.

Assistant:

 The number of distinct solutions to the equation $| |x-1|-2|=\frac{m}{100}$ is equal to $4$ if and only if $\frac{m}{100}=1$. This is because the expression $| |x-1|-2|$ can take on exactly four distinct values when its argument is $1$. Therefore, we set $\frac{m}{100}=1$ and solve for $m$.

```python


INTERMEDIATE OUT :

from sympy import symbols, Eq, solve

def find_m():
    m = symbols('m')
    equation = Eq(m/100, 1)
    solution = solve(equation, m)
    return solution[0]

result = find_m()

The value of $m$ for which the equation $| |x-1|-2|=\frac{m}{100}$ has $4$ distinct solutions is $100$. The answer is: $100$.
