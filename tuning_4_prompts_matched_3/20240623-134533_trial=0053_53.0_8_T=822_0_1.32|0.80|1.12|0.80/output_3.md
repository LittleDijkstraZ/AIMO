Below is a math problem you are to solve (positive numerical answer!):
"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"
Analyze this problem and think step by step to come to a solution with programs. After solving the problem, output the final numerical answer within \boxed{}.

Assistant:


The problem involves finding the area of a convex polygon that is enclosed by the points satisfying the given equation. The equation is:
\[((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0.\]

The product of two numbers is zero if and only if at least one of the numbers is zero. This means that either $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$.

If $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$, then $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$, which means that $x + y = \pm 10$ and $x - y = \pm 10$. These are the equations of the four lines forming the vertices of a square with side length 20.

If $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$, then $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$, which means that $x = \pm 8$ and $y = \pm 8$. These are the equations of the four lines forming the sides of the square with side length 16.

So, the points satisfying the equation form a square with side length 20, and its area is $20^2 = 400$.
The answer is: 400

Below is a math problem you are to solve (positive numerical answer!):
"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"
Analyze this problem and think step by step to come to a solution with programs. After solving the problem, output the final numerical answer within \boxed{}.

Assistant:

 The given equation is $0 = ((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2)$.

For this equation to be true, either the first term is $0$ or the second term is $0$.
If the first term is $0$, then $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$, which means $x + y = \pm 10$ and $x - y = \pm 10$.

If the second term is $0$, then $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$, which means $x = \pm 8$ and $y = \pm 8$.

This means the points satisfying the equation are the vertices of a square with side length $20$.

The area of a square is calculated as side length squared, so the area of this square is $20^2 = 400$.

So the area of the convex polygon is $400$. The answer is: $400$.

"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"

Assistant:


The expression $AB = 0$ is equivalent to $A = 0$ or $B = 0$. So, the given equation is equivalent to either $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$.

The first equation is satisfied if and only if $|x + y| = 10$ and $|x - y| = 10$. This gives us four lines: $x + y = 10$, $x + y = -10$, $x - y = 10$, and $x - y = -10$. These lines form a rectangle with side lengths 20.

The second equation is satisfied if and only if $|x| = 8$ and $|y| = 8$. This gives us four lines: $x = 8$, $x = -8$, $y = 8$, and $y = -8$. These lines form a square with side length 16.

The intersection of the two sets of lines is the set of points that satisfy both equations. This intersection is the set of points that form a rectangle with side lengths 20 and a square with side length 16. The intersection of these two sets of points forms a convex polygon, which is also a rectangle with side lengths 20 and 16. The area of this rectangle is $20 \times 16 = 320$. So, the area of the convex polygon is 320. The answer is: $320$

Below is a math problem you are to solve (positive numerical answer!):
"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"

Assistant:

 The problem statement asks us to find the area of the convex polygon enclosed by the points $(x, y)$ that satisfy the equation. The equation is $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$.

For the product of two numbers to be zero, either one of them must be zero. So, either $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$.

If $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$, then $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$, which means $x + y = \pm 10$ and $x - y = \pm 10$. These four lines are the sides of a square with side length 10.

If $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$, then $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$, which means $x = \pm 8$ and $y = \pm 8$. These four lines are the sides of a square with side length 8.

The smaller square is completely inside the larger square. Therefore, the convex polygon enclosed by the points $(x, y)$ that satisfy the equation is the larger square. The area of a square is the side length squared. So, the area of the convex polygon is $10^2 = 100$. The answer is: $100$

The equation given in the problem is a product of two terms equal to zero. This means that either one of the terms is zero or both are zero. We can break down the problem into two cases:

Case 1: $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$.
This equation implies that $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. The only way both these equations can be true is if $x = 0$ and $y = 0$.

Case 2: $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$.
This equation implies that $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$. The only way both these equations can be true is if $-8 \le x \le 8$ and $-8 \le y \le 8$.

Combining the two cases, we see that the points that satisfy the equation form a square with side length 16. Therefore, the area of the square is $16^2 = 256$. The answer is: $256$

"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"

 The equation $AB=0$ is satisfied if and only if $A=0$ or $B=0$. So the given equation is equivalent to either $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$.

This gives us the following system of equations:

1. $\vert x + y \vert = 10$
2. $\vert x - y \vert = 10$
3. $\vert x \vert = 8$
4. $\vert y \vert = 8$

The solutions to equations 3 and 4 are the points in the set $\{(8,0),(-8,0),(0,8),(0,-8)\}$.

For equations 1 and 2, we have:

1. $x + y = 10$ or $x + y = -10$.
2. $x - y = 10$ or $x - y = -10$.

Solving these systems of equations, we find the solutions to be the points in the sets $\{(5,5),(-5,-5)\}$, $\{(5,-5),(-5,5)\}$.

Therefore, the polygon is a square with side length $16$. The area of this square is $16^2 = 256$.

So, the area of the convex polygon is $256$. The answer is: $256$.

"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"

Assistant:

 The given equation is a product of two expressions equaling zero, so either one of the expressions must be zero for the product to be zero. That is,

\[((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2) = 0 \quad \text{or} \quad ((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0.\]

The first expression equals zero if and only if $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. The second expression equals zero if and only if $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$.

The first set of conditions, $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$, define a square with side length 10. The vertices of the square are $(5, 5)$, $(5, -5)$, $(-5, -5)$, and $(-5, 5)$.

The second set of conditions, $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$, define a square with side length 8. The vertices of the square are $(8, 8)$, $(8, -8)$, $(-8, -8)$, and $(-8, 8)$.

The intersection of these two squares is a smaller square with side length 6 (the difference between 8 and 2) centered at the origin. The area of this square is $6^2 = 36$. So the area of the convex polygon is $36$ square units. The answer is: $36$

Assistant:


The given equation is equal to zero if and only if both $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ and $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$, or both $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ and $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$.
From $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$, we have $\vert x + y \vert = 10$, which implies $x + y = 10$ or $x + y = -10$.
From $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$, we have $\vert x \vert = 8$, which implies $x = 8$ or $x = -8$.
Similarly, we have $y = 8$ or $y = -8$.

By analyzing all possible combinations of $x$ and $y$, we can find the vertices of the convex polygon. The vertices are $(8, 2)$, $(8, -18)$, $(-8, 2)$, and $(-8, -18)$.

The convex polygon is a square with side length 16, so its area is $16^2 = 256$. The answer is: $256$

Below is a math problem you are to solve (positive numerical answer!):
"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"
Analyze this problem and think step by step to come to a solution with programs. After solving the problem, output the final numerical answer within \boxed{}.

Assistant:

 To solve this problem, we first need to analyze the equation. The equation is in the form of a product of two expressions equal to zero. Therefore, either of the two expressions must be zero for the equation to hold true. 

Let's consider the first expression:
$$((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2) = 0$$
For this expression to be zero, both terms inside the parentheses must be zero:
$$\vert x + y \vert - 10 = 0 \Rightarrow \vert x + y \vert = 10$$
$$\vert x - y \vert - 10 = 0 \Rightarrow \vert x - y \vert = 10$$
This gives us four equations:
1. $x + y = 10$
2. $x + y = -10$
3. $x - y = 10$
4. $x - y = -10$
Solving these four equations gives us the coordinates of the vertices of the polygon.

Similarly, for the second expression:
$$((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$$
For this expression to be zero, both terms inside the parentheses must be zero:
$$\vert x \vert - 8 = 0 \Rightarrow \vert x \vert = 8 \Rightarrow x = 8 \text{ or } x = -8$$
$$\vert y \vert - 8 = 0 \Rightarrow \vert y \vert = 8 \Rightarrow y = 8 \text{ or } y = -8$$
This gives us a total of 4 vertices of the polygon: $(8,8)$, $(8,-8)$, $(-8,8)$, and $(-8,-8)$.

Now we can plot these points and visualize the polygon. The polygon is a square with side length of 16 units. To find the area of the square, we use the formula $A = s^2$, where $s$ is the side length of the square. Therefore, the area of the polygon is:
$$A = 16^2 = 256$$

So, the area of the convex polygon is 256 square units. The answer is: $256$.
