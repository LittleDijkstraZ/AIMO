Below is a math problem you are to solve (positive numerical answer!):
"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"
Analyze this problem and think step by step to come to a solution with programs. After solving the problem, output the final numerical answer within \boxed{}.

Assistant:

 The given equation is a product of two expressions equal to zero, so either $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$.

If the first expression equals zero, then $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. This means that $x + y = \pm 10$ and $x - y = \pm 10$. Solving these equations gives us the vertices of a square with side length 10.

If the second expression equals zero, then $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$. This means that $x = \pm 8$ and $y = \pm 8$. Solving these equations gives us the vertices of a square with side length 16.

The overall shape is the union of these two squares, and it's a larger square with side length 16 that contains a smaller square with side length 10. The area of the convex polygon is the area of the larger square minus the area of the smaller square.

The area of a square with side length $s$ is $s^2$. So the area of the larger square is $16^2 = 256$, and the area of the smaller square is $10^2 = 100$. The area of the convex polygon is $256 - 100 = 156$.

    side_length_large_square = 16
    side_length_small_square = 10
    area_large_square = side_length_large_square ** 2
    area_small_square = side_length_small_square ** 2
    area_polygon = area_large_square - area_small_square
    return area_polygon

The area of the convex polygon is $156$. The answer is $\boxed{156}$.

"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"

Assistant:

 The equation given in the problem is a product of two terms equal to zero. Therefore, either the first term is zero or the second term is zero.

The first term is zero when $|\pm x \pm y| - 10 = 0$, which implies $|\pm x \pm y| = 10$. This gives us four equations: $|x + y| = 10$, $|x - y| = 10$, $|x| = 8$, and $|y| = 8$. The solutions to these equations are the vertices of the polygon.

The second term is zero when $|\pm x| - 8 = 0$ or $|\pm y| - 8 = 0$, which implies $|\pm x| = 8$ or $|\pm y| = 8$. This gives us four more equations: $|x| = 8$, $|y| = 8$, $-x = 8$, and $-y = 8$. The solutions to these equations are the vertices of the polygon.

By solving these equations, we find that the vertices of the polygon are $(8, 8)$, $(8, -8)$, $(-8, 8)$, and $(-8, -8)$. These points form a square with side length $16$. The area of a square is given by the square of the length of its side, so the area of the polygon is $16^2 = 256$.
The answer is: $256$

Below is a math problem you are to solve (positive numerical answer!):
"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"
Analyze this problem and think step by step to come to a solution with programs. After solving the problem, output the final numerical answer within \boxed{}.

Assistant:

 The given equation is $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$.
For this equation to equal zero, either the first term or the second term must be zero.
If the first term is zero, then $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$.
This implies that $x + y = \pm 10$ and $x - y = \pm 10$.
Solving these equations, we get the lines $y = \pm x \pm 10$.
If the second term is zero, then $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$.
This implies that $x = \pm 8$ and $y = \pm 8$.
So we have four lines $x = \pm 8$ and $y = \pm 8$.
The four lines form a square with side length 16.
The area of the square is $16^2 = 256$.
Therefore, the area of the convex polygon is 256.
The answer is: $256$

Analyze this problem and think step by step to come to a solution with programs. After solving the problem, output the final numerical answer within \boxed{}.

Assistant:

 The equation $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + (\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + (\vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ is true if and only if at least one of the following two conditions is met:
1. $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ and $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ and $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$.
2. $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ and $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ and $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$.
The first condition implies $x = y = \pm 8$, and the second condition implies $x = -y = \pm 8$. So the points that satisfy the equation are $(\pm 8, \pm 8)$, $(\pm 8, \mp 8)$, $(\mp 8, \pm 8)$, and $(\mp 8, \mp 8)$. These points form a square with side length 16. The area of this square is $16^2 = 256$. Therefore, the area of the convex polygon is 256.

The python code to calculate the area is:
