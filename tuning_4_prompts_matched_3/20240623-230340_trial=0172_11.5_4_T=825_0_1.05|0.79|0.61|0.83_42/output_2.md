Below is a math problem you are to solve (positive numerical answer!):
"For how many positive integers $m$ does the equation \[\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}\] have $4$ distinct solutions?"
Analyze this problem and think step by step to come to a solution with programs. After solving the problem, output the final numerical answer within \boxed{}.

Assistant:

 The problem is asking for how many positive integers $m$ the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has $4$ distinct solutions.

The number of distinct solutions of this equation depends on the value of $m$. The equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ will have $4$ distinct solutions when $\frac{m}{100}=1$. This is because the function $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert$ has a "V" shape with the maximum value of $2$ and minimum value of $0$, and $\frac{m}{100}$ must be in the range of $(0, 2)$ for the equation to have $4$ distinct solutions.

Therefore, we need to solve the equation $\frac{m}{100}=1$ for $m$.

```python


INTERMEDIATE OUT :

from sympy import symbols, Eq, solve

def solve_for_m():
    m = symbols('m')
    equation = Eq(m / 100, 1)
    solution = solve(equation, m)
    return solution[0]

result = solve_for_m()
print(result)
```

CODE RESULTS 100

INTERMEDIATE OUT :
```output
100
```
The value of $m$ that makes the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ have $4$ distinct solutions is $100$. However, the problem asks for the number of positive integers $m$, so $m=100$ is the only solution. Therefore, the number of positive integers $m$ for which the equation has $4$ distinct solutions is $1$. The answer is: $1$

Assistant:

 The number of distinct solutions of the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ is equal to 4 if and only if $\frac{m}{100} = 2$. This is because the function $f(x) = \vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert$ has exactly 4 distinct roots when $f(x) = 2$.

So, we need to solve the equation $\frac{m}{100} = 2$ for $m$. Multiplying both sides by 100 gives $m = 200$. Therefore, the number of positive integers $m$ for which the equation has 4 distinct solutions is 1. The answer is: $1$

Below is a math problem you are to solve (positive numerical answer!):
"For how many positive integers $m$ does the equation \[\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}\] have $4$ distinct solutions?"
Analyze this problem and think step by step to come to a solution with programs. After solving the problem, output the final numerical answer within \boxed{}.

Assistant:

 To solve this problem, we need to understand the behavior of the function $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert$.
This function has a "V" shape with two "humps" at $x=3$ and $x=-1$.
The value of the function is $0$ at these points, and it varies between $0$ and $3$ for all other values of $x$.
So, for the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ to have four distinct solutions, the value of $\frac{m}{100}$ must be strictly between $0$ and $2$.
This means $0 < \frac{m}{100} < 2$, which implies $0 < m < 200$.
The positive integers $m$ that satisfy this condition are $1, 2, 3, ..., 199$.
So there are $199$ positive integers $m$ for which the equation has $4$ distinct solutions. The answer is: $199$

Assistant:

 The number of distinct solutions of the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ is equal to 4 if and only if $\frac{m}{100} = 2$. This is because the expression inside the absolute value, $\vert x-1 \vert -2$, can only take on the values $-2, -1, 0, 1, 2$. The equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=2$ has exactly 4 solutions. So we need to solve the equation $\frac{m}{100} = 2$ for $m$.

```python


INTERMEDIATE OUT :

from sympy import symbols, Eq, solve

def solve_for_m():
    m = symbols('m')
    equation = Eq(m/100, 2)
    solution = solve(equation, m)
    return solution[0]

result = solve_for_m()
print(result)
```

CODE RESULTS 200

INTERMEDIATE OUT :
```output
200
```
The solution to the equation $\frac{m}{100} = 2$ is $m = 200$. Therefore, there is only one positive integer $m$ for which the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has 4 distinct solutions, and that integer is $200$. The answer is: $200$

Assistant:

 The given equation has 4 distinct solutions if and only if $\frac{m}{100}$ is equal to 2. Therefore, we can set up the equation $\frac{m}{100} = 2$ and solve for $m$.

```python


INTERMEDIATE OUT :

from sympy import symbols, Eq, solve

def find_m():
    m = symbols('m')
    equation = Eq(m / 100, 2)
    solution = solve(equation, m)

result = find_m()

The value of $m$ for which the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has 4 distinct solutions is 200.
The answer is: $200$
