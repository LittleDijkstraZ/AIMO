Interesting, let's analyze step by step:



We know that the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has 4 distinct solutions, which implies the absolute value on the right-hand side, $\frac{m}{100}$, must be equal to 2. That's because the absolute value function has a 'V' shape with 'valleys' (lowest points) at values of 0 and 4. Since we are given that there are 4 solutions, the middle two solutions must occur at the points where the value of the absolute value function is 2.

Therefore, we have:

\[\frac{m}{100} = 2 \Rightarrow m = 200.\]

To verify that this value of $m$ indeed results in 4 distinct solutions, we substitute $m = 200$ into the original equation and solve it for $x$:

\[\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{200}{100} = 2.\]

This simplifies to:

\[\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert = 2.\]

We can solve this by considering the two possible cases inside the absolute value:

1. $\vert x-1 - 2 \vert = 2 \Rightarrow \vert x-3 \vert = 2$.
2. $\vert x-1 + 2 \vert = 2 \Rightarrow \vert x+1 \vert = 2$.

For the first case, we have two more absolute value equations to solve:

1.1. $x - 3 = 2 \Rightarrow x = 5$.
1.2. $-(x - 3) = 2 \Rightarrow x = 1$.

For the second case, we have:

2.1. $x + 1 = 2 \Rightarrow x = 1$.
2.2. $-(x + 1) = 2 \Rightarrow x = -3$.

Thus, we have found the four distinct solutions $x = -3, 1, 5$. The value of $m = 200$ is a positive integer, so it is a valid solution. The answer is: $2$

Interesting, let's analyze step by step:



Step 1: The given equation is $| |x-1| -2 | = \frac{m}{100}$.
It has four distinct solutions, so the right side of the equation $\frac{m}{100}$ should be in the range from 1 to 2. Therefore, $1 \leq \frac{m}{100} \leq 2$, which gives $100 \leq m \leq 200$.

Now we know that $m$ is a positive integer in the range from 100 to 200. We need to find how many integers are in this range. To find this, we subtract the smallest integer in the range from the largest and add 1. So the number of integers in this range is $200 - 100 + 1 = 101$.

So the value of $m$ can take 101 values. But we know that the equation should have 4 distinct solutions, not just any 4 out of the 101 possible values of $m$. We need to check for each $m$ in the range from 100 to 200 how many distinct solutions the equation has.

We can do this using a loop in sympy, but for this problem, we don't actually need to use sympy because the number of possible values for $m$ is relatively small. So we can just manually check for each $m$ in the range from 100 to 200 how many distinct solutions the equation has.

However, since we don't actually need to find the solutions for each $m$, we can skip this part. The important step here is to realize that the number of distinct solutions depends on the value of $m$, and for each $m$ in the range from 100 to 200, the equation has exactly 4 distinct solutions. So the value of $m$ that we are looking for is actually any integer in this range.

So the final answer is the number of integers in the range from 100 to 200, which is 101. But we have to check if this number is a positive integer, which it is. Therefore, the value of $m$ that satisfies the conditions is $\boxed{1}$. However, this is not the final answer we are looking for. The number of positive integers $m$ such that the equation has 4 distinct solutions is the number of integers from 100 to 200, which is 101.
The answer is: $101$.

The equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has four distinct solutions. It's a very challenging problem. The idea here is to use the property of absolute value, we will have cases to handle.

Step 1: Set up the equations based on the different cases of absolute value.
Step 2: Solve these equations to find the solutions for $x$.
Step 3: Count the number of distinct solutions.
Step 4: Find the value of $m$ such that the number of distinct solutions is equal to 4.

Here is the step-by-step process using sympy:

```python

from sympy import symbols, solve, Eq, Abs

def count_solutions():
    # x: the variable in the equation
    x = symbols('x')
    m = symbols('m')

    # Set up the equations based on the different cases of absolute value
    equation1 = Eq(Abs(Abs(x - 1) - 2), m/100)
    equation2 = Eq(Abs(x - 1) - 2, m/100)
    equation3 = Eq(Abs(x - 1) - 2, -m/100)
    equation4 = Eq(Abs(Abs(x - 1) - 2), -m/100)

    # Solve these equations to find the solutions for x
    solutions1 = solve(equation2, x)
    solutions2 = solve(equation3, x)
    solutions = solutions1 + solutions2

    # Count the number of distinct solutions
    distinct_solutions = len(set(solutions))

    # Find the value of m such that the number of distinct solutions is equal to 4
    for i in range(1, 101):
        if distinct_solutions == 4:
            m_value = i
            break

The value of $m$ is $1$. However, $m$ must be a positive integer. Therefore, the value $m=1$ doesn't satisfy the condition.

Let's try another value for $m$.

The value of $m$ is $2$. Now, this value does satisfy the condition that the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has $4$ distinct solutions.

Since the value of $m$ we found is a positive integer, we can conclude that the number of positive integers $m$ for which the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has $4$ distinct solutions is $1$. Therefore, the answer is $1$. However, this result doesn't make sense because the value of $m$ we found is 2, not 1. We must have made a mistake in our calculations. Let's go back and check our work.

When we solve for the number of distinct solutions, we only count solutions that are not equal to zero. However, zero solutions should also be counted. To correct this, we need to add a condition to our code that counts the number of solutions and checks if the number of solutions is equal to 4. If it is not, we continue searching for the next value of m.

Let's modify our code to include this condition:

```python


INTERMEDIATE OUT :

def count_solutions():
    # x: the variable in the equation
    x = symbols('x')
    m = symbols('m')

    # Set up the equations based on the different cases of absolute value

    equation2 = Eq(Abs(x - 1) - 2, m/100)
    equation3 = Eq(Abs(x - 1) - 2, -m/100)
    equation4 = Eq(Abs(Abs(x - 1) - 2), -m/100)

    # Solve these equations to find the solutions for x
    solutions1 = solve(equation2, x)
    solutions2 = solve(equation3, x)
    solutions = solutions1 + solutions2

    # Count the number of distinct solutions
    distinct_solutions = len(set(solutions))

    # Find the value of m such that the number of distinct solutions is equal to 4
    for i in range(1, 101):
        if distinct_solutions == 4:
            m_value = i
            break
        else:
            m = i

    return m_value

The value of $m$ is $1$. However, this value does not satisfy the condition that the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has $4$ distinct solutions. We made a mistake when we counted the number of solutions. Let's re-examine our steps.

Step 1: Set up the equations based on the different cases of absolute value.
Step 2: Solve these equations to find the solutions for $x$.
Step 3: Count the number of distinct solutions.
Step 4: Find the value of $m$ such that the number of distinct solutions is equal to 4.

When we solve for the number of distinct solutions, we only count solutions that are not equal to zero.

Assistant:

Interesting, let's analyze step by step:



1. The given equation has four distinct solutions, which means there are four different values of x that satisfy the equation.
2. To get four distinct solutions, the absolute value expression must equal a value in the range $[0,1)$.
3. This means, $\frac{m}{100}$ must be in the interval $(0,1)$, so $0<m<100$. Also, the value inside the absolute value, $\vert x-1 \vert -2$, should have two solutions, which means $\vert x-1 \vert -2 = 0$ should have two solutions. Thus, $\vert x-1 \vert = 2$ and $x-1 = \pm 2$, so $x = 3$ or $x = -1$.
4. To satisfy both conditions, we need to choose $m$ such that $0 < m < 100$ and $\frac{m}{100} = 2 - 1 = 1$.
5. Solving this equation, we find $m = 100$. But this is not in the range $(0,100)$.
6. So, we need to choose a different value of $\frac{m}{100}$. Let's try $\frac{m}{100} = 1$. Then we have $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert = 1$. The values of $x$ that satisfy this equation are $x = 0$ and $x = 2$. This gives us two solutions, not four.
7. Let's try $\frac{m}{100} = \frac{1}{2}$. Then we have $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert = \frac{1}{2}$. The values of $x$ that satisfy this equation are $x = \frac{3}{2}$ and $x = \frac{1}{2}$. This gives us two solutions again.
8. Let's try $\frac{m}{100} = \frac{1}{3}$. Then we have $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert = \frac{1}{3}$. The values of $x$ that satisfy this equation are $x = \frac{10}{3}$ and $x = \frac{4}{3}$. This gives us two solutions again.
9. Finally, let's try $\frac{m}{100} = \frac{1}{4}$. Then we have $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert = \frac{1}{4}$. The values of $x$ that satisfy this equation are $x = \frac{9}{4}$ and $x = \frac{3}{4}$. This gives us four distinct solutions.
10. Therefore, the value of $m$ that makes the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ have $4$ distinct solutions is $m = 25$.
11. To verify that $25$ is a positive integer, we simply check that it is greater than zero. Since $25 > 0$, it is indeed a positive integer.

So the value of $m$ that makes the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ have $4$ distinct solutions is $25$. The answer is: $\boxed{25}$.

Interesting, let's analyze step by step:


The equation $|\ |x-1|-2\ |=\frac{m}{100}$ has 4 distinct solutions. Let's first think about the case where the expression inside the outermost absolute value is positive, i.e., $|x-1|-2>0$. In this case, we have $|x-1|-2=\frac{m}{100}$.
Solving this equation will give us two solutions, which are not distinct (because of the absolute value on the left side). So this case is not valid.
Now let's consider the case where the expression inside the outermost absolute value is negative, i.e., $|x-1|-2<0$. In this case, we have $-(|x-1|-2)=\frac{m}{100}$, which simplifies to $|x-1|-2=-\frac{m}{100}$.

Solving this equation will give us two distinct solutions if and only if $-\frac{m}{100}$ is positive, i.e., $m<0$. But $m$ is a positive integer, so this case is not valid either.

So, the only valid case is when the expression inside the outermost absolute value equals zero, i.e., $|x-1|-2=0$. Solving this equation, we get $|x-1|=2$, which gives us two more cases: $x-1=2$ and $x-1=-2$. The first case gives us $x=3$, and the second case gives us $x=-1$. So, these two values are the only possible values for $x$.

Substituting $x=3$ and $x=-1$ into the equation $| |x-1|-2|=\frac{m}{100}$, we get $| |-2|-2|=\frac{m}{100}$ and $| |2|-2|=\frac{m}{100}$, respectively. The first equation simplifies to $|0|=\frac{m}{100}$, which means $\frac{m}{100}=0$ and thus $m=0$. The second equation simplifies to $|4|=\frac{m}{100}$, which means $\frac{m}{100}=4$ and thus $m=400$.

Therefore, the only values of $m$ that work are $m=0$ and $m=400$. However, $m=0$ is not a positive integer, so we must have $m=400$. This means that the equation $| |x-1|-2|=\frac{m}{100}$ has 4 distinct solutions when $m=400$.

So, the value of $m$ that satisfies the condition is $400$. This is indeed a positive integer. Therefore, the number of positive integers $m$ that satisfy the condition is 1. The answer is: $\boxed{1}$

Interesting, let's analyze step by step:



1. We need to find the number of values for $m$ such that the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has $4$ distinct solutions.

2. We can start by setting $\frac{m}{100}$ equal to a number between $0$ and $2$ (the range of $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert$). This is because the absolute value of a number between $0$ and $2$ will give us four distinct solutions.

3. Multiply both sides by $100$ to get rid of the fraction: $m = 100 * \text{number between } 0 \text{ and } 2$. This gives us a range of possible values for $m$ from $0$ to $200$.

4. Now we need to count how many integers fall within this range. This is simply $200 - 0 + 1 = 201$. However, $0$ is not a positive integer, so we subtract $1$ to get $200$.

5. The problem asks for the number of positive integers $m$, so we only consider the positive values of $m$. Since $m$ can be any value from $0$ to $200$, the number of positive integers $m$ is equal to the number of positive integers in this range. This is simply $200$.

Now let's verify this result:

```python

Interesting, let's analyze step by step:


The equation $||x-1|-2|=\frac{m}{100}$ has $4$ distinct solutions, then $\frac{m}{100}$ must be equal to $2$. So we have $m = 200$. Now we have to prove that the equation $||x-1|-2|=2$ has indeed $4$ distinct solutions.

Step 1: We start with the equation $||x-1|-2|=2$. This equation has two "layers" of absolute value, so we need to consider two cases.

Case 1: $|x-1|-2=2$. Then, $|x-1|=4$. This leads to two sub-cases:
Sub-case 1.1: $x-1=4$, which gives $x=5$.
Sub-case 1.2: $x-1=-4$, which gives $x=-3$.

Case 2: $|x-1|-2=-2$. Then, $|x-1|=0$, which gives $x=1$.

So, the four distinct solutions are $x=-3, 1, 5$. 

We have successfully found the value of $m$ that makes the equation have $4$ distinct solutions. Now we just need to check if $m$ is a positive integer. We are given that $m = 200$, which is a positive integer. So, the value of $m$ we are looking for is indeed $200$.

Therefore, the number of positive integers $m$ for which the equation has four distinct solutions is $1$. The answer is: $1$
