Below is a math problem you are to solve (positive numerical answer):
"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"

To accomplish this:
- List the variables and known values from the problem.
- Outline the steps using sympy to solve the problem:
  * Identify the sympy functions required for each step.
  * Implement these functions step-by-step, commenting each line for clarity.
- Calculate the final answer and verify it's a positive integer.
- Output the result within \boxed{}.

Interesting, let's analyze step by step:



We have two cases: 

1. Either $ (|x + y| - 10)^2 = 0 \text{ or } (|x - y| - 10)^2 = 0$. 
2. Either $ (|x| - 8)^2 = 0 \text{ or } (|y| - 8)^2 = 0$.

This implies that the solution set is the union of four lines: $x + y = 10, x + y = -10, x - y = 10, x - y = -10$ and $x = 8, x = -8, y = 8, y = -8$.

This forms a square with side length 16. The area of this square is therefore $16^2 = 256$.

Now, let's verify that the area is a positive integer.

```python


INTERMEDIATE OUT :

from sympy import symbols, Rational

def calculate_area():
    # Side length of the square
    side_length = 16

    # Calculate the area
    area = side_length**2

    return area

result = calculate_area()
print(result)
```

CODE RESULTS 256

INTERMEDIATE OUT :
```output
256
```
The area of the convex polygon is 256, which is a positive integer. The answer is: $\boxed{256}$

Interesting, let's analyze step by step:


The product of two numbers is zero if at least one of the numbers is zero. So, we have two possibilities:
1) $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0 \Rightarrow \vert x + y \vert = 10$,
2) $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0 \Rightarrow \vert x - y \vert = 10$.
3) $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0 \Rightarrow \vert x \vert = 8$,
4) $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0 \Rightarrow \vert y \vert = 8$.
From $\vert x + y \vert = 10$, we have $x + y = 10$ or $x + y = -10$.
From $\vert x - y \vert = 10$, we have $x - y = 10$ or $x - y = -10$.
From $\vert x \vert = 8$, we have $x = 8$ or $x = -8$.
From $\vert y \vert = 8$, we have $y = 8$ or $y = -8$.
Combining all possibilities, we get the vertices of the polygon:
$(8,8), (8,-8), (-8,8), (-8,-8), (10,0), (0,10), (-10,0), (0,-10)$.
The polygon is a square with side length 16, so its area is $16^2 = 256$.
The answer is: $256$

Interesting, let's analyze step by step:



The equation is a product of two quadratic expressions equals zero, which means that at least one of the quadratic expressions must be zero for the equation to hold true. Thus, we have four cases to consider:

1. $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$,
2. $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$,
3. $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$, and
4. $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$.

Each of these equations implies a constraint on the variables x and y. Solving each equation, we get:

1. $\vert x + y \vert = 10$,
2. $\vert x - y \vert = 10$,
3. $\vert x \vert = 8$, and
4. $\vert y \vert = 8$.

From 3. and 4., we get that x is in the interval $[-8, 8]$ and y is in the interval $[-8, 8]$. From 1. and 2., we get that either $x + y = 10$ or $x + y = -10$, and either $x - y = 10$ or $x - y = -10$. By solving these systems of linear equations, we find that the vertices of the polygon are the points:

$$(8, 2), (8, -2), (-8, 2), (-8, -2).$$

The polygon is a square with side length 16. The area of this square is therefore $16^2 = 256$. So the area of the polygon is 256. We verify that the answer is a positive integer.
The answer is: $256$
