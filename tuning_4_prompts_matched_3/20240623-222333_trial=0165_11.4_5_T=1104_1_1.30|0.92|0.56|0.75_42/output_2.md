Interesting, let's analyze step by step:


Step 1: Identify the sympy functions required for each step.

We will use the following sympy functions:
- Abs: Absolute value function
- solveset: Solves the equation for a given domain
- S: Domain of real numbers
- Eq: Create an equation
- Symbol: Create a symbolic variable
- solveset: Solves the equation for a given domain
- S: Domain of real numbers
- Eq: Create an equation
- Symbol: Create a symbolic variable
- solveset: Solves the equation for a given domain
- S: Domain of real numbers
- Eq: Create an equation
- Symbol: Create a symbolic variable
- solveset: Solves the equation for a given domain
- S: Domain of real numbers

Step 2: Implement these functions step-by-step, commenting each line for clarity.

Let's denote $x$ as a symbolic variable:

x = Symbol('x')

Now, let's set up the equation based on the problem:

eq = Abs(Abs(x - 1) - 2) - m / 100

We want to find the number of distinct solutions of the equation, so we will solve for $x$ in terms of $m$:

solution_set = solveset(Eq(eq, 0), x, domain=S.Reals)

Now we want to find the number of distinct solutions for $m$ between 1 and 100 (inclusive).

num_solutions = 0

for m in range(1, 101):
    solutions_for_m = len(solution_set.subs(m, m))
    if solutions_for_m == 4:
        num_solutions += 1

print(num_solutions)

Finally, we want to verify the answer that we have calculated. For clarity, we present the main body of the script again with some additions:

```python


INTERMEDIATE OUT :

from sympy import Abs, solveset, S, Eq, Symbol

def count_solutions():
    x = Symbol('x')
    num_solutions = 0

    for m in range(1, 101):
        eq = Abs(Abs(x - 1) - 2) - m / 100
        solution_set = solveset(Eq(eq, 0), x, domain=S.Reals)
        solutions_for_m = len(solution_set)

        if solutions_for_m == 4:
            num_solutions += 1

    return num_solutions

result = count_solutions()
print(result)
```

CODE RESULTS 100

It looks like the number of positive integers $m$ such that the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has $4$ distinct solutions is $100$. However, upon further inspection, it appears that the solutions found are spurious, as setting $m=0$ in the original equation would result in $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=0$, which implies $\vert x-1 \vert=2$. This would give three solutions for $x$, not four. Upon closer examination of the solutions provided by Sympy, it is clear that the spurious solutions stem from the use of the absolute value function, which introduces extraneous solutions when trying to solve for $x$. It is evident that manual manipulation and analysis is required to deal with absolute value equations, as a black box solver like Sympy might not suffice for this purpose. Therefore, it is not a valid solution to the problem. Let's reconsider the problem from a different perspective. The given equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ can have $4$ distinct solutions only if it undergoes a "bifurcation" twice. This means that the initial equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=0$ has three solutions, and as we increase $m$, the number of solutions increases to $4$. By trial and error, or by considering the properties of absolute value functions, it is clear that $m=50$ is the value that accomplishes this. Let's check if $m=50$ indeed results in $4$ distinct solutions: Substitute $m=50$ in the original equation: $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{50}{100}=0.5$. Considering the properties of absolute value functions, it is clear that this equation will have four distinct solutions. Thus, it appears that the value of $m$ for which the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has $4$ distinct solutions is indeed $50$. As we wanted to find the number of positive integers $m$ that satisfy this property, our final answer is $1$. This is a much cleaner solution than the one obtained by blindly using a black box solver and relying on spurious solutions. In conclusion, the number of positive integers $m$ such that the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has $4$ distinct solutions is 1.
The value of $m$ for which the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has $4$ distinct solutions is indeed $50$.

The number of positive integers $m$ such that the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has $4$ distinct solutions is 1. Therefore, the number of solutions for $m$ is $1$. To verify that it's a positive integer, we can output it:

Interesting, let's analyze step by step:



First, recall that a double absolute value function $|\ |$ will be equivalent to one of three cases, which can be broken down into two separate absolute value functions:

\[\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}\]

This equation can be transformed into one of the following three forms, where $a = |x-1|$:

1) $ | a - 2 | = \frac{m}{100} $
2) $ | a + 2 | = \frac{m}{100} $
3) $ |-a - 2 | = \frac{m}{100}$

Let's consider case 1) first:
\[ | a - 2 | = \frac{m}{100} \implies a - 2 = \pm \frac{m}{100} \]

So, $a = 2 \pm \frac{m}{100}$. Knowing that $a = |x-1|$ and it will be positive, we can split this into two separate absolute value equations:

1.1) $x - 1 = 2 + \frac{m}{100} \implies x = 3 + \frac{m}{100}$,
1.2) $x - 1 = 2 - \frac{m}{100} \implies x = 3 - \frac{m}{100}$.

Hence, $x = 3 + \frac{m}{100}$ or $x = 3 - \frac{m}{100}$ for case 1.

By similar analysis of case 2 and 3 we can find that

- Case 2 leads to $x = -3 + \frac{m}{100}$ or $x = -3 - \frac{m}{100}$
- Case 3 leads to $x = 1 + 3 + \frac{m}{100}$ or $x = 1 + 3 - \frac{m}{100}$

which can be simplified into:

- Case 2: $x = -3 + \frac{m}{100}$ or $x = -3 - \frac{m}{100}$
- Case 3: $x = 4 + \frac{m}{100}$ or $x = 2 - \frac{m}{100}$.

Therefore, the solutions are $x = 3 + \frac{m}{100}$ or $x = 3 - \frac{m}{100}$ (from case 1), $x = -3 + \frac{m}{100}$ or $x = -3 - \frac{m}{100}$ (from case 2), and $x = 4 + \frac{m}{100}$ or $x = 2 - \frac{m}{100}$ (from case 3).

To find the value of m for which the equation has four distinct solutions, we need to find the range of m for which each of these pairs of solutions yields two different values. 

For case 1 and case 2, we need $ 0 < \frac{m}{100} < 1$, i.e., $0 < m < 100$, hence the only m that works is m = 100. Substituting this into the above equations, we can find the four distinct solutions: 

\[x = 3 + \frac{100}{100} = 4, x = 3 - \frac{100}{100} = 2, x = -3 + \frac{100}{100} = -2, x = -3 - \frac{100}{100} = -6.\]

Hence, the equation has four distinct solutions when $m = 100$. Since 100 is a positive integer, the solution is verified and it is an example of an integer value $m$. Thus, the value of $m$ that makes the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ have four distinct solutions is $m = 100$. Thus the answer is:

\[100\]

The value of $m$ that makes the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ have four distinct solutions is $\boxed{100}$.
The answer is: $\boxed{100}$

Interesting, let's analyze step by step:



The given equation is $ \vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100} $ and we are asked to find how many positive integers $m$ make this equation have 4 distinct solutions.

1. The equation has four distinct solutions when the right side ($\frac{m}{100}$) is equal to 1. Therefore, $m = 100$.

Let's verify it:
Substitute $m = 100$ into the equation $ \vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{100}{100} = 1 $. The equation becomes $ \vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=1 $.
This equation has four distinct solutions: $x = -1, 3, 5, 7$.

Hence, $m = 100$ is a valid solution, and it's a positive integer.
The answer is: 100

Interesting, let's analyze step by step:



The expression $| |x - 1| - 2 | = \frac{m}{100}$ has 4 distinct solutions. 

Recall the graph of $|x - a|$ is a "V" shape, and $| |x - a| - b|$ is a "bump" that goes from $0$ at $x = a \pm b$ to $2b$ at $x = a$, and back to $0$ at $x = a \pm b$.

Then $| |x - 1| - 2|$ goes from $0$ at $x = 3$ and $x = -1$ to $4$ at $x = 1$, and back to $0$ at $x = -1$ and $x = 3$. The condition $| |x - 1| - 2 | = \frac{m}{100}$ is true for values of $x$ in these "bumps" when the height of the bump, $4$, times the fraction $\frac{m}{100}$, equals the height of the bump, that is $m = 400$.

However, the height of the bump is always $4$, and the "bumps" appear at the places where the heights of the "V"s from $|x - 1|$ and $|x - 1| - 2$ are equal.

So let's solve the equations $|x - 1| = 2$ and $|x - 1| - 2 = 0$:

```python


INTERMEDIATE OUT :

from sympy import symbols, Eq, solve

def find_m():
    x = symbols('x')

    # Solve the equation |x - 1| = 2
    equation1 = Eq(abs(x - 1), 2)
    solutions1 = solve(equation1, x)

    # Solve the equation |x - 1| - 2 = 0
    equation2 = Eq(abs(x - 1) - 2, 0)
    solutions2 = solve(equation2, x)

    return solutions1, solutions2

result = find_m()
print(result)
```

CODE RESULTS ([-1, 3], [-1, 3])

INTERMEDIATE OUT :
```output
([-1, 3], [-1, 3])
```

We got that $|x - 1| = 2$ has solutions $x = -1$ and $x = 3$, and $|x - 1| - 2 = 0$ has also solutions $x = -1$ and $x = 3$.

Therefore, the height of each bump equals the height of the "V"s from $|x - 1|$ and $|x - 1| - 2$. As each bump has a height of $4$, each of these "bumps" will intersect the line $y = \frac{m}{100}$ when $\frac{m}{100} = 4$, which gives us $m = 400$.

As the "bumps" don't intersect the line $y = \frac{m}{100}$ for any other values of $m$, there is only 1 value of $m$ such that the equation $| |x - 1| - 2 | = \frac{m}{100}$ has 4 distinct solutions, and that is $m = 400$. As $400$ is a positive integer, the final answer is $400$. The problem has been solved. The answer is: $400$

1. Identify the sympy functions required for each step.
To solve the equation, we'll use sympy's solveset function to find the values of x that satisfy the equation.
2. Implement these functions step-by-step, commenting each line for clarity.

We are given the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$. For this equation to have 4 distinct solutions, m must be a positive integer value that satisfies this condition.

Since we want to count the number of positive integer values of m that result in 4 distinct solutions, we can set up the following loop:

from sympy import symbols, solveset, S

def count_m():
    x, m = symbols('x m')
    count = 0

    for m_value in range(1, 101):  # we only need to check the first 100 positive integers for m
        equation = abs(abs(x - 1) - 2) - m_value / 100
        solutions = solveset(equation, x, domain=S.Reals)

        if len(solutions) == 4:
