Interesting, let's analyze step by step:



1. The problem states that $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ and $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$. 

2. If any of the expressions in step 1 equals 0, then both expressions must equal 0. This implies that $\vert x + y \vert = 10$, $\vert x - y \vert = 10$, $\vert x \vert = 8$, and $\vert y \vert = 8$.

3. The solutions to $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ are given by the lines $x + y = 10$ and $x + y = -10$. Similarly, the solutions to $\vert x - y \vert = 10$ are given by the lines $x - y = 10$ and $x - y = -10$. The solutions to $\vert x \vert = 8$ are given by the lines $x = 8$ and $x = -8$. Similarly, the solutions to $\vert y \vert = 8$ are given by the lines $y = 8$ and $y = -8$.

4. The intersection points of these lines are the vertices of the polygon. By solving these equations, we find that the vertices of the polygon are $(8, 2)$, $(8, -2)$, $(-8, 2)$, $(-8, -2)$, $(2, 8)$, $(-2, 8)$, $(2, -8)$, and $(-2, -8)$.

5. To find the area of the polygon, we can use the shoelace formula. The shoelace formula for a polygon with vertices $(x_1, y_1), (x_2, y_2), \ldots, (x_n, y_n)$ is given by:

$$\frac{1}{2} \left| \sum_{i=1}^{n} x_i y_{i+1} - y_i x_{i+1} \right|$$

where $x_{n+1} = x_1$ and $y_{n+1} = y_1$.

6. By plugging in the coordinates of the vertices into the shoelace formula, we find that the area of the polygon is 256 square units.

7. The result is a positive integer, so our answer is valid.

The answer is: $256$

Interesting, let's analyze step by step:



If $f(x,y) = ((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$, the points which make $f(x,y) = 0$ are exactly the points which are in the intersection of the two squares with side length 10 centered at the origin and the two squares with side length 8, also centered at the origin.

The intersection of these squares is a square of side length 8, hence its area is $8^2 = 64$.

Therefore, the area of this convex polygon is 64.
The answer is: $64$

Interesting, let's analyze step by step:



The equation is equal to zero if any of its factors is zero. This gives us two conditions:
1. $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$
2. $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$

From the first condition, we have $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ or $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. These are the equations of two lines parallel to the x-axis and y-axis respectively, and the distance between them is 10 units.

From the second condition, we have $\vert x \vert = 8$ or $\vert y \vert = 8$. These are the equations of two lines parallel to the y-axis and x-axis respectively, and the distance between them is 8 units.

The intersection points of these lines form a square with side length 8 units. The area of this square is $8^2 = 64$ square units. The answer is: $64$

Interesting, let's analyze step by step:



If the product of two numbers is zero, one or both numbers must be zero. So, we can break down the problem into two scenarios:

Scenario 1: $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ and $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$. This implies $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. These are two equations of a square with side length 10 centered at the origin (0,0). The area of this square is $10^2 = 100$.

Scenario 2: $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ and $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$. This implies $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$. These are two equations of a square with side length 16 centered at the origin (0,0). The area of this square is $16^2 = 256$.

However, the intersection of these two scenarios is the origin (0,0) only. To see this, if both $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$ hold, then $x = y = 0$. And if both $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$ hold, then again $x = y = 0$.

So, the intersection of these two scenarios is the origin (0,0) only, which has area 0.

Therefore, the total area of the convex polygon formed by the points that satisfy the original equation is the sum of the areas of the two squares, which is $100 + 256 = 356$.

The area of the convex polygon is 356. The answer is: $356$

Interesting, let's analyze step by step:



We start by noting that the product of two numbers is zero if and only if at least one of the numbers is zero. Therefore, we can consider the two cases separately:

1. $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ and $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$. This means $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$.
2. $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ and $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$. This means $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$.

From the first case, we have:

- If $\vert x + y \vert = 10$, then $x + y = \pm 10$ or $x + y = -\pm 10$.
- If $\vert x - y \vert = 10$, then $x - y = \pm 10$ or $x - y = -\pm 10$.

From the second case, we have:

- If $\vert x \vert = 8$, then $x = \pm 8$.
- If $\vert y \vert = 8$, then $y = \pm 8$.

Now we can see that the solution points lie on the square with vertices at $(\pm 8, \pm 8)$. The side length of the square is 16, so the area of the square is $16^2 = 256$. The area of the convex polygon is thus 256.
The answer is: $256$.

Interesting, let's analyze step by step:



The product of two numbers is zero if and only if at least one of them is zero. Thus, the given equation implies that either $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$. Each of these equations implies that $\vert x + y \vert = 10$, $\vert x - y \vert = 10$, $\vert x \vert = 8$, or $\vert y \vert = 8$. 

From $\vert x + y \vert = 10$, we have $x + y = 10$ or $x + y = -10$. 
From $\vert x - y \vert = 10$, we have $x - y = 10$ or $x - y = -10$. 
From $\vert x \vert = 8$, we have $x = 8$ or $x = -8$. 
From $\vert y \vert = 8$, we have $y = 8$ or $y = -8$. 

Now, we can find all possible combinations of these equations and their intersections. This will result in a polygon which can be broken down into 8 triangles. We can then use the formula for the area of a triangle (1/2 * base * height) to find the area of each triangle and sum them up to get the area of the polygon.

Calculating the area of each triangle and summing them up, we get the total area of the polygon as 256 square units.

So, the area of the convex polygon is 256 square units. The answer is: $256$.

Interesting, let's analyze step by step:



The expression $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ equals zero if and only if either the first factor equals zero, i.e., $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$, or the second factor equals zero, i.e., $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$.

In the first case, we have $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. These two equations form a diamond shape, where the coordinates $(x, y)$ lie.

In the second case, we have $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$. These two equations form a square shape, where the coordinates $(x, y)$ lie.

The convex polygon that encloses the points is thus a square with side length 16. The area of this square is $16^2 = 256$.
The answer is: $256$
