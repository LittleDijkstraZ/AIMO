Below is a math problem you are to solve (positive numerical answer!):
"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"
Analyze this problem and think step by step to come to a solution with programs. After solving the problem, output the final numerical answer within \boxed{}.

The problem statement is quite complex, but by examining it, we can simplify it. The expression equals zero if either of the factors equals zero. The factors are:
\[((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)\]
and
\[((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2).\]
The first factor equals zero if both $\vert x + y \vert - 10 = 0$ and $\vert x - y \vert - 10 = 0$. This simplifies to $x + y = \pm 10$ and $x - y = \pm 10$. Solving these equations, we find that the points are at $(5,5)$, $(5,-5)$, $(-5,5)$, and $(-5,-5)$.
The second factor equals zero if both $\vert x \vert - 8 = 0$ and $\vert y \vert - 8 = 0$. This simplifies to $x = \pm 8$ and $y = \pm 8$. Solving these equations, we find that the points are at $(8,8)$, $(8,-8)$, $(-8,8)$, and $(-8,-8)$.
Therefore, the points that satisfy the original equation are the vertices of a square with side length 10. The area of this square is $10^2 = 100$. So the area of the convex polygon is 100.
The answer is: $100$

Below is a math problem you are to solve (positive numerical answer!):
"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"

 To solve this problem, we first need to understand the conditions that make the expression $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2)$ equal to zero.

The expression is equal to zero if either of the two factors is zero. This gives us two conditions:

1. $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ and $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 \neq 0$.
2. $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 \neq 0$ and $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$.

From condition 1, we have $(\vert x + y \vert - 10) = 0$ and $(\vert x - y \vert - 10) = 0$, which implies $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. This means $x + y = \pm 10$ and $x - y = \pm 10$. Solving these equations, we find that the points $(x, y)$ that satisfy condition 1 are $(8, 2)$, $(8, -2)$, $(-8, 2)$, and $(-8, -2)$.

From condition 2, we have $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$, which implies $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$. This means $x = \pm 8$ and $y = \pm 8$. Solving these equations, we find that the points $(x, y)$ that satisfy condition 2 are $(8, 8)$, $(8, -8)$, $(-8, 8)$, and $(-8, -8)$.

The points $(x, y)$ that satisfy the original equation are the union of the points that satisfy conditions 1 and 2, which are $(8, 2)$, $(8, -2)$, $(-8, 2)$, $(-8, -2)$, $(8, 8)$, $(8, -8)$, $(-8, 8)$, and $(-8, -8)$. These points form a square with side length 16. The area of this square is $16^2 = 256$. So, the area of the convex polygon is 256.

Here is a Python code to calculate the area:

```python


INTERMEDIATE OUT :

def polygon_area():
    side_length = 16
    area = side_length ** 2
    return area

result = polygon_area()
print(result)
```

CODE RESULTS 256

INTERMEDIATE OUT :
```output
256
```
The area of the convex polygon is $256$. The answer is: $256$

Below is a math problem you are to solve (positive numerical answer!):
"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"

 The given equation is a product of two terms equal to zero, so each term must be zero separately. This gives us the following four equations:

1. $\vert x + y \vert - 10 = 0$
2. $\vert x - y \vert - 10 = 0$
3. $\vert x \vert - 8 = 0$
4. $\vert y \vert - 8 = 0$

From equations 3 and 4, we get $x = \pm 8$ and $y = \pm 8$.

From equations 1 and 2, we have $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$.

Considering all combinations of signs, we find that the points that satisfy the given equation are $(8, 8)$, $(-8, 8)$, $(8, -8)$, and $(-8, -8)$.

These points form a square with side length 16. The area of the square is therefore $16^2 = 256$.

```python


INTERMEDIATE OUT :

def area_of_polygon():
    """The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"""
    side_length = 16
    area = side_length ** 2
    return area

result = area_of_polygon()
print(result)
```

CODE RESULTS 256

INTERMEDIATE OUT :
```output
256

The area of the convex polygon is $256$.
The answer is: $256$
