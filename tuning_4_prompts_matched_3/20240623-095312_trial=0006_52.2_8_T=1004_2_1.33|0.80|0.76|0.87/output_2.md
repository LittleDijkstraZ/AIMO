Question (hint: positive numerical answer):
"For how many positive integers $m$ does the equation \[\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}\] have $4$ distinct solutions?"
Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:


To find the number of positive integers $m$ for which the equation $| ||x-1|-2| = \frac{m}{100}$ has four distinct solutions, we first analyze the structure of the equation.
The equation $| ||x-1|-2| = \frac{m}{100}$ is a combination of two absolute value functions. The function $| ||x-1|-2|$ is a piecewise function that has three different forms depending on the value of $x$.
When $|x-1| \geq 2$, we have $| ||x-1|-2| = |x-1|-2$.
When $1 < |x-1| < 2$, we have $| ||x-1|-2| = 2 - |x-1|$.
When $|x-1| \leq 1$, we have $| ||x-1|-2| = 2 - (x-1) = 3 - x$.
So, the equation $| ||x-1|-2| = \frac{m}{100}$ is equivalent to solving three separate equations:
1. $|x-1|-2 = \frac{m}{100} \implies |x-1| = 2 + \frac{m}{100}$.
2. $2 - |x-1| = \frac{m}{100} \implies |x-1| = 2 - \frac{m}{100}$.
3. $3 - x = \frac{m}{100} \implies x = 3 - \frac{m}{100}$.
For each of these equations, we need to find the number of distinct solutions $x$.
For equation (1), $|x-1| = 2 + \frac{m}{100}$. This has two solutions when $2 + \frac{m}{100} > 0$, i.e., when $m > -200$. Similarly, equation (2) has two solutions when $2 - \frac{m}{100} > 0$, i.e., when $m < 200$. And equation (3) has one solution for all $m$.
So, the equation $| ||x-1|-2| = \frac{m}{100}$ has four distinct solutions when $0 < m < 200$. The number of positive integers $m$ in this range is 199.
Therefore, the number of positive integers $m$ for which the equation $| ||x-1|-2| = \frac{m}{100}$ has four distinct solutions is 199.
The answer is: $199$.

Question (hint: positive numerical answer):
"For how many positive integers $m$ does the equation \[\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}\] have $4$ distinct solutions?"
Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:


The equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has $4$ distinct solutions if and only if $\frac{m}{100} = 2$. This is because the expression on the left side of the equation, $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert$, can take on exactly $4$ distinct values between $0$ and $2$, inclusive. It is equal to $0$ when $\vert x-1 \vert = 2$, equal to $1$ when $\vert x-1 \vert = 3$, equal to $2$ when $\vert x-1 \vert = 4$, and cannot be equal to any value greater than $2$.

Setting $\frac{m}{100} = 2$, we find that $m = 200$.

So, there is only one positive integer $m$ that satisfies the given condition, and that is $200$. The answer is: $\boxed{1}$.

Step-by-step Solution:


The equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has 4 distinct solutions if and only if $\frac{m}{100} = 2$.
Solving this equation gives $m = 200$.
Therefore, the only positive integer value of $m$ for which the equation has 4 distinct solutions is 200.
The answer is: $1$

Question (hint: positive numerical answer):
"For how many positive integers $m$ does the equation \[\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}\] have $4$ distinct solutions?"
Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:



For the equation to have 4 distinct solutions, the right-hand side, $\frac{m}{100}$, must be equal to 2. Therefore, we have: \[\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=2.\]This breaks down into two separate cases:

Case 1: $\vert x-1 \vert -2 = 2$. Solving this equation gives $\vert x-1 \vert = 4$. This breaks down further into two sub-cases:

Sub-case 1.1: $x-1 = 4$ gives $x = 5$.

Sub-case 1.2: $x-1 = -4$ gives $x = -3$.

Case 2: $\vert x-1 \vert -2 = -2$. Solving this equation gives $\vert x-1 \vert = 0$, which implies $x-1 = 0$ and $x = 1$.

Thus, the 4 distinct solutions are $x = -3, 1, 5$. The value of $m$ is determined by equating $\frac{m}{100}$ to 2, so $m = 200$. Therefore, the only positive integer value of $m$ for which the equation has 4 distinct solutions is 200. The answer is: $\boxed{1}$

Question (hint: positive numerical answer):
"For how many positive integers $m$ does the equation \[\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}\] have $4$ distinct solutions?"
Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:


The equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has $4$ distinct solutions.
We know that $\frac{m}{100}$ is positive, so $m$ must be positive.
We also know that $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert$ can take on only certain positive values to allow for $4$ distinct solutions.
By analyzing the equation, we find that $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert$ must be equal to $0.2$ or $0.8$.
This means $\frac{m}{100}$ must be equal to $0.2$ or $0.8$.
Therefore, $m$ must be $20$ or $80$.
So there are $2$ positive integers $m$ for which the equation has $4$ distinct solutions.
The answer is: $2$

Question (hint: positive numerical answer):
"For how many positive integers $m$ does the equation \[\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}\] have $4$ distinct solutions?"
Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:


The equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has 4 distinct solutions. 
The expression $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert$ is a piecewise function that represents a V-shape on the number line. 
The equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ will have 4 distinct solutions if and only if $\frac{m}{100}$ is the height of the V shape at exactly 4 places. 
The height of the V shape is 2, so we need to find the number of values of $m$ for which $\frac{m}{100}=2$. 
Multiplying both sides by 100 gives $m=200$. 
Thus, there is only 1 value of $m$ that satisfies the condition. The answer is: 1
