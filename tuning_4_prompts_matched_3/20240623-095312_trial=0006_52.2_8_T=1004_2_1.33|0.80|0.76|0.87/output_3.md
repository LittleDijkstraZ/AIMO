Question (hint: positive numerical answer):
"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"
Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:


The expression $ab = 0$ is equivalent to $a = 0$ or $b = 0$. So, the given equation is equivalent to:
$$((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2) = 0$$
or
$$((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0.$$
The only way the first expression can be zero is if $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. This means $x + y = \pm 10$ and $x - y = \pm 10$. Solving these equations gives us the vertices of the square: $(8, 2), (8, -2), (-8, -2), (-8, 2)$.

The only way the second expression can be zero is if $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$, which gives us the vertices of the square: $(8, 8), (8, -8), (-8, -8), (-8, 8)$.

The union of these two squares is a larger square with side length $10\sqrt{2}$, so its area is $(10\sqrt{2})^2 = 200$.
The answer is: $200$

Question (hint: positive numerical answer):
"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"
Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:



In order for the product of two factors to be zero, one of the factors must be zero. This means that either $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$. 

If $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$, then both $\vert x + y \vert - 10 = 0$ and $\vert x - y \vert - 10 = 0$, which means $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. This results in a square with side length 20.

If $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$, then both $\vert x \vert - 8 = 0$ and $\vert y \vert - 8 = 0$, which means $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$. This results in a square with side length 16.

The convex polygon is the union of these two squares, so its area is the sum of the areas of the two squares.

The area of a square is given by side length squared, so the area of the first square (side length 20) is $20^2 = 400$ and the area of the second square (side length 16) is $16^2 = 256$.

Adding these two areas together gives the total area of the convex polygon: $400 + 256 = 656$. The answer is: $\boxed{656}$.

Question (hint: positive numerical answer):
"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"
Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:


The product of two numbers is zero if and only if at least one of the numbers is zero. So, we have two cases to consider:

Case 1: $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$.
This means that $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. The absolute value equations split into four cases:
- $x + y = 10$ and $x - y = 10$
- $x + y = 10$ and $x - y = -10$
- $x + y = -10$ and $x - y = 10$
- $x + y = -10$ and $x - y = -10$
After solving these four systems of equations, we find that the points satisfying Case 1 are $(10,0)$ , $(0,10)$, $(-10,0)$ and $(0,-10)$.

Case 2: $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$.
This means that $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$. The absolute value equations split into four cases:
- $x = 8$ and $y = 8$
- $x = 8$ and $y = -8$
- $x = -8$ and $y = 8$
- $x = -8$ and $y = -8$
After solving these four systems of equations, we find that the points satisfying Case 2 are $(8,8)$ , $(8,-8)$, $(-8,8)$ and $(-8,-8)$.

Plotting these eight points on the coordinate plane, we see that they form a square with side length 16. The area of this square is $16^2 = 256$. Therefore, the area of the convex polygon is 256 square units.
The answer is: 256.

Question (hint: positive numerical answer):
"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"
Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:


The expression $A \cdot B = 0$ implies that at least one of the quantities $A$ or $B$ is zero. So the given equation is satisfied if either $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$.
For the first case, we have $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. These conditions imply that $x + y = \pm 10$ and $x - y = \pm 10$, which are the equations of four lines in the coordinate plane.
For the second case, we have $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$, which are the equations of four lines in the coordinate plane.
Therefore, the points satisfying the given equation are the intersections of these eight lines. These intersections form a square with side length 16. The area of this square is $16^2 = 256$. The answer is: $256$

Question (hint: positive numerical answer):
"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"
Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:


The expression equals zero if either $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$.
The first two equations imply that $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$, which means that the points $(x, y)$ lie on the lines $x + y = 10$ and $x - y = 10$ or their opposites.
The last two equations imply that $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$, which means that the points $(x, y)$ lie on the lines $x = 8$ and $y = 8$ or their opposites.
The lines $x + y = 10$, $x - y = 10$, $x = 8$, and $y = 8$ form a rectangle with side lengths 16 and 20. The area of this rectangle is $16 \times 20 = 320$. So the area of the convex polygon is 320 square units.
The answer is: $320$

Question (hint: positive numerical answer):
"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"
Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:


The product of two numbers is zero if and only if at least one of the numbers is zero. This means that either $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$, $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$, $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$, or $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$.
For $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$, we have $\vert x + y \vert = 10$, which gives us two lines: $x + y = 10$ and $x + y = -10$.
Similarly, for $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$, we have $\vert x - y \vert = 10$, which gives us two more lines: $x - y = 10$ and $x - y = -10$.
For $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$, we have $\vert x \vert = 8$, which gives us two lines: $x = 8$ and $x = -8$.
And for $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$, we have $\vert y \vert = 8$, which gives us two more lines: $y = 8$ and $y = -8$.
These lines form a square with side length 16. The area of this square is $16^2 = 256$.
So, the area of the convex polygon is 256 square units.
The answer is: $256$

Question (hint: positive numerical answer):
"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"
Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:


The product of two numbers is zero if and only if at least one of the numbers is zero. Therefore, the equation
\[((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0\]
is satisfied if either
\[((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2) = 0\]
or
\[((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0.\]
If $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2) = 0$, then $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$, which implies that $x + y = \pm 10$ and $x - y = \pm 10$. Solving these equations gives us the vertices of the square with side length 10: $(5,5)$, $(5,-5)$, $(-5,5)$, and $(-5,-5)$.
If $((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$, then $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$, which implies that $x = \pm 8$ and $y = \pm 8$. Solving these equations gives us the vertices of the square with side length 16: $(8,8)$, $(8,-8)$, $(-8,8)$, and $(-8,-8)$.

The convex polygon formed by these points is a rectangle with side lengths 16 and 10. The area of this rectangle is $16 \times 10 = 160$. The answer is: $\boxed{160}$

Question (hint: positive numerical answer):
"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"
Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:



The given equation is $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$.

This equation is satisfied if either $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$.

For the first case, $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$, it implies that $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. These are the equations of two squares with side length 10 centered at the origin. The vertices of these squares are $(0, \pm10), (\pm10, 0), (0, \mp10), (\mp10, 0)$.

For the second case, $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$, it implies that $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$. These are the equations of two squares with side length 8 centered at the origin. The vertices of these squares are $(\pm8, 0), (0, \pm8)$.

The intersection of the two squares from the first and second cases is a square with side length 8 centered at the origin.

The area of this square is $8^2 = 64$. The answer is: $64$.

"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"
Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:


The expression $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ is equal to zero if and only if either of the factors is equal to zero.
The first factor is equal to zero when $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ or $\vert x - y \vert = 10$.
The second factor is equal to zero when $\vert x \vert = 8$ or $\vert y \vert = 8$.
These conditions define a square with side length 16.
Therefore, the area of the convex polygon is $16^2 = 256$. The answer is: $256$
