Interesting, let's analyze step by step:



The given equation is $| |x - 1| - 2| = \frac{m}{100}$. We want to find how many positive integers $m$ make this equation have four distinct solutions.

First, let's think about when the expression on the left has four distinct solutions. The expression $|x - 1| - 2$ has three "jump points": $x = 1 - 2 = -1$, $x = 1$, and $x = 1 + 2 = 3$. This expression is equal to 0 at $x = 3$, negative for $x < 3$, and positive for $x > 3$.

So, the equation $| |x - 1| - 2| = \frac{m}{100}$ has four distinct solutions when $\frac{m}{100}$ is in the range $(0, 2)$. This means $0 < \frac{m}{100} < 2$, so $0 < m < 200$.

The positive integers $m$ in this range are $1, 2, ..., 199$, so there are 199 such integers. However, we must exclude the cases where the number of solutions is not 4.

If $\frac{m}{100} = 0$ or $\frac{m}{100} = 2$, the equation becomes $| |x - 1| - 2| = 0$ or $| |x - 1| - 2| = 2$. The first equation has only two solutions, and the second equation has six solutions.

Therefore, the possible values of $m$ are those integers in the range $(0, 200)$ except $0$ and $200$. The number of such integers is $199 - 2 = 197$.

However, we have made a mistake! The number of solutions of the equation $| |x - 1| - 2| = \frac{m}{100}$ is not always 4. It can also be 2.

When $\frac{m}{100}$ is less than 0 or greater than 4, the equation has only two solutions. The values of $m$ in these cases are those less than 0 or greater than 400. There are no such positive integers $m$ in the range $(0, 200)$.

Therefore, the possible values of $m$ are the integers in the range $(0, 200)$ except $0$ and $200$. The number of such integers is indeed 197.

Now let's implement this in Python:

```python


INTERMEDIATE OUT :

def number_of_m():
    # The possible values of m are the integers in the range (0, 200) except 0 and 200.
    m_values = list(range(1, 200))
    return len(m_values)

result = number_of_m()
print(result)
```

CODE RESULTS 199

INTERMEDIATE OUT :
```output
199
```

Oops, we made a mistake again! The number of positive integers $m$ in the range $(0, 200)$ is indeed 199, but we have to exclude $0$ and $200$. So the correct number of positive integers $m$ is $199 - 2 = 197$.

So the correct number of positive integers $m$ for which the equation $| |x - 1| - 2| = \frac{m}{100}$ has four distinct solutions is 197.

The answer is: $197$

Interesting, let's analyze step by step:



Given the equation $| |x - 1| - 2| = \frac{m}{100}$ and we want it to have 4 distinct solutions. This equation can be interpreted as a piecewise function, which can have up to 4 different pieces depending on the value of $x$. The absolute value function $|x|$ splits into two cases: $x$ for $x \geq 0$ and $-x$ for $x < 0$. So, $| |x - 1| - 2|$ will have different expressions depending on the value of $x$.

Let's first solve the equation $| |x - 1| - 2| = \frac{m}{100}$ for the number of values of $m$.

We can start by analyzing the number of solutions of the equation $| |x - 1| - 2| = k$, where $k$ is a constant. The equation $| |x - 1| - 2| = k$ will have 4 distinct solutions if $0 < k < 1$. This is because the function $| |x - 1| - 2|$ oscillates between 0 and 3, so for $k$ in $(0,1)$, there will be 4 different $x$ values that satisfy the equation.

So, we need to find the value of $m$ such that $\frac{m}{100} \in (0,1)$. This implies $0 < m < 100$.

Therefore, the number of positive integers $m$ that satisfy the equation is the number of integers from 1 to 99, inclusive. This is simply $99$.

So the answer is $\boxed{99}$. However, this result contradicts our initial analysis. The equation $| |x - 1| - 2| = k$ with $k = 1$ has only 3 distinct solutions, not 4. 

Let's re-evaluate the problem. We are looking for the number of positive integers $m$ such that the equation $| |x - 1| - 2| = \frac{m}{100}$ has 4 distinct solutions.

If we set $\frac{m}{100} = 1$, then $m = 100$. However, with $m = 100$, the equation $| |x - 1| - 2| = 1$ has only 3 distinct solutions, not 4.

The mistake in our previous reasoning is that we assumed that for $k \in (0,1)$, the equation $| |x - 1| - 2| = k$ would always have 4 distinct solutions. However, this is not always true. For example, when $k = 1$, the equation $| |x - 1| - 2| = 1$ only has 3 distinct solutions, not 4.

To find the correct range of $m$, we need to consider the properties of the function $| |x - 1| - 2|$. We know that the function $| |x - 1| - 2|$ oscillates between 0 and 3. For the equation $| |x - 1| - 2| = \frac{m}{100}$ to have 4 distinct solutions, we need to choose $m$ such that $\frac{m}{100} \in (0,1)$. This implies $0 < m < 100$. However, this range only gives us 99 possible values of $m$, and we need to check if any of these values actually result in 4 distinct solutions for the equation.

By analyzing the properties of the function $| |x - 1| - 2|$, we find that the equation $| |x - 1| - 2| = \frac{m}{100}$ has 4 distinct solutions for $m = 50$. This is because when $\frac{m}{100} = 0.5$, the equation $| |x - 1| - 2| = 0.5$ has 4 distinct solutions.

Therefore, the only positive integer value of $m$ for which the equation $| |x - 1| - 2| = \frac{m}{100}$ has 4 distinct solutions is $m = 50$. So the number of positive integers $m$ that satisfy the equation is 1, not 99.

So the answer is $\boxed{1}$. However, this result also contradicts our initial analysis. The equation $| |x - 1| - 2| = \frac{50}{100}$ has only 3 distinct solutions, not 4.

The mistake in our previous reasoning is that we assumed that for $k \in (0,1)$, the equation $| |x - 1| - 2| = k$ would always have 4 distinct solutions. However, this is not always true. For example, when $k = 0.5$, the equation $| |x - 1| - 2| = 0.5$ only has 3 distinct solutions, not 4.

To find the correct range of $m$, we need to consider the properties of the function $| |x - 1| - 2|$. We know that the function $| |x - 1| - 2|$ oscillates between 0 and 3. For the equation $| |x - 1| - 2| = \frac{m}{100}$ to have 4 distinct solutions, we need to choose $m$ such that $\frac{m}{100} \in (0,1)$. This implies $0 < m < 100$. However, this range only gives us 99 possible values of $m$, and we need to check if any of these values actually result in 4 distinct solutions for the equation.

By analyzing the properties of the function $| |x - 1| - 2|$, we find that the equation $| |x - 1| - 2| = \frac{m}{100}$ has 4 distinct solutions for $m = 50$. This is because when $\frac{m}{100} = 0.5$, the equation $| |x - 1| - 2| = 0.5$ has 4 distinct solutions.

Therefore, the only positive integer value of $m$ for which the equation $| |x - 1| - 2| = \frac{m}{100}$ has 4 distinct solutions is $m = 50$. So the number of positive integers $m$ that satisfy the equation is 1.

So the answer is $\boxed{1}$. This result is consistent with our initial analysis. The equation $| |x - 1| - 2| = \frac{50}{100}$ does have 4 distinct solutions.

The mistake in our previous reasoning is that we assumed that for $k \in (0,1)$, the equation $| |x - 1| - 2| = k$ would always have 4 distinct solutions. However, this is not always true. For example, when $k = 0.5$, the equation $| |x - 1| - 2| = 0.5$ only has 3 distinct solutions, not 4

Interesting, let's analyze step by step:



We need to find how many positive integer values of $m$ make the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ have $4$ distinct solutions.

The equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ is equivalent to a piecewise function with $4$ cases, based on the absolute value:

1. If $x \ge 3$, then $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\vert x-3 \vert$.
2. If $1 \le x < 3$, then $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\vert -1 \vert = 1$.
3. If $x < 1$, then $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\vert x+1 \vert$.

Now we need to solve each case and find the number of integer solutions for $m$.

Case 1: $x \ge 3$, $\vert x-3 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$, $x-3=\frac{m}{100}$ or $3-x=\frac{m}{100}$.

Case 2: $1 \le x < 3$, $\vert -1 \vert = 1$, $1=\frac{m}{100}$, $m=100$.

Case 3: $x < 1$, $\vert x+1 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$, $-(x+1)=\frac{m}{100}$ or $x+1=\frac{m}{100}$.

Now, let's find the number of integer solutions for $m$ in each case.

Case 1: $x-3=\frac{m}{100}$ has no integer solutions because $x-3$ is not an integer for any integer $x$. Similarly, $3-x=\frac{m}{100}$ has no integer solutions. So, no integer solutions in this case.

Case 2: $1=\frac{m}{100}$, $m=100$. One solution.

Case 3: $-(x+1)=\frac{m}{100}$ has no integer solutions because $-(x+1)$ is not an integer for any integer $x$. Similarly, $x+1=\frac{m}{100}$ has no integer solutions. So, no integer solutions in this case.

Adding up the number of integer solutions in each case, we have $1$ solution for $m$.

So, the only positive integer value of $m$ that makes the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ have $4$ distinct solutions is $100$. The answer is: $1$

Interesting, let's analyze step by step:



The equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has 4 distinct solutions, and we want to find the number of possible values for $m$.

The number of solutions of the equation is related to the value of $m$. The right-hand side $\frac{m}{100}$ is a positive number because $m$ is a positive integer, and the left-hand side of the equation is a number between 0 and 3.

When $\frac{m}{100}=3$, the equation has 4 solutions. This means $m=300$.

Therefore, there is only one possible value for $m$, which is $300$. Since $300$ is a positive integer, we have found our answer.

The answer is: $1$

Interesting, let's analyze step by step:



1. The equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has 4 distinct solutions.
2. This equation can be rewritten as two cases: $\vert x-1 \vert -2 = \pm \frac{m}{100}$.
3. Simplify the above equations, we have $\vert x-1 \vert = 2 \pm \frac{m}{100}$.
4. This gives us four equations: $x-1 = 2 + \frac{m}{100}$, $x-1 = 2 - \frac{m}{100}$, $-x+1 = 2 + \frac{m}{100}$, and $-x+1 = 2 - \frac{m}{100}$.
5. Solve these equations one by one:

- $x = 3 + \frac{m}{100}$: the solutions are $x = 3 + \frac{m}{100}$ and $x = 3 - \frac{m}{100}$.
- $x = -1 + \frac{m}{100}$: the solutions are $x = -1 + \frac{m}{100}$ and $x = -1 - \frac{m}{100}$.

6. The four solutions are $3 + \frac{m}{100}$, $3 - \frac{m}{100}$, $-1 + \frac{m}{100}$, and $-1 - \frac{m}{100}$.
7. For these four solutions to be distinct, we require that $3 + \frac{m}{100} \neq 3 - \frac{m}{100}$, $3 + \frac{m}{100} \neq -1 + \frac{m}{100}$, $3 + \frac{m}{100} \neq -1 - \frac{m}{100}$, $3 - \frac{m}{100} \neq -1 + \frac{m}{100}$, $3 - \frac{m}{100} \neq -1 - \frac{m}{100}$, and $-1 + \frac{m}{100} \neq -1 - \frac{m}{100}$.
8. Simplifying these inequalities, we find that $\frac{m}{100} \neq 2$, $\frac{m}{100} \neq 4$, and $\frac{m}{100} \neq -2$. This means $m$ must be an integer such that $200 < m < 400$ or $-200 < m < 200$.
9. However, since $m$ is a positive integer, we only consider $200 < m < 400$.
10. The possible values of $m$ are the integers from 201 to 399, inclusive.
11. The number of such integers is $399 - 201 + 1 = 199$.
12. However, we must check if 199 is a positive integer. It is.

Therefore, the number of positive integers $m$ such that the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has 4 distinct solutions is 199. The answer is: $199$.

Interesting, let's analyze step by step:



The equation $||x-1|-2|=\frac{m}{100}$ has 4 distinct solutions. This equation can have at most 4 solutions because the equation $|x-1|-2=\frac{m}{100}$ or $|x-1|-2=-\frac{m}{100}$ each have 2 branches of absolute value, and when you solve each branch of these equations, you get 4 equations in total.

Now, we know that $|x-1|-2$ must be equal to either $\frac{m}{100}$ or $-\frac{m}{100}$. This means that the distance between $x$ and $1$ minus $2$ must be either $\frac{m}{100}$ or $-\frac{m}{100}$.

The graph of $|x-1|-2$ is a V-shape with the vertex at $(1, -2)$. The distance from the vertex to each branch is $2$ units. Therefore, for the equation to have 4 solutions, the value of $\frac{m}{100}$ must be between $0$ and $2$, i.e., $0 < \frac{m}{100} < 2$. This implies $0 < m < 200$.

Now, we need to count the number of positive integers $m$ in this range. The positive integers from $1$ to $199$ inclusive are the possible values of $m$. So the number of positive integers $m$ is $199$. However, this number is not an integer we are looking for.

Let's go back and think about the conditions for the equation to have 4 distinct solutions. From the graph, we can see that the value of $\frac{m}{100}$ must be equal to the distance from the vertex to each branch, which is $2$. This gives us $\frac{m}{100} = 2$ or $\frac{m}{100} = -2$. The second equation has no solution because the distance cannot be negative. From the first equation, we have $m = 200$.

So, the only value of $m$ that makes the equation have 4 distinct solutions is $200$. But we need to check if it's a positive integer. It is, indeed, a positive integer. So the number of positive integers $m$ for which the equation has 4 distinct solutions is $1$.
The answer is: $1$
