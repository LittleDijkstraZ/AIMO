Approach:


We will try to find a general formula for $f(n)$ based on the given functional equations and then compute $f(100)$ using this formula.

Solution:
From the second equation $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$, we can find that for $n=1$, we have $f(2) = 2f(1) + 1$.

From the first equation $f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$, we can find that for $n=1$, we have $f(f(f(1)))=8(1)-7=1$.
As $f(f(f(1)))=1$, it implies that $f(f(1))=1$ because $f(n)$ is a function from $\mathbb N$ to $\mathbb N$.
Now we know $f(f(1))=1$, we can substitute it into the equation $f(2) = 2f(1) + 1$, we get $1 = 2f(1) + 1$. Solving this equation, we get $f(1)=0$.

Now we have found $f(1)=0$. We can substitute this into the equation $f(2) = 2f(1) + 1$, we get $f(2) = 2(0) + 1 = 1$.

Now let's compute $f(3)$ based on $f(2)$ using the second equation $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$.
We have $f(3) = 2f(1.5) + 1$, but we know $f(1)=0$, so $f(1.5) = f(\frac{3}{2}) = f(1) = 0$. So $f(3) = 2(0) + 1 = 1$.

Now let's compute $f(4)$ based on $f(2)$ using the second equation $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$.
We have $f(4) = 2f(2) + 1 = 2(1) + 1 = 3$.

And $f(5) = 2f(2.5) + 1 = 2(1) + 1 = 3$.

Similarly, we can find $f(6) = 2f(3) + 1 = 2(1) + 1 = 3$, $f(7) = 2f(3.5) + 1 = 2(1) + 1 = 3$, and so on. We can see that $f(n) = 3$ when $n \geq 3$.

So now we can compute $f(100)$. Since $100 \geq 3$, we have $f(100) = 3$.

The value of $f(100)$ is 3.
The answer is: $3$

Approach:


To find the value of $f(100)$, we need to use the given functional equations to transform the expression $f(100)$ into a form where we can find the value.

First, let's substitute $n = 100$ into the equation $f(2n) = 2f(n) + 1$:
$$f(200) = 2f(100) + 1 \tag{1}$$

Now, substitute $n = 100$ into the equation $f(f(f(n))) = 8n - 7$:
$$f(f(f(100))) = 8*100 - 7 = 793 \tag{2}$$

From equation (2), we know that $f(f(f(100))) = 793$, and thus $f(f(100)) = x$ implies $f(x) = 793$. Now, substitute $x = f(100)$ into equation (1):
$$f(f(100)) = 2f(100) + 1 \Rightarrow 793 = 2f(100) + 1 \Rightarrow 2f(100) = 792 \Rightarrow f(100) = \frac{792}{2} = 396$$

So, $f(100) = 396$.
The answer is: $396$

Solve the following problem with a Python Script (positive numerical answer):
"A function $f: \mathbb N \to \mathbb N$ satisfies the following two conditions for all positive integers $n$:$f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$ and $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$. Calculate $f(100)$."

Approach:


We will use the second condition to find $f(100)$ by expressing $100$ in the form $2n$.

We know that $f(f(f(100))) = 8*100 - 7 = 793$.
Using the second condition, we can write $f(f(f(100))) = f(f(2*50)) = f(2f(50)+1)$.
Substituting the value of $f(f(f(100)))$, we get $793 = f(2f(50)+1)$.

Now we need to find $f(50)$. We can use the second condition again:
$f(f(f(50))) = 8*50 - 7 = 393$.
Again, using the second condition, we can write $f(f(f(50))) = f(f(2*25)) = f(2f(25)+1)$.
Substituting the value of $f(f(f(50)))$, we get $393 = f(2f(25)+1)$.

Now we need to find $f(25)$. We can use the second condition again:
$f(f(f(25))) = 8*25 - 7 = 193$.
Again, using the second condition, we can write $f(f(f(25))) = f(f(2*12.5)) = f(2f(12.5)+1)$.
Since $12.5$ is not a natural number, we cannot continue this way.

However, we can notice that $193$ is a prime number, and since $f(f(f(n)))$ is always equal to $8n-7$, we can guess that $f(n)$ might be the function that maps every natural number to the previous prime number.

To verify this, let's calculate $f(12.5)$:
Since $12.5$ is not a natural number, we cannot apply the second condition directly.
But we can notice that $12.5$ is between $12$ and $13$, so we can use the first condition to find $f(12)$ and $f(13)$:
$f(f(f(12))) = 8*12 - 7 = 89$. So $f(12) = p_{8} = 19$.
$f(f(f(13))) = 8*13 - 7 = 97$. So $f(13) = p_{9} = 23$.

Thus, we can deduce that $f(n)$ maps every natural number to the previous prime number.

Now we can continue our calculation:
$f(25) = p_{9} = 23$,
$f(50) = p_{18} = 71$,
$f(100) = p_{35} = 149$.

So, $f(100) = 149$. The answer is: $\boxed{149}$

Approach:


We can solve this problem by using the second given equation and the definition of the function $f$.

From the second equation, we know that $f(2n) = 2f(n) + 1$. Let's use this equation to find $f(100)$.

We know that $100 = 2 \cdot 50$, so we can apply the equation $f(2n) = 2f(n) + 1$ with $n = 50$ to get $f(100) = 2f(50) + 1$.

Now, we need to find the value of $f(50)$. Since $50 = 2 \cdot 25$, we can apply the equation $f(2n) = 2f(n) + 1$ again with $n = 25$ to get $f(50) = 2f(25) + 1$.

We continue this process until we reach a base case. The base case in this problem is when $n$ is small enough that we can directly use the first equation $f(f(f(n))) = 8n - 7$. For simplicity, let's start with $n = 1$.

From the first equation, when $n = 1$, we have $f(f(f(1))) = 8 \cdot 1 - 7 = 1$. Therefore, $f(1) = 1$.

Now, we can substitute $n = 1$ into the equation $f(2n) = 2f(n) + 1$ to get $f(2) = 2f(1) + 1 = 2 \cdot 1 + 1 = 3$.

Similarly, we can find $f(4) = 2f(2) + 1 = 2 \cdot 3 + 1 = 7$, $f(8) = 2f(4) + 1 = 2 \cdot 7 + 1 = 15$, $f(16) = 2f(8) + 1 = 2 \cdot 15 + 1 = 31$, and so on.

We notice that $f(2^k) = 2^k - 1$ for all positive integers $k$. In particular, $f(32) = 63$, $f(64) = 127$, and $f(50) = f(32 \cdot \frac{50}{32}) = f(32) \cdot \frac{50}{32} = 63 \cdot \frac{50}{32} = 97.5$, which is not an integer, so this method doesn't work for us.

However, we can use the fact that $f(f(f(n))) = 8n - 7$ to find $f(50)$. Since $f(32) = 63$, we can substitute $n = 32$ into the equation $f(f(f(n))) = 8n - 7$ to get $f(f(63)) = 8 \cdot 32 - 7 = 255$.

Now, we know that $f(50) = 2f(25) + 1$, and $f(25) = 2f(12.5)$, but $12.5$ is not an integer, so this method doesn't work either. However, we can notice that $f(64) = 127$, so $f(32) = 63$, and $f(16) = 31$.

Since $f(32) = 63$, we can substitute $n = 32$ into the equation $f(2n) = 2f(n) + 1$ repeatedly to get:
\[f(64) = 2f(32) + 1 = 2 \cdot 63 + 1 = 127,\]
\[f(48) = 2f(24) + 1 = 2 \cdot f(12) + 1 = 2 \cdot (2f(6) + 1) + 1 = 2 \cdot (2 \cdot (2f(3) + 1) + 1) + 1 = 2 \cdot (2 \cdot (2 \cdot 3 + 1) + 1) + 1 = 2 \cdot (2 \cdot 7 + 1) + 1 = 2 \cdot 15 + 1 = 31,\]
\[f(40) = 2f(20) + 1 = 2 \cdot f(10) + 1 = 2 \cdot (2f(5) + 1) + 1 = 2 \cdot (2 \cdot (2f(2.5) + 1) + 1) + 1 = 2 \cdot (2 \cdot (2 \cdot (2f(1.25) + 1) + 1) + 1) + 1 = 2 \cdot (2 \cdot (2 \cdot (2 \cdot 1 + 1) + 1) + 1) + 1 = 2 \cdot (2 \cdot (2 \cdot 3 + 1) + 1) + 1 = 2 \cdot (2 \cdot 7 + 1) + 1 = 2 \cdot 15 + 1 = 31,\]
\[f(32) = 2f(16) + 1 = 2 \cdot 31 + 1 = 63.\]

We can see that the value of $f(n)$ is oscillating between $2f(n) + 1$ and $f(2n)$.

From the calculations above, we have found that $f(32) = 63$, $f(48) = 31$, and $f(40) = 31$. Since $50$ is between $48$ and $40$, and $f(n)$ is oscillating, we can conclude that $f(50) = 31$.

Now, we can continue to find $f(25)$:
\[f(25) = 2f(12.5) = 2 \cdot (2f(6.25)) = 2 \cdot (2 \cdot (2f(3.125))).\]

We can keep going down to the base case of $n = 1$ to find that $f(3.125) = 1$, so $f(3.125) = 1$, and then we can work our way back up to $f(25)$:
\[f(25) = 2 \cdot (2 \cdot (2 \cdot 1)) = 8.\]

Finally, we can find $f(50)$:
\[f(50) = 2f(25

Solve the following problem with a Python Script (positive numerical answer):
"A function $f: \mathbb N \to \mathbb N$ satisfies the following two conditions for all positive integers $n$:$f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$ and $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$. Calculate $f(100)$."

Approach:


To solve this problem, we need to use the given equations step by step to find the value of $f(100)$.

1. From the first equation $f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$, let's substitute $n = 100$, we get $f(f(f(100)))=8*100-7=793$.

2. Now, we want to find the value of $f(100)$, but we only have a relationship between $f(f(f(n)))$ and $n$. To make progress, we can try to find a pattern in the second equation $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$.

3. From the second equation, let's express $f(n)$ in terms of $f(2n)$. Rearranging terms gives $f(n) = \frac{f(2n) - 1}{2}$.

4. Now, let's substitute $n = 50$ in the second equation, we get $f(100) = 2f(50) + 1$.

5. Substitute $n = 25$ in the second equation, we get $f(50) = 2f(25) + 1$.

6. Substitute $n = 12.5$ (note that 12.5 is not a positive integer, but it helps us understand the pattern), we get $f(25) = 2f(12.5) + 1$.

From this pattern, we can see that to find $f(n)$, we need to keep dividing $n$ by 2 and applying the second equation until we reach $n = 1$.

Let's calculate the value of $f(1)$ from the second equation, we get $f(2) = 2f(1) + 1$, and since $f(1)$ is the base case, we can assume $f(1) = 1$. Then, we have $f(2) = 2*1 + 1 = 3$.

Now, we can work our way back up:

- $f(12.5) = \frac{f(25) - 1}{2} = \frac{2f(12.5) + 1 - 1}{2} = f(12.5)$, which is consistent with our assumption.
- $f(25) = 2f(12.5) + 1 = 2*f(12.5) + 1$.
- $f(50) = 2f(25) + 1 = 2*(2*f(12.5) + 1) + 1 = 4*f(12.5) + 3$.
- $f(100) = 2f(50) + 1 = 2*(4*f(12.5) + 3) + 1 = 8*f(12.5) + 7$.

We know that $f(f(f(100)))=793$, and since $f(f(f(100)))=8*100-7=793$, we can equate this to our expression for $f(f(f(100)))$ to get $8*f(12.5) + 7 = 793$.

Solving this equation for $f(12.5)$ gives $f(12.5) = \frac{793 - 7}{8} = 97$.

Finally, we can use the pattern we found to find $f(100)$:

- $f(25) = 2f(12.5) + 1 = 2*97 + 1 = 195$.
- $f(50) = 4*f(12.5) + 3 = 4*97 + 3 = 391$.
- $f(100) = 8*f(12.5) + 7 = 8*97 + 7 = 783$.

However, this value is not equal to 793, which we calculated earlier. We must have made a mistake in our calculations. Let's go back and recheck our work.

After rechecking our calculations, we find that the pattern we found was incorrect. The correct pattern should be:

- $f(2n) = 2f(n)$.
- $f(n) = \frac{f(2n)}{2}$.

Now, let's try again:

- $f(12.5) = \frac{f(25)}{2} = \frac{195}{2} = 97.5$, which is not an integer. This indicates that our assumption that $f(1) = 1$ is incorrect.
- Let's try another base case. If we assume $f(1) = 0$, then $f(2) = 2f(1) = 0$, and $f(4) = 2f(2) = 0$, and so on. We can see that $f(n) = 0$ for all powers of 2.
- Now, let's try to find $f(3)$ using the second equation. We get $f(6) = 2f(3)$, and since $f(6)$ is a power of 2 (which we found to be 0), we have $0 = 2f(3)$, which implies $f(3) = 0$.
- Similarly, we can find that $f(n) = 0$ for all odd numbers.
- Now, let's try to find $f(100)$. We can write $100$ as $2^2*5^2$. From the first equation, we have $f(f(f(100)))=8*100-7=793$.
- Since $f(100)$ is even, $f(f(f(100)))$ must also be even. But we know that $f(f(f(100)))=793$, which is odd. This contradiction means our assumption that $f(1) = 0$ was incorrect.
- Let's try another base case. If we assume $f(1) = 1$, then $f(2) = 2f(1) + 1 = 3$, and $f(4) = 2f(2) + 1 = 7$, and so on. We can see that $f(2^n) = 2^n + 1$ for all powers of 2.
- Now, let's try to find $f(3)$ using the second equation. We get $f(6) = 2f(3) + 1$, and since $f(6) = 7$, we have $7 = 2f(3) +

Solve the following problem with a Python Script (positive numerical answer):
"A function $f: \mathbb N \to \mathbb N$ satisfies the following two conditions for all positive integers $n$:$f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$ and $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$. Calculate $f(100)$."

Assistant:

Approach:

 We can start by calculating $f(100)$ by using the second given condition. Since $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$, we can set $n=50$ to find $f(100)$: $f(100)=2f(50)+1$. However, we need to find $f(50)$ first. Again using the second condition, we have $f(50)=2f(25)+1$. Now, we need to find $f(25)$. 
We can apply the first given condition on $n=12.5$ (since $f(25)$ must be a positive integer, it won't be of the form $8n-7$), and we get $f(f(f(12.5)))=8(12.5)-7=93$. But we know that $f(f(f(12.5)))=f(f(25))$, and thus $f(f(25))=93$. Again using the second condition, we have $f(f(25))=2f(f(12.5))+1$. Substituting $f(f(25))=93$ we get $93=2f(f(12.5))+1$. So $f(f(12.5))=\frac{92}{2}=46$. But $f(f(12.5))=f(25)$, so we have $f(25)=46$. Now we can find $f(50)$: $f(50)=2f(25)+1=2(46)+1=93$. Finally, we can find $f(100)$: $f(100)=2f(50)+1=2(93)+1=187$.

Therefore, $f(100) = 187$.

The answer is: $187$.

Approach:



To solve this problem, we can use a trial and error approach by calculating the function for small values of $n$ and look for a pattern. Let's start with $n=1$.

From the second condition, we have $f(2) = 2f(1) + 1$. Now we can substitute $f(1)$ from the first condition of $f(f(f(1))) = 8*1 - 7 = -1$. Since $f$ is a function from $\mathbb{N}$ to $\mathbb{N}$, it cannot return a negative value. This means that our trial and error approach does not yield the correct function.

Let's try another approach. We can guess a function that satisfies both conditions and check if it works. A natural guess is $f(n) = 2n - 1$. Let's check if it works:

1. For the first condition, we have $f(f(f(n))) = f(f(2n-1)) = f(2(2n-1)-1) = f(4n-3) = 8n-7$.
2. For the second condition, we have $f(2n) = 2(2n-1) + 1 = 4n - 1 = 2f(n) + 1$.

So, the function $f(n) = 2n - 1$ satisfies both conditions. Now we can calculate $f(100)$ using this function: $f(100) = 2*100 - 1 = 199$.
The answer is: $\boxed{199}$.

Approach:


This problem is a functional equation problem, and it can be solved by iteration and substitution. First, we can use the second equation to simplify the first equation. Then we can use the simplified first equation to solve for $f(100)$.

First, set $n=2$ in the second equation to get $f(4) = 2f(2) + 1$. Then set $n=f(2)$ in the first equation to get $f(f(f(f(2)))) = 8f(2) - 7$. By the second equation, $f(f(f(f(2)))) = f(f(f(4))) = f(8)$, so we have $f(8) = 8f(2) - 7$. Combining this with $f(4) = 2f(2) + 1$, we get $f(8) = 8(f(4) - 1)/2 - 7 = 4f(4) - 8 - 7 = 4(2f(2) + 1) - 15 = 8f(2) - 11$. Equating this to $f(8)$ from the first equation gives $8f(2) - 11 = 8f(2) - 7$, so $f(2) = 1$. Then from the second equation we get $f(4) = 2f(2) + 1 = 3$, $f(8) = 8f(2) - 7 = 1$, $f(16) = 8f(4) - 7 = 15$, and so on. After some iterations, we can guess the general form of $f(2^k)$: it seems that $f(2^k) = 1$ if $k$ is odd, and $f(2^k) = 2^{k-1} + 1$ if $k$ is even. To confirm this, we can use induction. The base cases $k=1,2,3$ have already been verified. Assuming the formula holds for $k$, we want to show it holds for $k+1$. If $k$ is even, then $k+1$ is odd, and $f(2^{k+1}) = f(2 \cdot 2^k) = 2f(2^k) + 1 = 2(2^{k-1} + 1) + 1 = 2^k + 1$, which is consistent with our formula. If $k$ is odd, then $k+1$ is even, and $f(2^{k+1}) = f(2 \cdot 2^k) = 2f(2^k) = 2 \cdot 1 = 2$, which is also consistent with our formula. Thus, our formula holds for all positive integers $k$. In particular, $f(100) = f(2^6 \cdot 5^2) = f(2^6) = 2^{6-1} + 1 = 31$. So $f(100) = 31$.
The answer is: $31$

Solve the following problem with a Python Script (positive numerical answer):
"A function $f: \mathbb N \to \mathbb N$ satisfies the following two conditions for all positive integers $n$:$f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$ and $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$. Calculate $f(100)$."
Write comments to indicate the steps you take. Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Assistant:

Approach:


We can start by calculating $f(100)$ by using the given functional equation $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$.
First, let's find $f(50)$:
$f(2*50)=2f(50)+1 \implies f(100)=2f(50)+1$.
Then, let's find $f(25)$:
$f(2*25)=2f(25)+1 \implies f(50)=2f(25)+1$.
Continuing this process, we can keep finding smaller values of $f(n)$ until we reach $f(1)$, for which we can use the equation $f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$.
Once we find $f(1)$, we can use the equation $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$ to find $f(2)$, $f(4)$, and so on, up to $f(100)$.

However, it is important to note that this method might be time-consuming and not very efficient. Therefore, a more systematic approach would be to use a recursive function in a programming language to calculate $f(100)$ using the given functional equations.

For example, in Python, we can write a function that recursively calculates $f(n)$ based on the given functional equations:

```python


INTERMEDIATE OUT :

def f(n):
    if n == 1:
        return 1
    elif n % 2 == 0:
        return 2 * f(n // 2) + 1
    else:
        return 8 * (n - 1) // 7

result = f(100)
print(result)
```

CODE RESULTS 111

INTERMEDIATE OUT :
```output
111
```
The answer is $\boxed{111}$.

Approach:


We can solve this problem by applying the second condition iteratively.
First, apply the second condition to $f(f(f(100))) = 8 \cdot 100 - 7 = 793$.
So, $f(f(100)) = 793$.
Now, apply the second condition again to $f(f(100)) = 793$.
This gives $f(100) = f(793)$.
Again, apply the second condition to get $f(100) = f(793) = 2f(396.5) + 1$.
Since $f$ is defined only for natural numbers, $f(396.5)$ is undefined.
This implies that we made an error in our reasoning.

Let's reconsider the problem and apply the second condition directly to $f(100)$.
Since we want to find $f(100)$, we can start with $f(2 \cdot 50) = 2f(50) + 1$.
Then, apply the second condition again to get $f(50) = f(25)$.
Again, apply the second condition to get $f(25) = f(12.5)$.
Again, this is undefined because $f$ is only defined for natural numbers.
Let's try a different approach.

Notice that the equation $f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$ gives us the value of $f(f(f(n)))$ for any positive integer $n$.
Let's try plugging in $n = 1$ to get $f(f(f(1))) = 8 \cdot 1 - 7 = 1$.
Since $f(f(f(1))) = 1$, this implies that $f(1) = 1$.
Now, we can use this to find $f(100)$ by repeatedly applying the second condition.
\begin{align*}
f(100) &= f(2 \cdot 50) = 2f(50) + 1 \\
f(50) &= f(2 \cdot 25) = 2f(25) + 1 \\
f(25) &= f(2 \cdot 12.5) = 2f(12.5) + 1 \\
f(12.5) &= f(2 \cdot 6.25) = 2f(6.25) + 1 \\
&\ \vdots \\
f(1) &= 1.
\end{align*}

From this, we can see that we can apply the second condition repeatedly to find $f(100)$.

Let's compute $f(100)$:
\begin{align*}
f(100) &= 2f(50) + 1 \\
&= 2(2f(25) + 1) + 1 \\
&= 2(2(2f(12.5) + 1) + 1) + 1 \\
&\ \vdots \\
&= 2^{6}f(1) + 2^{5} + 2^{4} + 2^{3} + 2^{2} + 2 + 1 \\
&= 64 + 32 + 16 + 8 + 4 + 2 + 1 \\
&= 127.
\end{align*}

Therefore, $f(100) = 127$. The answer is: $127$

Solve the following problem with a Python Script (positive numerical answer):
"A function $f: \mathbb N \to \mathbb N$ satisfies the following two conditions for all positive integers $n$:$f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$ and $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$. Calculate $f(100)$."

Assistant:

Approach:

 We will solve this problem by using the second given condition $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$ to simplify the expression for $f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$. Then, we will find a pattern in the function $f$ and use it to calculate $f(100)$.

First, let's use the second condition to simplify $f(f(f(n)))$:

$f(f(f(n)))=f(2f(f(n)) - 1)$.
Now apply the second condition again,
$f(f(f(n)))=f(2(2f(n) - 1) - 1)$,
which simplifies to
$f(f(f(n)))=f(4f(n) - 3)$.

Now, apply the second condition one more time:
$f(f(f(n)))=2(4f(n) - 3) - 1$,
which simplifies to
$f(f(f(n)))=8f(n) - 7$.

So, we have $f(f(f(n)))=8f(n) - 7$.

Comparing this with the given $f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$, we can conclude that $f(n)=n$ for all positive integers $n$. This is because both expressions give the same result when $n$ is substituted in for $f(n)$.

Now, we can find $f(100)$ by substituting $n=100$ into the function $f(n)=n$:

$f(100)=100$.
The answer is: $100$

Approach:



We start with the given functional equations and try to deduce some simple steps to calculate $f(100)$.

We know that $f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$. If we let $m = f(n)$, we can rewrite the equation as $f(f(m)) = 8n - 7$.

Similarly, we can also let $k = f(m)$, and we get $f(k) = 8n - 7$. This means $k = f(f(f(n))) = 8n - 7$.

Now we apply the second given equation, $f(2n) = 2f(n) + 1$. By setting $n = f(n)$, we can get $f(2f(n)) = 2f(f(n)) + 1$.

In other words, $f(2m) = 2k + 1$. But we know that $k = 8n - 7$, so we have $f(2m) = 2(8n - 7) + 1 = 16n - 14 + 1 = 16n - 13$.

However, we also have $f(2n) = 2f(n) + 1$. So we must have $16n - 13 = 2f(n) + 1$. Solving for $f(n)$, we get $f(n) = \frac{16n - 14}{2} = 8n - 7$.

Now we substitute $n = 100$ into $f(n) = 8n - 7$ to find $f(100) = 8 \times 100 - 7 = 800 - 7 = 793$.

So, the value of $f(100)$ is 793. The answer is: $793$

Approach:


We will try to find the value of $f(100)$ by using the given functional equations. 

First, let's find the value of $f(f(100))$. We know that $f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$, so $f(f(100)) = 8*100 - 7 = 793$.

Next, we want to find the value of $f(793)$. We know that $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$, so we can substitute $n=f(100)/2 = 793/2 = 396.5$, which is not an integer, so this equation does not help us directly.

However, we notice that if we can find an integer $n$ such that $f(n) = 793$, then $f(f(n)) = f(793)$. 

Let's try to find such an integer $n$. We know that $f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$, so if we can find an $n$ such that $8n-7 = 793$, then $f(n) = 793$. 

Setting $8n - 7 = 793$, we solve for $n$:
\[8n = 793 + 7 = 800 \implies n = \frac{800}{8} = 100.\]

So $f(100) = 793$.

Now, we want to find $f(793)$. We know that $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$. 

If we substitute $n=793/2 = 396.5$, which is not an integer, so this equation does not help us directly.

However, we notice that if we can find an integer $m$ such that $f(m) = 793$, then $f(f(m)) = f(793)$. 

Let's try to find such an integer $m$. We know that $f(f(f(m)))=8m-7$, so if we can find an $m$ such that $8m - 7 = 793$, then $f(m) = 793$. 

Setting $8m - 7 = 793$, we solve for $m$:
\[8m = 793 + 7 = 800 \implies m = \frac{800}{8} = 100.\]

So $f(100) = 793$. Now we want to find $f(793)$. 

Using the equation $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$, we substitute $n=396.5$, which is not an integer, so this equation does not help us directly. 

However, we notice that if we can find an integer $k$ such that $f(k) = 793$, then $f(f(k)) = f(793)$. 

Let's try to find such an integer $k$. We know that $f(f(f(k)))=8k-7$, so if we can find an $k$ such that $8k - 7 = 793$, then $f(k) = 793$. 

Setting $8k - 7 = 793$, we solve for $k$:
\[8k = 793 + 7 = 800 \implies k = \frac{800}{8} = 100.\]

So $f(100) = 793$. 

Now we want to find $f(793)$. We notice that $793 = f(100)$, so $f(793) = f(f(100)) = f(793)$. This means that $f(793) = 793$.

Finally, we want to find $f(f(793))$, which is $f(793)$. We found that $f(793) = 793$.

So the value of $f(100)$ is $793$. The answer is: $793$

Approach:


We can start by substituting $n = 1$ into the equation $f(f(f(n))) = 8n - 7$ to find the value of $f(1)$.
Substituting $n = 1$ gives us $f(f(f(1))) = 8*1 - 7 = 1$, so $f(f(f(1))) = 1$.
Since $f(f(f(1))) = 1$, we know that $f(1)$ is the number that when plugged into the function three times gives 1. Let's call this number $x$, so $f(x) = 1$. From the second condition, we know that $f(2) = 2f(1) + 1 = 2*1 + 1 = 3$.
Now we can substitute $n = 2$ into the second condition $f(2n) = 2f(n) + 1$ to find $f(4)$:
$f(4) = 2f(2) + 1 = 2*3 + 1 = 7$.
Similarly, $f(8) = 2f(4) + 1 = 2*7 + 1 = 15$, $f(16) = 2f(8) + 1 = 2*15 + 1 = 31$, and so on.
By observing this pattern, we can see that $f(2^k) = 2^k - 1$ for all positive integers $k$.
Now we want to find $f(100)$. Since $100 = 2^2 * 5^2$, we can use the second condition repeatedly to find $f(100)$.
First, $f(100) = f(2^2 * 5^2) = 2f(2^2 * 5) + 1 = 2[2f(2^2 * 5/2) + 1] + 1 = 2[2f(2^2 * 5/4) + 1] + 1 = 2[2f(2^2 * 5/8) + 1] + 1 = \dots = 2^4 * f(5)$.
Next, we need to find $f(5)$. Since $5 = 2^0 * 5$, we have $f(5) = 2f(2^0 * 5/2) + 1 = 2f(2^0 * 5/4) + 1 = \dots = 2^3 * f(1)$.
Finally, $f(1)$ is the number we found earlier that satisfies $f(x) = 1$, so $f(1) = 1$.
Therefore, $f(5) = 2^3 * f(1) = 2^3 * 1 = 8$.
Now we can substitute this back into the equation for $f(100)$:
$f(100) = 2^4 * f(5) = 2^4 * 8 = 16 * 8 = 128$.
So, $f(100) = 128$.
The value of $f(100)$ is 128. The answer is: $128$

Approach:

 We will use the second equation repeatedly to simplify the first equation until it becomes simpler to solve.

Start with the equation $f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$.

Substitute $f(n)$ with $2f\left(\frac{n}{2}\right) + 1$ (from the second equation where $n$ is replaced with $\frac{n}{2}$), we get:

$f(f(2f\left(\frac{n}{2}\right) + 1)) = 8n - 7$.

Further simplify the left side using the second equation:

$f(2f\left(f\left(\frac{n}{2}\right)\right) + 1) = 8n - 7$.

Now substitute $f\left(\frac{n}{2}\right)$ with $2f\left(\frac{n}{4}\right) + 1$ (from the second equation where $n$ is replaced with $\frac{n}{4}$):

$f(2(2f\left(\frac{n}{4}\right) + 1) + 1) = 8n - 7$.

Simplify the equation:

$f(4f\left(\frac{n}{4}\right) + 3) = 8n - 7$.

Let's denote $f\left(\frac{n}{4}\right)$ as $m$. Then we have:

$f(4m + 3) = 8\left(\frac{n}{4}\right) - 7$.

Simplify the right side:

$f(4m + 3) = 2n - 7$.

Now we have a simpler equation, but still not easy to solve directly. However, from the second equation $f(2n) = 2f(n) + 1$, we can guess that $f(n) = n + 1$ might be a solution. Let's check if it works.

If $f(n) = n + 1$, then $f(4m + 3) = 4m + 4 = 2n - 7$. Solving for $n$, we get:

$2n = 4m + 7 + 4 = 4m + 11$,

$n = 2m + \frac{11}{2}$.

But $n$ must be an integer, and $\frac{11}{2}$ is not an integer. So our initial guess $f(n) = n + 1$ is incorrect.

However, if we modify our guess to $f(n) = 2n - 1$, we have:

$f(4m + 3) = 2(4m + 3) - 1 = 8m + 5$.

On the other hand, $2n - 7 = 2(2m + 3) - 7 = 4m + 6 - 7 = 8m - 1$.

So we have $8m + 5 = 8m - 1$. This equality is true, confirming our guess that $f(n) = 2n - 1$ is a solution to the first equation.

Finally, to find $f(100)$, just substitute $n = 100$ into our solution $f(n) = 2n - 1$:

$f(100) = 2 \cdot 100 - 1 = 199$.

So, $f(100) = 199$. The answer is: $\boxed{199}$.

Assistant:

Approach:


To find $f(100)$, we can use the second equation from the problem statement: $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$. 

First, we apply this equation to $n=50$ to find $f(100)$:
\[f(100) = 2f(50) + 1.\]
Next, we apply the equation to $n=25$ to find $f(50)$:
\[f(50) = 2f(25) + 1.\]

Continuing this process, we need to find the value of $f$ at $n=12.5$. However, this is not a valid input for the function $f$, since it's not a positive integer. So, we need to look for another way to find $f(25)$.

We know that $f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$. Applying this equation to $n=25$, we have:
\[f(f(f(25))) = 8*25 - 7 = 200 - 7 = 193.\]

From the problem statement, we know that $f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$, so we have:
\[f(f(f(25))) = 193 \implies f(f(x)) = 193 \text{ for some } x.\]

But we know that $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$, so we can write $x = f(y)$ for some $y$. Then we have:
\[f(f(y)) = 193.\]

Again using the equation $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$, we can write $y = f(z)$ for some $z$. Then we have:
\[f(f(z)) = 193.\]

Now, we can try to find a value of $z$ such that $f(f(z)) = 193$. We know that $f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$, so we can write:
\[193 = f(f(z)) = 8z - 7.\]

Solving for $z$, we get:
\[8z = 193 + 7 = 200 \implies z = \frac{200}{8} = 25.\]

So, we have found that $z = 25$. Now we can substitute this value into the equation $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$ to find the value of $f(25)$:
\[f(50) = 2f(25) + 1.\]

We know that $f(25) = z = 25$, so we have:
\[f(50) = 2*25 + 1 = 50 + 1 = 51.\]

Now we can substitute this value into the equation $f(100) = 2f(50) + 1$ to find the value of $f(100)$:
\[f(100) = 2*51 + 1 = 102 + 1 = 103.\]

So, the value of $f(100)$ is $103$.
The answer is: $\boxed{103}$
