Approach:


The given equation is a product of two expressions equal to zero, which means either of the expressions must be zero for the product to be zero. Therefore, we can solve the equation by setting each expression equal to zero and finding the corresponding values of x and y.

The equations are:
1. $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$
2. $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$
3. $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$
4. $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$

Setting each equation to zero gives:
1. $\vert x + y \vert = 10$
2. $\vert x - y \vert = 10$
3. $\vert x \vert = 8$
4. $\vert y \vert = 8$

From equations 3 and 4, we can deduce that the values of x and y are either 8 or -8.

From equations 1 and 2, we can deduce that the values of x and y must satisfy the conditions:
1. $x + y = 10$ or $x + y = -10$
2. $x - y = 10$ or $x - y = -10$

Solving these systems of equations gives us the vertices of the polygon:
$(8, 2)$, $(8, -2)$, $(-8, 2)$, and $(-8, -2)$.

The polygon is a square with side length 16. The area of a square is given by the square of the length of its side, so the area of this square is $16^2 = 256$.
The answer is: $256$

The equation $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + (\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ implies that $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. This means that the points $(x, y)$ lie on the lines $x + y = 10$ and $x - y = 10$ or their opposites. Similarly, the equation $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + (\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ implies that $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$, so the points $(x, y)$ lie on the lines $x = 8$ and $y = 8$ or their opposites. The intersections of these lines form a square with side length 10 (since the distance between $x + y = 10$ and $x - y = 10$ is 10, and the distance between $x = 8$ and $y = 8$ is 8).
The area of this square is side length squared, so the area is $10^2 = 100$. The answer is: $100$

Solve the following problem with a Python Script (positive numerical answer):
"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"

Approach:



The equation given is a product of two expressions equal to zero. This means that either the first expression is zero or the second expression is zero. 

So, we have two cases to consider:

1. $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$
2. $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$

For the first case, $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$, this can only happen if both terms are zero. This means that $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. Solving these equations gives us the vertices of a square with side length 10.

For the second case, $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$, this can only happen if both terms are zero. This means that $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$. Solving these equations gives us the vertices of a square with side length 16.

The area of the convex polygon is the sum of the areas of the two squares. The area of a square is given by side length squared, so the area of the first square is $10^2 = 100$ and the area of the second square is $16^2 = 256$. Adding these two areas gives the total area of the convex polygon: $100 + 256 = 356$.

So, the area of the convex polygon is 356. The answer is: $356$

Approach:

 The equation given in the problem is a product of two expressions equal to zero. This means that either the first expression is zero or the second expression is zero. We can analyze each case separately.

Case 1: $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$
For the sum of two squares to be zero, both squares must be zero. So we have:
$\vert x + y \vert - 10 = 0$ and $\vert x - y \vert - 10 = 0$
which simplifies to $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$.
This means that the points $(x, y)$ must lie on the lines $x + y = 10$ and $x - y = 10$.

Case 2: $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$
Similarly, for the sum of two squares to be zero, both squares must be zero. So we have:
$\vert x \vert - 8 = 0$ and $\vert y \vert - 8 = 0$
which simplifies to $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$.
This means that the points $(x, y)$ must lie on the lines $x = 8$ and $y = 8$.

Combining the results from both cases, the points $(x, y)$ that satisfy the equation are those that lie on the square with vertices at $(8, 8)$, $(-8, 8)$, $(-8, -8)$, and $(8, -8)$.

The side length of this square is $16$ (from $8$ to $-8$ along any axis), so the area of the square is $16^2 = 256$.

Therefore, the area of the convex polygon formed by the points that satisfy the given equation is $256$. The answer is: $256$

Solve the following problem with a Python Script (positive numerical answer):
"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"

Approach:

 The equation given is a product of two expressions equal to zero, so either one of the expressions must be zero for the entire equation to hold true. This gives us two systems of equations to solve:
1. $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ and $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$
2. $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ and $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$

For each system, setting the squared expressions to zero gives us:
1. $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x \vert = 8$
2. $\vert x - y \vert = 10$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$

These absolute value equations give us the following four systems of linear equations:
1.1. $x + y = 10$ and $x = 8$
1.2. $x + y = -10$ and $x = 8$
1.3. $-x - y = 10$ and $x = 8$
1.4. $-x - y = -10$ and $x = 8$
2.1. $x - y = 10$ and $y = 8$
2.2. $x - y = -10$ and $y = 8$
2.3. $-x + y = 10$ and $y = 8$
2.4. $-x + y = -10$ and $y = 8$

Solving each system of equations gives us the following vertices of the polygon:
1.1. $(8, 2)$
1.2. $(8, -18)$
1.3. $(8, 18)$
1.4. $(8, -2)$
2.1. $(18, 8)$
2.2. $(-18, 8)$
2.3. $(-2, 8)$
2.4. $(2, 8)$

The polygon is a square with side length 16. To find the area, we simply square the side length: $16^2 = 256$. The area of the polygon is 256 square units.
The answer is: $256$

Solve the following problem with a Python Script (positive numerical answer):
"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"
Write comments to indicate the steps you take. Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Assistant:

Approach:


The given equation is of the form $(A)(B) = 0$, so either $A = 0$ or $B = 0$. This gives us two sets of equations to solve:
1. $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$
2. $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$
For the first set of equations, we have $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. This gives us four lines in the coordinate plane: $x + y = 10$, $x + y = -10$, $x - y = 10$, and $x - y = -10$. These lines form a square with side length 10.
For the second set of equations, we have $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$. This gives us four lines in the coordinate plane: $x = 8$, $x = -8$, $y = 8$, and $y = -8$. These lines form a square with side length 16.
The intersection of these two squares is the convex polygon we are looking for. The side length of this square is the minimum of the side lengths of the two squares, which is 10. Therefore, the area of the convex polygon is $10^2 = 100$.

The answer is: $100$

Solve the following problem with a Python Script (positive numerical answer):
"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"
Write comments to indicate the steps you take. Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Assistant:

Approach:



The given equation is $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + (\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + (\vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$. For the product of two numbers to be zero, either one of the numbers must be zero. Therefore, we have two cases to consider:

1. $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + (\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2) = 0$. This implies that $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. These two equations represent two lines in the coordinate plane, which are the perpendicular bisectors of the line segments joining the points $(10,0)$ and $(-10,0)$, and $(0,10)$ and $(0,-10)$ respectively. The intersection of these lines forms a square with side length $20$.

2. $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + (\vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$. This implies that $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$, which represents a square with side length $16$.

Therefore, the points satisfying the given equation form a square with side length $20$, and another square with side length $16$. The total area of the convex polygon formed by these points is the sum of the areas of these two squares.

Solution:

The area of a square with side length $a$ is $a^2$. So, the area of the square with side length $20$ is $20^2 = 400$, and the area of the square with side length $16$ is $16^2 = 256$. The total area of the convex polygon is $400 + 256 = 656$. The answer is: $656$

Write comments to indicate the steps you take. Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Assistant:

Approach:

 The equation is satisfied if either $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$. This means that either $\vert x + y \vert = 10$, $\vert x - y \vert = 10$, $\vert x \vert = 8$ or $\vert y \vert = 8$. These equations describe a square with side length 16. The area of this square is $16^2 = 256$.

So the area of the convex polygon is 256.

```python


INTERMEDIATE OUT :

def polygon_area():
    side_length = 16
    area = side_length ** 2
    return area

result = polygon_area()
print(result)
```

CODE RESULTS 256

INTERMEDIATE OUT :
```output
256
```
The area of the convex polygon is $256$. The answer is $\boxed{256}$.
