Approach:



To solve this problem, we will use the Cauchy-Schwarz inequality. First, we rewrite the expression $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ as $(x-2y)^2 + (y-2x)^2$. Then we apply the Cauchy-Schwarz inequality to the terms $|x-2y|$ and $|y-2x|$.

Cauchy-Schwarz inequality states that for any real numbers $a_1, a_2, ..., a_n$ and $b_1, b_2, ..., b_n$, we have $(a_1b_1 + a_2b_2 + ... + a_nb_n)^2 \leq (a_1^2 + a_2^2 + ... + a_n^2)(b_1^2 + b_2^2 + ... + b_n^2)$.

In our case, we can let $a_1 = x - 2y$, $a_2 = y - 2x$, $b_1 = 1$, and $b_2 = 1$. Then we have:

$$(x - 2y)^2 + (y - 2x)^2 \geq \frac{(|x - 2y| + |y - 2x|)^2}{2}.$$

Since $|x - 2y| + |y - 2x| = 40$, we can substitute this into the inequality:

$$5x^2 + 5y^2 - 8xy \geq \frac{40^2}{2} = 800.$$

So the minimum value of $5x^2 + 5y^2 - 8xy$ is 800.

The answer is: $800$.

Approach:


To find the minimum value of the function $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ subject to the constraint $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$, we can use the method of Lagrange multipliers. Let $f(x, y) = 5x^2 + 5y^2 - 8xy$ and $g(x, y) = |x - 2y| + |y - 2x| - 40$. We want to find the points $(x, y)$ where the gradient of $f$ is a scalar multiple of the gradient of $g$. That is, we want to find $(x, y)$ such that $\nabla f(x, y) = \lambda \nabla g(x, y)$ for some scalar $\lambda$.

Calculating the gradients, we have:
\[\nabla f(x, y) = \begin{bmatrix} 10x - 8y \\ 10y - 8x \end{bmatrix}\]
\[\nabla g(x, y) = \begin{bmatrix} -1 \\ -1 \end{bmatrix}\] or \[\nabla g(x, y) = \begin{bmatrix} 1 \\ -2 \end{bmatrix}\] or \[\nabla g(x, y) = \begin{bmatrix} -1 \\ 2 \end{bmatrix}\] or \[\nabla g(x, y) = \begin{bmatrix} 1 \\ 1 \end{bmatrix}\]

Depending on the region of the plane, the gradient of $g$ will be one of these four vectors. We can analyze each case separately.

Case 1: $\nabla g(x, y) = \begin{bmatrix} -1 \\ -1 \end{bmatrix}$
In this case, we have $10x - 8y = -\lambda$ and $10y - 8x = -\lambda$. Solving this system of equations, we find $x = y$. Substituting into the constraint equation, we get $|x - 2x| + |x - 2x| = 40$, which simplifies to $|x| + |-x| = 40$. This gives $2|x| = 40$, so $|x| = 20$. Thus, $x = \pm 20$. Since $x = y$, we have two candidate points: $(20, 20)$ and $(-20, -20)$.

Case 2: $\nabla g(x, y) = \begin{bmatrix} 1 \\ -2 \end{bmatrix}$
In this case, we have $10x - 8y = \lambda$ and $10y - 8x = -2\lambda$. Solving this system of equations, we find $x = \frac{4}{3}y$. Substituting into the constraint equation, we get $|x - 2y| + |\frac{4}{3}y - 2x| = 40$. After simplifying, we find $|x - 2y| + |\frac{4}{3}y - 2x| = 40$ simplifies to $2|y| = 40$, so $|y| = 20$. Thus, $y = \pm 20$. Since $x = \frac{4}{3}y$, we have two candidate points: $(\frac{4}{3}(20), 20) = (\frac{80}{3}, 20)$ and $(\frac{4}{3}(-20), -20) = (-\frac{80}{3}, -20)$.

Case 3: $\nabla g(x, y) = \begin{bmatrix} -1 \\ 2 \end{bmatrix}$
This case is symmetric to Case 2 and gives the same candidate points: $(\frac{4}{3}(20), 20) = (\frac{80}{3}, 20)$ and $(\frac{4}{3}(-20), -20) = (-\frac{80}{3}, -20)$.

Case 4: $\nabla g(x, y) = \begin{bmatrix} 1 \\ 1 \end{bmatrix}$
In this case, we have $10x - 8y = \lambda$ and $10y - 8x = \lambda$. Solving this system of equations, we find $x = y$. This is the same as Case 1, so we already have the candidate points $(20, 20)$ and $(-20, -20)$.

Now we evaluate $f(x, y)$ at each candidate point:
$f(20, 20) = 5(20^2) + 5(20^2) - 8(20)(20) = 2000$.
$f(-20, -20) = 2000$.
$f(\frac{80}{3}, 20) = 5(\frac{80}{3})^2 + 5(20^2) - 8(\frac{80}{3})(20) = 1066.\overline{6}$.
$f(-\frac{80}{3}, -20) = 1066.\overline{6}$.

Therefore, the minimum value of $f(x, y)$ subject to the constraint is $1066.\overline{6}$. However, this is not an integer. Let's check our work.

We made a mistake in our analysis of the cases. When $\nabla g(x, y) = \begin{bmatrix} 1 \\ -2 \end{bmatrix}$ or $\nabla g(x, y) = \begin{bmatrix} -1 \\ 2 \end{bmatrix}$, we should have found that $x = -\frac{4}{3}y$. This gives the candidate points $(\frac{4}{3}(-20), 20) = (-\frac{80}{3}, 20)$ and $(\frac{4}{3}(20), -20) = (\frac{80}{3}, -20)$. Evaluating $f(x, y)$ at these points, we get:
$f(-\frac{80}{3}, 20) = 1066.\overline{6}$.
$f(\frac{80}{3}, -20) = 1066.\overline{6}$.

Now all candidate points give integer values of $f(x, y)$: $f(20, 20) = 2000$, $f(-20, -20) = 2000$, $f(\frac{80}{3}, 20) = 1066.\overline{6}$, $f(-\frac{80}{3}, 20) = 1066.\overline{6}$, $f(\frac{80}{3}, -20) = 1066.\overline{6}$, and $f(-\frac{80}{3}, -20) = 1066.\overline{6}$.

The minimum value of $f(x, y)$ subject to the constraint is thus $1066.\

Approach:



First, we need to find the relationship between $x$ and $y$ from the equation $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$. This equation simplifies to $|x-2y| + |2y-x| = 40$.

Since $|a| = |-a|$, we can rewrite this as $|x-2y| = |2y-x|$. This implies that $x-2y = 2y-x$ or $x-2y = -(2y-x)$.

Solving the first equation $x-2y = 2y-x$ gives $x = 2y$. Substituting this into the second equation $x-2y = -(2y-x)$ gives $x = y$.

So, the relationship between $x$ and $y$ is $x = y$.

Next, we substitute $x = y$ into the expression $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ to get $5x^2+5x^2-8x^2 = 2x^2$.

To minimize this expression, we need to minimize $x^2$. Since $x = y$, we can use the constraint equation $|x-2x| + |x-2x| = 40$, which simplifies to $|x| + |-x| = 40$. This implies $2|x| = 40$, so $|x| = 20$.

Therefore, the minimum value of $x^2$ is $0$ when $x = 0$.

Finally, we substitute $x = 0$ into the expression $2x^2$ to get $2(0)^2 = 0$.

So, the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ is $0$. The answer is: $0$

This problem is a bit tricky because we need to find the minimum value of a function under a constraint. One way to approach this problem is to use the method of Lagrange multipliers. However, this method can be quite complicated for this problem. Instead, we can observe that the constraint $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$ is equivalent to $x = y = \pm 10$. This can be verified by checking that only these values satisfy the constraint.

Now, we substitute $x = y = 10$ into the function $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ to get $5(10)^2+5(10)^2-8(10)(10) = 500+500-800 = 200$.

Similarly, we substitute $x = y = -10$ into the function to get $5(-10)^2+5(-10)^2-8(-10)(-10) = 500+500-800 = 200$.

Therefore, the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ is $200$. The answer is: $200$

First, we note that the function $f(x, y) = 5x^2 + 5y^2 - 8xy$ can be rewritten as:

\[f(x, y) = (5x^2 - 8xy + 5y^2) = (x - y)^2 + 4xy.\]

We want to minimize this function subject to the constraint $|x - 2y| + |y - 2x| = 40$.

The constraint can be rewritten as $|x - 2y| + |2y - x| = 40$, which implies $|x - 2y| = |2y - x| = 20$. This further implies $x - 2y = \pm 20$ and $2y - x = \pm 20$.

Solving these equations, we find two possible solutions: $(x, y) = (20, 0)$ and $(x, y) = (0, 20)$.

Now we substitute these values into the function $f(x, y)$:

\[f(20, 0) = (20 - 0)^2 + 4 \cdot 20 \cdot 0 = 400,\]
\[f(0, 20) = (0 - 20)^2 + 4 \cdot 0 \cdot 20 = 400.\]

So the minimum value of $f(x, y)$ is 400. The answer is: $400$

We will use the AM-GM inequality to solve this problem. The AM-GM inequality states that for any non-negative real numbers $a$ and $b$, we have $a+b \geq 2\sqrt{ab}$, and equality holds if and only if $a=b$.

First, let's rewrite the given equation $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$ as follows:
\[|x-2y| + |y-2x| = |x-2y| + |2y-x| = |x-2y| + |-1(x-2y)| = |x-2y| + |-1|\cdot |x-2y| = |x-2y| + |x-2y| = 2|x-2y|.\]
Therefore, we have $2|x-2y| = 40$, which simplifies to $|x-2y| = 20$. This implies that $x-2y = \pm 20$.

Now, let's substitute $x = 2y \pm 20$ into the expression $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ to find its minimum value.

When $x = 2y + 20$, we have:
\begin{align*}
5x^2+5y^2-8xy &= 5(2y+20)^2+5y^2-8(2y+20)y \\
&= 5(4y^2+80y+400)+5y^2-16y^2-160y \\
&= 20y^2+400y+2000+5y^2-16y^2-160y \\
&= -y^2+240y+2000.
\end{align*}
When $x = 2y - 20$, we have:
\begin{align*}
5x^2+5y^2-8xy &= 5(2y-20)^2+5y^2-8(2y-20)y \\
&= 5(4y^2-80y+400)+5y^2-16y^2+160y \\
&= 20y^2-400y+2000+5y^2-16y^2+160y \\
&= -y^2-240y+2000.
\end{align*}
Both of these expressions are quadratic functions with a negative leading coefficient, so they have a maximum value. To find the maximum value, we can find the vertex of the parabola.

For the function $-y^2+240y+2000$, the vertex is at $y = -\frac{240}{2(-1)} = 120$, and the maximum value is $-120^2+240\cdot120+2000 = -14400+28800+2000 = 14400+2000 = 16400$.

For the function $-y^2-240y+2000$, the vertex is at $y = -\frac{-240}{2(-1)} = -120$, but this is not a valid solution because $y$ must be a real number. Therefore, the maximum value of this function is not relevant to our problem.

So, the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ when $x$ and $y$ range over all real numbers such that $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$ is $16400$.
The answer is: $16400$

Solve the following problem with a Python Script (positive numerical answer):

Assistant:

Approach:


To solve this problem, we first need to recognize that the given equation $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$ is actually equivalent to $x = 2y$ or $y = 2x$. This is because the absolute value function $|a - b|$ can be interpreted as the distance between $a$ and $b$, and in this case, the sum of the distances between $x$ and $2y$, and $y$ and $2x$ is 40. This means that $x$ and $y$ must be related in one of the two ways mentioned above.

Next, we substitute $x = 2y$ or $y = 2x$ into the expression $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ and simplify.

Let's start with $x = 2y$:

$$5x^2+5y^2-8xy = 5(2y)^2 + 5y^2 - 8(2y)y = 20y^2 + 5y^2 - 16y^2 = 9y^2.$$

Now let's substitute $y = 2x$:

$$5x^2+5y^2-8xy = 5x^2 + 5(2x)^2 - 8x(2x) = 5x^2 + 20x^2 - 16x^2 = 9x^2.$$

Now we need to find the minimum value of $9y^2$ and $9x^2$. Since both expressions are always non-negative (since they are squares), the minimum value is achieved when $y = 0$ or $x = 0$. However, if $y = 0$, then $x = 2y = 0$, and if $x = 0$, then $y = 2x = 0$. This means that both $x$ and $y$ must be zero for the minimum value to be achieved.

Substitute $x = 0$ and $y = 0$ into either $9y^2$ or $9x^2$:

$$9y^2 = 9(0)^2 = 0,$$
$$9x^2 = 9(0)^2 = 0.$$

So the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ is 0.

The answer is: $0$

This problem is a bit complex, but it can be solved by using the inequality $|a| + |b| \geq |a + b|$ and the fact that $5x^2 + 5y^2 - 8xy = \frac{1}{2}((5x - 4y)^2 + (5y - 4x)^2)$.

First, we note that $|x - 2y| + |y - 2x| = |2y - x| + |2x - y| = |2(y - x) + (y - x)| = |3(y - x)| = 40$. This implies $|y - x| = \frac{40}{3}$.

Next, we use the inequality $|a| + |b| \geq |a + b|$ with $a = 5x - 4y$ and $b = 5y - 4x$. We have $|a| + |b| = |5x - 4y| + |5y - 4x| \geq |(5x - 4y) + (5y - 4x)| = |(5x - 4y + 5y - 4x)| = |x - y| = \frac{40}{3}$.

Then, we know that $5x^2 + 5y^2 - 8xy = \frac{1}{2}((5x - 4y)^2 + (5y - 4x)^2) \geq \frac{1}{2} \cdot \left(\frac{40}{3}\right)^2 = \frac{800}{9}$.

Therefore, the minimum value of $5x^2 + 5y^2 - 8xy$ is $\frac{800}{9}$.

Approach:



The first step is to simplify the given equation $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$.

We can rewrite it as $|x-2y| + |2y-x| = 40$, and then $|x-2y| - |x-2y| = 40$, which simplifies to $0 = 40$.

This is a contradiction, so there must be a mistake in our reasoning.

Let's go back and look at the original equation $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$.

Notice that $|x-2y| = |-(2y-x)| = |2y-x|$, so we can rewrite the equation as $|x-2y| + |x-2y| = 40$, which simplifies to $2|x-2y| = 40$.

Dividing both sides by 2 gives $|x-2y| = 20$.

Now, let's define a new variable $u = x-2y$. Then the equation $|x-2y| = 20$ becomes $|u| = 20$, which implies $u = 20$ or $u = -20$.

Substituting $u = x-2y$ back into the equation gives $x-2y = 20$ or $x-2y = -20$.

Now, let's substitute these equations into the expression $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$:

1. If $x-2y = 20$, then $x = 2y + 20$. Substituting this into the expression gives $5(2y+20)^2+5y^2-8(2y+20)y$.

2. If $x-2y = -20$, then $x = 2y - 20$. Substituting this into the expression gives $5(2y-20)^2+5y^2-8(2y-20)y$.

Now, we need to find the minimum value of these two expressions.

To do this, we can take the derivative of each expression with respect to $y$ and set it equal to zero to find the critical points.

After taking the derivative and setting it equal to zero, we can find that the minimum value of each expression occurs at the same value of $y$.

Let's call this common value of $y$ as $y_0$. Then we can substitute $y_0$ into the equation $x = 2y + 20$ (or $x = 2y - 20$) to find the corresponding value of $x$, which we'll call $x_0$.

Finally, we substitute $x_0$ and $y_0$ into the expression $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ to find the minimum value.

After doing all this, we find that the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ is -400.
The answer is: -400

Approach:


We first observe that the function $f(x, y) = 5x^2 + 5y^2 - 8xy$ can be rewritten as $f(x, y) = (5x^2 - 8xy + 5y^2) = (5x^2 - 10xy + 5y^2) + (3xy) = (5(x-y)^2) + (3xy)$.

Now, let's denote $u = x - y$ and $v = y - 2x$. Then we have $|u| + |v| = 40$. By the triangle inequality, we know that $|u| + |v| \geq |u - v|$. So, we have $|u - v| \leq 40$.

Also, note that $u - v = 3x - 3y = 3(x - y) = 3u$. So, $|3u| \leq 40$, which implies $|u| \leq \frac{40}{3}$.

Now, we want to minimize $f(x, y) = 5(x - y)^2 + 3xy = 5u^2 + 3(x - y)(y - 2x) = 5u^2 + 3uv = 5u^2 + 3u(2u + v) = 5u^2 + 6u^2 + 3uv = 11u^2 + 3uv$.

By AM-GM, we have $11u^2 + 3uv \geq 2\sqrt{11u^2 \cdot 3uv} = 2\sqrt{33u^3v}$. Since $|u| \leq \frac{40}{3}$ and $|v| \leq 40$, we have $|uv| \leq 40^2 = 1600$. So, $2\sqrt{33u^3v} \geq -2\sqrt{33 \cdot \frac{40}{3} \cdot 1600} = -2\sqrt{33 \cdot \frac{64000}{3}} = -2\sqrt{66 \cdot 6400} = -2 \cdot 80\sqrt{66} = -160\sqrt{66}$.

Therefore, the minimum value of $f(x, y)$ is $-160\sqrt{66}$. However, we made a mistake in the calculation. The correct approach is to use the Cauchy-Schwarz inequality.

By Cauchy-Schwarz, we have $(1^2 + 1^2)(5u^2 + 3uv) \geq (u + v)^2$, which implies $2(5u^2 + 3uv) \geq (u - v)^2 = 1600$. So, $5u^2 + 3uv \geq 800$.

Therefore, the minimum value of $f(x, y)$ is $800$. The answer is: $800$

Approach:


To find the minimum value of the expression $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ subject to the constraint $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$, we can use the method of Lagrange multipliers. We introduce a new variable $\lambda$ and form the function $F(x, y, \lambda) = 5x^2+5y^2-8xy + \lambda (|x-2y| + |y-2x| - 40)$.

Now we need to find the critical points of $F(x, y, \lambda)$ by setting its partial derivatives with respect to $x$, $y$, and $\lambda$ to zero:
$$\frac{\partial F}{\partial x} = 10x - 8y + \lambda(-1 + 2\text{sgn}(x-2y)) = 0,$$
$$\frac{\partial F}{\partial y} = 10y - 8x + \lambda(1 - 2\text{sgn}(y-2x)) = 0,$$
$$\frac{\partial F}{\partial \lambda} = |x-2y| + |y-2x| - 40 = 0.$$

The equations involving the signum functions are difficult to solve directly. However, we can use the fact that the constraint equation implies $|x-2y| = |y-2x|$, which means $x-2y = \pm (y-2x)$. This gives us two cases to consider:

Case 1: $x-2y = y-2x$. This simplifies to $3x = 3y$, or $x = y$. Substituting into the constraint equation gives $2|x-x| = 40$, or $0 = 40$, which is a contradiction. So this case is not possible.

Case 2: $x-2y = -(y-2x)$. This simplifies to $x-2y = 2y-x$, or $4y = 2x$, or $x = 2y$. Substituting into the constraint equation gives $|2y-4y| + |y-4y| = 40$, or $2|2y| + 3|y| = 40$. This simplifies to $10|y| = 40$, or $|y| = 4$. Since $x = 2y$, we have $|x| = 8$.

Now we can substitute the values of $x$ and $y$ into the expression $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$:
$$5(8^2) + 5(4^2) - 8(8)(4) = 320 + 80 - 256 = 164.$$

So the minimum value of the expression $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ subject to the constraint is 164. The answer is: $164$

Approach:


To find the minimum value of the expression $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ under the condition $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$, we can use the Cauchy-Schwarz inequality.

By the Cauchy-Schwarz inequality, we have
\[(1+4)(x^2+y^2) \ge (x+2y)^2.\]
Expanding the right-hand side, we get
\[(x+2y)^2 = x^2 + 4y^2 + 4xy.\]
So,
\[5(x^2+y^2) \ge x^2 + 4y^2 + 4xy.\]
This simplifies to
\[4(x^2+y^2) \ge 4xy.\]
Multiplying both sides by $\frac{1}{4}$, we get
\[x^2+y^2 \ge xy.\]
Now, we can rewrite the given expression as
\[5(x^2+y^2) - 8xy = 4(x^2+y^2) - 3xy.\]
Using the inequality $x^2+y^2 \ge xy$, we have
\[4(x^2+y^2) - 3xy \ge 0.\]
So, the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ is 0.

Now, we need to check when this minimum value is achieved. From the inequality $x^2+y^2 \ge xy$, we have equality when $x=y$. And from the condition $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$, we have equality when $x=y$. So, the minimum value is achieved when $x=y$.

Therefore, the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ when $x$ and $y$ range over all real numbers such that $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$ is 0. The answer is: $0$

Approach:


We can rewrite the given equation $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$ as $|2y-x| + |2x-y| = 40$.
This equation represents the perimeter of a parallelogram with vertices at $(0,0)$, $(x,y)$, $(2x,2y)$, and $(y,x)$.
The maximum area of a parallelogram with a given perimeter is achieved when the parallelogram is a square.
So, we can set $x=2y$ or $y=2x$.
Without loss of generality, let's consider $x=2y$.
Substituting this into the equation $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$, we get $|x-x| + |y-x| = 40$, which simplifies to $|y-x| = 40$.
Since $|y-x|$ represents the distance between the points $(x,y)$ and $(y,x)$, this means the distance between these points is 40.
Now, let's consider the expression $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$.
Substituting $x=2y$, we get $5(2y)^2+5y^2-8(2y)y = 20y^2+5y^2-16y^2 = 9y^2$.
To minimize $9y^2$, we need to minimize $|y|$.
Since $|y-x| = 40$, we can find the minimum value of $|y|$ by considering the triangle formed by the points $(0,0)$, $(x,y)$, and $(2x,2y)$.
By the triangle inequality, $|x-2y| + |2y-x| \geq |x-2y + 2y-x| = |0| = 0$.
Since $|x-2y| + |2y-x| = 40$, we have $|x-2y| = |2y-x| = 20$.
Therefore, the minimum value of $|y|$ is achieved when $(x,y)$ lies on the line segment connecting $(0,0)$ and $(40,20)$, or $(0,0)$ and $(-40,-20)$.
Without loss of generality, let's consider the line segment connecting $(0,0)$ and $(40,20)$.
The equation of this line segment is $y = \frac{1}{2}x$.
Substituting this into $9y^2$, we get $9\left(\frac{1}{2}x\right)^2 = \frac{9}{4}x^2$.
To minimize $\frac{9}{4}x^2$, we need to minimize $|x|$.
Since $|x-2y| = 20$, we can find the minimum value of $|x|$ by considering the triangle formed by the points $(0,0)$, $(x,y)$, and $(2x,2y)$.

Therefore, the minimum value of $|x|$ is achieved when $(x,y)$ lies on the line segment connecting $(0,0)$ and $(20,10)$, or $(0,0)$ and $(-20,-10)$.
Without loss of generality, let's consider the line segment connecting $(0,0)$ and $(20,10)$.
The equation of this line segment is $y = \frac{1}{2}x$.
Substituting this into $\frac{9}{4}x^2$, we get $\frac{9}{4}(x^2)$.
To minimize $\frac{9}{4}(x^2)$, we need to minimize $|x|$.

Approach:


We will use the Cauchy-Schwarz Inequality to solve this problem.

The given equation is $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$.
By the Cauchy-Schwarz Inequality, we have
\[(|x| + 2|y|)^2 \ge (1^2 + 2^2)(x^2 + y^2) = 5(x^2 + y^2).\]
So,
\[(x^2 + 4y^2 + 4xy) \ge 5(x^2 + y^2).\]
Rearranging terms, we get
\[-xy \ge - \frac{x^2 + 4y^2}{4} = - \frac{1}{4}(x^2 + 4y^2) \ge - \frac{1}{4} \cdot 5(x^2 + y^2) = - \frac{5}{4}(x^2 + y^2).\]
Thus, we have
\[-xy \ge - \frac{5}{4}(x^2 + y^2).\]
Multiplying both sides by 4, we get
\[-4xy \ge -5(x^2 + y^2).\]
Adding 5(x^2 + y^2) to both sides, we have
\[5(x^2 + y^2) - 4xy \ge 0.\]
So, the minimum value of $5x^2 + 5y^2 - 8xy$ is 0.
The answer is: $0$
