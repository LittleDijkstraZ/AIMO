"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"

 The given equation is a product of two terms equal to zero. This means that either the first term is zero or the second term is zero. 

The first term is $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)$, which is zero if and only if $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. This gives us a square with side length 10.

The second term is $((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2)$, which is zero if and only if $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$. This gives us a square with side length 16.

Therefore, the points that satisfy the equation form the union of two squares: one with side length 10 and the other with side length 16.

To find the area of the convex polygon, we can simply add the areas of the two squares. The area of a square with side length $s$ is $s^2$, so the area of the first square is $10^2 = 100$ and the area of the second square is $16^2 = 256$. 

So, the area of the convex polygon is $100 + 256 = 356$.

    side_length_square1 = 10
    side_length_square2 = 16
    area_square1 = side_length_square1 ** 2
    area_square2 = side_length_square2 ** 2

Assistant:

 The equation $A \cdot B = 0$ implies that either $A = 0$ or $B = 0$. Therefore, the given equation is equivalent to the system of equations:
1. $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$
2. $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$
3. $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$
4. $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$
The solutions to these equations are:
1. $\vert x + y \vert = 10 \implies x + y = \pm 10$
2. $\vert x - y \vert = 10 \implies x - y = \pm 10$
3. $\vert x \vert = 8 \implies x = \pm 8$
4. $\vert y \vert = 8 \implies y = \pm 8$
These solutions form a square with side length $16$ (the maximum possible value for $x$ or $y$), so the area of the square is $16^2 = 256$. The answer is: $256$

"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"

Assistant:

 The given equation is a product of two terms, and it equals zero if and only if at least one of the terms equals zero.
The first term, $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)$, equals zero if and only if $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$.
The second term, $((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2)$, equals zero if and only if $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$.
Therefore, the given equation is satisfied if and only if the point $(x, y)$ satisfies both $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$, and also $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$.
The solutions to $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$ are the points on a square with side length 10, centered at the origin.
The solutions to $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$ are the points on a square with side length 16, also centered at the origin.
The intersection of these two squares is the convex polygon we are looking for.
The area of a square with side length $a$ is $a^2$, so the area of the convex polygon is $(10)^2 = 100$. The answer is: $100$

The given equation is a product of two expressions equal to zero. Therefore, either the first expression is zero or the second expression is zero.

The first expression is $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)$. This expression is zero if and only if $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. These conditions represent a square with side length 10 units.

The second expression is $((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2)$. This expression is zero if and only if $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$. These conditions represent a square with side length 16 units.

The convex polygon formed by the intersection of these two squares is also a square. The side length of this square is the smaller of the side lengths of the two squares, which is 10 units.

The area of a square is given by the square of the side length, so the area of the convex polygon is $10^2 = 100$ square units. The answer is: $100$

 The equation $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + (\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ implies that $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$.
These equations are satisfied when $x + y = \pm 10$ and $x - y = \pm 10$.
Solving these equations, we find that the points satisfying these conditions are $\left( 5, 5 \right)$, $\left( 5, -5 \right)$, $\left( -5, 5 \right)$, and $\left( -5, -5 \right)$.
Similarly, the equation $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + (\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ implies that $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$.
These equations are satisfied when $x = \pm 8$ and $y = \pm 8$.
So the points satisfying this condition are $\left( 8, 0 \right)$, $\left( -8, 0 \right)$, $\left( 0, 8 \right)$, and $\left( 0, -8 \right)$.
Plotting these points on a coordinate plane, we see that they form a square with side length 10.
Therefore, the area of the convex polygon is $10^2 = 100$. The answer is: $100$

 The given equation is a product of two terms equal to zero, which means that either of the terms must be zero. This gives us two sets of equations:

1. $|x + y| - 10 = 0$ and $|x - y| - 10 = 0$, which simplifies to $|x + y| = 10$ and $|x - y| = 10$.
2. $|x| - 8 = 0$ and $|y| - 8 = 0$, which simplifies to $|x| = 8$ and $|y| = 8$.

For the first set of equations, we have four cases to consider:

1. $x + y = 10$ and $x - y = 10$. Solving this system gives $x = 10$ and $y = 0$.
2. $x + y = 10$ and $x - y = -10$. Solving this system gives $x = 0$ and $y = 10$.
3. $x + y = -10$ and $x - y = 10$. Solving this system gives $x = -10$ and $y = 0$.
4. $x + y = -10$ and $x - y = -10$. Solving this system gives $x = 0$ and $y = -10$.

For the second set of equations, we have:

1. $x = 8$ and $y = 8$.
2. $x = 8$ and $y = -8$.
3. $x = -8$ and $y = 8$.
4. $x = -8$ and $y = -8$.

These eight points form the vertices of a square with side length 20. The area of this square is $20^2 = 400$. Therefore, the area of the convex polygon is 400. The answer is: $400$

 The given equation is a product of two expressions equal to zero. This means that either the first expression is zero or the second expression is zero. 

Let's consider the two cases separately:

1. $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$: This can only be true if both $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ and $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$. This implies that $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. This means that the points must lie on the lines $x + y = 10$ and $x - y = 10$. These lines intersect at the points $(5,5)$ and $(5,-5)$.

2. $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$: This can only be true if both $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ and $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$. This implies that $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$. This means that the points must lie on the lines $x = 8$ and $y = 8$. These lines intersect at the points $(8,8)$ and $(8,-8)$.

Now, we can see that the points that satisfy the given equation are the vertices of a rectangle with vertices at $(5,5)$, $(5,-5)$, $(8,8)$, and $(8,-8)$. The length of the rectangle is $8 - 5 = 3$ and the width is $8 - 5 = 3$. So, the area of the rectangle is $3 \times 3 = 9$.

Therefore, the area of the convex polygon enclosed by the points that satisfy the given equation is 9. The answer is: $9$

The problem statement provides a complicated equation that represents the boundary of a region in the plane. We are asked to find the area of the region enclosed by this boundary.

The equation is $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$.

The equation is equal to zero if either of the two factors is zero. The first factor is zero if $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ or $\vert x - y \vert = 10$, which represent two squares with side length 10. The second factor is zero if $\vert x \vert = 8$ or $\vert y \vert = 8$, which represent two squares with side length 8.

Therefore, the region enclosed by the boundary is the union of four squares: two with side length 10 and two with side length 8.

The area of a square is side length squared, so the areas of the squares are:
- Side length 10: $10^2 = 100$ square units
- Side length 8: $8^2 = 64$ square units

Since there are two squares of each size, the total area of the region is $2(100) + 2(64) = 328$ square units.

Therefore, the area of the convex polygon is 328 square units. The answer is: $328$

The given equation is $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$.

This equation is satisfied if either of the two factors is zero. 

For the first factor to be zero, we need either $(\vert x + y \vert - 10) = 0$ or $(\vert x - y \vert - 10) = 0$. This implies $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ or $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. These are the equations of two lines in the plane.

For the second factor to be zero, we need either $(\vert x \vert - 8) = 0$ or $(\vert y \vert - 8) = 0$. This implies $\vert x \vert = 8$ or $\vert y \vert = 8$. These are the equations of two lines in the plane.

The intersection of these lines form a square with side length 16. Therefore, the area of the convex polygon is $16^2 = 256$. The answer is: $256$

The equation $A \cdot B = 0$ implies that either $A = 0$ or $B = 0$. Thus, the given equation is equivalent to the union of the following two sets of points:
1. $\vert x + y \vert - 10 = 0$ and $\vert x - y \vert - 10 = 0$, and
2. $\vert x \vert - 8 = 0$ and $\vert y \vert - 8 = 0$.

For the first set of points, we have $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. This implies that $x + y = \pm 10$ and $x - y = \pm 10$. Solving these four equations, we find that the points satisfying the first set are $(5,5)$, $(5,-5)$, $(-5,5)$, and $(-5,-5)$.

For the second set of points, we have $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$. This implies that $x = \pm 8$ and $y = \pm 8$. Solving these four equations, we find that the points satisfying the second set are $(8,8)$, $(8,-8)$, $(-8,8)$, and $(-8,-8)$.

The convex polygon is formed by connecting these eight points. It is a square with side length 10, so its area is $10^2 = 100$. The answer is: $100$
