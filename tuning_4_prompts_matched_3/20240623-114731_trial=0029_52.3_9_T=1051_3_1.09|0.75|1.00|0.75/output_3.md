Solve the following problem with a Python Script (positive numerical answer):
"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"

Approach:

 The equation given in the problem is a product of two expressions equal to zero. This means that either the first expression is zero or the second expression is zero. We can solve each expression separately.

For the first expression, $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$, we know that a square of a real number is zero if and only if the number itself is zero. So we have $\vert x + y \vert - 10 = 0$ and $\vert x - y \vert - 10 = 0$, which simplifies to $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. The absolute value equations can be split into two cases:

1. $x + y = 10$ and $x - y = 10$, which gives $x = 10$ and $y = 0$.
2. $x + y = 10$ and $x - y = -10$, which gives $x = 0$ and $y = 10$.
3. $x + y = -10$ and $x - y = 10$, which gives $x = -10$ and $y = 0$.
4. $x + y = -10$ and $x - y = -10$, which gives $x = 0$ and $y = -10$.

So the vertices of the polygon are $(10, 0)$, $(0, 10)$, $(-10, 0)$, and $(0, -10)$.

For the second expression, $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$, we can use the same reasoning as before to find that $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$, which means $-8 \leq x \leq 8$ and $-8 \leq y \leq 8$.

The first expression gives us the vertices of a square with side length 20, and the second expression gives us a square with side length 16. The intersection of these two regions is the polygon we are looking for.

The area of the polygon is the area of the square with side length 20 minus the area of the square with side length 16. The area of a square is side length squared, so the area of the polygon is $20^2 - 16^2 = 400 - 256 = 144$.

The answer is: $144$

The equation given is a product of two expressions equal to zero. Therefore, either the first expression is zero or the second expression is zero.
We can solve this problem by considering each of these cases separately and then finding the intersection points of the lines formed by these equations.

Case 1: $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$
This case implies that $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$.
This gives us the lines $x + y = 10$, $x + y = -10$, $x - y = 10$, and $x - y = -10$.

Case 2: $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$
This case implies that $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$.
This gives us the lines $x = 8$, $x = -8$, $y = 8$, and $y = -8$.

By solving the system of equations formed by these lines, we find the vertices of the polygon:
$(8, 8)$, $(8, -8)$, $(-8, 8)$, and $(-8, -8)$.

The polygon is a square with side length 16.
The area of the square is $16^2 = 256$.

Therefore, the area of the convex polygon is 256 square units. The answer is: 256

Approach:


The equation $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + (\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ implies that $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. These two equations represent two pairs of parallel lines with a distance of 10 units from the origin.

Similarly, the equation $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + (\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ implies that $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$, which represents a square with side length 16 units and centered at the origin.

The intersection of these two sets of points forms a square with side length 10 units (since the maximum value of $\vert x + y \vert$ and $\vert x - y \vert$ is 10 given $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$).

The area of this square is $10^2 = 100$.
The answer is: $100$

Solve the following problem with a Python Script (positive numerical answer):
"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"

Approach:


The equation $AB = 0$ implies that $A = 0$ or $B = 0$. So, we can set each factor equal to zero and solve for the points that satisfy the equation.

The first factor is $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$. This implies that $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. This means that $x + y = \pm 10$ and $x - y = \pm 10$. Solving these four equations gives us the vertices of the polygon.

The second factor is $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$. This implies that $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$, which means $x = \pm 8$ and $y = \pm 8$. This gives us the vertices of the polygon.

Now we can plot the points and find the area of the polygon.

The vertices of the polygon are:
$(8,8)$, $(8,-8)$, $(-8,8)$, $(-8,-8)$, $(10,0)$, $(-10,0)$, $(0,10)$, $(0,-10)$.

Plotting these points, we can see that they form a square with side length 16. The area of a square is side length squared, so the area of this square is $16^2 = 256$.

Therefore, the area of the convex polygon is 256. The answer is: $256$

Solve the following problem with a Python Script (positive numerical answer):
"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"

Approach:



The equation given is a product of two terms equal to zero, so either one of the terms must be zero for the equation to hold. This gives us two systems of absolute value equations to solve:

1. $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ and $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ and $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$
2. $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$

Solving the first system:

From $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$, we have $\vert x + y \vert = 10$. This implies $x + y = \pm 10$.
From $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$, we have $\vert x \vert = 8$, which implies $x = \pm 8$.
From $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$, we have $\vert y \vert = 8$, which implies $y = \pm 8$.

The solutions to the first system are $(8,8)$, $(8,-8)$, $(-8,8)$, and $(-8,-8)$.

Solving the second system:

From $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$, we have $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. This implies $x - y = \pm 10$.

The solutions to the second system are the same as the solutions to the first system.

So the vertices of the polygon are $(8,8)$, $(8,-8)$, $(-8,8)$, and $(-8,-8)$.

This forms a square with side length 16. The area of the square is $16^2 = 256$.

So the area of the convex polygon is 256. The answer is: $256$

Approach:


The equation given is a product of two expressions equal to zero. This means that either the first expression is zero or the second expression is zero. We can analyze each case separately.

Case 1: $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$
This case implies that $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. This means that $x + y = \pm 10$ and $x - y = \pm 10$. Solving these equations, we get the points $(5,5), (5,-5), (-5,5),$ and $(-5,-5)$. These points form a square with side length 10.

Case 2: $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$
This case implies that $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$. This means that $x = \pm 8$ and $y = \pm 8$. So the points are $(8,8), (8,-8), (-8,8),$ and $(-8,-8)$. These points also form a square with side length 16.

The area of the convex polygon is the union of the areas of the two squares. The first square has side length 10 and area $10^2 = 100$, while the second square has side length 16 and area $16^2 = 256$. Therefore, the total area of the convex polygon is $100 + 256 = 356$. The answer is: $356$

Approach:



The equation $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + (\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ implies that $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. This means that the points $(x, y)$ must lie on the lines $x + y = 10$ and $x - y = 10$. Similarly, the equation $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + (\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ implies that $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$, which means the points $(x, y)$ must lie on the lines $x = 8$ and $y = 8$. The intersections of these lines form a rectangle with vertices at $(8, 2), (8, -2), (-8, 2), (-8, -2)$.

To find the dimensions of the rectangle, we can calculate the distances between the vertices. The distance between $(8, 2)$ and $(8, -2)$ is $4$, and the distance between $(8, 2)$ and $(-8, 2)$ is $16$. Therefore, the rectangle has sides of length $16$ and $4$.

The area of the rectangle is the product of its side lengths, so the area is $16 \times 4 = 64$. The answer is: $64$

Approach:


The equation $A \cdot B = 0$ is true if and only if $A = 0$ or $B = 0$. So, the given equation is equivalent to either $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$.

The first equation is true if and only if $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. This is the equation of a square with side length 10.

The second equation is true if and only if $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$. This is the equation of a square with side length 16.

The convex polygon enclosed by the points that satisfy the given equation is the intersection of these two squares, which is a square with side length 10.

The area of this square is $10^2 = 100$.

So, the area of the convex polygon is 100. The answer is: $100$

Approach:


The given equation is a product of two terms, and for the product to be zero, one of the terms must be zero. So we have two cases to consider:

Case 1: $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$. This implies that $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. This is the equation of a square with side length 20, centered at the origin.

Case 2: $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$. This implies that $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$. This is the equation of a square with side length 16, centered at the origin.

Now, we need to find the intersection of these two squares. The intersection is a square with side length 16 (since 16 is less than 20), centered at the origin.

The area of a square is given by the square of the side length, so the area of this square is $16^2 = 256$.

So the area of the convex polygon enclosed by the points satisfying the given equation is 256. The answer is: $256$
