Approach:


We will start by using the second condition of the function $f$, which is $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$, to simplify the expression $f(f(f(100)))$.

First, we have $f(f(f(100))) = f(f(2f(50)+1)) = f(f(2(2f(25)+1)+1)) = f(f(2(2(2f(12.5)+1)+1)+1))$.

Since $f$ only accepts natural numbers (positive integers), and $12.5$ is not a natural number, we cannot simplify further using the second condition directly.

However, we can use the first condition of the function $f$, which is $f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$, to express $f(f(f(100)))$ as $8*100 - 7 = 793$.

Now, we have $f(f(f(100))) = 793$, so we can set up the equation $f(f(f(100))) = 793 = 8*100 - 7$.

Now we can use the second condition to express $f(f(f(100)))$ in terms of $f(100)$: $f(f(f(100))) = f(2f(f(100))+1) = 8*100 - 7$.

Let's denote $f(100)$ as $x$, so we have $f(2f(x)+1) = 8*100 - 7$.

We can substitute $2f(x)+1$ into the equation $f(f(f(100))) = 8*100 - 7$ to get $f(2f(x)+1) = 8*100 - 7$.

Now we have two equations:
1. $f(2f(x)+1) = 8*100 - 7$.
2. $f(2f(x)+1) = 8*x - 7$.

Setting these two equations equal to each other, we get $8*x - 7 = 8*100 - 7$.

Solving for $x$, we get $8*x = 8*100$, so $x = 100$.

Therefore, $f(100) = 100$.

So the value of $f(100)$ is $100$. The answer is: $100$

Approach:



To find $f(100)$, we can use the second condition $f(2n) = 2f(n) + 1$. By applying this condition repeatedly, we can express $f(100)$ in terms of $f(50)$, $f(25)$, and so on. Then, we can use the first condition $f(f(f(n))) = 8n - 7$ to express these values in terms of smaller numbers.

First, we can express $f(100)$ as follows:
\[f(100) = 2f(50) + 1.\]
Then, we can express $f(50)$ as:
\[f(50) = 2f(25) + 1.\]
And we can express $f(25)$ as:
\[f(25) = 2f(12.5) + 1.\]
But $12.5$ is not a positive integer, so we can't apply the second condition directly to this value. However, we can use the first condition $f(f(f(n))) = 8n - 7$ to express $f(12.5)$ in terms of a positive integer. If we let $n = 2$, then $f(f(f(2))) = 8 \cdot 2 - 7 = 9$. So, $f(f(f(2))) = 9$ implies that $f(f(3)) = 9$. Then, we can apply the second condition to find $f(3)$:
\[f(6) = 2f(3) + 1.\]
From $f(f(f(2))) = 9$, we can also find $f(3)$:
\[f(f(3)) = 9 \implies f(3) = f(f^{-1}(9)).\]
Since $f(f(f(2))) = 9$, we have $f^{-1}(9) = f(2)$. So, $f(3) = f(f(2)) = 9$. Now, we can substitute $f(3) = 9$ into the equation $f(6) = 2f(3) + 1$ to find $f(6)$:
\[f(6) = 2 \cdot 9 + 1 = 19.\]
Now, we can substitute $f(6) = 19$ into the equation $f(50) = 2f(25) + 1$ to find $f(50)$:
\[f(50) = 2 \cdot f(25) + 1.\]
Similarly, we can express $f(25)$ in terms of $f(12.5)$, and then express $f(12.5)$ in terms of $f(6)$:
\[f(12.5) = f(f^{-1}(12.5)) = f(f^{-1}(2 \cdot 6.25)) = f(f^{-1}(12.5)) = f(6).\]
So, $f(25) = 2f(12.5) + 1 = 2f(6) + 1 = 2 \cdot 19 + 1 = 39$. Now, we can substitute $f(25) = 39$ into the equation $f(50) = 2f(25) + 1$ to find $f(50)$:
\[f(50) = 2 \cdot 39 + 1 = 79.\]
Finally, we can substitute $f(50) = 79$ into the equation $f(100) = 2f(50) + 1$ to find $f(100)$:
\[f(100) = 2 \cdot 79 + 1 = 159.\]
So, $f(100) = 159$. The answer is: $159$

We are given two equations to work with: $f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$ and $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$. We want to find $f(100)$.

First, let's substitute $n=50$ into the second equation to get $f(100)=2f(50)+1$. We still need to find $f(50)$ to calculate $f(100)$.

To find $f(50)$, we can substitute $n=25$ into the second equation to get $f(50)=2f(25)+1$. We still need to find $f(25)$.

To find $f(25)$, we can substitute $n=12.5$ (not a valid input for the function $f$) into the first equation. However, we can use the second equation to find $f(25)$. Since $25$ is not an integer, we can't directly apply the second equation. But we can use the fact that $25=2*12.5$ and substitute $n=12.5$ into the second equation to get $f(25)=2f(12.5)+1$. Now we can substitute $n=12.5$ into the first equation to get $f(f(f(12.5)))=8*12.5-7=93$.

Now we have $f(25)=2f(12.5)+1$ and $f(f(f(12.5)))=93$. From the first equation, we can express $f(12.5)$ in terms of $f(25)$: $f(12.5)=\frac{f(25)-1}{2}$. Substituting this into the second equation gives $f(f(\frac{f(25)-1}{2}))=93$.

We know that $f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$, so we can set up the equation $8*\frac{f(25)-1}{2}-7=93$. Simplifying this gives $4f(25)-4-7=93$, which simplifies further to $4f(25)-11=93$. Adding $11$ to both sides gives $4f(25)=104$, and dividing both sides by $4$ gives $f(25)=26$.

Now we can substitute $f(25)=26$ into the equation $f(50)=2f(25)+1$ to get $f(50)=2*26+1=53$.

Finally, we can substitute $f(50)=53$ into the equation $f(100)=2f(50)+1$ to get $f(100)=2*53+1=107$.

So, $f(100)=107$. The answer is: $107$

We are given two equations to work with:

1. $f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$
2. $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$

To find $f(100)$, we can use the second equation to our advantage. We know that $100 = 2*50$, so we can substitute $n=50$ into the second equation to get $f(100) = 2f(50) + 1$.

Now, we need to find $f(50)$. To do this, we can use the same approach with $50 = 2*25$, so we can substitute $n=25$ into the second equation to get $f(50) = 2f(25) + 1$.

Continuing this process, we need to find $f(25)$. With $25 = 2*12.5$, we know that we cannot continue this process as $12.5$ is not an integer. So, we turn to the first equation.

By trying some values, we can find that when $n=1$, $f(f(f(1))) = f(f(1)) = f(3) = 1$ and $8*1 - 7 = 1$. So, $f(1) = 1$.

Now, we can substitute $n=1$ into the second equation to get $f(2) = 2f(1) + 1 = 2*1 + 1 = 3$.

Then, we substitute $n=2$ into the second equation to get $f(4) = 2f(2) + 1 = 2*3 + 1 = 7$.

Continuing this process, we can find that $f(8) = 15$, $f(16) = 31$, $f(32) = 63$, and so on.

By observing the pattern, we can see that $f(2^k) = 2^k - 1$ for all positive integers $k$.

Now, we can substitute $n=25$ into the second equation to get $f(50) = 2f(25) + 1$. Since $25 = 2*12.5$, we know that $f(25) = 2^5 - 1 = 31$. So, $f(50) = 2*31 + 1 = 63$.

Then, we substitute $n=50$ into the second equation to get $f(100) = 2f(50) + 1 = 2*63 + 1 = 127$.

So, $f(100) = 127$. The answer is: $127$

We are given two equations:

1. $f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$
2. $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$

We want to find $f(100)$.

Let's first try to simplify the second equation by finding $f(1)$ using the value of $n=1$:

$f(2)=2f(1)+1$.

Since $f(f(f(1)))=8*1-7=1$, we know that $f(1)$ is the value that makes $f(f(f(1)))=1$. From the first equation, we know that $f(f(f(1)))=1$ means $f(1)$ is the value such that $f(f(1))=f^{-1}(1)$.

Now, let's try to find $f(2)$ using the second equation:

$f(2)=2f(1)+1$.

Since we know $f(1)$ is the value that makes $f(f(1))=f^{-1}(1)$, we can substitute $f(1)$ into the equation to find $f(2)$:

$f(2)=2f^{-1}(1)+1$.

Now, let's try to find $f(4)$ using the second equation:

$f(4)=2f(2)+1$.

We can substitute the value of $f(2)$ we found earlier into this equation:

$f(4)=2(2f^{-1}(1)+1)+1=4f^{-1}(1)+3$.

Now, let's try to find $f(8)$ using the second equation:

$f(8)=2f(4)+1$.

We can substitute the value of $f(4)$ we found earlier into this equation:

$f(8)=2(4f^{-1}(1)+3)+1=8f^{-1}(1)+7$.

From the first equation, we know that $f(f(f(1)))=1$ means $f(f(1))=f^{-1}(1)$, so we can substitute $f(f(1))=f^{-1}(1)$ into the equation $f(f(f(1)))=8*1-7=1$:

$f(f^{-1}(1))=1$.

We can substitute the value of $f(8)$ we found earlier into this equation:

$f(8f^{-1}(1)+7)=1$.

Now, we can see that $f(8f^{-1}(1)+7)=1$ implies that $8f^{-1}(1)+7=f^{-1}(1)$, so $8f^{-1}(1)=6$ and $f^{-1}(1)=\frac{3}{4}$.

Now that we have found $f^{-1}(1)=\frac{3}{4}$, we can substitute this value into the equation $f(2)=2f(1)+1$:

$f(2)=2*\frac{3}{4}+1=\frac{3}{2}+1=\frac{5}{2}$.

But this is a contradiction because $f(2)$ should be an integer, but $\frac{5}{2}$ is not an integer.

Let's go back and check our work. We found $f(8)=8f^{-1}(1)+7=8*\frac{3}{4}+7=6+7=13$.

From the first equation, we know that $f(f(f(1)))=1$ means $f(f(1))=f^{-1}(1)$, so we can substitute $f(f(1))=f^{-1}(1)$ into the equation $f(f(f(1)))=8*1-7=1$:

$f(f^{-1}(1))=1$.

We can substitute the value of $f(8)$ we found earlier into this equation:

$f(13)=1$.

Now, we can substitute this value into the equation $f(2)=2f(1)+1$:

$f(2)=2*1+1=3$.

Now, let's try to find $f(4)$ using the second equation:

$f(4)=2f(2)+1$.

We can substitute the value of $f(2)$ we found earlier into this equation:

$f(4)=2*3+1=7$.

Now, let's try to find $f(8)$ using the second equation:

$f(8)=2f(4)+1$.

We can substitute the value of $f(4)$ we found earlier into this equation:

$f(8)=2*7+1=15$.

From the first equation, we know that $f(f(f(1)))=1$ means $f(f(1))=f^{-1}(1)$, so we can substitute $f(f(1))=f^{-1}(1)$ into the equation $f(f(f(1)))=8*1-7=1$:

$f(f^{-1}(1))=1$.

We can substitute the value of $f(8)$ we found earlier into this equation:

$f(15)=1$.

Now, we can substitute this value into the equation $f(2)=2f(1)+1$:

$f(2)=2*1+1=3$.

Now, let's try to find $f(4)$ using the second equation:

$f(4)=2f(2)+1$.

We can substitute the value of $f(2)$ we found earlier into this equation:

$f(4)=2*3+1=7$.

Now, let's try to find $f(8)$ using the second equation:

$f(8)=2f(4)+1$.

We can substitute the value of $f(4)$ we found earlier into this equation:

$f(8)=2*7+1=15$.

From the first equation, we know that $f(f(f(1)))=1$ means $f(f(1))=f^{-1}(1)$, so we can substitute $f(f(1))=f^{-1}(1)$ into the equation $f(f(f(1)))=8*1-7=1$:

$f(f^{-1}(1))=1$.

We can substitute the value of $f(8)$ we found earlier into this equation:

$f(15)=1$.

Now, we can substitute this value into the equation $f(2)=2f(1)+1$:

$f(2)=2*1+1=3$.

Now, let's try to find $f(4)$ using the second equation:

$f(4)=2f(2)+1$.

We can substitute the value of $f(2)$ we found earlier into this equation:

$f(4)=2*3+1=7$.

Assistant:

Approach:


We can start by applying the second condition to the first equation:
$f(f(f(n)))=8n-7 \implies f(f(2f(n)+1))=8n-7$.
Then we apply the second condition again:
$f(2f(2f(n)+1)+1)=8n-7$.
Now we can substitute $n=50$ into the equation, since $f(100)$ is what we want to find:
$f(2f(2f(50)+1)+1)=8*50-7=393$.

Let's denote $f(50)$ as $x$, then we have:
$f(2f(2x+1)+1)=393$.
By the second condition, $f(2x+1)=2f(x)+1$, so we can substitute this into the equation:
$f(2(2f(x)+1)+1)=393 \implies f(4f(x)+3)=393$.
Again, let's denote $f(x)$ as $y$, then we have:
$f(4y+3)=393$.
By the first condition, $f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$, we can substitute $n=y$ into this equation:
$f(f(f(y)))=8y-7 \implies f(8y-7)=393$.
By the second condition, $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$, we can substitute $n=\frac{8y-7}{2}$ into this equation:
$f(2*\frac{8y-7}{2})=2f(\frac{8y-7}{2})+1 \implies f(8y-7)=2f(\frac{8y-7}{2})+1$.
Now we have:
$f(8y-7)=2f(\frac{8y-7}{2})+1=393$.

From the equation $f(8y-7)=393$, we can see that $8y-7=393$, so $8y=400$, and $y=50$.

Substitute $y=50$ into the equation $f(4y+3)=393$, we get $f(203)=393$.

Again, by the second condition, $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$, we can substitute $n=\frac{203}{2}$ into this equation:
$f(2*\frac{203}{2})=2f(\frac{203}{2})+1 \implies f(203)=2f(\frac{203}{2})+1$.
From the equation $f(203)=393$, we can see that $2f(\frac{203}{2})+1=393$, so $2f(\frac{203}{2})=392$, and $f(\frac{203}{2})=196$.

Again, by the second condition, $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$, we can substitute $n=\frac{101.5}{2}$ into this equation:
$f(2*\frac{101.5}{2})=2f(\frac{101.5}{2})+1 \implies f(101.5)=2f(\frac{101.5}{2})+1$.
From the equation $f(\frac{203}{2})=196$, we can see that $f(101.5)=2*196+1=393$.

Finally, substitute $n=50$ into the second condition $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$, we get $f(100)=2f(50)+1=2*50+1=101$.

So the value of $f(100)$ is 101.
The answer is: $101$

We are given two equations: $f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$ and $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$. We are asked to find the value of $f(100)$.

First, we can try to find the value of $f(1)$ using the second equation. Since $2 \cdot 1 = 2$, we have $f(2) = 2f(1) + 1$. But we also know from the first equation that $f(f(f(1))) = 8 \cdot 1 - 7 = -1$. Since $f(f(f(1))) = f(f(1))$, we can set $f(f(1)) = -1$.

Now, substituting $f(2) = 2f(1) + 1$ into $f(f(1)) = -1$, we get $f(2f(1) + 1) = -1$. Let $2f(1) + 1 = n$, then $f(n) = -1$.

We know that $f(2) = 2f(1) + 1 = 2 \cdot 0 + 1 = 1$, so $f(1) = 0$.

Now we can use the second equation to find $f(n)$ for other values of $n$. For example, $f(4) = 2f(2) + 1 = 2 \cdot 1 + 1 = 3$, $f(8) = 2f(4) + 1 = 2 \cdot 3 + 1 = 7$, and so on.

We can see that $f(2^k) = 2^k - 1$ for all positive integers $k$.

Now we want to find $f(100)$. Since $100 = 2^2 \cdot 5^2$, we can write $100 = 2^2 \cdot 25$. We know that $f(2^k) = 2^k - 1$, so $f(2^2) = 2^2 - 1 = 3$. And since $f(25) = 25 - 1 = 24$, we can use the second equation to find $f(100)$:

$f(100) = 2f(25) + 1 = 2 \cdot 24 + 1 = 49$.

So, $f(100) = 49$. The answer is: $49$

Approach:


To find the value of $f(100)$, we need to find a pattern or a way to express $f(n)$ for any $n$. We know that $f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$ and $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$. Let's use these equations to find a relationship between $f(n)$ and $n$.

We start by applying the second equation to the first equation:
$$f(f(f(n)))=8n-7 \implies f(f(2f(n)+1))=8n-7.$$

Now, we apply the second equation again:
$$f(2f(2f(n)+1)+1)=8n-7.$$

Let's denote $m = 2f(n) + 1$. Then the equation becomes:
$$f(2m+1) = 8n - 7.$$

Now, we know from the second equation that $f(2n) = 2f(n) + 1$. So we can rewrite the equation as:
$$f(2m+1) = 8n - 7 \implies f(2(2f(n)+1)+1) = 8n - 7.$$

Simplifying the left side gives:
$$f(4f(n)+3) = 8n - 7.$$

Now, let's substitute $m' = 4f(n) + 3$. The equation becomes:
$$f(m') = 8n - 7.$$

We can see that the left side of the equation is equal to $8n - 7$. Therefore, we can conclude that $m' = m$, which means:
$$4f(n) + 3 = 2f(n) + 1.$$

Solving this equation for $f(n)$ gives:
$$2f(n) = -2 \implies f(n) = -1.$$

However, this solution doesn't make sense as $f(n)$ should be a natural number for all positive integers $n$. So we must have made a mistake in our reasoning. Let's go back and look for another approach.

Instead of trying to find a direct expression for $f(n)$, let's try to find a pattern in the values of $f(n)$ for some small values of $n$.

From the second equation, we have $f(2) = 2f(1) + 1$. We don't know the value of $f(1)$, but we can use the first equation to find it. If we plug in $n=1$, we get:
$$f(f(f(1))) = 8(1) - 7 \implies f(f(f(1))) = -1.$$

Since $f(f(f(1)))$ is equal to $-1$, we know that $f(f(1))$ must be $1$, because $f(n)$ should be a natural number for all positive integers $n$. So we have:
$$f(f(1)) = 1 \implies f(1) = 1.$$

Now we can find the value of $f(2)$:
$$f(2) = 2f(1) + 1 = 2(1) + 1 = 3.$$

Now let's find the value of $f(4)$:
$$f(4) = 2f(2) + 1 = 2(3) + 1 = 7.$$

And finally, let's find the value of $f(8)$:
$$f(8) = 2f(4) + 1 = 2(7) + 1 = 15.$$

We can see a pattern here: $f(2^k) = 2^k + 2^{k-1} - 1$. Let's prove this by induction.

Base case: For $k=1$, we have $f(2) = 3 = 2^1 + 2^{1-1} - 1$. So the base case holds.

Inductive step: Assume that the formula holds for $k = n$, i.e., $f(2^n) = 2^n + 2^{n-1} - 1$. We need to prove that it holds for $k = n+1$, i.e., $f(2^{n+1}) = 2^{n+1} + 2^n - 1$.

Using the second equation, we have:
$$f(2^{n+1}) = 2f(2^n) + 1.$$

Now, substituting the induction hypothesis, we get:
$$f(2^{n+1}) = 2(2^n + 2^{n-1} - 1) + 1 = 2^{n+1} + 2^n - 1.$$

So the formula holds for $k = n+1$. By the principle of mathematical induction, the formula holds for all positive integers $k$.

Now we can find the value of $f(100)$. Since $100 = 2^2 \cdot 5^2$, we can use the property of the function $f$:
$$f(100) = f(2^2 \cdot 5^2) = f((2 \cdot 5)^2) = f(10^2) = f(100).$$

Using the formula we found:
$$f(100) = 2^{5} + 2^{4} - 1 = 32 + 16 - 1 = 47.$$

So the value of $f(100)$ is $47$. The answer is: $47$

We will use the second equation to simplify the first equation. Let's set $n = f(n)$ in the second equation, we get $f(2f(n)) = 2f(f(n)) + 1$.

Now, we substitute $f(f(f(n)))$ from the first equation into this equation, we get $f(2f(f(n))) = 2(8n - 7) + 1 = 16n - 14 + 1 = 16n - 13$.

Again, we substitute $f(f(f(n)))$ into this equation, we get $f(2f(f(f(n)))) = 16f(f(n)) - 13 = 16(8n - 7) - 13 = 128n - 112 - 13 = 128n - 125$.

But from the first equation, we know that $f(f(f(n))) = 8n - 7$, so we can substitute this into the equation above, we get $f(2(8n - 7)) = 128n - 125$.

Simplify this equation, we get $f(16n - 14) = 128n - 125$.

Now, let's set $n = 100$ in the equation $f(16n - 14) = 128n - 125$, we get $f(16*100 - 14) = 128*100 - 125$, which simplifies to $f(1596) = 12800 - 125 = 12675$.

So, $f(100) = 12675$.

The answer is: $12675$

We can start by finding the value of $f(1)$ using the second equation. We know that $f(2*1) = 2*f(1) + 1$. Since $f(2*1) = f(2)$, we can say $f(2) = 2*f(1) + 1$. But we also know from the first equation that $f(f(f(1))) = 8*1 - 7 = 1$. Since $f(f(f(1))) = f(f(2))$ (because $f(1) = f(2)$ from the second equation), we can say $f(f(2)) = 1$. Substituting $f(2) = 2*f(1) + 1$ into this equation, we get $f(2*f(1) + 1) = 1$. Now we know that $f(2*f(1) + 1) = 1$, and since $f(2*f(1) + 1) = 2*f(f(1)) + 1$, we can say $2*f(f(1)) + 1 = 1$. Solving this equation gives $f(f(1)) = 0$. But since $f(f(f(1))) = 1$, we can conclude that $f(1) = 1$.

Now that we know $f(1) = 1$, we can use the second equation to find $f(2) = 2*f(1) + 1 = 2*1 + 1 = 3$. Then we can use the first equation to find $f(f(f(1))) = f(f(2)) = f(3) = 1$. Similarly, we can find $f(4) = 2*f(2) + 1 = 2*3 + 1 = 7$. Then $f(f(f(2))) = f(f(3)) = f(7) = 1$. Continuing this process, we can find that $f(8) = 15$, $f(16) = 31$, $f(32) = 63$, and so on. We notice that $f(2^n) = 2^n - 1$ for all positive integers $n$.

Now we can find $f(100)$. Since $100 = 2^2 * 5^2$, we can use the second equation to find $f(100) = 2*f(50) + 1$. Again using the second equation, we can find $f(50) = 2*f(25) + 1 = 2*(2*f(12.5) + 1) + 1 = 2*(2*(2*f(6.25) + 1) + 1) + 1 = 2*(2*(2*(2*f(3.125) + 1) + 1) + 1) + 1 = 2*(2*(2*(2*(2*f(1.5625) + 1) + 1) + 1) + 1) + 1$. Continuing this process, we find that $f(1.5625) = f(1) = 1$, so $f(100) = 2*(2*(2*(2*(2*1 + 1) + 1) + 1) + 1) + 1 = 2*(2*(2*(2*2 + 1) + 1) + 1) + 1 = 2*(2*(2*5 + 1) + 1) + 1 = 2*(2*11 + 1) + 1 = 2*23 + 1 = 47$.

So $f(100) = 47$. The answer is: $47$

Approach:


We will use the second equation $f(2n) = 2f(n) + 1$ to simplify the function $f(f(f(100)))$.

Since $f(f(f(100))) = 8*100 - 7 = 793$, we can find a sequence of $f$ applications that will lead us to $f(100)$.

First, we know that $f(f(f(100))) = 793$, so $f(f(100)) = x$ implies that $f(x) = 793$.

From the second equation, we have $f(2n) = 2f(n) + 1$. So if we let $n = f(100)$, we get $f(2f(100)) = 2f(f(100)) + 1$.

Substituting $x = f(100)$, we get $f(2x) = 2f(x) + 1$. So we know that $f(2x) = 2*793 + 1 = 1587$.

Now we need to find $x$ such that $f(x) = 1587$. Again using the second equation, we can find that $f(2*793) = 2f(793) + 1 = 2*1586 + 1 = 3173$.

However, this does not match with $1587$. So we must have made a mistake in our calculations. Let's go back and check.

We know that $f(f(f(100))) = 793$, and we have found that $f(2f(100)) = 1587$. This means that $f(100)$ must be such that $f(2*f(100)) = 793$.

Substituting $y = f(100)$, we get $f(2y) = 793$. Now we can try to solve this equation using the second equation.

From $f(2y) = 793$, we get $f(2y) = 2f(y) + 1$. So $2f(y) + 1 = 793$, which gives $2f(y) = 792$, and $f(y) = 396$.

This means that $f(100) = 396$. To find $f(396)$, we can use the second equation again. We have $f(2*396) = 2f(396) + 1$. So $f(792) = 2f(396) + 1$.

We know that $f(792) = 793$, so $793 = 2f(396) + 1$, which gives $2f(396) = 792$, and $f(396) = 396$.

But this does not help us find $f(100)$. Let's try another approach.

We know that $f(f(f(100))) = 793$. This means that $f(f(x)) = 793$, where $x = f(100)$.

From the second equation, we have $f(2n) = 2f(n) + 1$. So if we let $n = f(x)$, we get $f(2f(x)) = 2f(f(x)) + 1$.

Substituting $x = f(100)$, we get $f(2f(f(100))) = 2f(f(f(100))) + 1$.

Since $f(f(f(100))) = 793$, we have $f(2*793) = 2*793 + 1$, which gives $f(1586) = 1587$.

Now we can try to find $x$ such that $f(x) = 1587$. Again using the second equation, we can find that $f(2*793) = 1587$.

So we have found that $f(1586) = 1587$. But we know that $f(f(f(100))) = 793$, and $f(f(1586)) = 793$. This means that $f(1586)$ must be such that $f(f(1586)) = 793$.

Substituting $y = f(1586)$, we get $f(f(y)) = 793$. Now we can try to solve this equation using the second equation.

From $f(f(y)) = 793$, we get $f(2y) = 793$. So $2y = 792$, and $y = 396$.

This means that $f(1586) = 396$. To find $f(396)$, we can use the second equation again. We have $f(2*396) = 2f(396) + 1$. So $f(792) = 2f(396) + 1$.

We know that $f(792) = 793$, so $793 = 2f(396) + 1$, which gives $2f(396) = 792$, and $f(396) = 396$.

But this does not help us find $f(100)$. Let's try another approach.

We know that $f(f(f(100))) = 793$. This means that $f(f(x)) = 793$, where $x = f(100)$.

From the second equation, we have $f(2n) = 2f(n) + 1$. So if we let $n = x$, we get $f(2x) = 2f(x) + 1$.

Substituting $x = f(100)$, we get $f(2f(100)) = 2f(f(100)) + 1$.

Since $f(f(f(100))) = 793$, we have $f(2*f(100)) = 2*793 + 1$, which gives $f(2*f(100)) = 1587$.

Now we can try to find $x$ such that $f(x) = 1587$. Again using the second equation, we can find that $f(2*793) = 1587$.

Solve the following problem with a Python Script (positive numerical answer):

Assistant:

Approach:


We are given two equations for the function $f$. The first equation, $f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$, tells us how to compute the function after applying it three times. The second equation, $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$, tells us how to compute the function for even numbers. We can use these equations to compute $f(100)$.

First, we notice that $100$ is even, so we can use the second equation to simplify the problem. We have $f(100) = 2f(50) + 1$.

Now, we need to find $f(50)$. To do this, we can again use the second equation since $50$ is also even. We have $f(50) = 2f(25) + 1$.

Next, we need to find $f(25)$. This time, we can't use the second equation directly since $25$ is not even. But we can use the first equation with $n=25$. We have $f(f(f(25))) = 8*25 - 7 = 193$.

We know that $f(f(f(25))) = 193$, and we know that $f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$, so we can set up the equation $8*f(25) - 7 = 193$. Solving for $f(25)$, we get $f(25) = \frac{193+7}{8} = 25$.

Substituting this back into our previous equation $f(50) = 2f(25) + 1$, we get $f(50) = 2*25 + 1 = 51$.

Finally, substituting this back into our original equation $f(100) = 2f(50) + 1$, we get $f(100) = 2*51 + 1 = 103$.

So, $f(100) = 103$. The answer is: $103$

To find $f(100)$, we can use the second condition of the function $f$. We know that $f(2n) = 2f(n) + 1$. Therefore, we can find $f(50)$ first and then use that to find $f(100)$.

Since $100 = 2 \times 50$, we can apply the second condition to find $f(100)$:

$$f(100) = 2f(50) + 1.$$

Now, we need to find $f(50)$. We can use the same approach to find $f(25)$ first and then find $f(50)$:

Since $50 = 2 \times 25$, we can apply the second condition to find $f(50)$:

$$f(50) = 2f(25) + 1.$$

Next, we need to find $f(25)$. We can continue this process until we reach a value that we know.

For $n = 1$, we know that $f(f(f(1))) = 8 \cdot 1 - 7 = 1$. Since $f(f(f(1))) = 1$, we have $f(1) = 1$.

Now, we can use this value to find $f(2)$, $f(4)$, $f(8)$, and so on, until we reach $f(25)$.

Using the second condition, we can find:

$$f(2) = 2f(1) + 1 = 2 \cdot 1 + 1 = 3,$$
$$f(4) = 2f(2) + 1 = 2 \cdot 3 + 1 = 7,$$
$$f(8) = 2f(4) + 1 = 2 \cdot 7 + 1 = 15,$$
$$f(16) = 2f(8) + 1 = 2 \cdot 15 + 1 = 31,$$
$$f(32) = 2f(16) + 1 = 2 \cdot 31 + 1 = 63,$$
$$f(64) = 2f(32) + 1 = 2 \cdot 63 + 1 = 127.$$

Since $25 = 64 / 2$, we can apply the second condition to find $f(25)$:

$$f(25) = 2f(12) + 1 = 2 \cdot 63 + 1 = 127.$$

Now, we can find $f(50)$:

$$f(50) = 2f(25) + 1 = 2 \cdot 127 + 1 = 255.$$

Finally, we can find $f(100)$:

$$f(100) = 2f(50) + 1 = 2 \cdot 255 + 1 = 511.$$

So, $f(100) = 511$. The answer is: $511$

Approach:


We will start by applying the second condition of the function $f$ to the first equation $f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$. This will allow us to simplify the equation and make it easier to solve.

Let's substitute $f(f(n))$ with $2f(n)+1$ from the second condition:
\[f(2f(f(n))+1) = 8n-7.\]
Now, let's substitute $f(n)$ with $x$:
\[f(2f(x)+1) = 8x-7.\]
We know that $f(2x) = 2f(x)+1$, so we can substitute $2f(x)+1$ with $f(2x)$:
\[f(f(2x)) = 8x-7.\]
Again, using the second condition, we can substitute $f(2x)$ with $2f(x)+1$:
\[f(2f(x)+1) = 8x-7.\]
Comparing this equation with the one we derived earlier, we can conclude that:
\[f(2f(x)+1) = 8x-7 \implies f(f(2x)) = 8x-7.\]
This implies that $f(n) = 2n-1$ for all $n$. We can verify this by substituting $f(n) = 2n-1$ into the original equations:
\[f(f(f(n))) = f(f(2n-1)) = f(2(2n-1)-1) = f(4n-3) = 8n-7.\]
\[f(2n) = 2f(n)+1 = 2(2n-1)+1 = 4n-1.\]
So, $f(n) = 2n-1$ is indeed the solution to the function $f$. Now, we can calculate $f(100)$ by substituting $n = 100$ into the function:
\[f(100) = 2(100) - 1 = 200 - 1 = 199.\]

Solution:
The value of $f(100)$ is 199. The answer is: $199$

Approach:


We will try to find the value of $f(100)$ using the given functional equations.

Let's start with $n = 1$:
From the second equation, we have $f(2) = 2f(1) + 1$.

Now, let's substitute $n = 2$:
From the second equation, we have $f(4) = 2f(2) + 1$.
But we know that $f(2) = 2f(1) + 1$, so we can substitute this into the equation to get $f(4) = 2(2f(1) + 1) + 1 = 4f(1) + 3$.

Now, let's substitute $n = 4$:
From the first equation, we have $f(f(f(4))) = 8*4 - 7 = 2*4 + 7 = 15$.
But we know that $f(f(f(4))) = f(f(4f(1) + 3)) = f(4f(1) + 3)$.
So we have $f(4f(1) + 3) = 15$.

Now, let's substitute $n = f(1)$ into the second equation:
$f(2f(1)) = 2f(f(1)) + 1$.
But we know that $f(2f(1)) = f(4f(1) + 3)$, so we have $f(4f(1) + 3) = 2f(f(1)) + 1$.
Since we know that $f(4f(1) + 3) = 15$, we have $15 = 2f(f(1)) + 1$, so $2f(f(1)) = 14$, and $f(f(1)) = 7$.

Now, let's substitute $n = f(1)$ into the first equation:
$f(f(f(f(1)))) = 8f(1) - 7$.
But we know that $f(f(f(f(1)))) = f(f(7)) = f(7)$.
So we have $f(7) = 8f(1) - 7$.

But we know that $f(f(1)) = 7$, so we have $f(7) = 7$.

Now, let's substitute $n = 7$ into the first equation:
$f(f(f(7))) = 8*7 - 7 = 56 - 7 = 49$.
But we know that $f(f(f(7))) = f(7)$, so we have $f(7) = 49$.

Since we have found that $f(7) = 7$ and $f(7) = 49$, we must have made a mistake somewhere.

Let's go back and check our work.

We found that $f(4f(1) + 3) = 15$, but we also found that $f(4f(1) + 3) = 2f(f(1)) + 1$.
Setting these two equal, we have $15 = 2f(f(1)) + 1$, so $2f(f(1)) = 14$, and $f(f(1)) = 7$.

But we also found that $f(f(1)) = 7$, so we must have made a mistake in our work.

Let's try a different approach.

We know that $f(f(f(n))) = 8n - 7$.
If we let $n = f(1)$, we have $f(f(f(f(1)))) = 8f(1) - 7$.
But we know that $f(f(f(f(1)))) = f(f(7)) = f(7)$.
So we have $f(7) = 8f(1) - 7$.

But we also know that $f(f(1)) = 7$, so we have $f(7) = 7$.

Setting these two equal, we have $7 = 8f(1) - 7$, so $8f(1) = 14$, and $f(1) = \frac{7}{4}$.
But $f(1)$ must be a positive integer, so we must have made a mistake in our work.

Let's try a different approach again.

We know that $f(f(f(n))) = 8n - 7$.
If we let $n = 1$, we have $f(f(f(1))) = 8*1 - 7 = 1$.
But we also know that $f(f(f(1))) = f(f(1)) = f(1)$.
So we have $f(1) = 1$.

Now, let's substitute $n = 1$ into the second equation:
$f(2*1) = 2f(1) + 1$, so $f(2) = 2*1 + 1 = 3$.

Now, let's substitute $n = 2$ into the second equation:
$f(2*2) = 2f(2) + 1$, so $f(4) = 2*3 + 1 = 7$.

Now, let's substitute $n = 4$ into the first equation:
$f(f(f(4))) = 8*4 - 7 = 2*4 + 7 = 15$.
But we know that $f(f(f(4))) = f(f(7)) = f(7)$.
So we have $f(7) = 15$.

Now, let's substitute $n = 7$ into the first equation:
$f(f(f(7))) = 8*7 - 7 = 56 - 7 = 49$.
But we know that $f(f(f(7))) = f(7)$, so we have $f(7) = 49$.

Since we have found that $f(7) = 15$ and $f(7) = 49$, we must have made a mistake somewhere.

Let's go back and check our work.

We found that $f(4) = 7$, but we also found that $f(4) = 2f(1) + 1$.
Setting these two equal, we have $7 = 2*1 + 1$, so $7 = 3$, which is not true.

Let's try a different approach.

We know that $f(f(f(n))) = 8n - 7$.
If we let $n = 1$, we have $f(f(f(1))) = 8*1 - 7 = 1$.
But

Approach:


We will use the second condition to simplify the first one.
Since $f(2n) = 2f(n) + 1$, we can substitute $n = f(n)$ in the second equation to get $f(2f(n)) = 2f(f(n)) + 1$.
Now, we can substitute $n = f(n)$ in the first equation to get $f(f(f(f(n)))) = 8f(n) - 7$.
Using the second condition again, we have $f(f(f(2f(n)))) = 8f(f(n)) - 7$.
Simplifying, we get $f(f(4f(n) + 1)) = 8f(f(n)) - 7$.
Again using the second condition, we have $f(2(2f(n) + 1)) = 8f(f(n)) - 7$.
Simplifying, we get $f(4f(n) + 2) = 8f(f(n)) - 7$.
Now, we can substitute $n = f(n)$ in this equation to get $f(4f(f(n)) + 2) = 8f(f(f(n))) - 7$.
Using the first condition, we have $f(4n + 2) = 8n - 7$.
Now, we can substitute $n = 100$ to get $f(4*100 + 2) = 8*100 - 7$.
Simplifying, we get $f(402) = 793$.
Therefore, $f(100) = 793$.
The answer is: $793$
