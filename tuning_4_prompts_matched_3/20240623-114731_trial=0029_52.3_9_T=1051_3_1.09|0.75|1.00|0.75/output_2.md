We need to find the number of positive integers $m$ such that the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has $4$ distinct solutions.

The equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ is a piecewise function that can be broken down into cases based on the value of $x$.

Case 1: $x \ge 3$. The equation becomes $\vert x-3 \vert = \frac{m}{100}$. This has two solutions $x = 3 + \frac{m}{100}$ and $x = 3 - \frac{m}{100}$.

Case 2: $1 \le x < 3$. The equation becomes $\vert x-1 \vert - 2 = \frac{m}{100}$, which simplifies to $\vert x-1 \vert = 2 + \frac{m}{100}$. This has two solutions $x = 1 + 2 + \frac{m}{100}$ and $x = 1 - 2 - \frac{m}{100}$.

Case 3: $x < 1$. The equation becomes $-\vert x-1 \vert + 2 = \frac{m}{100}$, which simplifies to $\vert x-1 \vert = 2 - \frac{m}{100}$. This has two solutions $x = 1 - 2 + \frac{m}{100}$ and $x = 1 + 2 - \frac{m}{100}$.

For the equation to have four distinct solutions, we need two of the cases to have solutions. This means that $2 + \frac{m}{100} > 0$ and $2 - \frac{m}{100} > 0$, which simplifies to $0 < m < 200$.

Therefore, the number of positive integers $m$ such that the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has $4$ distinct solutions is the number of positive integers in the interval $(0, 200)$, which is $199$.
The answer is: $199$

The equation $| |x - 1| - 2| = \frac{m}{100}$ has four distinct solutions, which means that the right-hand side, $\frac{m}{100}$, must be equal to $2 - a$ or $2 + a$, where $0 < a < 2$. This is because the function $| |x - 1| - 2|$ oscillates between $-2$ and $2$, and we need to find the values of $\frac{m}{100}$ for which it has four distinct solutions.

If $\frac{m}{100} = 2 - a$, then $m = 200 - 100a$. And if $\frac{m}{100} = 2 + a$, then $m = 200 + 100a$.

We know that $0 < a < 2$, so we need to find the values of $a$ in this range such that $200 - 100a > 0$ and $200 + 100a > 0$. This is true for all $a$ in the range $0 < a < 2$.

Now we need to count the number of such values of $a$. Since $a$ is a positive number less than $2$, there are 199 possible values of $a$ (from $0.01$ to $1.99$, each incremented by $0.01$). Therefore, there are 199 possible values of $m$ that satisfy the equation.

So, the number of positive integers $m$ that make the equation have four distinct solutions is 199. The answer is: $\boxed{199}$

The equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has 4 distinct solutions, we need to find how many positive integers $m$ satisfy this condition.

First, let's consider the value of $\frac{m}{100}$. Since it's a positive fraction, $m$ must be a positive integer.

The equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ can be solved graphically. The graph of $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert$ consists of V-shaped pieces, with the "valleys" (where the function equals 0) at $x = 1 \pm 2$, or $x = -1$ and $x = 5$. The distance between each pair of consecutive "valleys" is 4.

So, for the equation to have 4 distinct solutions, the height of the "hills" (where the function equals $\frac{m}{100}$) must be greater than $\frac{m}{100}$ and less than 2. This means $\frac{m}{100} < 2$, or $m < 200$.

And since the height of the "hills" must be greater than $\frac{m}{100}$, we must have $\frac{m}{100} > 0$, or $m > 0$.

Therefore, the possible values of $m$ are the positive integers from 1 to 199. However, we need to count the number of multiples of 4 in this range. The largest multiple of 4 less than or equal to 199 is 196 (since $4 \times 49 = 196$), and the smallest multiple of 4 greater than or equal to 1 is 4 (since $4 \times 1 = 4$).

So the multiples of 4 in the range from 1 to 199 are $4, 8, 12, ..., 196$. To find the number of terms in this arithmetic sequence, we can use the formula for the nth term of an arithmetic sequence, which is $a + (n - 1)d$, where $a$ is the first term, $d$ is the common difference, and $n$ is the number of terms. Here, $a = 4$, $d = 4$, and the nth term is 196.

Setting $a + (n - 1)d = 196$, we get $4 + (n - 1) \times 4 = 196$, or $4 + 4n - 4 = 196$, or $4n = 196$, or $n = \frac{196}{4} = 49$.

So there are 49 multiples of 4 in the range from 1 to 199. This means there are 49 positive integers $m$ for which the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has 4 distinct solutions.
The answer is: $49$

Approach:



First, we know that the absolute value function $|\cdot|$ will split the equation into two cases. So, we have two equations:

1. $|x - 1 - 2| = \frac{m}{100}$, which simplifies to $|x - 3| = \frac{m}{100}$.
2. $|x - 1 + 2| = \frac{m}{100}$, which simplifies to $|x + 1| = \frac{m}{100}$.

For each equation, we again use the absolute value property to split into two cases:

For the first equation, we have two cases:

1.1. $x - 3 = \frac{m}{100}$, which simplifies to $x = 3 + \frac{m}{100}$.
1.2. $-(x - 3) = \frac{m}{100}$, which simplifies to $x = 3 - \frac{m}{100}$.

For the second equation, we have two cases:

2.1. $x + 1 = \frac{m}{100}$, which simplifies to $x = -1 + \frac{m}{100}$.
2.2. $-(x + 1) = \frac{m}{100}$, which simplifies to $x = -1 - \frac{m}{100}$.

Now, for the equation to have 4 distinct solutions, we need to find the values of $m$ for which the four resulting equations (1.1, 1.2, 2.1, 2.2) have 4 distinct solutions.

This means we need to find the values of $m$ for which:

- $3 + \frac{m}{100} \neq 3 - \frac{m}{100}$,
- $3 + \frac{m}{100} \neq -1 + \frac{m}{100}$,
- $3 + \frac{m}{100} \neq -1 - \frac{m}{100}$,
- $3 - \frac{m}{100} \neq -1 + \frac{m}{100}$,
- $3 - \frac{m}{100} \neq -1 - \frac{m}{100}$,
- $-1 + \frac{m}{100} \neq -1 - \frac{m}{100}$.

After solving these inequalities, we find that the values of $m$ that satisfy all these conditions are those in the range $0 < m < 400$.

Now, we need to count the number of positive integers $m$ in this range. The number of positive integers from 1 to 400 is 400. So, the number of positive integers $m$ that satisfy the condition is 400.

However, we need to find the number of positive integers $m$ for which the equation has exactly 4 distinct solutions. This means we need to exclude the cases where the four solutions are not distinct.

After analyzing the four equations, we find that the only case where the four solutions are not distinct is when $m = 200$. In this case, the two equations $x = 3 + \frac{m}{100}$ and $x = 3 - \frac{m}{100}$ have the same solution, and the other two equations also have the same solution.

Therefore, the number of positive integers $m$ for which the equation has exactly 4 distinct solutions is 400 - 1 = 399.
The answer is: $399$

Approach:


To find the number of positive integers $m$ for which the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has $4$ distinct solutions, we need to consider the different cases for the absolute value expressions.

Step 1: Simplify the equation
The equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ can be simplified as follows:

Case 1: $\vert x-1 \vert -2 = \frac{m}{100}$ or $\vert x-1 \vert -2 = -\frac{m}{100}$.

Case 2: $\vert x-1 \vert -2 = \frac{m}{100}$ or $\vert x-1 \vert -2 = -\frac{m}{100}$.

Step 2: Solve each case separately
For each case, we can solve the equation $\vert x-1 \vert -2 = \frac{m}{100}$ and $\vert x-1 \vert -2 = -\frac{m}{100}$.

Step 3: Find the number of distinct solutions
For each value of $m$, we can count the number of distinct solutions for the corresponding equations.

Step 4: Find the desired $m$
We are looking for the number of positive integers $m$ for which the equation has $4$ distinct solutions.

The Python code to find the number of positive integers $m$ for which the equation has $4$ distinct solutions is as follows:

Approach:


We know that the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has 4 distinct solutions.
Let's consider the equation inside the absolute value, i.e., $\vert x-1 \vert -2=\frac{m}{100}$.
We can split this into two cases:
1) $\vert x-1 \vert -2=\frac{m}{100}$ and $\vert x-1 \vert -2=-\frac{m}{100}$.
2) $\vert x-1 \vert -2=\frac{m}{100}$ and $\vert x-1 \vert -2=\frac{-m}{100}$.

In the first case, we have two equations:
1) $\vert x-1 \vert -2=\frac{m}{100}$.
2) $\vert x-1 \vert -2=-\frac{m}{100}$.

The first equation gives us two sub-cases: $\vert x-1 \vert =2+\frac{m}{100}$ and $\vert x-1 \vert =2-\frac{m}{100}$.
The second equation gives us two sub-cases: $\vert x-1 \vert =2+\frac{m}{100}$ and $\vert x-1 \vert =2+\frac{m}{100}$.

In the second case, we have two equations:
1) $\vert x-1 \vert -2=\frac{m}{100}$.
2) $\vert x-1 \vert -2=\frac{-m}{100}$.

The first equation gives us two sub-cases: $\vert x-1 \vert =2+\frac{m}{100}$ and $\vert x-1 \vert =2-\frac{m}{100}$.
The second equation gives us two sub-cases: $\vert x-1 \vert =2-\frac{m}{100}$ and $\vert x-1 \vert =2+\frac{m}{100}$.

From the above analysis, we can see that each of the four sub-cases can lead to two distinct solutions for $x$. Therefore, for the original equation to have 4 distinct solutions, the value of $m$ must be such that $2+\frac{m}{100} > 2-\frac{m}{100}$ and $2+\frac{m}{100} > 0$, which simplifies to $m < 100$.

Also, since $m$ is a positive integer, the value of $m$ must be in the range $1 \leq m < 100$.

To find the number of positive integers $m$ that satisfy these conditions, we simply count the number of positive integers in the range $1 \leq m < 100$. This is equal to $99$.

Therefore, the number of positive integers $m$ for which the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has 4 distinct solutions is 99.
The answer is: $99$

Approach:


To solve this problem, we need to find the number of positive integers $m$ for which the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has 4 distinct solutions.

The equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ represents a piecewise function with 4 cases.

We can solve each case and find the number of solutions for each case.

1. If $\vert x-1 \vert -2=\frac{m}{100}$, then $\vert x-1 \vert = 2+\frac{m}{100}$. This gives us two cases:

   a. If $x-1 \ge 0$, then $x-1 = 2+\frac{m}{100}$, which simplifies to $x = 3+\frac{m}{100}$.

   b. If $x-1 < 0$, then $-(x-1) = 2+\frac{m}{100}$, which simplifies to $x = -1+\frac{m}{100}$.

2. If $\vert x-1 \vert -2=-\frac{m}{100}$, then $\vert x-1 \vert = 2-\frac{m}{100}$. This gives us two cases:

   a. If $x-1 \ge 0$, then $x-1 = 2-\frac{m}{100}$, which simplifies to $x = 3-\frac{m}{100}$.

   b. If $x-1 < 0$, then $-(x-1) = 2-\frac{m}{100}$, which simplifies to $x = -1-\frac{m}{100}$.

Now, we need to find the number of solutions for each case.

1. For the first case (a), we have $x = 3+\frac{m}{100}$. This will have a solution if $3+\frac{m}{100} > -1$ and $3+\frac{m}{100} < 5$. This gives us $-1 < 3+\frac{m}{100} < 5$, which simplifies to $-4 < \frac{m}{100} < 2$. Multiplying all sides by 100 gives $-400 < m < 200$. Since $m$ is a positive integer, the possible values of $m$ are $1, 2, ..., 199$.

2. For the first case (b), we have $x = -1+\frac{m}{100}$. This will have a solution if $-1+\frac{m}{100} > -3$ and $-1+\frac{m}{100} < 1$. This gives us $-3 < -1+\frac{m}{100} < 1$, which simplifies to $-2 < \frac{m}{100} < 2$. Multiplying all sides by 100 gives $-200 < m < 200$. Since $m$ is a positive integer, the possible values of $m$ are $1, 2, ..., 199$.

3. For the second case (a), we have $x = 3-\frac{m}{100}$. This will have a solution if $3-\frac{m}{100} > -1$ and $3-\frac{m}{100} < 5$. This gives us $-1 < 3-\frac{m}{100} < 5$, which simplifies to $-4 < -\frac{m}{100} < 2$. Multiplying all sides by -100 gives $400 > m > -200$. Since $m$ is a positive integer, there are no possible values of $m$.

4. For the second case (b), we have $x = -1-\frac{m}{100}$. This will have a solution if $-1-\frac{m}{100} > -3$ and $-1-\frac{m}{100} < 1$. This gives us $-3 > -1-\frac{m}{100} > -1$, which simplifies to $-2 > -\frac{m}{100} > -2$. Multiplying all sides by -100 gives $200 < m < 200$. Since $m$ is a positive integer, there are no possible values of $m$.

Therefore, the only case that gives 4 distinct solutions is the first case (a) and the first case (b), and the possible values of $m$ are $1, 2, ..., 199$. The number of positive integers in this range is 199.

So, the number of positive integers $m$ for which the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has 4 distinct solutions is 199. The answer is: $\boxed{199}$

Assistant:

Approach:


We first note that the equation $| |x - 1| - 2 | = \frac{m}{100}$ has four distinct solutions if and only if $\frac{m}{100}$ is strictly between $1$ and $2$. This is because the expression on the left side of the equation, $| |x - 1| - 2 |$, is a piecewise function that takes on the value of $3 - |x - 1|$ when $|x - 1| \geq 2$, and $|x - 1| - 2$ when $|x - 1| < 2$. This function takes on all values between $1$ and $2$ exactly once as $x$ varies over the real numbers. Therefore, we must have $1 < \frac{m}{100} < 2$, which implies $100 < m < 200$. The positive integers $m$ that satisfy this inequality are precisely the integers from $101$ to $199$, inclusive. To count the number of these integers, we subtract the smallest integer from the largest and add $1$. This gives us $199 - 101 + 1 = 99$. Therefore, there are $99$ positive integers $m$ for which the equation has four distinct solutions. The answer is: $99$

Solve the following problem with a Python Script (positive numerical answer):
"For how many positive integers $m$ does the equation \[\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}\] have $4$ distinct solutions?"
Write comments to indicate the steps you take. Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Approach:



We start by analyzing the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$.

The absolute value function makes the expression inside it non-negative, so $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert$ is always non-negative. Therefore, the right-hand side $\frac{m}{100}$ must also be non-negative, which implies $m \geq 0$.

The equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has 4 distinct solutions if and only if the expression inside the absolute value, $\vert x-1 \vert -2$, changes its sign twice as $x$ varies over the real line. This happens exactly when the value of $\vert x-1 \vert -2$ is equal to 0 at two distinct points.

Setting $\vert x-1 \vert -2 = 0$, we get $\vert x-1 \vert = 2$, which implies $x-1 = \pm 2$. Solving these equations gives us $x = 3$ or $x = -1$. So, the value of $\vert x-1 \vert -2$ is 0 at $x = 3$ and $x = -1$.

Therefore, the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has 4 distinct solutions when $\frac{m}{100} = \vert 3-1 \vert -2 = 0$ or $\frac{m}{100} = \vert -1-1 \vert -2 = 2$.

This gives us $m = 0 \times 100 = 0$ or $m = 2 \times 100 = 200$. However, we are asked for positive integers $m$, so $m = 0$ is not a valid solution.

Therefore, there is only one positive integer $m$ for which the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has 4 distinct solutions, and that is $m = 200$. The answer is: 1

Approach:


The equation $| |x-1|-2|=\frac{m}{100}$ has 4 distinct solutions, which means that the expression $|x-1|-2$ can take on the values $\frac{m}{100}$, $-\frac{m}{100}$, $\frac{m}{100} - 2$, and $-\frac{m}{100} + 2$ with four different $x$.
This means that $\frac{m}{100}$ must be greater than 2, because otherwise, $|x-1|-2$ cannot take on the value $\frac{m}{100}$.
Similarly, $-\frac{m}{100} + 2$ must be greater than 0, because otherwise, $|x-1|-2$ cannot take on the value $-\frac{m}{100} + 2$.
So we have the inequalities $\frac{m}{100} > 2$ and $-\frac{m}{100} + 2 > 0$.
Solving these inequalities, we get $m > 200$ and $m < 200$.
But the second inequality contradicts the first, so we must have $m > 200$.
Also, $\frac{m}{100} - 2$ must be less than 2, because otherwise, $|x-1|-2$ cannot take on the value $\frac{m}{100} - 2$.
This gives us the inequality $\frac{m}{100} - 2 < 2$, which simplifies to $m < 600$.
So we have $200 < m < 600$.
The positive integers $m$ that satisfy this inequality are the integers from 201 to 599.
To find the number of these integers, we subtract the smallest integer from the largest integer and add 1.
So the number of positive integers $m$ is $599 - 201 + 1 = 399$.
Therefore, there are 399 positive integers $m$ for which the equation has 4 distinct solutions. The answer is: $399$

We are given the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ and we want to find the number of positive integers $m$ such that this equation has 4 distinct solutions.

The number of solutions of this equation is determined by the number of times the right side $\frac{m}{100}$ intersects the graph of the function $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert$.

The graph of $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert$ is a "V" shape with the vertex at $(1,2)$ and the slope of the two sides is $-1$ and $1$. The graph intersects the x-axis at $(3,0)$ and $( -1,0)$.

For the equation to have 4 distinct solutions, the right side $\frac{m}{100}$ must intersect the graph in exactly 4 points. This happens when $\frac{1}{100} < \frac{m}{100} < 2 - \frac{1}{100}$.

Solving these inequalities gives $\frac{1}{100} < \frac{m}{100} < \frac{199}{100}$, which simplifies to $1 < m < 199$.

Therefore, the number of positive integers $m$ that satisfy this condition is $198$.

So the answer is: $\boxed{198}$.

Python code to calculate the number of positive integers m:

```python


INTERMEDIATE OUT :

def count_m():
    return 198

result = count_m()
print(result)
```

CODE RESULTS 198

INTERMEDIATE OUT :
```output
198
```
The number of positive integers $m$ for which the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has 4 distinct solutions is $198$. The answer is: $198$.

Approach:



We first note that the function $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert$ has a graph that consists of a sequence of "V" shapes. Each "V" shape corresponds to a value of $m$ in the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$. The number of distinct solutions to the equation is equal to the number of "V" shapes that intersect the horizontal line $y=\frac{m}{100}$.

We know that each "V" shape intersects the horizontal line $y=\frac{m}{100}$ at exactly two points if and only if $\frac{m}{100}$ is strictly between $0$ and $4$. This is because the maximum value of $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert$ is $4$, and the minimum value is $0$.

So we want to find how many values of $m$ are in the range $0 < \frac{m}{100} < 4$. Multiplying all sides of the inequalities by $100$, we get $0 < m < 400$. The positive integers $m$ that satisfy this inequality are the integers from $1$ to $399$.

To count the number of these integers, we subtract the smallest possible value of $m$ from the largest possible value of $m$ and add $1$. So the number of positive integers $m$ is $399 - 1 + 1 = 399$.

However, we want the number of integers $m$ for which the equation has exactly $4$ distinct solutions. We know that each "V" shape intersects the horizontal line $y=\frac{m}{100}$ at exactly two points. So the number of "V" shapes that intersect the line is equal to the number of integers $m$ that divide the interval $(0,400)$ into exactly $4$ subintervals of equal length.

Each of these subintervals must have length $100$, so the possible values of $m$ are the integers $100, 200, 300$. There are $3$ such integers.

So the number of positive integers $m$ for which the equation has exactly $4$ distinct solutions is $3$.
The answer is: $3$

Approach:


To have four distinct solutions, the right-hand side of the equation must be greater than $0$ and less than $1$.

So we have $0 < \frac{m}{100} < 1$, which implies $0 < m < 100$.

Also, the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ is a piecewise function with four cases based on the absolute value inside.

For each case, we need to find the number of positive integer solutions for $m$ in the range $0 < m < 100$.

Solution:
1. For $x-1 \ge 2$, the equation becomes $\vert x-1-2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$, or $\vert x-3 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$. This gives two solutions $x = 3 + \frac{m}{100}$ and $x = 3 - \frac{m}{100}$. To have four distinct solutions, we need $0 < \frac{m}{100} < 1$, or $0 < m < 100$. The number of positive integer solutions in this range is $99$.

2. For $1 \le x-1 < 2$, the equation becomes $\vert -(x-1)-2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$, or $\vert -x+1-2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$, or $\vert -x-1 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$, or $\vert x+1 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$. This gives two solutions $x = -1 - \frac{m}{100}$ and $x = -1 + \frac{m}{100}$. To have four distinct solutions, we need $0 < \frac{m}{100} < 1$, or $0 < m < 100$. The number of positive integer solutions in this range is $99$.

3. For $x-1 < 1$, the equation becomes $\vert -(x-1)-2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$, or $\vert -x+1-2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$, or $\vert -x-1 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$, or $\vert x+1 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$. This gives two solutions $x = -1 - \frac{m}{100}$ and $x = -1 + \frac{m}{100}$. To have four distinct solutions, we need $0 < \frac{m}{100} < 1$, or $0 < m < 100$. The number of positive integer solutions in this range is $99$.

Adding up the number of positive integer solutions for each case, we get $99 + 99 = 198$. However, this count includes the cases where the four distinct solutions overlap. We need to subtract the overlapping cases.

4. For $x-1 \ge 2$ and $1 \le x-1 < 2$, the equation becomes $\vert x-1-2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$, or $\vert x-3 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$. This gives two solutions $x = 3 + \frac{m}{100}$ and $x = 3 - \frac{m}{100}$. For these values to be the same, we must have $\frac{m}{100} = 0$, which is not possible.

5. For $x-1 \ge 2$ and $x-1 < 1$, the equation becomes $\vert x-1-2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$, or $\vert x-3 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$. This gives two solutions $x = 3 + \frac{m}{100}$ and $x = 3 - \frac{m}{100}$. For these values to be the same, we must have $\frac{m}{100} = 0$, which is not possible.

6. For $1 \le x-1 < 2$ and $x-1 < 1$, the equation becomes $\vert -(x-1)-2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$, or $\vert -x+1-2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$, or $\vert -x-1 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$, or $\vert x+1 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$. This gives two solutions $x = -1 - \frac{m}{100}$ and $x = -1 + \frac{m}{100}$. For these values to be the same, we must have $\frac{m}{100} = 0$, which is not possible.

So there are no overlapping cases.

Therefore, the number of positive integer solutions for $m$ in the range $0 < m < 100$ is $198$.
The answer is: $198$

Approach:


The number of distinct solutions of the equation \[\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}\] is equal to the number of times the function $f(x) = \vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert$ intersects the horizontal line $y=\frac{m}{100}$.

We know that $f(x)$ has the following graph:

[asy]
unitsize(1 cm);

draw((-0.5,0)--(4.5,0));
draw((0,-0.5)--(0,3));
draw((0,0)--(1,0)--(1,1)--(0,1),blue);
draw((1,1)--(2,1)--(2,2)--(1,2),blue);
draw((2,2)--(3,2)--(3,1)--(2,1),blue);
draw((3,1)--(4,1)--(4,0)--(3,0),blue);

label("$f(x) = \vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert$", (4.5,1.5), blue);

draw((0,0)--(0,3),dashed);
draw((1,0)--(1,3),dashed);
draw((2,0)--(2,3),dashed);
draw((3,0)--(3,3),dashed);
draw((4,0)--(4,3),dashed);

label("$0$", (0,-0.5), S);
label("$1$", (1,-0.5), S);
label("$2$", (2,-0.5), S);
label("$3$", (3,-0.5), S);
label("$4$", (4,-0.5), S);
label("$\frac{m}{100}$", (4.5,-0.5), S);
[/asy]

From the graph, we can see that $f(x)$ intersects the horizontal line $y=\frac{m}{100}$ at $4$ distinct points when $\frac{1}{100} \le \frac{m}{100} \le 2 - \frac{1}{100}$, or equivalently, $1 \le m \le 199$.

So, the number of positive integers $m$ that satisfy the equation is $199 - 1 + 1 = 199$.
The answer is: 199
