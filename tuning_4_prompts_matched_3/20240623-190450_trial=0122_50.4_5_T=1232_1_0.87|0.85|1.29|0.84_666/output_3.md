Interesting, let's analyze step by step:



The equation $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + (\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ implies that $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$, which further implies $x + y = \pm 10$ and $x - y = \pm 10$. These are the equations of the lines $x + y = 10$, $x + y = -10$, $x - y = 10$, and $x - y = -10$.

Similarly, the equation $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + (\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ implies that $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$, which further implies $x = \pm 8$ and $y = \pm 8$. These are the equations of the lines $x = 8$, $x = -8$, $y = 8$, and $y = -8$.

The intersection of these lines forms a square with side length 10 (the distance between the lines $x + y = 10$ and $x + y = -10$, or the distance between the lines $x - y = 10$ and $x - y = -10$). The area of this square is $10^2 = 100$.

So, the area of the convex polygon is 100.
The answer is: $100$

Interesting, let's analyze step by step:



The expression is equal to zero if and only if both $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ and $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$, and also $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ and $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$.

Each of these equations is satisfied if and only if $\vert x + y \vert = 10$, $\vert x - y \vert = 10$, $\vert x \vert = 8$, and $\vert y \vert = 8$.

The solutions to $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ are given by the lines $x + y = 10$ and $x + y = -10$. Similarly, the solutions to $\vert x - y \vert = 10$ are given by the lines $x - y = 10$ and $x - y = -10$. The solutions to $\vert x \vert = 8$ are given by the lines $x = 8$ and $x = -8$. The solutions to $\vert y \vert = 8$ are given by the lines $y = 8$ and $y = -8$.

These lines form a square with side length 16. The area of this square is $16^2 = 256$.

So, the area of the convex polygon is 256 square units.

To confirm, we can use Python to calculate the area:

```python


INTERMEDIATE OUT :

def calculate_area():
    side_length = 16
    area = side_length**2
    return area

result = calculate_area()
print(result)
```

CODE RESULTS 256

INTERMEDIATE OUT :
```output
256
```
The area of the convex polygon is $256$ square units. The answer is: $256$

Interesting, let's analyze step by step:



The product of two numbers is zero if and only if at least one of the numbers is zero. Therefore, the given equation is equivalent to the following two systems of equations:

1. $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ and $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ and $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$.
2. $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$.

From the first system of equations, we have $\vert x + y \vert = 10$, $\vert x \vert = 8$, and $\vert y \vert = 8$. The solutions to these equations are:

1. $x + y = 10$ or $x + y = -10$.
2. $x = 8$ or $x = -8$.
3. $y = 8$ or $y = -8$.

From the second equation, we have $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. Considering all possible combinations of the solutions from the first system, we find that the only combination that satisfies this equation is $x = 8$ and $y = -8$.

So, the vertices of the polygon are $(8, 8)$, $(8, -8)$, $(-8, 8)$, and $(-8, -8)$. These points form a square with side length $16$. The area of the square is $16^2 = 256$.

Therefore, the area of the convex polygon is $256$.
The answer is: $256$

Interesting, let's analyze step by step:



The given equation is:
$$((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0.$$

The product of two factors equals zero if and only if at least one of the factors equals zero. Therefore, the points that satisfy the equation are the union of the points that satisfy each of the following equations:

1. $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$.
2. $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$.
3. $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$.
4. $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$.

For equation 1, we have $\vert x + y \vert = 10$, which means $x + y = 10$ or $x + y = -10$.
For equation 2, we have $\vert x - y \vert = 10$, which means $x - y = 10$ or $x - y = -10$.
For equation 3, we have $\vert x \vert = 8$, which means $x = 8$ or $x = -8$.
For equation 4, we have $\vert y \vert = 8$, which means $y = 8$ or $y = -8$.

Now we analyze the intersections of these lines to form a polygon.
The lines $x + y = 10$, $x + y = -10$, $x - y = 10$, $x - y = -10$, $x = 8$, $x = -8$, $y = 8$, and $y = -8$ form a square with side length 10.
The area of this square is $10^2 = 100$.

So the area of the convex polygon is 100 square units.
The answer is: $100$

Interesting, let's analyze step by step:



The equation is given as:

$$((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0.$$

This equation is equal to zero if and only if either of the two factors is equal to zero. Therefore, we have two sets of equations:

1. $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ and $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$.
2. $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ and $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$.

From the first set of equations, we get:

1. $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$.
2. $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$.

From the second set of equations, we get:

1. $\vert x - y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$.
2. $\vert x - y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$.

The solutions to these equations are:

1. $x = \pm 8$, $y = \pm 2$.
2. $x = \pm 2$, $y = \pm 8$.

The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying the equation are therefore:

$$\left(8, 2\right), \left(-8, -2\right), \left(2, 8\right), \left(-2, -8\right).$$

The area of the convex polygon formed by these points is a square with side length $10$. The area of this square is $10^2 = 100$.

So the area of the convex polygon is $100$. The problem asks for a positive numerical answer, and $100$ is a positive integer, so our answer is valid.

The answer is: $100$

Interesting, let's analyze step by step:



1. The equation given in the problem is a product of two terms equal to zero. Therefore, either the first term is zero or the second term is zero. This gives us two sets of equations:

   a) $|x+y| - 10 = 0$ and $|x-y| - 10 = 0$,
   b) $|x| - 8 = 0$ and $|y| - 8 = 0$.

2. Solving these sets of equations, we get the following vertices of the polygon:

   a) For the first set of equations, we have $|x+y| = 10$ and $|x-y| = 10$. This gives us the vertices $(8, 2)$, $(8, -2)$, $(-8, 2)$, and $(-8, -2)$.
   b) For the second set of equations, we have $|x| = 8$ and $|y| = 8$. This gives us the vertices $(8, 8)$, $(8, -8)$, $(-8, 8)$, and $(-8, -8)$.

3. To find the area of the polygon, we can use the Shoelace formula. The Shoelace formula takes the coordinates of the vertices of a polygon and calculates its area. The formula is given by:

   $A = \frac{1}{2} |(x_1y_2 + x_2y_3 + ... + x_ny_1) - (y_1x_2 + y_2x_3 + ... + y_nx_1)|$.

4. Applying the Shoelace formula to the vertices $(8, 2)$, $(8, -2)$, $(-8, 2)$, and $(-8, -2)$, we get the area $A_1 = 96$.
5. Applying the Shoelace formula to the vertices $(8, 8)$, $(8, -8)$, $(-8, 8)$, and $(-8, -8)$, we get the area $A_2 = 128$.
6. The total area of the polygon is the sum of $A_1$ and $A_2$, which is $A = A_1 + A_2 = 96 + 128 = 224$.

7. Since the area is a positive integer, we have found the correct answer. The area of the convex polygon is $224$. The answer is: $224$.

Interesting, let's analyze step by step:



The given equation is a product of two terms equal to zero, so either the first term is zero or the second term is zero.

The first term is $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)$, which equals to zero if and only if both $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. This implies that the points $(x, y)$ must lie on the lines $x + y = 10$ and $x - y = 10$ or their opposites $x + y = -10$ and $x - y = -10$. These lines form a square with side length 10.

The second term is $((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2)$, which equals to zero if and only if both $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$. This implies that the points $(x, y)$ must lie on the lines $x = 8$ and $y = 8$ or their opposites $x = -8$ and $y = -8$. These lines form a square with side length 16.

The intersection of these two squares is a smaller square with side length 8. The area of this square is $8^2 = 64$.

The answer is: $64$

Interesting, let's analyze step by step:



The equation given is:
$$((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$$

The product of two terms equals zero if and only if one or both terms are zero. Therefore, the points that satisfy this equation are the union of the points that satisfy:
1. $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$
2. $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$
3. $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$
4. $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$

Each of these equations implies that $\vert x + y \vert = 10$, $\vert x - y \vert = 10$, $\vert x \vert = 8$, or $\vert y \vert = 8$. These equations represent four squares in the coordinate plane:
1. Square with side length 20 centered at the origin.
2. Square with side length 20 centered at the origin, but rotated 45 degrees.
3. Square with side length 16 centered at the origin, with vertices at $(\pm 8, 0)$ and $(0, \pm 8)$.
4. Square with side length 16 centered at the origin, with vertices at $(\pm 8, 0)$ and $(0, \pm 8)$, but rotated 45 degrees.

The intersection of these squares is a regular octagon with side length 8$\sqrt{2}$ and area $320$. The area of the convex polygon is therefore 320.

To calculate this in sympy, we can use the following steps:

1. Define the side length of the octagon: $s = 8\sqrt{2}$.
2. Calculate the area of the octagon: $A = \frac{1}{2} * s^2 * (2 + 2\sqrt{2})$.

Now let's implement this in sympy:

```python


INTERMEDIATE OUT :

from sympy import symbols, sqrt, simplify

def area_of_octagon():
    s = 8 * sqrt(2)  # side length of the octagon
    A = simplify(1/2 * s**2 * (2 + 2*sqrt(2)))  # area of the octagon
    return A

result = area_of_octagon()
print(result)
```

CODE RESULTS 128.0 + 128.0*sqrt(2)

INTERMEDIATE OUT :
```output
128.0 + 128.0*sqrt(2)
```
The area of the octagon is $128 + 128\sqrt{2}$. However, we can see that the area of the octagon should be a positive integer. Let's simplify the result further:

```python


INTERMEDIATE OUT :

from sympy import nsimplify

def simplified_area():
    area = 128 + 128*sqrt(2)
    simplified_area = nsimplify(area)
    return simplified_area

result = simplified_area()
print(result)
```

CODE RESULTS 128 + 128*sqrt(2)

INTERMEDIATE OUT :
```output
128 + 128*sqrt(2)
```
The simplified result is the same as the original result. This indicates that we might have made a mistake in our calculations. Let's go back and reevaluate the area of the octagon.

The area of a regular octagon with side length $s$ is given by the formula $A = 2 * s^2 * (1 + \sqrt{2})$. Let's use this formula to calculate the area of the octagon:

```python


INTERMEDIATE OUT :

def area_of_octagon():

Below is a math problem you are to solve (positive numerical answer):
"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"

  * Implement these functions step-by-step, commenting each line for clarity.
- Calculate the final answer and verify it's a positive integer.
- Output the result within \boxed{}.

Assistant:

Interesting, let's analyze step by step:



The equation is $0$ if and only if at least one of the factors is $0$. This means that the points $(x, y)$ that satisfy the equation are those that make either the first factor $0$ or the second factor $0$.

The first factor is $0$ if and only if $|x + y| = 10$ or $|x - y| = 10$. These are the equations of two pairs of parallel lines, each pair being $10$ units apart.

The second factor is $0$ if and only if $|x| = 8$ or $|y| = 8$, which are the equations of two pairs of parallel lines, each pair being $8$ units apart.

The intersection of these lines form a square with side length $10$ (from the first factor) and a smaller square with side length $8$ (from the second factor). The convex polygon is the outer square.

The area of the square with side length $10$ is $10^2 = 100$.

So, the area of the convex polygon is $100$. The answer is: $100$
