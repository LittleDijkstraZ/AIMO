Solve the following problem with a Python Script (positive numerical answer):
"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"
Write comments to indicate the steps you take. Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Approach:

 The equation $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ implies $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. The equation $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ implies $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$.
The solutions to $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$ are four lines: $x + y = \pm10$ and $x - y = \pm10$.
The solutions to $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$ are four lines: $x = \pm8$ and $y = \pm8$.
The intersections of these lines form a square with side length 16.
The area of this square is $16^2 = 256$. The answer is: $256$

Solve the following problem with a Python Script (positive numerical answer):
"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"

Approach:


The expression equals to zero if and only if both of the factors equals to zero. Hence, we have two sets of equations:
1. $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0 \Rightarrow \vert x + y \vert = 10$,
2. $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0 \Rightarrow \vert x - y \vert = 10$,
3. $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0 \Rightarrow \vert x \vert = 8$,
4. $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0 \Rightarrow \vert y \vert = 8$.

From the above equations, we can deduce the four vertices of the square are $(8,8)$, $(-8,8)$, $(-8,-8)$, and $(8,-8)$. The side length of the square is $16$. Therefore, the area of the square is $16^2 = 256$.
The answer is: $256$

Solve the following problem with a Python Script (positive numerical answer):
"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"

Approach:


The expression equals zero when either of the factors equals zero. The factors are:
$$((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)$$
and
$$((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2)$$
Each of these factors is a square, so for the whole expression to equal zero, each factor must be zero. 
Setting each factor to zero and solving the resulting absolute value equations gives the vertices of the polygon:
$$|x+y| = 10 \Rightarrow x+y = \pm 10$$
$$|x-y| = 10 \Rightarrow x-y = \pm 10$$
$$|x| = 8 \Rightarrow x = \pm 8$$
$$|y| = 8 \Rightarrow y = \pm 8$$
Combining these equations, we find the vertices of the polygon to be:
$$(8,8), (8,-8), (-8,8), (-8,-8), (10,0), (-10,0), (0,10), (0,-10)$$
These points form a square with side length 16. To find the area of the square, we use the formula for the area of a square, which is the side length squared: $16^2 = 256$. So the area of the convex polygon is 256 square units. The answer is: $256$

Solve the following problem with a Python Script (positive numerical answer):
"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"
Write comments to indicate the steps you take. Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Assistant:

Approach:

 The given equation implies that either $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$. 

This simplifies to $\vert x + y \vert = 10$, $\vert x - y \vert = 10$, $\vert x \vert = 8$, or $\vert y \vert = 8$.

The absolute value equations can be split into two cases:

1. For $\vert x + y \vert = 10$, we have $x + y = 10$ or $x + y = -10$.
2. For $\vert x - y \vert = 10$, we have $x - y = 10$ or $x - y = -10$.
3. For $\vert x \vert = 8$, we have $x = 8$ or $x = -8$.
4. For $\vert y \vert = 8$, we have $y = 8$ or $y = -8$.

The intersection of these cases gives us the vertices of the polygon: $(8,8)$, $(8,-8)$, $(-8,8)$, $(-8,-8)$, $(10,0)$, $(0,10)$, $(-10,0)$, and $(0,-10)$.

Now we can draw the polygon and calculate its area. The polygon is a square with side length 16 (since the distance between $(8,8)$ and $(8,-8)$ is 16).

The area of the square is $16^2 = 256$.

Therefore, the area of the convex polygon is $256$.
The answer is: $256$
