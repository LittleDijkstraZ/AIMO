Approach:



We are looking for the number of positive integers $m$ for which the equation $| |x - 1| - 2 | = \frac{m}{100}$ has four distinct solutions. The right-hand side of the equation, $\frac{m}{100}$, must be a positive number, so $m$ must be a positive integer. The number of solutions will depend on the value of $m$.

When $| |x - 1| - 2 | = \frac{m}{100}$, the expression $|x - 1| - 2$ is an integer number of steps of size $\frac{1}{100}$ from $-2$ to $2$. The number of such steps is $400$, but we need to consider the cases separately:

1. If $|x - 1| - 2 > 0$, then we have $|x - 1| = 2 + \frac{m}{100}$, which simplifies to $x - 1 = 2 + \frac{m}{100}$ or $x - 1 = -(2 + \frac{m}{100})$. The first equation gives $x = 3 + \frac{m}{100}$, and the second equation gives $x = -1 - \frac{m}{100}$.
2. If $|x - 1| - 2 < 0$, then we have $|x - 1| = 2 - \frac{m}{100}$, which simplifies to $x - 1 = 2 - \frac{m}{100}$ or $x - 1 = -(2 - \frac{m}{100})$. The first equation gives $x = 3 - \frac{m}{100}$, and the second equation gives $x = -1 + \frac{m}{100}$.

For each of these equations, we need to count the number of distinct solutions. This will depend on the value of $m$. 

For the first equation, $x = 3 + \frac{m}{100}$, the number of distinct solutions is the number of integers $m$ for which $-1 < \frac{m}{100} < 2$, which simplifies to $-100 < m < 200$. This gives us $101$ possible values for $m$.

For the second equation, $x = 3 - \frac{m}{100}$, the number of distinct solutions is the number of integers $m$ for which $0 < \frac{m}{100} < 3$, which simplifies to $0 < m < 300$. This gives us $299$ possible values for $m$.

For the third equation, $x = -1 - \frac{m}{100}$, the number of distinct solutions is the number of integers $m$ for which $-3 < -\frac{m}{100} < -2$, which simplifies to $300 < m < 100$. This gives us $0$ possible values for $m$.

For the fourth equation, $x = -1 + \frac{m}{100}$, the number of distinct solutions is the number of integers $m$ for which $-2 < -\frac{m}{100} < -1$, which simplifies to $200 < m < 100$. This gives us $0$ possible values for $m$.

Therefore, the number of positive integers $m$ for which the equation has four distinct solutions is the number of values of $m$ in the intersection of the intervals $(-100, 200)$ and $(0, 299)$, which is the interval $(0, 200)$. There are $200$ positive integers in this interval.
The answer is: 200

Approach:


The equation $| |x-1| -2 | = \frac{m}{100}$ has 4 distinct solutions if $\frac{m}{100} = 2$ or $\frac{m}{100} = 1$.
For the first case, when $\frac{m}{100} = 2$, we have $m = 200$.
For the second case, when $\frac{m}{100} = 1$, we have $m = 100$.
Thus, there are 2 values of $m$ for which the equation has 4 distinct solutions. The answer is: $2$

Approach:

 To solve this problem, we need to find out for how many positive integers $m$ the equation \[\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}\] has $4$ distinct solutions.

The equation \[\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}\] involves absolute values, which makes it a bit complex to solve directly. However, we can simplify it by considering the different cases of the absolute values.

Case 1: If $\vert x-1 \vert -2 > 0$, then the equation becomes \[\vert x-1 \vert -2 = \frac{m}{100}.\] This implies $\vert x-1 \vert = 2 + \frac{m}{100}$, and further implies $x-1 = 2 + \frac{m}{100}$ or $x-1 = -(2 + \frac{m}{100})$. So we have two equations here:

1. $x-1 = 2 + \frac{m}{100}$ gives $x = 3 + \frac{m}{100}$.
2. $x-1 = -(2 + \frac{m}{100})$ gives $x = -1 - \frac{m}{100}$.

Now we need to check when these two solutions are distinct. This happens when $-1 - \frac{m}{100} \neq 3 + \frac{m}{100}$, which simplifies to $-1 - 3 \neq \frac{2m}{100}$, or $-4 \neq \frac{m}{50}$. This is true for all $m \neq 200$.

Case 2: If $\vert x-1 \vert -2 < 0$, then the equation becomes \[\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=-\left(\frac{m}{100}\right).\] But the left side is always non-negative, and the right side is always non-negative. So there are no solutions in this case.

Case 3: If $\vert x-1 \vert -2 = 0$, then the equation becomes \[\vert x-1 \vert = 2,\] which implies $x-1 = 2$ or $x-1 = -2$, and gives $x = 3$ or $x = -1$. These are two distinct solutions.

Therefore, the equation \[\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}\] has $4$ distinct solutions when $m \neq 200$. There are $199$ such positive integers $m$. The answer is: $199$

Approach:

 The equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has $4$ distinct solutions when $\frac{m}{100}$ is between $1$ and $2$ (inclusive), because the function $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert$ oscillates between $1$ and $2$ as $x$ varies. Therefore, we need to find the number of positive integers $m$ such that $1 \leq \frac{m}{100} \leq 2$.

Multiplying all sides of the inequalities by $100$ gives $100 \leq m \leq 200$. The positive integers $m$ that satisfy this inequality are precisely the integers from $100$ to $200$, inclusive. To find the number of these integers, we subtract the smallest possible value of $m$ from the largest possible value of $m$ and then add $1$ (to include both endpoints).

Number of integers = $200 - 100 + 1 = 101$.

Therefore, there are $101$ positive integers $m$ such that the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has $4$ distinct solutions. The answer is: $101$

Approach:



We first rewrite the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ as $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=0.01m$. 

We consider the two absolute value terms separately. The inner absolute value equation $\vert x-1 \vert -2 = 0.01m$ can be split into two cases:

1. $\vert x-1 \vert -2 = 0.01m$, and 
2. $\vert x-1 \vert -2 = -0.01m$.

For each of these cases, we can further split them into two sub-cases based on the absolute value term $\vert x-1 \vert$:

1.1. $x-1 -2 = 0.01m$, or 
1.2. $-(x-1) -2 = 0.01m$.

Similarly, for the second case:

2.1. $x-1 -2 = -0.01m$, or 
2.2. $-(x-1) -2 = -0.01m$.

For each of these sub-cases, we can solve for $x$:

1.1. $x = 1 + 2 + 0.01m = 3 + 0.01m$,
1.2. $x = 1 + 2 - 0.01m = 3 - 0.01m$,
2.1. $x = 1 + 2 - 0.01m = 3 - 0.01m$,
2.2. $x = 1 + 2 + 0.01m = 3 + 0.01m$.

Comparing the four solutions, we find that the solutions $x = 3 + 0.01m$ and $x = 3 - 0.01m$ are the same. So we only need to consider the two distinct solutions $x = 3 + 0.01m$ and $x = 3 - 0.01m$.

The equation has 4 distinct solutions when the distance between these two solutions is greater than or equal to 2, i.e., $|3 + 0.01m - (3 - 0.01m)| \geq 2$, which simplifies to $0.02m \geq 2$. Solving for $m$ gives $m \geq 100$. 

Since $m$ is a positive integer, the least such value for $m$ is 100. Therefore, there is only one positive integer $m$ for which the equation has 4 distinct solutions, namely $m=100$.

The answer is: 1

Approach:



1. Consider the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$. For this equation to have 4 distinct solutions, the value of $\frac{m}{100}$ must be such that the equation results in two disjoint pairs of linear equations with two solutions each.

2. When $\vert x-1 \vert -2 > 0$, we have $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\vert x-1 \vert -2 = \frac{m}{100}$. This simplifies to $\vert x-1 \vert = 2 + \frac{m}{100}$. This results in two linear equations $x-1 = 2 + \frac{m}{100}$ and $x-1 = -2 - \frac{m}{100}$, or $x = 3 + \frac{m}{100}$ and $x = -1 - \frac{m}{100}$.

3. When $\vert x-1 \vert -2 < 0$, we have $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=-\vert x-1 \vert +2 = \frac{m}{100}$. This simplifies to $\vert x-1 \vert = 2 - \frac{m}{100}$. This results in two linear equations $x-1 = 2 - \frac{m}{100}$ and $x-1 = -2 + \frac{m}{100}$, or $x = 3 - \frac{m}{100}$ and $x = -1 + \frac{m}{100}$.

4. The four distinct solutions are $3 + \frac{m}{100}$, $-1 - \frac{m}{100}$, $3 - \frac{m}{100}$, and $-1 + \frac{m}{100}$. These four solutions are distinct if and only if the differences between any two of them are not equal.

5. The differences between the solutions are: $(3 + \frac{m}{100}) - (-1 - \frac{m}{100}) = 4$, $(3 + \frac{m}{100}) - (3 - \frac{m}{100}) = \frac{2m}{100}$, $(-1 - \frac{m}{100}) - (-1 + \frac{m}{100}) = \frac{2m}{100}$, $(3 - \frac{m}{100}) - (-1 + \frac{m}{100}) = 4$. All of these differences are equal only when $m=0$. For $m=0$, the equation does not have four distinct solutions.

6. Therefore, for the equation to have four distinct solutions, the value of $\frac{m}{100}$ must be such that $\frac{2m}{100} \neq 4$. This is equivalent to $m \neq 200$.

7. Since $m$ is a positive integer, the only possible values of $m$ are the positive integers less than 200. There are 199 such integers.
The answer is: $199$

Approach:

 The equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has $4$ distinct solutions if and only if $\frac{m}{100} \in (0,2)$. Hence, $0<\frac{m}{100}<2$, which implies $0<m<200$. The positive integers $m$ that satisfy this inequality are the integers from $1$ to $199$. We need to count the number of these integers.

```python
