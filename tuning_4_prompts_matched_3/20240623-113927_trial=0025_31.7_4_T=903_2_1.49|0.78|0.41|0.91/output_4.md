Question (hint: positive numerical answer):
"A function $f: \mathbb N \to \mathbb N$ satisfies the following two conditions for all positive integers $n$:$f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$ and $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$. Calculate $f(100)$."
Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:



First, we need to find the value of $f(1)$ using the second equation. We set $n=1$ in the equation $f(2n) = 2f(n) + 1$ to get $f(2) = 2f(1) + 1$.

Then, since $f(f(f(1))) = 8(1) - 7 = -1$, and we know $f(f(f(1))) = f(f(2))$ because when $n=1$, $2n = 2$, we can set $n=2$ in the equation $f(f(f(n))) = 8n - 7$ to get $f(f(2)) = 8(2) - 7 = 9$.

So, we have $f(2) = 9$. Now, substitute $f(2) = 9$ into the equation $f(2n) = 2f(n) + 1$ to get $f(4) = 2f(2) + 1 = 2(9) + 1 = 19$.

Then, we have $f(f(f(2))) = 8(2) - 7 = 9$, and since $f(f(f(2))) = f(f(4))$, we can set $n=4$ in the equation $f(f(f(n))) = 8n - 7$ to get $f(f(4)) = 8(4) - 7 = 25$. So, we have $f(4) = 25$.

Now, substitute $f(4) = 25$ into the equation $f(2n) = 2f(n) + 1$ to get $f(8) = 2f(4) + 1 = 2(25) + 1 = 51$.

Then, we have $f(f(f(4))) = 8(4) - 7 = 25$, and since $f(f(f(4))) = f(f(8))$, we can set $n=8$ in the equation $f(f(f(n))) = 8n - 7$ to get $f(f(8)) = 8(8) - 7 = 59$. So, we have $f(8) = 59$.

Now, we can see a pattern that $f(2^k) = 3 + 2^k(2^k - 1)$. Let's check this for $k=1, 2, 3, 4$:

- For $k=1$, $f(2) = 3 + 2(2 - 1) = 3 + 2 = 5$, but $f(2) = 9$. So, the pattern doesn't hold for $k=1$.
- For $k=2$, $f(4) = 3 + 4(4 - 1) = 3 + 12 = 15$, but $f(4) = 25$. So, the pattern doesn't hold for $k=2$.
- For $k=3$, $f(8) = 3 + 8(8 - 1) = 3 + 56 = 59$, and $f(8) = 59$. So, the pattern holds for $k=3$.

Since the pattern holds for $k=3$, we can assume it holds for all positive integers $k$. Now, let's find $f(100)$. Since $100 = 2^2 \cdot 5^2$, we can use the pattern $f(2^k) = 3 + 2^k(2^k - 1)$ to find $f(100)$:

$$f(100) = f(2^2 \cdot 5^2) = f((2^2)(5^2)) = f(4 \cdot 25) = f(f(f(25))).$$

Since $f(25) = 3 + 25(25 - 1) = 3 + 600 = 603$, we can substitute $n=25$ into the equation $f(f(f(n))) = 8n - 7$ to get $f(f(f(25))) = 8(25) - 7 = 200$. So, we have $f(100) = 200$. The answer is: $\boxed{200}$

Question (hint: positive numerical answer):
"A function $f: \mathbb N \to \mathbb N$ satisfies the following two conditions for all positive integers $n$:$f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$ and $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$. Calculate $f(100)$."
Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:



To find the value of $f(100)$, we first need to find a pattern in the function $f$.

From the second equation, we know that $f(2n) = 2f(n) + 1$. Let's try to find the value of $f(1)$ using this equation. We have $f(2) = 2f(1) + 1$. But from the first equation, we know that $f(f(f(1))) = 8(1) - 7 = -1$. And since $f$ maps from $\mathbb{N}$ to $\mathbb{N}$, $f(1)$ must be a positive integer. Therefore, we must have $f(f(f(1))) = 1$, so $f(1) = 1$.

Now, let's find $f(2)$ using the second equation. We have $f(4) = 2f(2) + 1$. But from the first equation, we know that $f(f(f(2))) = 8(2) - 7 = 9$. And since $f(2)$ is also a positive integer, we must have $f(f(f(2))) = 9$, so $f(2) = 3$.

Now, let's find $f(3)$ using the second equation. We have $f(6) = 2f(3) + 1$. But from the first equation, we know that $f(f(f(3))) = 8(3) - 7 = 19$. Since $f(3)$ is also a positive integer, we must have $f(f(f(3))) = 19$, so $f(3) = 5$.

Now, we can continue to find the values of $f(4)$, $f(5)$, and so on, using the second equation. After finding the values of $f(1)$, $f(2)$, $f(3)$, and so on, we can observe a pattern that $f(n) = 2n - 1$ for all positive integers $n$.

Now, we can find the value of $f(100)$ using this pattern. We have $f(100) = 2(100) - 1 = 199$.

So, the value of $f(100)$ is $199$. The answer is: $199$

Question (hint: positive numerical answer):
"A function $f: \mathbb N \to \mathbb N$ satisfies the following two conditions for all positive integers $n$:$f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$ and $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$. Calculate $f(100)$."
Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:



First, let's apply the second equation to the first equation: $f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$ becomes $f(f(2f(n)+1))=8n-7$.
Now, let's substitute $n = f(n)$ into the second equation: $f(2f(n)+1)=2f(f(n))+1$.
Substituting this into the equation we got from the first equation gives us $f(2f(f(n))+1)=8f(n)-7$.
Now, let's substitute $n = f(n)$ into this equation again: $f(2f(f(f(n)))+1)=8f(f(n))-7$.
Since $f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$, this equation simplifies to $f(2(8n-7)+1)=8f(f(n))-7$.
Expanding the left side gives $f(16n-14+1)=8f(f(n))-7$, or $f(16n-13)=8f(f(n))-7$.
Now, let's set $n = 2$: $f(16*2-13)=8f(f(2))-7$ simplifies to $f(13)=8f(f(2))-7$.
Similarly, setting $n = 1$ gives $f(16*1-13)=8f(f(1))-7$, or $f(3)=8f(f(1))-7$.
From the second equation, we have $f(2)=2f(1)+1$.
Substituting this into the equation $f(3)=8f(f(1))-7$, we get $f(3)=8f(2f(1)+1)-7$.
Simplifying this gives $f(3)=8(2f(1)+1)-7$, or $f(3)=16f(1)+8-7$, or $f(3)=16f(1)+1$.
We already know that $f(13)=8f(f(2))-7$, and substituting $f(2)=2f(1)+1$ gives $f(13)=8f(2f(1)+1)-7$.
Simplifying this gives $f(13)=8(2f(1)+1)-7$, or $f(13)=16f(1)+8-7$, or $f(13)=16f(1)+1$.
Since $f(3)=16f(1)+1$, we have $f(13)=f(3)$.
Since $f(13)$ can only have one value, we can conclude that $f(1)=1$.
Now we can use the second equation to find the values of $f(2)$, $f(3)$, $f(4)$, etc.
Continuing this process, we find that $f(2)=3$, $f(3)=7$, $f(4)=15$, and so on.
By examining the pattern, we find that $f(n)=2^n-1$ for all positive integers $n$.
To find $f(100)$, we simply substitute $n = 100$ into the equation: $f(100)=2^{100}-1$.
Therefore, the value of $f(100)$ is $2^{100}-1$.
The answer is: $2^{100}-1$

Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:



To find $f(100)$, we can use the second equation $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$. We can apply this equation repeatedly to find $f(100)$ in terms of $f(50)$, $f(25)$, and so on.

First, let's find $f(50)$:
$$f(50) = 2f(25)+1.$$
Then, we can apply the second equation again to find $f(25)$:
$$f(25) = 2f(12.5)+1.$$
But $12.5$ is not a positive integer, so we cannot use the second equation directly with it. We need to find another way to express $f(25)$ in terms of a positive integer value.

Notice that $25 = 2*12.5$, so we can substitute $n = 12.5$ into the first equation $f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$:
$$f(f(f(12.5)))=8*12.5-7 = 100.$$
But $f(f(f(12.5)))$ is just $f(25)$, so we have:
$$f(25) = 100.$$
Now we can substitute this into the equation for $f(50)$:
$$f(50) = 2f(25)+1 = 2*100+1 = 201.$$
Finally, we can substitute $f(50)$ into the equation for $f(100)$:
$$f(100) = 2f(50)+1 = 2*201+1 = 403.$$
So, $f(100) = 403$. The answer is: $403$

"A function $f: \mathbb N \to \mathbb N$ satisfies the following two conditions for all positive integers $n$:$f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$ and $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$. Calculate $f(100)$."
Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:


We are given that $f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$ and $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$.

Let's start by plugging in $n=1$ into the equation $f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$, we get $f(f(f(1)))=8(1)-7=1$. Since $f(1)$ is a positive integer, the only possibility is $f(1)=1$.

Now, let's use $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$ with $n=1$, we get $f(2)=2f(1)+1=2(1)+1=3$.

Then, let's use $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$ with $n=2$, we get $f(4)=2f(2)+1=2(3)+1=7$.

Again, let's use $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$ with $n=4$, we get $f(8)=2f(4)+1=2(7)+1=15$.

Continuing this pattern, we find that $f(16)=31$, $f(32)=63$, and $f(64)=127$.

Now, we notice a pattern. We can see that $f(2^k)=2^k-1$ for $k=1,2,3,4$. So, we conjecture that $f(2^k)=2^k-1$ for all positive integers $k$.

To prove this, we will use induction.

Base case: For $k=1$, we have $f(2^1)=f(2)=3=2^1-1$. So, the base case holds.

Inductive step: Suppose that $f(2^k)=2^k-1$ for some positive integer $k$. Then,
\[f(2^{k+1})=f(2 \cdot 2^k)=2f(2^k)+1=2(2^k-1)+1=2^{k+1}-1.\]
So, the formula holds for $k+1$.

By induction, we have proven that $f(2^k)=2^k-1$ for all positive integers $k$.

Now, we can find $f(100)$. Since $100=2^2 \cdot 5^2$, we have
\[f(100)=f(2^2 \cdot 5^2)=f(2^2 \cdot 5^2)=f((2^2 \cdot 5^2))=f(100).\]
Using the formula $f(2^k)=2^k-1$, we get
\[f(100)=2^2-1=4-1=3.\]
So, $f(100)=3$. The answer is: $\boxed{3}$

Question (hint: positive numerical answer):
"A function $f: \mathbb N \to \mathbb N$ satisfies the following two conditions for all positive integers $n$:$f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$ and $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$. Calculate $f(100)$."
Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:



We start by calculating $f(1)$ using the second equation. We have $f(2) = 2f(1) + 1$. Then, applying the function $f$ again, we get $f(f(2)) = f(2f(1) + 1)$. Using the first equation, this becomes $f(f(2)) = 8(f(1)) - 7$. But we also know that $f(f(2)) = f(2f(1) + 1) = 2f(f(1)) + 1$. So we have the equation $2f(f(1)) + 1 = 8f(1) - 7$. Solving this equation gives us $f(1) = 3$.

Now, we can use the second equation to find $f(2) = 2f(1) + 1 = 2(3) + 1 = 7$. Continuing this way, we find $f(3) = f\left(\frac{f(2)+1}{2}\right) = f\left(\frac{7+1}{2}\right) = f(4) = 2f(2)+1 = 2(7)+1 = 15$.

We can continue this process to find $f(4) = 15$, $f(5) = 29$, $f(6) = 53$, $f(7) = 89$, and so on. We notice a pattern: $f(n) = 3 + 4(n - 1)$. To confirm this, we can prove it by induction. It is true for $n = 1$, and if $f(n) = 3 + 4(n - 1)$, then $f(f(n)) = f(3 + 4(n - 1)) = 3 + 4(3 + 4(n - 1) - 1) = 8n - 7$, which verifies the first equation.

Finally, we can calculate $f(100) = 3 + 4(100 - 1) = 3 + 4(99) = 3 + 396 = 400 - 1 = 399$. So $f(100) = 399$. The answer is: $399$

Question (hint: positive numerical answer):
"A function $f: \mathbb N \to \mathbb N$ satisfies the following two conditions for all positive integers $n$:$f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$ and $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$. Calculate $f(100)$."
Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:



Let's start by calculating $f(100)$ using the second equation given in the problem. The equation is $f(2n) = 2f(n) + 1$. We can substitute $n = 50$ into this equation to get:

$$f(2 \cdot 50) = 2f(50) + 1.$$

This simplifies to:

$$f(100) = 2f(50) + 1. \tag{1}$$

Now, let's substitute $n = 25$ into the second equation to get:

$$f(2 \cdot 25) = 2f(25) + 1.$$

This simplifies to:

$$f(50) = 2f(25) + 1. \tag{2}$$

Now, let's substitute $n = 12$ into the second equation to get:

$$f(2 \cdot 12) = 2f(12) + 1.$$

This simplifies to:

$$f(24) = 2f(12) + 1. \tag{3}$$

Finally, let's substitute $n = 6$ into the second equation to get:

$$f(2 \cdot 6) = 2f(6) + 1.$$

This simplifies to:

$$f(12) = 2f(6) + 1. \tag{4}$$

And let's substitute $n = 3$ into the first equation given in the problem:

$$f(f(f(3))) = 8 \cdot 3 - 7 = 19.$$

Since $f(f(f(3))) = 19$, we can rewrite this as:

$$f(f(3)) = f^{-1}(19).$$

And since $f(f(3)) = 6$ (from equation 3), we get:

$$f(3) = f^{-1}(19).$$

Now, let's substitute $n = 3$ into the second equation:

$$f(2 \cdot 3) = 2f(3) + 1.$$

This simplifies to:

$$f(6) = 2f(3) + 1.$$

But we know that $f(3) = f^{-1}(19)$, so we can substitute this into the equation to get:

$$f(6) = 2f^{-1}(19) + 1.$$

And finally, let's substitute $n = 6$ into the second equation:

$$f(2 \cdot 6) = 2f(6) + 1.$$

This simplifies to:

$$f(12) = 2f(6) + 1.$$

But we know that $f(6) = 2f^{-1}(19) + 1$, so we can substitute this into the equation to get:

$$f(12) = 2(2f^{-1}(19) + 1) + 1 = 4f^{-1}(19) + 3.$$

Now, we can substitute this into equation 4:

$$4f^{-1}(19) + 3 = f(12).$$

And substitute $f(12)$ into equation 3:

$$f(24) = 2(4f^{-1}(19) + 3) + 1 = 8f^{-1}(19) + 7.$$

And substitute $f(24)$ into equation 2:

$$f(50) = 2(8f^{-1}(19) + 7) + 1 = 16f^{-1}(19) + 15.$$

And finally, substitute $f(50)$ into equation 1:

$$f(100) = 2(16f^{-1}(19) + 15) + 1 = 32f^{-1}(19) + 31.$$

So, we have found that $f(100) = 32f^{-1}(19) + 31$. However, we don't have a direct way to calculate $f^{-1}(19)$. But we know that $f(f(3)) = 19$, which means $f^{-1}(19) = 3$. Substitute $f^{-1}(19) = 3$ into the equation we found for $f(100)$:

$$f(100) = 32 \cdot 3 + 31 = 96 + 31 = 127.$$

Therefore, the value of $f(100)$ is 127. The answer is: $127$

Question (hint: positive numerical answer):
"A function $f: \mathbb N \to \mathbb N$ satisfies the following two conditions for all positive integers $n$:$f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$ and $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$. Calculate $f(100)$."
Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:



To find $f(100)$, we first need to find the value of $f(n)$ for some base cases.

Using the second condition, we can find $f(1)$:
\[f(2 \cdot 1) = 2f(1) + 1 \implies f(2) = 2f(1) + 1.\]
And from the first condition, we have:
\[f(f(f(1))) = 8 \cdot 1 - 7 = -1.\]
Let's denote $f(1)$ as $a$. Then we have:
\[f(f(a)) = f(a) = -1.\]
Again from the first condition, we have:
\[f(f(f(2))) = 8 \cdot 2 - 7 = 9.\]
Denoting $f(2)$ as $b$, we get:
\[f(f(b)) = 9 \implies f(b) = 9.\]
But we know that $f(2) = b = 2a + 1$, and $f(b) = 9$, so we have:
\[f(2a + 1) = 9.\]
Using the second condition, we get:
\[f(4a + 2) = 2f(2a + 1) + 1 = 2 \cdot 9 + 1 = 19.\]
And from the first condition, we have:
\[f(f(f(4a + 2))) = 8(4a + 2) - 7 = 32a + 15.\]
But we know that $f(4a + 2) = 19$, so we have:
\[f(19) = 32a + 15.\]
Now we can use trial and error to find the value of $a$.
We can try $a = 1$, then $f(1) = 1$, $f(2) = 3$, $f(3) = 1$, $f(4) = 5$, and so on.
We find that when $a = 1$, we get $f(1) = 1$, $f(2) = 3$, $f(3) = 1$, $f(4) = 5$, and so on, until $f(19) = 32a + 15 = 47$.
Thus, the function $f(n)$ defined as:
\[f(n) = \begin{cases} 1 & \text{if } n = 1, \\ 2n - 1 & \text{if } n \text{ is even}, \\ 1 & \text{if } n \text{ is odd and } n > 1. \end{cases}\]
satisfies both conditions.
Now we can calculate $f(100)$.
Since $100$ is even, we have $f(100) = 2 \cdot 100 - 1 = 199$.
So the value of $f(100)$ is $199$. The answer is: $199$

Question (hint: positive numerical answer):
"A function $f: \mathbb N \to \mathbb N$ satisfies the following two conditions for all positive integers $n$:$f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$ and $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$. Calculate $f(100)$."
Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:


We start by plugging in $n=1$ into the second equation to get $f(2)=2f(1)+1$.
Then, we plug in $n=f(1)$ into the first equation to get $f(f(f(f(1)))) = 8f(1) - 7$.
Since $f(f(f(f(1)))) = f(f(f(2))) = f(f(2f(1)+1))$, we can use the second equation to simplify this to $f(f(2f(1)+1)) = f(2(2f(1)+1)+1) = f(4f(1)+3)$.
Using the first equation again, we have $f(4f(1)+3) = 8(4f(1)+3) - 7 = 32f(1)+24-7 = 32f(1)+17$.
But we know that $f(f(f(f(1)))) = 8f(1) - 7$, so we can set these two equal to each other to get $32f(1)+17 = 8f(1) - 7$.
Simplifying this gives $24f(1) = -24$, so $f(1) = -1$.
But the function $f$ is meant to map from $\mathbb N$ to $\mathbb N$, and we got a negative value, so this solution doesn't make sense in the context of the problem.

Let's try another approach.

We know that $f(2n) = 2f(n) + 1$, and we want to find $f(100)$.
Let's find $f(50)$ first.
Using the second equation with $n=25$, we have $f(50) = 2f(25) + 1$.
Similarly, $f(25) = 2f(12.5)$, but $12.5$ is not an integer, so this equation doesn't help us directly.
But we can still use the equation $f(2n) = 2f(n) + 1$ by noticing that $50 = 2 \cdot 25$, so we have $f(50) = 2f(25) + 1$.
Continuing this pattern, we can find $f(100)$ in terms of $f(50)$.
$f(100) = 2f(50) + 1$.
Now we need to find $f(50)$ in terms of $f(25)$.
$f(50) = 2f(25) + 1$.
And we need to find $f(25)$ in terms of $f(12.5)$.
But again, $12.5$ is not an integer, so we need to find another way.

Let's try using the first equation.
We know that $f(f(f(n))) = 8n - 7$, so for $n=50$, we have $f(f(f(50))) = 8 \cdot 50 - 7 = 393$.
And $f(f(f(50))) = f(f(2f(25)+1)) = f(f(50))$.
Now we have $f(f(50)) = 393$.
And we can find $f(50)$ by using the second equation.
$f(50) = 2f(25) + 1$.
So we can substitute this into the equation $f(f(50)) = 393$.
$f(f(50)) = f(2f(25)+1) = 393$.
This becomes $f(2(2f(25)+1)+1) = 393$.
Simplifying gives $f(4f(25)+3) = 393$.
And we know that $f(f(f(25))) = 8 \cdot 25 - 7 = 193$.
So we have $f(4f(25)+3) = 393$ and $f(f(f(25))) = 193$.
By setting these equal to each other, we get $393 = 193 \cdot 2 + 1$.
This simplifies to $393 = 387$, which is a contradiction.

This suggests that we may have made an error in our calculations, so let's go back and check our work.
We found that $f(100) = 2f(50) + 1$, $f(50) = 2f(25) + 1$, and $f(25) = 2f(12.5)$.
But as mentioned earlier, $12.5$ is not an integer, so we can't continue this approach.

Let's try another approach.

Since we are given two equations for the function $f$, we can use them to set up a system of equations.
From the second equation, we have $f(2n) = 2f(n) + 1$.
Plugging in $n=1$, we get $f(2) = 2f(1) + 1$.
And plugging in $n=2$, we get $f(4) = 2f(2) + 1$.
Now we can substitute the expression for $f(2)$ from the previous equation into this equation to get $f(4) = 2(2f(1)+1) + 1 = 4f(1) + 3$.
Using the first equation $f(f(f(n))) = 8n - 7$, we can plug in $n=4$ to get $f(f(f(4))) = 8 \cdot 4 - 7 = 24$.
And $f(f(f(4))) = f(f(4f(1)+3)) = f(4f(1)+3)$.
So we have $f(4f(1)+3) = 24$.
Now we can substitute the expression for $f(4)$ into this equation to get $f(4f(1)+3) = f(4f(1)+3) = 24$.
Simplifying gives $4f(1)+3 = 24$.
Solving for $f(1)$, we get $f(1) = \frac{21}{4}$, which is not an integer, so this approach also doesn't work.

Let's try a different approach.

Since $f$ is a function from $\mathbb N$ to $\mathbb N$, it must be the case that $f(1)$ is a positive integer.
From the second equation, we have $f(2) = 2f(1) + 1$.
Plugging in $n=1$, we get $f(2) = 2f(1) +

Question (hint: positive numerical answer):
"A function $f: \mathbb N \to \mathbb N$ satisfies the following two conditions for all positive integers $n$:$f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$ and $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$. Calculate $f(100)$."
Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:



To solve this problem, we will use the second equation first. We know that $f(2n) = 2f(n) + 1$. So, if we substitute $n = 50$, we get $f(100) = 2f(50) + 1$. We don't know the value of $f(50)$ yet, but we can use the first equation to find it.

We know that $f(f(f(n))) = 8n - 7$. If we substitute $n = 50$, we get $f(f(f(50))) = 8*50 - 7 = 393$. We also know that $f(f(f(50))) = 50$ (since $n$ is 50), so we have $f(f(50)) = 50$.

Now, let's use the second equation again to find $f(50)$. We have $f(100) = 2f(50) + 1$. But we know $f(100) = 393$ from the first equation and $f(f(50)) = 50$, so $f(50) = \frac{393 - 1}{2} = 196$.

Finally, substitute $f(50) = 196$ into the equation $f(100) = 2f(50) + 1$ to find $f(100)$:

$$f(100) = 2*196 + 1 = 393.$$

So, the value of $f(100)$ is $393$.
The answer is: $\boxed{393}$.

Question (hint: positive numerical answer):
"A function $f: \mathbb N \to \mathbb N$ satisfies the following two conditions for all positive integers $n$:$f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$ and $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$. Calculate $f(100)$."
Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:



We know that $f(f(f(100)))=8(100)-7=793$. Since we know the value of $f(f(f(100)))$, we can find $f(f(100))$ by finding the number $n$ such that $f(n)=793$.
From the second condition, we know that $f(2(50))=2f(50)+1$, or $f(100)=2f(50)+1$. Since $f(f(f(100)))=793$, we can substitute $f(100)$ into the first condition to get $f(f(793))=793$.
Again using the second condition, we know that $f(2(396.5))=2f(396.5)+1$, or $f(793)=2f(396.5)+1$. Substituting this into the previous equation, we have $f(2f(396.5)+1)=793$.
Let's set $f(396.5)=x$. Then the equation becomes $f(2x+1)=793$.
Since we know that $f(f(f(100)))=793$, we also know that $f(f(f(396.5)))=793$, or $f(f(793))=793$. From this, we can deduce that $f(793)=793$, and thus $x=396.5$. However, this is a contradiction because the domain and range of $f$ are both natural numbers.

Let's try a different approach. From the first condition, we know that $f(f(f(100)))=793$. This means that $f(f(n))=k$ for some positive integer $k$ such that $f(k)=793$. We can use the second condition to try to find a relationship between $f(n)$ and $f(2n)$.
From the second condition, we have $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$. Let's substitute $2n$ with $n$ to get $f(n/2)=2f(n/4)+1$. Since the domain of $f$ is only natural numbers, we must have $n/2$ is a natural number as well. Therefore, $n$ must be an even number.
Let's substitute $n$ with $2n$ in the second condition to get $f(2(2n))=2f(2n)+1$, or $f(4n)=2f(2n)+1$. We can also substitute $2n$ with $n$ in the first condition to get $f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$.
Since we know that $f(f(f(100)))=793$, we can substitute $n=100$ into the first condition to get $f(f(f(100)))=8(100)-7=793$. This means that $f(f(100))=793$.
From the second condition, we know that $f(2(50))=2f(50)+1$, or $f(100)=2f(50)+1$. Since $f(f(100))=793$, we can substitute this into the equation to get $793=2f(50)+1$. Solving for $f(50)$, we get $f(50)=(793-1)/2=396$.
Since we know that $f(50)=396$, we can substitute $n=50$ into the second condition to get $f(2(50))=2f(50)+1$, or $f(100)=2(396)+1=793$.
Therefore, $f(100)=793$.
The value of $f(100)$ is $793$. The answer is: $793$

"A function $f: \mathbb N \to \mathbb N$ satisfies the following two conditions for all positive integers $n$:$f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$ and $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$. Calculate $f(100)$."
Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:



First, let's try to find $f(1)$ using the second condition $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$.
Setting $n=1$, we get $f(2)=2f(1)+1$.
Since $f(2)$ is the input to the function, and the output is 8 times the input minus 7 from the first condition, we can substitute $f(2)$ into the first condition: $f(f(2))=8*1-7$, or $f(2f(1)+1)=1$.
This implies that $2f(1)+1=1$, which means $f(1)=0$.
Now, we can find $f(100)$ using the second condition.
$f(200)=2f(100)+1$.
Again, substituting this into the first condition, we get $f(f(200))=8*100-7$, or $f(2f(100)+1)=793$.
But we know that $2f(100)+1=200$, so substituting this in, we have $f(200)=793$.
Now we can solve for $f(100)$:
$f(200)=2f(100)+1=793$, so $2f(100)=792$ and $f(100)=396$.
Therefore, $f(100)=396$. The answer is: $396$

Question (hint: positive numerical answer):
"A function $f: \mathbb N \to \mathbb N$ satisfies the following two conditions for all positive integers $n$:$f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$ and $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$. Calculate $f(100)$."
Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:


To find $f(100)$, we need to find the pattern of the function $f$.
Using the second condition, we have $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$. This means that $f(n)$ is an increasing function.
Using the first condition, we have $f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$.
Let's try to find the value of $f(1)$ using this information.
If we let $n=1$ in the first condition, we have $f(f(f(1)))=8(1)-7=1$.
So $f(f(f(1)))=1$.
This means that $f(1)$ is a value such that $f(f(f(1)))=1$.
Let's try to find such a value.
If we let $f(1)=1$, then $f(f(f(1)))=f(f(1))=f(1)=1$, which satisfies the condition.
Therefore, $f(1)=1$.
Now we can use the second condition to find $f(2)$.
We have $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$, so when $n=1$, we have $f(2)=2f(1)+1=2(1)+1=3$.
We can continue to find $f(3)$, $f(4)$, etc., using the second condition.
After some trial and error, we find that $f(n)=2n-1$ satisfies both conditions.
So, $f(100)=2(100)-1=199$. The answer is: $199$

"A function $f: \mathbb N \to \mathbb N$ satisfies the following two conditions for all positive integers $n$:$f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$ and $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$. Calculate $f(100)$."
Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:


First, let's apply the function $f$ on $n = 1$:
$f(f(f(1))) = 8(1) - 7 = -1$.
Since function $f$ only outputs natural numbers, we know that this equation cannot hold. Therefore, we must have made a mistake somewhere in our work.
Let's try applying the function $f$ on $n = 2$:
$f(f(f(2))) = f(f(2f(1) + 1)) = f(f(3)) = 8(3) - 7 = 13$.
We know that $f(f(f(2))) = 13$, but we also know that $f(f(f(2))) = 8(2) - 7 = 9$.
Therefore, our original equation $f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$ is not always true.
We made a mistake in our reasoning. Let's try a different approach.
From the given information, we know that $f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$ and $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$.
We can substitute $n = f(1)$ into the equation $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$:
$f(2f(1)) = 2f(f(1)) + 1$.
Since $2f(1)$ is equal to $f(2)$, this equation becomes $f(f(2)) = 2f(f(1)) + 1$.
We also know that $f(f(f(2))) = 9$, so we can substitute this into the equation:
$9 = 2f(f(1)) + 1$.
Simplifying, we get $2f(f(1)) = 8$, so $f(f(1)) = 4$.
Since $f(f(1)) = 4$, and we know that $f$ outputs natural numbers, the only possible value for $f(1)$ is 2.
Now, let's try to find $f(100)$ using the equation $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$.
If we let $n = 50$, we get $f(100) = 2f(50) + 1$.
Again, using the equation $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$, we can let $n = 25$:
$f(50) = 2f(25) + 1$.
Similarly, $f(50) = 2f(12.5)$.
But $f$ only outputs natural numbers, so this equation doesn't hold.
We made another mistake in our reasoning.
Let's go back to the original equation $f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$.
If we let $n = 100$, we get $f(f(f(100))) = 8(100) - 7 = 793$.
From $f(f(f(100))) = 793$, we can work backwards to find $f(100)$.
We know that $f(f(f(100))) = 8(100) - 7 = 793$.
Then $f(f(100)) = \frac{793}{8} = 99.125$, but this doesn't make sense because $f(100)$ should be a natural number.
Let's try another approach.
From the given information, we know that $f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$.
If we let $n = 2$, we get $f(f(f(2))) = 8(2) - 7 = 9$.
From $f(f(f(2))) = 9$, we can work backwards to find $f(2)$:
$f(f(2)) = \frac{9}{2} = 4.5$, but this doesn't make sense because $f(2)$ should be a natural number.
Again, we made a mistake in our reasoning.
Let's try one more approach.
From the given information, we know that $f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$.
If we let $n = 3$, we get $f(f(f(3))) = 8(3) - 7 = 17$.
From $f(f(f(3))) = 17$, we can work backwards to find $f(3)$:
$f(f(3)) = \frac{17}{2} = 8.5$, but this doesn't make sense because $f(3)$ should be a natural number.
Again, we made a mistake in our reasoning.
Let's try one more approach.
From the given information, we know that $f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$.
If we let $n = 4$, we get $f(f(f(4))) = 8(4) - 7 = 25$.
From $f(f(f(4))) = 25$, we can work backwards to find $f(4)$:
$f(f(4)) = \frac{25}{2} = 12.5$, but this doesn't make sense because $f(4)$ should be a natural number.
Again, we made a mistake in our reasoning.
Let's go back to the original equation $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$.
If we let $n = 100$, we get $f(200) = 2f(100) + 1$.
From $f(200) = 2f(100) + 1$, we can solve for $f(100)$:
$f(100) = \frac{f(200) - 1}{2}$.
We know that $f(200)$ should be a natural number, so let's try plugging in some natural numbers for $f(200)$ until we find one that makes $f(100)$ a natural number.
If we let $f(200) = 201$, then $f(100) = \frac{201 - 1}{2} = 100$, which is a natural number.
So, $f(100) = 100$.
The answer is: $100$

Question (hint: positive numerical answer):
"A function $f: \mathbb N \to \mathbb N$ satisfies the following two conditions for all positive integers $n$:$f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$ and $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$. Calculate $f(100)$."
Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:


First, let's apply the second condition of the function $f$ to find $f(100)$:
$f(100) = 2f(50) + 1$.
Next, we apply the second condition again to find $f(50)$:
$f(50) = 2f(25) + 1$.
Continuing this process, we can keep applying the second condition until we reach a value we know. We know that $f(1) = 1$ from the first equation.
Using the second condition, we find:
$f(2) = 2f(1) + 1 = 2(1) + 1 = 3$.
$f(4) = 2f(2) + 1 = 2(3) + 1 = 7$.
$f(8) = 2f(4) + 1 = 2(7) + 1 = 15$.
$f(16) = 2f(8) + 1 = 2(15) + 1 = 31$.
$f(32) = 2f(16) + 1 = 2(31) + 1 = 63$.
$f(64) = 2f(32) + 1 = 2(63) + 1 = 127$.
Now we can apply the first condition of the function $f$ to find $f(64)$:
$f(f(f(64))) = 8(64) - 7 = 511$.
Since $f(f(f(64))) = f(127)$ and we know that $f(127) = 511$, we can conclude that $f(n) = 8n - 7$.
Finally, we can find $f(100)$ using the expression we found for $f(n)$:
$f(100) = 8(100) - 7 = 793$.
The answer is: $793$

Question (hint: positive numerical answer):
"A function $f: \mathbb N \to \mathbb N$ satisfies the following two conditions for all positive integers $n$:$f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$ and $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$. Calculate $f(100)$."
Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:


To find $f(100)$, we can first find $f(2)$ using the second equation, since we know $f(1)$ from the first equation.

Using the second equation, $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$, when $n=1$, we get $f(2)=2f(1)+1$. But we know from the first equation that $f(f(f(1)))=8(1)-7=1$, so $f(f(1))=1$, and thus $f(1)$ must be the only positive integer solution to this equation. Therefore, $f(1)=1$.

Substituting $f(1)=1$ into $f(2)=2f(1)+1$, we get $f(2)=2*1+1=3$.

Now we can find $f(100)$ by repeatedly applying the second equation.

First, let's find $f(50)$: $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$ gives $f(100)=2f(50)+1$.
Next, let's find $f(25)$: $f(100)=2f(50)+1$ gives $f(50)=2f(25)+1$.
Similarly, $f(12)=2f(6)+1$ and $f(6)=2f(3)+1$.
Finally, we know $f(3)$ from the first equation: $f(f(f(1)))=8(1)-7=1$ gives $f(f(1))=1$, and thus $f(1)=1$. And we've already found $f(2)=3$. Using the second equation $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$, we get $f(3)=2f(1)+1=3$.

Now we can substitute $f(3)=3$ into $f(6)=2f(3)+1$ to get $f(6)=2*3+1=7$.
Then we substitute $f(6)=7$ into $f(12)=2f(6)+1$ to get $f(12)=2*7+1=15$.
And finally we substitute $f(12)=15$ into $f(24)=2f(12)+1$ to get $f(24)=2*15+1=31$.

Then we substitute $f(24)=31$ into $f(50)=2f(25)+1$ to get $f(50)=2f(25)+1$. Since $50$ is in the form of $2n$, we can use the second equation $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$ again, which gives $f(50)=2f(25)+1$.
We know $f(25)=2f(12)+1=2*15+1=31$.
Then substitute $f(25)=31$ into $f(50)=2f(25)+1$ to get $f(50)=2*31+1=63$.

Finally, we substitute $f(50)=63$ into $f(100)=2f(50)+1$ to get $f(100)=2*63+1=127$. So $f(100)=127$.
The answer is: $127$
