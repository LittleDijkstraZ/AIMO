Question (hint: positive numerical answer):
"Let $k, l > 0$ be parameters. The parabola $y = kx^2 - 2kx + l$ intersects the line $y = 4$ at two points $A$ and $B$. These points are distance 6 apart. What is the sum of the squares of the distances from $A$ and $B$ to the origin?"
Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:


To solve this problem, we first need to find the $x$-coordinates of points $A$ and $B$.
The parabola $y = kx^2 - 2kx + l$ intersects the line $y = 4$ at points $A$ and $B$,
so we can set $kx^2 - 2kx + l = 4$ and solve for $x$.
Rearranging terms, we have $kx^2 - 2kx + l - 4 = 0$.
Let's call this equation (1).
The distance between $A$ and $B$ is given as 6,
so if $x_1$ and $x_2$ are the $x$-coordinates of $A$ and $B$, respectively, we have $x_2 - x_1 = 6$.
By Vieta's formulas, the sum of the roots of equation (1) is $x_1 + x_2 = \frac{2k}{k} = 2$,
and the product of the roots is $x_1x_2 = \frac{l - 4}{k}$.
We are also given that $x_2 - x_1 = 6$.
Squaring both sides of the equation $x_2 - x_1 = 6$, we have $(x_2 - x_1)^2 = 36$.
Expanding the left side, we get $x_2^2 - 2x_1x_2 + x_1^2 = 36$.
Substituting the values of $x_1 + x_2$ and $x_1x_2$, we have
\[(2)^2 - 2\left(\frac{l - 4}{k}\right) + \left(\frac{l - 4}{k}\right)^2 = 36.\]
Simplifying, we get $4 - 2\left(\frac{l - 4}{k}\right) + \left(\frac{l - 4}{k}\right)^2 = 36$.
Rearranging terms, we have $\left(\frac{l - 4}{k}\right)^2 - 2\left(\frac{l - 4}{k}\right) + 4 = 36$.
This equation simplifies to $\left(\frac{l - 4}{k}\right)^2 - 2\left(\frac{l - 4}{k}\right) - 32 = 0$.
Let $t = \frac{l - 4}{k}$, then the equation becomes $t^2 - 2t - 32 = 0$.
Factoring the quadratic, we have $(t - 8)(t + 4) = 0$.
The roots are $t = 8$ and $t = -4$.
Since $t = \frac{l - 4}{k}$, we have $\frac{l - 4}{k} = 8$ or $\frac{l - 4}{k} = -4$.
Solving for $l$ in each case, we get $l = 8k + 4$ or $l = -4k + 4$.
Substituting $l = 8k + 4$ into equation (1), we have $kx^2 - 2kx + (8k + 4 - 4) = 0$,
which simplifies to $kx^2 - 2kx + 8k = 0$.
This equation has roots $x = \frac{2k \pm \sqrt{(2k)^2 - 4(k)(8k)}}{2k} = \frac{2k \pm \sqrt{4k^2 - 32k^2}}{2k} = \frac{2k \pm \sqrt{-28k^2}}{2k}$.
Since the square root of a negative number is not real, this case does not yield real solutions for $x$,
so we discard this possibility.
Substituting $l = -4k + 4$ into equation (1), we have $kx^2 - 2kx + (-4k + 4 - 4) = 0$,
which simplifies to $kx^2 - 2kx - 4k = 0$.
This equation has roots $x = \frac{2k \pm \sqrt{(2k)^2 - 4(k)(-4k)}}{2k} = \frac{2k \pm \sqrt{4k^2 + 16k^2}}{2k} = \frac{2k \pm \sqrt{20k^2}}{2k} = \frac{2k \pm 2k\sqrt{5}}{2k} = 1 \pm \sqrt{5}$.
So the $x$-coordinates of $A$ and $B$ are $1 + \sqrt{5}$ and $1 - \sqrt{5}$.
The distance from each point to the origin is $\sqrt{(1 \pm \sqrt{5})^2 + 4^2} = \sqrt{1 + 10 + 2\sqrt{5} + 16} = \sqrt{27 + 2\sqrt{5}} = \sqrt{27} + \sqrt{2}$.
The sum of the squares of the distances from $A$ and $B$ to the origin is $(\sqrt{27} + \sqrt{2})^2 + (\sqrt{27} - \sqrt{2})^2 = 27 + 2 + 2(27) = 27 + 2 + 54 = 83$.
Therefore, the sum of the squares of the distances from $A$ and $B$ to the origin is 83. The answer is: 83

Question (hint: positive numerical answer):
"Let $k, l > 0$ be parameters. The parabola $y = kx^2 - 2kx + l$ intersects the line $y = 4$ at two points $A$ and $B$. These points are distance 6 apart. What is the sum of the squares of the distances from $A$ and $B$ to the origin?"
Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:


First, let's set the two equations equal to each other to find the points of intersection:
\[kx^2 - 2kx + l = 4.\]
Rearranging the equation gives:
\[kx^2 - 2kx + l - 4 = 0.\]
Let $x_1$ and $x_2$ be the x-coordinates of points $A$ and $B$ respectively. By Vieta's formulas, we have:
\[x_1 + x_2 = \frac{2k}{k} = 2\]
and
\[x_1x_2 = \frac{l - 4}{k}.\]
We are given that the distance between $A$ and $B$ is 6, so we can use the distance formula:
\[\sqrt{(x_2 - x_1)^2 + (4 - 4)^2} = 6.\]
Since the y-coordinates of both points are 4, the only difference between the points is in the x-coordinates. Thus, $(x_2 - x_1)^2 = 36$, which simplifies to $x_2^2 - 2x_1x_2 + x_1^2 = 36$.

We can substitute $x_1x_2 = \frac{l - 4}{k}$ into this equation:
\[x_2^2 - 2\left(\frac{l - 4}{k}\right) + x_1^2 = 36.\]
Using the identity $(x_1 + x_2)^2 = x_1^2 + 2x_1x_2 + x_2^2$, we can replace $x_1^2 + x_2^2$ with $(x_1 + x_2)^2 - 2x_1x_2$:
\[(x_1 + x_2)^2 - 2x_1x_2 - 2\left(\frac{l - 4}{k}\right) = 36.\]
Substituting the values of $x_1 + x_2 = 2$ and $x_1x_2 = \frac{l - 4}{k}$ gives:
\[2^2 - 2\left(\frac{l - 4}{k}\right) - 2\left(\frac{l - 4}{k}\right) = 36.\]
Simplifying the equation gives:
\[4 - 4\left(\frac{l - 4}{k}\right) = 36.\]
Multiplying both sides by $k$ gives:
\[4k - 4(l - 4) = 36k.\]
Expanding the equation gives:
\[4k - 4l + 16 = 36k.\]
Moving all the terms with $k$ to one side gives:
\[32k = 4l - 16.\]
Dividing both sides by 4 gives:
\[8k = l - 4.\]
Adding 4 to both sides gives:
\[l = 8k + 4.\]
We want to find the sum of the squares of the distances from $A$ and $B$ to the origin. The distance from a point $(x, y)$ to the origin is $\sqrt{x^2 + y^2}$. Since both points have a y-coordinate of 4, we only need to find the sum of the squares of their x-coordinates. Using the identity $(x_1 + x_2)^2 = x_1^2 + 2x_1x_2 + x_2^2$, we have:
\[(x_1 + x_2)^2 - 2x_1x_2 = x_1^2 + x_2^2.\]
Substituting the values of $x_1 + x_2 = 2$ and $x_1x_2 = \frac{l - 4}{k}$ gives:
\[2^2 - 2\left(\frac{l - 4}{k}\right) = x_1^2 + x_2^2.\]
We already found this equation earlier:
\[x_1^2 + x_2^2 = (x_1 + x_2)^2 - 2x_1x_2 = 2^2 - 2\left(\frac{l - 4}{k}\right) = 4 - 2\left(\frac{8k + 4 - 4}{k}\right) = 4 - 16 = -12.\]
This result seems to be incorrect. Let's go back and reevaluate our steps.

When we substituted $x_1x_2 = \frac{l - 4}{k}$ into the equation $(x_2 - x_1)^2 = 36$, we should have used the identity $(x_2 - x_1)^2 = (x_2^2 - 2x_1x_2 + x_1^2)$. This gives us:
\[x_2^2 - 2x_1x_2 + x_1^2 = 36.\]
Substituting $x_1x_2 = \frac{l - 4}{k}$ gives:
\[x_2^2 - 2\left(\frac{l - 4}{k}\right) + x_1^2 = 36.\]
Again, using the identity $(x_1 + x_2)^2 = x_1^2 + 2x_1x_2 + x_2^2$, we can replace $x_1^2 + x_2^2$ with $(x_1 + x_2)^2 - 2x_1x_2$:
\[(x_1 + x_2)^2 - 2x_1x_2 - 2\left(\frac{l - 4}{k}\right) = 36.\]
Substituting the values of $x_1 + x_2 = 2$ and $x_1x_2 = \frac{l - 4}{k}$ gives:
\[2^2 - 2\left(\frac{l - 4}{k}\right) - 2\left(\frac{l - 4}{k}\right) = 36.\]
Simplifying the equation gives:
\[4 - 4\left(\frac{l - 4}{k}\right) = 36.\]
Multiplying both sides by $k$ gives:
\[4k - 4(l - 4) = 36k.\]
Expanding the equation gives:
\[4k - 4l + 16 = 36k.\]
Moving all the terms with $k$ to one side gives:
\[32k = 4l - 16.\]
Dividing both sides by 4 gives:
\[8k = l - 4.\]
Adding 4 to both sides gives:
\[l = 8k + 4.\]
Now we can substitute this value of $l$ back into the equation $x_2^2 - 2\left(\frac{l - 4}{k}\right) + x_1^2 = 36$:

Question (hint: positive numerical answer):
"Let $k, l > 0$ be parameters. The parabola $y = kx^2 - 2kx + l$ intersects the line $y = 4$ at two points $A$ and $B$. These points are distance 6 apart. What is the sum of the squares of the distances from $A$ and $B$ to the origin?"
Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:


The parabola $y = kx^2 - 2kx + l$ intersects the line $y = 4$ at two points $A$ and $B$. This means that the solutions of the equation $kx^2 - 2kx + l = 4$ are the $x$-coordinates of points $A$ and $B$. Let's call these solutions $x_1$ and $x_2$, where $x_1$ corresponds to point $A$ and $x_2$ corresponds to point $B$. Since the points are distance 6 apart, we have $(x_2 - x_1)^2 = 36$.

Now, we want to find the sum of the squares of the distances from $A$ and $B$ to the origin. The distance from a point $(x, y)$ to the origin is $\sqrt{x^2 + y^2}$. So, the distance from point $A$ to the origin is $\sqrt{x_1^2 + (kx_1^2 - 2kx_1 + l - 4)^2}$ and the distance from point $B$ to the origin is $\sqrt{x_2^2 + (kx_2^2 - 2kx_2 + l - 4)^2}$.

Let's denote $d_1 = \sqrt{x_1^2 + (kx_1^2 - 2kx_1 + l - 4)^2}$ and $d_2 = \sqrt{x_2^2 + (kx_2^2 - 2kx_2 + l - 4)^2}$. We want to find $d_1^2 + d_2^2$.

By the distance formula, we have $d_1^2 + d_2^2 = (x_1^2 + (kx_1^2 - 2kx_1 + l - 4)^2) + (x_2^2 + (kx_2^2 - 2kx_2 + l - 4)^2)$.

This simplifies to $d_1^2 + d_2^2 = x_1^2 + k^2x_1^4 - 4kx_1^3 + 4k^2x_1^2 + l^2 - 8lx + 16 + x_2^2 + k^2x_2^4 - 4kx_2^3 + 4k^2x_2^2 + l^2 - 8lx + 16$.

Combining like terms, we get $d_1^2 + d_2^2 = (x_1^2 + x_2^2) + k^2(x_1^4 + x_2^4) - 4k(x_1^3 + x_2^3) + 4k^2(x_1^2 + x_2^2) + 2(l^2 - 8lx + 32)$.

We know that $(x_2 - x_1)^2 = 36$, so $x_2^2 - 2x_1x_2 + x_1^2 = 36$. Rearranging, we get $x_1^2 + x_2^2 = 2x_1x_2 + 36$.

We also know that $x_1 + x_2 = 2k$ and $x_1x_2 = l - 2k$. Substituting these into the equation for $d_1^2 + d_2^2$, we get

$d_1^2 + d_2^2 = 2x_1x_2 + 36 + k^2(x_1^2 + x_2^2) - 4k(x_1 + x_2)(x_1^2 + x_2^2 - x_1x_2) + 4k^2(2x_1x_2 + 36) + 2(l^2 - 8lx + 32)$.

Simplifying, we get $d_1^2 + d_2^2 = 2(l - 2k) + 36 + k^2(2x_1x_2 + 36) - 4k(2k)(36 - (l - 2k)) + 4k^2(2(l - 2k) + 36) + 2(l^2 - 8lk + 32)$.

Simplifying further, we get $d_1^2 + d_2^2 = 2l - 4k + 36 + 2k^3 - 288k^2 + 2kl^2 - 4kl + 144k + 8k^2l - 32k^2 + 72k^2 + 2l^2 - 16lk + 64$.

Simplifying yet further, we get $d_1^2 + d_2^2 = 2l^2 + 2l - 288k^2 - 12k + 4kl^2 - 20kl + 144k + 8k^2l + 64$.

This simplifies to $d_1^2 + d_2^2 = 2l^2 + 2l - 288k^2 - 12k + 4kl^2 - 20kl + 144k + 8k^2l + 64$.

However, we do not have enough information to determine the exact values of $k$ and $l$. Therefore, we cannot find a numerical value for $d_1^2 + d_2^2$. However, this equation gives us an expression for the sum of the squares of the distances from $A$ and $B$ to the origin in terms of $k$ and $l$.
The answer is: $\boxed{}$. The missing value is that we do not have enough information to determine the exact values of $k$ and $l$. Therefore, we cannot find a numerical value for $d_1^2 + d_2^2$. However, this equation gives us an expression for the sum of the squares of the distances from $A$ and $B$ to the origin in terms of $k$ and $l$.

Question (hint: positive numerical answer):
"Let $k, l > 0$ be parameters. The parabola $y = kx^2 - 2kx + l$ intersects the line $y = 4$ at two points $A$ and $B$. These points are distance 6 apart. What is the sum of the squares of the distances from $A$ and $B$ to the origin?"
Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:


To solve this problem, we first need to find the x-coordinates of points A and B. These points are the solutions to the equation $kx^2 - 2kx + l = 4$. Subtracting 4 from both sides gives us $kx^2 - 2kx + l - 4 = 0$. 

The solutions to this quadratic equation are given by the quadratic formula $x = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}$, where a = k, b = -2k, and c = l - 4. The difference of these solutions (the distance between A and B) is given by $\frac{\sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{a}$, and we know this is equal to 6. 

So we have $\frac{\sqrt{(-2k)^2 - 4*k*(l - 4)}}{k} = 6$, which simplifies to $\frac{\sqrt{4k^2 - 4k*(l - 4)}}{k} = 6$.

Squaring both sides to get rid of the square root gives us $\frac{4k^2 - 4k*(l - 4)}{k^2} = 36$, and multiplying both sides by $k^2$ gives us $4k^2 - 4k*(l - 4) = 36k^2$.

Rearranging terms gives us $32k^2 = 4k*(l - 4)$, so $8k = l - 4$, or $l = 8k + 4$.

Now we need to find the distances from A and B to the origin. The coordinates of A and B are given by $(x_1, kx_1^2 - 2kx_1 + l)$ and $(x_2, kx_2^2 - 2kx_2 + l)$ respectively, where $x_1$ and $x_2$ are the solutions to the quadratic equation $kx^2 - 2kx + l - 4 = 0$. The distances from A and B to the origin are given by $\sqrt{x_1^2 + (kx_1^2 - 2kx_1 + l)^2}$ and $\sqrt{x_2^2 + (kx_2^2 - 2kx_2 + l)^2}$ respectively.

The sum of the squares of these distances is then $\sqrt{x_1^2 + (kx_1^2 - 2kx_1 + l)^2}^2 + \sqrt{x_2^2 + (kx_2^2 - 2kx_2 + l)^2}^2$.

This is a complicated expression to evaluate directly, but we notice that the expression inside the square root is just the square of the distance between A and B, which is 36. Therefore, the sum of the squares of the distances from A and B to the origin is just 36^2 = 1296.

The answer is: $1296$

Question (hint: positive numerical answer):
"Let $k, l > 0$ be parameters. The parabola $y = kx^2 - 2kx + l$ intersects the line $y = 4$ at two points $A$ and $B$. These points are distance 6 apart. What is the sum of the squares of the distances from $A$ and $B$ to the origin?"
Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:


First, we need to find the $x$-coordinates of points $A$ and $B$.
We set $kx^2 - 2kx + l = 4$, which simplifies to $kx^2 - 2kx + l - 4 = 0$.
Let $x_1$ and $x_2$ be the roots of this equation, corresponding to $A$ and $B$ respectively.
Since the distance between $A$ and $B$ is 6, we have $(x_2 - x_1)^2 = 6^2 = 36$.
By Vieta's formulas, we know that $(x_1 + x_2)^2 - 4x_1x_2 = 36$.
Since $x_1 + x_2 = \frac{2k}{k} = 2$ and $x_1x_2 = \frac{l - 4}{k}$, we substitute these into the equation:
$$(2)^2 - 4\left(\frac{l - 4}{k}\right) = 36,$$
which simplifies to $4 - \frac{4(l - 4)}{k} = 36$.
Multiplying both sides by $k$ gives $4k - 4(l - 4) = 36k$.
Simplifying further gives $4k - 4l + 16 = 36k$, or $32k = 4l - 16$.
Dividing both sides by 4 gives $8k = l - 4$, or $l = 8k + 4$.
Now we need to find the squares of the distances from $A$ and $B$ to the origin.
The distance squared from a point $(x, y)$ to the origin is $x^2 + y^2$.
For point $A$, the $y$-coordinate is $kx_1^2 - 2kx_1 + l$, so the distance squared is $x_1^2 + (kx_1^2 - 2kx_1 + l)^2$.
Similarly, for point $B$, the distance squared is $x_2^2 + (kx_2^2 - 2kx_2 + l)^2$.
The sum of the squares of the distances is then
$$x_1^2 + (kx_1^2 - 2kx_1 + l)^2 + x_2^2 + (kx_2^2 - 2kx_2 + l)^2.$$
Substituting $l = 8k + 4$, we have
$$x_1^2 + (kx_1^2 - 2kx_1 + 8k + 4)^2 + x_2^2 + (kx_2^2 - 2kx_2 + 8k + 4)^2.$$
We can simplify this expression further, but it will involve solving for $x_1$ and $x_2$ from the quadratic equation, which is not straightforward.
However, we notice that the sum of the squares of the distances is symmetric in $x_1$ and $x_2$, so it must be a symmetric expression.
Thus, it must be a function of $k$ and $l$, and not depend on $x_1$ and $x_2$ directly.
By Vieta's formulas, we know that $x_1x_2 = \frac{l - 4}{k} = \frac{8k}{k} = 8$.
Also, $(x_1 + x_2)^2 = (2)^2 = 4$, so $x_1^2 + x_2^2 = (x_1 + x_2)^2 - 2x_1x_2 = 4 - 2(8) = -12$.
But the sum of squares of distances cannot be negative, so there must be an error in our approach.
Let's go back and reexamine our steps.
We made a mistake when we substituted $l = 8k + 4$ into the equation $4k - 4l + 16 = 36k$.
The correct equation should be $4k - 4(8k + 4) + 16 = 36k$, or $-28k = 0$.
But this equation has no solution for $k$, which indicates that we have made a mistake in our reasoning.
We need to revisit our steps and reexamine our assumptions.
From the equation $kx^2 - 2kx + l - 4 = 0$, we know that the sum of the squares of the distances from $A$ and $B$ to the origin must be a function of $k$ and $l$, not $x_1$ and $x_2$ directly.
Thus, it must be a function of $k$ and $l$, and not depend on $x_1$ and $x_2$ directly.
We know that the sum of the squares of the distances from $A$ and $B$ to the origin is given by
$$x_1^2 + (kx_1^2 - 2kx_1 + l)^2 + x_2^2 + (kx_2^2 - 2kx_2 + l)^2.$$
This expression is symmetric in $x_1$ and $x_2$, so it must be a function of $k$ and $l$, and not depend on $x_1$ and $x_2$ directly.
Also, we know that $x_1x_2 = \frac{l - 4}{k}$, and $(x_1 + x_2)^2 = 4$, so we can express the sum of squares of distances as a function of $k$ and $l$.
By Vieta's formulas, we know that $x_1x_2 = \frac{l - 4}{k}$, and $(x_1 + x_2)^2 = 4$, so we can express the sum of squares of distances as a function of $k$ and $l$.
We can use these facts to find an expression for the sum of squares of distances in terms of $k$ and $l$, and then substitute $l = 8k + 4$ to find the sum of squares of distances in terms of $k$ only.
We can use the identity $(a - b)^2 = a^2 + b^2 - 2ab$ to simplify the sum of squares of distances:
$$x_1^2 + (kx_1^2 - 2kx_1 + l)^2 + x_2^2 + (kx_2^2 - 2kx_2 + l)^2 = (x_1^2 + (kx_1^2 - 2kx_1 + l)^2) + (x_2^2 + (kx_2^2 - 2kx_2 + l)^2).$$
We know that $(x_1 + x_2)^2 = 4$, so $x_1^2 + x_2^2 = (x_1 + x_2)^2 - 2x_1x_2 = 4 - 2(8) = -12$.
But the sum of squares of distances cannot be negative

Question (hint: positive numerical answer):
"Let $k, l > 0$ be parameters. The parabola $y = kx^2 - 2kx + l$ intersects the line $y = 4$ at two points $A$ and $B$. These points are distance 6 apart. What is the sum of the squares of the distances from $A$ and $B$ to the origin?"
Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:



First, we find the x-coordinates of $A$ and $B$ by setting $y = 4$ in the equation of the parabola:
\[4 = kx^2 - 2kx + l.\]
Rearranging the equation gives $kx^2 - 2kx + l - 4 = 0$. Let's call this equation (1).

Given that $A$ and $B$ are distance 6 apart, we know that $(x_2 - x_1) = 6/ \sqrt{1^2} = 6$, where $x_1$ and $x_2$ are the x-coordinates of $A$ and $B$ respectively.

According to the quadratic formula, if $ax^2 + bx + c = 0$, then the roots $x_1$ and $x_2$ satisfy $x_1 + x_2 = -b/a$ and $x_1x_2 = c/a$.

Here, $a = k$, $b = -2k$, and $c = l - 4$. So, $x_1 + x_2 = 2k/k = 2$ and $x_1x_2 = (l - 4)/k$.

From $x_1 + x_2 = 2$, we have $x_2 = 2 - x_1$. Substituting into $x_1x_2 = (l - 4)/k$ gives $x_1(2 - x_1) = (l - 4)/k$, or $2x_1 - x_1^2 = (l - 4)/k$.

Multiplying through by $k$ gives $2kx_1 - kx_1^2 = l - 4$. Rearranging gives $kx_1^2 - 2kx_1 + 4 = l$, or equation (1) with $y = 4$.

Now we know that $A$ and $B$ are at $(x_1, 4)$ and $(x_2, 4)$ respectively. The distance from $A$ to the origin is $\sqrt{x_1^2 + 4^2} = \sqrt{x_1^2 + 16}$, and the distance from $B$ to the origin is $\sqrt{x_2^2 + 16} = \sqrt{(2 - x_1)^2 + 16} = \sqrt{4 - 4x_1 + x_1^2 + 16} = \sqrt{x_1^2 - 4x_1 + 20}$.

Therefore, the sum of the squares of the distances from $A$ and $B$ to the origin is
\[(\sqrt{x_1^2 + 16})^2 + (\sqrt{x_1^2 - 4x_1 + 20})^2 = x_1^2 + 16 + x_1^2 - 4x_1 + 20 = 2x_1^2 - 4x_1 + 36.\]

From the equation $2x_1 - x_1^2 = (l - 4)/k$, we can solve for $l$ in terms of $x_1$: $l = 2kx_1 - kx_1^2 + 4 = k(2x_1 - x_1^2) + 4 = k(2 - x_1)x_1 + 4 = kx_1(2 - x_1) + 4$.

Substituting this into the expression for the sum of squares of the distances gives
\[2x_1^2 - 4x_1 + 36 = 2x_1^2 - 4x_1 + \left[kx_1(2 - x_1) + 4\right] = 2x_1^2 - 4x_1 + 2kx_1^2 - 2kx_1^2 + 4kx_1 = 2x_1^2 - 4x_1 + 4kx_1 = 2x_1^2 + (4k - 4)x_1.\]

Since this is a constant, the value of this expression does not depend on $x_1$. Therefore, we can choose any convenient value for $x_1$ to calculate this expression. Let's choose $x_1 = 1$ (we can do this because $x_1$ and $x_2$ are interchangeable, and we know that $x_1x_2 = (l - 4)/k$). Then $l = k(2 - 1) \cdot 1 + 4 = k + 4$, and
\[2x_1^2 + (4k - 4)x_1 = 2 + (4k - 4) = 4k.\]

So, the sum of the squares of the distances from $A$ and $B$ to the origin is $4k$. But we know that $k, l > 0$, so $k$ is a positive number. Thus, the value of the expression is a positive number.

Therefore, the value of the expression is a positive numerical answer.

So, the answer is $\boxed{4k}$. Since we have established that $k$ is a positive number, $4k$ is also a positive numerical answer. The value of $k$ can be found by substituting the given conditions into the quadratic formula. For example, if $k = 1$ and $l = 5$, then the equation becomes $y = x^2 - 2x + 5$, and by solving for the roots, we can verify that the roots indeed satisfy the condition that the distance between them is 6. Thus, the sum of the squares of the distances from $A$ and $B$ to the origin is $4k = 4(1) = 4$. So the final answer is 4. The value of k is found by substituting the given conditions into the quadratic formula. For example, if k = 1 and l = 5, then the equation becomes y = x^2 - 2x + 5, and by solving for the roots, we can verify that the roots indeed satisfy the condition that the distance between them is 6. Thus, the sum of the squares of the distances from A and B to the origin is 4k = 4(1) = 4. The answer is: $4$

Question (hint: positive numerical answer):
"Let $k, l > 0$ be parameters. The parabola $y = kx^2 - 2kx + l$ intersects the line $y = 4$ at two points $A$ and $B$. These points are distance 6 apart. What is the sum of the squares of the distances from $A$ and $B$ to the origin?"
Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:


To solve this problem, we first need to find the coordinates of points $A$ and $B$. We know that these points are on the line $y = 4$, so we can substitute $y = 4$ into the equation of the parabola to find the corresponding $x$-values. 

Substituting $y = 4$ into the parabola equation gives:
$$4 = kx^2 - 2kx + l.$$
Rearranging the terms gives:
$$kx^2 - 2kx + l - 4 = 0.$$
Let's call this equation $(1)$.

We are given that points $A$ and $B$ are distance 6 apart. If $x_1$ and $x_2$ are the $x$-coordinates of points $A$ and $B$ respectively, then by the distance formula, we have:
$$(x_2 - x_1)^2 = 6^2 = 36.$$
From Vieta's formulas, we know that for a quadratic equation of the form $ax^2 + bx + c = 0$, the sum of the roots $x_1$ and $x_2$ is $-b/a$ and the product of the roots is $c/a$. In equation $(1)$, $a = k$, $b = -2k$, and $c = l - 4$. Thus, the sum of the roots $x_1 + x_2$ is $2k/k = 2$ and the product of the roots $x_1x_2$ is $(l - 4)/k$. Therefore, we have:
$$(x_2 - x_1)^2 = (x_2 + x_1)^2 - 4x_1x_2 = 2^2 - 4(l - 4)/k = 4 - 4(l - 4)/k = 36.$$
Simplifying the equation gives:
$$4 - \frac{4(l - 4)}{k} = 36.$$
$$\frac{4(l - 4)}{k} = -32.$$
$$4(l - 4) = -32k.$$
$$l - 4 = -8k.$$
$$l = 4 - 8k.$$

Now, we want to find the sum of the squares of the distances from $A$ and $B$ to the origin. If $A$ and $B$ are $(x_1, 4)$ and $(x_2, 4)$ respectively, the distances from $A$ and $B$ to the origin are $\sqrt{x_1^2 + 4^2}$ and $\sqrt{x_2^2 + 4^2}$ respectively. So, the sum of the squares of the distances is:
$$\left(\sqrt{x_1^2 + 16}\right)^2 + \left(\sqrt{x_2^2 + 16}\right)^2 = x_1^2 + 16 + x_2^2 + 16 = x_1^2 + x_2^2 + 32.$$

We already know that $x_1 + x_2 = 2$ and $x_1x_2 = (l - 4)/k = (-8k)/k = -8$. We can use the identity $(x_1 + x_2)^2 = x_1^2 + x_2^2 + 2x_1x_2$ to find $x_1^2 + x_2^2$:
$$(x_1 + x_2)^2 - 2x_1x_2 = x_1^2 + x_2^2,$$
$$2^2 - 2(-8) = x_1^2 + x_2^2,$$
$$4 + 16 = x_1^2 + x_2^2,$$
$$20 = x_1^2 + x_2^2.$$

Therefore, the sum of the squares of the distances from $A$ and $B$ to the origin is:
$$x_1^2 + x_2^2 + 32 = 20 + 32 = 52.$$

The sum of the squares of the distances from $A$ and $B$ to the origin is $52$. The answer is:
$$\boxed{52}$$

Question (hint: positive numerical answer):
"Let $k, l > 0$ be parameters. The parabola $y = kx^2 - 2kx + l$ intersects the line $y = 4$ at two points $A$ and $B$. These points are distance 6 apart. What is the sum of the squares of the distances from $A$ and $B$ to the origin?"
Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:


First, let's find the $x$-coordinates of points $A$ and $B$.
Setting $y = 4$ in the equation of the parabola gives:
$$4 = kx^2 - 2kx + l.$$
Rearranging terms, we get:
$$kx^2 - 2kx + (l - 4) = 0.$$
Let $x_1$ and $x_2$ be the solutions to this equation, corresponding to points $A$ and $B$, respectively.
We are given that the distance between $A$ and $B$ is 6, so $|x_2 - x_1| = 6$.
By Vieta's formulas, we know that $x_1 + x_2 = \frac{2k}{k} = 2$ and $x_1x_2 = \frac{l - 4}{k}$.
Using the difference of squares identity, we have:
$$(x_2 - x_1)^2 = (x_2 + x_1)^2 - 4x_1x_2.$$
Substituting the known values, we get:
$$36 = 4 - 4\left(\frac{l - 4}{k}\right).$$
Simplifying, we have:
$$36 = 4 - \frac{4l - 16}{k}.$$
Multiplying both sides by $k$, we get:
$$36k = 4k - 4l + 16.$$
Rearranging terms, we have:
$$4l = 4k + 36k - 16 = 40k - 16.$$
Dividing both sides by 4, we get:
$$l = 10k - 4.$$
Now, we want to find the sum of the squares of the distances from $A$ and $B$ to the origin.
The distance from a point $(x, y)$ to the origin is $\sqrt{x^2 + y^2}$.
For point $A$, this distance is $\sqrt{x_1^2 + (kx_1^2 - 2kx_1 + l)^2}$.
Similarly, for point $B$, this distance is $\sqrt{x_2^2 + (kx_2^2 - 2kx_2 + l)^2}$.
Let's denote $D_A = \sqrt{x_1^2 + (kx_1^2 - 2kx_1 + l)^2}$ and $D_B = \sqrt{x_2^2 + (kx_2^2 - 2kx_2 + l)^2}$.
We want to find $D_A^2 + D_B^2$.
Expanding, we get:
$$D_A^2 + D_B^2 = x_1^2 + (kx_1^2 - 2kx_1 + l)^2 + x_2^2 + (kx_2^2 - 2kx_2 + l)^2.$$
Using the values of $x_1 + x_2$, $x_1x_2$, and $l$, we can simplify this expression:
$$D_A^2 + D_B^2 = x_1^2 + (kx_1^2 - 2kx_1 + 10k - 4)^2 + x_2^2 + (kx_2^2 - 2kx_2 + 10k - 4)^2.$$
Since $x_1$ and $x_2$ are the solutions to the equation $kx^2 - 2kx + (l - 4) = 0$, by Vieta's formulas, we have $x_1x_2 = \frac{l - 4}{k}$.
Therefore, $x_1x_2 = 6$, and substituting this into the expression for $D_A^2 + D_B^2$, we get:
$$D_A^2 + D_B^2 = x_1^2 + (kx_1^2 - 2kx_1 + 10k - 4)^2 + x_2^2 + (kx_2^2 - 2kx_2 + 10k - 4)^2.$$
Since $x_1 + x_2 = 2$, we can substitute this into the expression for $D_A^2 + D_B^2$:
$$D_A^2 + D_B^2 = (2 - x_2)^2 + (k(2 - x_2)^2 - 2k(2 - x_2) + 10k - 4)^2 + x_2^2 + (kx_2^2 - 2kx_2 + 10k - 4)^2.$$
This simplifies to a quadratic in $x_2$:
$$D_A^2 + D_B^2 = 2x_2^4 - 24x_2^3 + 108x_2^2 - 208x_2 + 176.$$
To find the value of this expression, we can substitute $x_2 = 3$ (since $x_2 - x_1 = 6$ and $x_1 + x_2 = 2$ implies $x_2 = 3$) into the quadratic:
$$D_A^2 + D_B^2 = 2(3)^4 - 24(3)^3 + 108(3)^2 - 208(3) + 176 = 180.$$
Therefore, the sum of the squares of the distances from $A$ and $B$ to the origin is 180.
The value is 180. The answer is: $180$

Question (hint: positive numerical answer):
"Let $k, l > 0$ be parameters. The parabola $y = kx^2 - 2kx + l$ intersects the line $y = 4$ at two points $A$ and $B$. These points are distance 6 apart. What is the sum of the squares of the distances from $A$ and $B$ to the origin?"
Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:


First, we need to find the $x$-coordinates of points $A$ and $B$.
Setting $y = 4$ in the equation of the parabola, we get $4 = kx^2 - 2kx + l$.
Rearranging, we have $kx^2 - 2kx + (l-4) = 0$.

By the quadratic formula, the $x$-coordinates of $A$ and $B$ are given by
$$x = \frac{2k \pm \sqrt{(2k)^2 - 4k(l-4)}}{2k} = 1 \pm \sqrt{1 - \frac{l-4}{k}}.$$

Given that the distance between $A$ and $B$ is 6, we have
$$|1 - \sqrt{1 - \frac{l-4}{k}} - (1 + \sqrt{1 - \frac{l-4}{k}})| = 6,$$
which simplifies to
$$2\sqrt{1 - \frac{l-4}{k}} = 6.$$

Squaring both sides, we get
$$4\left(1 - \frac{l-4}{k}\right) = 36.$$
Simplifying, we have
$$4 - \frac{4(l-4)}{k} = 9.$$

Multiplying both sides by $k$, we get
$$4k - 4(l-4) = 9k.$$

Rearranging, we have
$$5k = 4(l-4),$$
so
$$l-4 = \frac{5k}{4}.$$

Substituting this into the equation $4 = k(1)^2 - 2k(1) + l$, we get
$$4 = k - 2k + \left(4 + \frac{5k}{4}\right),$$
which simplifies to
$$4 = -\frac{3k}{4}.$$

Multiplying both sides by $-4$, we have
$$16 = 3k,$$
so
$$k = \frac{16}{3}.$$

Then, we have
$$l-4 = \frac{5k}{4} = \frac{5 \cdot 16}{4 \cdot 3} = \frac{20}{3},$$
so
$$l = 4 + \frac{20}{3} = \frac{32}{3}.$$

The $x$-coordinates of $A$ and $B$ are
$$x = 1 \pm \sqrt{1 - \frac{l-4}{k}} = 1 \pm \sqrt{1 - \frac{\frac{20}{3}}{ \frac{16}{3}}} = 1 \pm \sqrt{1 - \frac{5}{4}} = 1 \pm \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}.$$

The distance from $A$ to the origin is $\sqrt{(1 - \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2})^2 + (4 - k(1 - \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2})^2)} = \sqrt{\frac{1}{4} + \frac{9}{4}} = \sqrt{1} = 1$.

The distance from $B$ to the origin is $\sqrt{(1 + \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2})^2 + (4 - k(1 + \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2})^2)} = \sqrt{\frac{1}{4} + \frac{9}{4}} = \sqrt{1} = 1$.

The sum of the squares of the distances from $A$ and $B$ to the origin is $1^2 + 1^2 = 2$.
The answer is: $2$

Question (hint: positive numerical answer):
"Let $k, l > 0$ be parameters. The parabola $y = kx^2 - 2kx + l$ intersects the line $y = 4$ at two points $A$ and $B$. These points are distance 6 apart. What is the sum of the squares of the distances from $A$ and $B$ to the origin?"
Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:


To solve this problem, we first need to find the x-coordinates of points A and B by setting $y = 4$ in the parabola equation. So we have:
\[4 = kx^2 - 2kx + l.\]
Rearranging the equation gives us:
\[kx^2 - 2kx + l - 4 = 0.\]
This is a quadratic equation in $x$, and we know that it has two roots (the x-coordinates of points A and B) that are distance 6 apart. Let's call these roots $x_1$ and $x_2$. By the properties of quadratic equations, we have:
\[x_1 + x_2 = \frac{2k}{k} = 2,\]
\[x_1x_2 = \frac{l - 4}{k}.\]
And we know that $|x_1 - x_2| = 6$, which implies $(x_1 - x_2)^2 = 36$. By the difference of squares formula, we have:
\[(x_1 - x_2)^2 = (x_1 + x_2)^2 - 4x_1x_2 = 36.\]
Substituting the expressions for $x_1 + x_2$ and $x_1x_2$ into this equation gives us:
\[4 - 4\cdot \frac{l - 4}{k} = 36.\]
Simplifying this equation gives us:
\[4k - 4l + 16 = 36k.\]
Rearranging terms, we get:
\[36k - 4k = 4l - 16,\]
\[32k = 4l - 16.\]
Dividing by 4 gives us:
\[8k = l - 4.\]
Adding 4 to both sides gives us:
\[l = 8k + 4.\]
Now we substitute this expression for $l$ into the equation $kx^2 - 2kx + l - 4 = 0$, to get:
\[kx^2 - 2kx + 8k = 0.\]
This is a quadratic equation with discriminant $\Delta = (-2k)^2 - 4*k*8k = 4k^2 - 32k^2 = -28k^2$. Since the discriminant is negative, the parabola and line $y = 4$ do not intersect, which is a contradiction. Therefore, our assumption that the parabola and line intersect at two points must be incorrect. Let's try a different approach.

Instead of trying to find the x-coordinates of A and B, let's find the distance from each point to the origin. The distance from a point $(x, y)$ to the origin is given by $\sqrt{x^2 + y^2}$. Since we know that $y = 4$, the distance from each point to the origin is $\sqrt{x^2 + 16}$.

For point A, let's call its x-coordinate $x_1$. For point B, let's call its x-coordinate $x_2$. The sum of the squares of the distances from A and B to the origin is:
\[(\sqrt{x_1^2 + 16})^2 + (\sqrt{x_2^2 + 16})^2 = x_1^2 + 16 + x_2^2 + 16 = x_1^2 + x_2^2 + 32.\]

We know that $x_1 + x_2 = 2$ and $x_1x_2 = \frac{l - 4}{k}$. We can square the equation $x_1 + x_2 = 2$ to get:
\[(x_1 + x_2)^2 = 4,\]
\[x_1^2 + 2x_1x_2 + x_2^2 = 4.\]
Substituting $x_1x_2 = \frac{l - 4}{k}$ into this equation gives us:
\[x_1^2 + 2\cdot \frac{l - 4}{k} + x_2^2 = 4.\]
Rearranging terms gives us:
\[x_1^2 + x_2^2 = 4 - 2\cdot \frac{l - 4}{k} = 4 - 2\cdot \frac{8k + 4 - 4}{k} = 4 - 16/k.\]

Substituting this into the sum of the squares of the distances from A and B to the origin gives us:
\[4 - 16/k + 32 = 36 - 16/k.\]
Therefore, the sum of the squares of the distances from A and B to the origin is $36 - \frac{16}{k}$.

But we know that $k = 1$ (since the coefficient of $x^2$ in the parabola equation is 1). Substituting $k = 1$ into the sum of the squares of the distances gives us:
\[36 - \frac{16}{1} = 36 - 16 = 20.\]
Therefore, the sum of the squares of the distances from A and B to the origin is 20. The answer is: $20$

Question (hint: positive numerical answer):
"Let $k, l > 0$ be parameters. The parabola $y = kx^2 - 2kx + l$ intersects the line $y = 4$ at two points $A$ and $B$. These points are distance 6 apart. What is the sum of the squares of the distances from $A$ and $B$ to the origin?"
Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:


To find the $x$-coordinates of $A$ and $B$, we set $y = 4$ and $y = kx^2 - 2kx + l$:
$$4 = kx^2 - 2kx + l.$$
Rearranging, we get $kx^2 - 2kx + l - 4 = 0$.
This is a quadratic equation, and we know that the two solutions $x = a$ and $x = b$ (which represent the $x$-coordinates of $A$ and $B$) are related to the coefficients by $a + b = \frac{2k}{k} = 2$ and $ab = \frac{l - 4}{k}$.
We are given that $|a - b| = 6$, so using the difference of squares we get $(a - b)^2 = 36$.
Expanding, we have $a^2 - 2ab + b^2 = 36$.
From the above, we know that $ab = \frac{l - 4}{k}$, so we substitute that into the equation to get: $a^2 - 2(\frac{l - 4}{k}) + b^2 = 36$.
We also know that $(a + b)^2 = 4$, so $a^2 + 2ab + b^2 = 16$.
Subtracting these two equations, we get $4ab = 20$, so $ab = 5$.
Substituting this back into $ab = \frac{l - 4}{k}$, we have $5 = \frac{l - 4}{k}$.
Multiplying both sides by $k$, we get $5k = l - 4$.
Solving for $l$, we have $l = 5k + 4$.
Now we need to find the sum of the squares of the distances from $A$ and $B$ to the origin.
The distance from $A$ to the origin is $\sqrt{a^2 + b^2}$, and the distance from $B$ to the origin is $\sqrt{a^2 + b^2}$.
So the sum of the squares of the distances is $2(a^2 + b^2)$.
From the equation $a^2 + 2ab + b^2 = 16$, we can rewrite this as $a^2 + b^2 = 16 - 2ab = 16 - 2(5) = 6$.
Therefore, the sum of the squares of the distances from $A$ and $B$ to the origin is $2(6) = 12$.
The answer is: $12$

Question (hint: positive numerical answer):
"Let $k, l > 0$ be parameters. The parabola $y = kx^2 - 2kx + l$ intersects the line $y = 4$ at two points $A$ and $B$. These points are distance 6 apart. What is the sum of the squares of the distances from $A$ and $B$ to the origin?"
Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:


First, we set $y = kx^2 - 2kx + l$ and $y = 4$ equal to each other to find the x-coordinates of points $A$ and $B$:
\[kx^2 - 2kx + l = 4.\]
Rearranging terms gives us:
\[kx^2 - 2kx + (l - 4) = 0.\]
This is a quadratic equation, and we know that the distance between $A$ and $B$ is 6.
By the quadratic formula, the x-coordinates of $A$ and $B$ are given by:
\[x = \frac{2k \pm \sqrt{(2k)^2 - 4k(l - 4)}}{2k} = 1 \pm \frac{\sqrt{4k^2 - 4k(l - 4)}}{2k} = 1 \pm \frac{\sqrt{4k^2 - 4kl + 16k}}{2k}.\]
We are given that the distance between $A$ and $B$ is 6, so:
\[\left| \frac{\sqrt{4k^2 - 4kl + 16k}}{2k} \right| = 3.\]
Squaring both sides, we get:
\[\frac{4k^2 - 4kl + 16k}{4k^2} = 9.\]
Simplifying, we have:
\[4k^2 - 4kl + 16k = 36k^2.\]
Rearranging terms gives us:
\[32k^2 = 4kl \implies 8k = l.\]
Now, we want to find the sum of the squares of the distances from $A$ and $B$ to the origin.
The distance from a point $(x, y)$ to the origin is $\sqrt{x^2 + y^2}$.
For point $A$, with x-coordinate $1 + \frac{\sqrt{4k^2 - 4kl + 16k}}{2k}$ and y-coordinate 4, the distance to the origin is:
\[d_A = \sqrt{\left(1 + \frac{\sqrt{4k^2 - 4kl + 16k}}{2k}\right)^2 + 4^2}.\]
For point $B$, with x-coordinate $1 - \frac{\sqrt{4k^2 - 4kl + 16k}}{2k}$ and y-coordinate 4, the distance to the origin is:
\[d_B = \sqrt{\left(1 - \frac{\sqrt{4k^2 - 4kl + 16k}}{2k}\right)^2 + 4^2}.\]
We want to find $d_A^2 + d_B^2$.
Expanding and simplifying, we get:
\[d_A^2 + d_B^2 = \left(1 + \frac{\sqrt{4k^2 - 4kl + 16k}}{2k}\right)^2 + \left(1 - \frac{\sqrt{4k^2 - 4kl + 16k}}{2k}\right)^2 + 32.\]
We know that $l = 8k$, so we can substitute to simplify:
\[d_A^2 + d_B^2 = \left(1 + \frac{\sqrt{4k^2 - 4k(8k) + 16k}}{2k}\right)^2 + \left(1 - \frac{\sqrt{4k^2 - 4k(8k) + 16k}}{2k}\right)^2 + 32 = \left(1 + \frac{\sqrt{4k^2 - 32k^2 + 16k}}{2k}\right)^2 + \left(1 - \frac{\sqrt{4k^2 - 32k^2 + 16k}}{2k}\right)^2 + 32 = \left(1 + \frac{\sqrt{-24k^2 + 16k}}{2k}\right)^2 + \left(1 - \frac{\sqrt{-24k^2 + 16k}}{2k}\right)^2 + 32.\]
However, we can see that the expression under the square root is negative for any positive value of $k$. This means that the expression is undefined.

Let's go back and reevaluate our steps.
We have the quadratic equation $kx^2 - 2kx + (l - 4) = 0$. The solutions of this equation are given by:
\[x = \frac{2k \pm \sqrt{(2k)^2 - 4k(l - 4)}}{2k} = 1 \pm \frac{\sqrt{4k^2 - 4kl + 16k}}{2k}.\]
We are given that the distance between $A$ and $B$ is 6, so:
\[\left| \frac{\sqrt{4k^2 - 4kl + 16k}}{2k} \right| = 3.\]
Squaring both sides, we get:
\[4k^2 - 4kl + 16k = 9(4k^2).\]
Simplifying, we have:
\[36k^2 = 4kl \implies 9k = l.\]
Now, we want to find the sum of the squares of the distances from $A$ and $B$ to the origin.
The distance from a point $(x, y)$ to the origin is $\sqrt{x^2 + y^2}$.
For point $A$, with x-coordinate $1 + \frac{\sqrt{4k^2 - 4kl + 16k}}{2k}$ and y-coordinate 4, the distance to the origin is:
\[d_A = \sqrt{\left(1 + \frac{\sqrt{4k^2 - 4k(9k) + 16k}}{2k}\right)^2 + 4^2} = \sqrt{\left(1 + \frac{\sqrt{-20k^2 + 16k}}{2k}\right)^2 + 16}.\]
For point $B$, with x-coordinate $1 - \frac{\sqrt{4k^2 - 4kl + 16k}}{2k}$ and y-coordinate 4, the distance to the origin is:
\[d_B = \sqrt{\left(1 - \frac{\sqrt{4k^2 - 4k(9k) + 16k}}{2k}\right)^2 + 4^2} = \sqrt{\left(1 - \frac{\sqrt{-20k^2 + 16k}}{2k}\right)^2 + 16}.\]
We want to find $d_A^2 + d_B^2$.
Expanding and simplifying, we get:
\[d_A^2 + d_B^2 = \left(1 + \frac{\sqrt{-20k^2 + 16k}}{2k}\right)^2 + \left(1 - \frac{\sqrt{-20k^

Question (hint: positive numerical answer):
"Let $k, l > 0$ be parameters. The parabola $y = kx^2 - 2kx + l$ intersects the line $y = 4$ at two points $A$ and $B$. These points are distance 6 apart. What is the sum of the squares of the distances from $A$ and $B$ to the origin?"
Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:



First, we set $y = kx^2 - 2kx + l$ and $y = 4$ equal to each other and get the equation $kx^2 - 2kx + l - 4 = 0$.

We are given that the two points $A$ and $B$ are distance 6 apart. This means that the difference of the roots of this quadratic equation is 6. By Vieta's formulas, we know that the difference of the roots of a quadratic equation $ax^2 + bx + c = 0$ is $\sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}/|a|$, which in our case is $\sqrt{(-2k)^2 - 4*k*(l-4)}/|k| = \sqrt{4k^2 - 4k*(l-4)}/k = 6$.

This simplifies to $\sqrt{4k^2 - 4k*(l-4)} = 6k$. Squaring both sides gives $4k^2 - 4k*(l-4) = 36k^2$, which simplifies to $32k^2 = 4k*(l-4)$. Dividing both sides by 4k gives $8k = l - 4$, so $l = 8k + 4$.

Now we want to find the sum of the squares of the distances from $A$ and $B$ to the origin. By Pythagorean theorem, this is equal to $(x_1^2 + y_1^2) + (x_2^2 + y_2^2)$, where $(x_1, y_1)$ and $(x_2, y_2)$ are the coordinates of points $A$ and $B$ respectively. Since $y_1 = y_2 = 4$, this simplifies to $x_1^2 + 16 + x_2^2 + 16 = x_1^2 + x_2^2 + 32$.

By Vieta's formulas, we know that $x_1 + x_2 = 2k$ and $x_1*x_2 = (l - 4)/k = 8k + 4 - 4/k = 8k + 4/k$.

We want to find $x_1^2 + x_2^2$, which can be obtained by squaring the equation $x_1 + x_2 = 2k$ to get $x_1^2 + 2x_1*x_2 + x_2^2 = 4k^2$, and subtracting $4x_1*x_2 = 4*(8k + 4/k) = 32k + 16/k$ from both sides to get $x_1^2 + x_2^2 = 4k^2 - 32k - 16/k$.

Therefore, the sum of the squares of the distances from $A$ and $B$ to the origin is $4k^2 - 32k - 16/k + 32 = 4k^2 - 32k + 16/k$.

Now we can substitute $l = 8k + 4$ back into the equation $\sqrt{4k^2 - 4k*(l-4)} = 6k$ to solve for $k$. We get $\sqrt{4k^2 - 4k*(8k + 4 - 4)} = 6k$, which simplifies to $\sqrt{4k^2 - 32k^2} = 6k$. Squaring both sides gives $4k^2 - 32k^2 = 36k^2$, which simplifies to $0 = 72k^2$, so $k = 0$. However, this doesn't make sense because we are given that $k > 0$, so we must have made a mistake somewhere.

Going back to the equation $l = 8k + 4$, we notice that we can substitute $l = 8k + 4$ directly into the equation $\sqrt{4k^2 - 4k*(l-4)} = 6k$. We get $\sqrt{4k^2 - 4k*(8k + 4 - 4)} = 6k$, which simplifies to $\sqrt{4k^2 - 32k^2} = 6k$, and then $\sqrt{-28k^2} = 6k$. This obviously doesn't make sense, so we must have made another mistake.

Going back to the equation $4k^2 - 4k*(l-4) = 36k^2$, we notice that we made a mistake when we squared both sides of the equation. We should have instead squared the equation $\sqrt{4k^2 - 4k*(l-4)} = 6k$ to get $4k^2 - 4k*(l-4) = 36k^2$, and then substituted $l = 8k + 4$ to get $4k^2 - 4k*(8k + 4 - 4) = 36k^2$, which simplifies to $4k^2 - 32k^2 = 36k^2$, and then $0 = 72k^2$, so $k = 0$.

However, as we already mentioned, this doesn't make sense because we are given that $k > 0$. We must have made another mistake.

Going back to the equation $\sqrt{4k^2 - 4k*(l-4)} = 6k$, we notice that we can multiply both sides by $k$ to get $\sqrt{4k^2 - 4k*(l-4)}*k = 6k^2$. The left side of the equation simplifies to $\sqrt{4k^2 - 4k*(l-4)}*k = \sqrt{(4k^2 - 4k*(l-4))*k^2} = \sqrt{4k^3 - 4k^2*(l-4)} = 6k^2$. Squaring both sides gives $4k^3 - 4k^2*(l-4) = 36k^4$, which simplifies to $4k^3 - 4k^2*(8k + 4 - 4) = 36k^4$, and then $4k^3 - 32k^3 = 36k^4$, and finally $-28k^3 = 36k^4$. This still doesn't make sense, so we must have made another mistake.

Going back to the equation $4k^2 - 4k*(l-4) = 36k^2$, we notice that we made a mistake when we squared the equation $\sqrt{4k^2 - 4k*(l-4)} = 6k$. We should have instead squared the equation $4k^2 - 4k*(l-4) = 36k^2$ to get $4k^2 - 4k*(l-4) = 36k^

Question (hint: positive numerical answer):
"Let $k, l > 0$ be parameters. The parabola $y = kx^2 - 2kx + l$ intersects the line $y = 4$ at two points $A$ and $B$. These points are distance 6 apart. What is the sum of the squares of the distances from $A$ and $B$ to the origin?"
Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:


To solve this problem, we first need to find the coordinates of points $A$ and $B$. The parabola $y = kx^2 - 2kx + l$ intersects the line $y = 4$, so we set $kx^2 - 2kx + l = 4$.
Rearranging the equation, we get $kx^2 - 2kx + l - 4 = 0$.
Let $x_1$ and $x_2$ be the x-coordinates of points $A$ and $B$ respectively. By Vieta's formulas, we have $x_1 + x_2 = \frac{2k}{k} = 2$ and $x_1x_2 = \frac{l - 4}{k}$.
We are given that the distance between $A$ and $B$ is 6, so we can use the distance formula $d = \sqrt{(x_2 - x_1)^2 + (4 - 4)^2} = 6$, which simplifies to $(x_2 - x_1)^2 = 36$. Expanding and using the fact that $x_1 + x_2 = 2$, we get $x_1^2 + x_2^2 - 2x_1x_2 = 36$, or $(x_1^2 + x_2^2) - 2(l - 4) = 36$.

Now, we want to find the sum of the squares of the distances from $A$ and $B$ to the origin. The distance from a point $(x, y)$ to the origin is $\sqrt{x^2 + y^2}$. For point $A$, this is $\sqrt{x_1^2 + (k x_1^2 - 2kx_1 + l)^2}$, and for point $B$, this is $\sqrt{x_2^2 + (k x_2^2 - 2kx_2 + l)^2}$. To simplify, let's denote $d_1 = \sqrt{x_1^2 + (k x_1^2 - 2kx_1 + l)^2}$ and $d_2 = \sqrt{x_2^2 + (k x_2^2 - 2kx_2 + l)^2}$. Then, we want to find $d_1^2 + d_2^2$.
Expanding and using the fact that $x_1^2 + x_2^2 = (x_1 + x_2)^2 - 2x_1x_2 = 4 - 2(l - 4) = 8 - 2l$, we get
\begin{align*}
d_1^2 + d_2^2 &= x_1^2 + (k x_1^2 - 2kx_1 + l)^2 + x_2^2 + (k x_2^2 - 2kx_2 + l)^2 \\
&= (x_1^2 + x_2^2) + k^2(x_1^4 - 4x_1^3 + 4x_1^2 - 4lx_1^2 + 8lx_1 - 4l^2) + (l - 4)^2 \\
&= 8 - 2l + k^2(x_1^4 + 4x_1^2 + 4 - 4lx_1^2 + 8lx_1 - 4l^2) + (l - 4)^2 \\
&= 8 - 2l + k^2((x_1^2 - 2lx_1 + l)^2 + 4 - 4l^2) + (l - 4)^2 \\
&= 8 - 2l + k^2((l - 4)^2 + 4 - 4l^2) + (l - 4)^2 \\
&= 8 - 2l + k^2(2(l - 4)^2 - 4l^2) + (l - 4)^2 \\
&= 8 - 2l + 2k^2(l - 4)^2 - 4k^2l^2 + (l - 4)^2 \\
&= 8 - 2l + 3(l - 4)^2 - 4k^2l^2.
\end{align*}
We know that $x_1x_2 = \frac{l - 4}{k}$, so $l - 4 = kx_1x_2$. Substituting this into the equation above, we get
\begin{align*}
d_1^2 + d_2^2 &= 8 - 2l + 3(kx_1x_2)^2 - 4k^2l^2 \\
&= 8 - 2l + 3k^2x_1^2x_2^2 - 4k^2l^2 \\
&= 8 - 2l + 3k^2(l - 4)^2 - 4k^2l^2 \\
&= 8 - 2l + 3k^2(k^2x_1^2x_2^2) - 4k^2l^2 \\
&= 8 - 2l + 3k^4x_1^2x_2^2 - 4k^2l^2 \\
&= 8 - 2l + 3k^4(l - 4)^2 - 4k^2l^2 \\
&= 8 - 2l + 3k^4(k^2x_1^2x_2^2) - 4k^2l^2 \\
&= 8 - 2l + 3k^6x_1^2x_2^2 - 4k^2l^2 \\
&= 8 - 2l + 3k^6(l - 4)^2 - 4k^2l^2.
\end{align*}
We know that $(x_1^2 + x_2^2) - 2(l - 4) = 36$, so $8 - 2l + 3k^6(l - 4)^2 - 4k^2l^2 = 36$. Simplifying, we get
\[8 - 2l + 3k^6(l - 4)^2 - 4k^2l^2 = 36.\]
Solving this equation for $l$, we get $l = 5$. Substituting this back into the equation above, we get
\[8 - 2(5) + 3k^6(5 - 4)^2 - 4k^2(5)^2 = 36,\]
which simplifies to
\[-2 + 3k^6 - 100k^2 = 36.\]
Rearranging, we get
\[3k^6 - 100k^2 - 64 = 0.\]
Let $x = k^2$, then the equation becomes
\[3x^3

Question (hint: positive numerical answer):
"Let $k, l > 0$ be parameters. The parabola $y = kx^2 - 2kx + l$ intersects the line $y = 4$ at two points $A$ and $B$. These points are distance 6 apart. What is the sum of the squares of the distances from $A$ and $B$ to the origin?"
Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:


To solve this problem, we need to find the points of intersection of the parabola $y = kx^2 - 2kx + l$ and the line $y = 4$. Setting these equal to each other, we get
\[4 = kx^2 - 2kx + l.\]
Rearranging terms, we have
\[kx^2 - 2kx + (l - 4) = 0.\]
This is a quadratic equation in $x$, and we know that the solutions (which are the x-coordinates of $A$ and $B$) are distance 6 apart. The distance between the roots of a quadratic equation $ax^2 + bx + c = 0$ is given by $\sqrt{\frac{b^2 - 4ac}{a^2}}$. In our case, $a = k$, $b = -2k$, and $c = l - 4$. Thus, we have
\[6 = \sqrt{\frac{(-2k)^2 - 4(k)(l - 4)}{k^2}} = \sqrt{\frac{4k^2 - 4k(l - 4)}{k^2}} = \sqrt{\frac{4k^2 - 4kl + 16k}{k^2}}.\]
Squaring both sides, we get
\[36 = \frac{4k^2 - 4kl + 16k}{k^2} \implies 36k^2 = 4k^2 - 4kl + 16k \implies 32k^2 + 4kl - 16k = 0.\]
This is a quadratic equation in $k$, and we can solve it using the quadratic formula:
\[k = \frac{-4l \pm \sqrt{(-4l)^2 - 4(32)(-16)}}{2(32)} = \frac{-4l \pm \sqrt{16l^2 + 2048}}{64}.\]
Since $k > 0$, we only consider the positive root:
\[k = \frac{-4l + \sqrt{16l^2 + 2048}}{64}.\]
Substituting this back into the quadratic equation $kx^2 - 2kx + (l - 4) = 0$, we can find the x-coordinates of $A$ and $B$. Then, we can use the distance formula to find the distances from $A$ and $B$ to the origin, and square them to get the sum. After a bit of tedious calculation, we find that this sum simplifies to $72 + \frac{16l^2 + 256}{l^2}$, and substituting $k = \frac{-4l + \sqrt{16l^2 + 2048}}{64}$ into this expression, we get that the sum is $72 + 8 = 80$. Therefore, the sum of the squares of the distances from $A$ and $B$ to the origin is $80$. The answer is: $80$

Question (hint: positive numerical answer):
"Let $k, l > 0$ be parameters. The parabola $y = kx^2 - 2kx + l$ intersects the line $y = 4$ at two points $A$ and $B$. These points are distance 6 apart. What is the sum of the squares of the distances from $A$ and $B$ to the origin?"
Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:


First, let's find the x-coordinates of points A and B. The equation of the parabola intersects the line $y = 4$ at two points A and B, so we can set $kx^2 - 2kx + l = 4$. This simplifies to $kx^2 - 2kx + l - 4 = 0$.
Let $x_1$ and $x_2$ be the x-coordinates of points A and B respectively. By the distance formula, the distance between A and B is $\sqrt{(x_2-x_1)^2 + (4-4)^2} = |x_2-x_1| = 6$ since the line $y = 4$ is horizontal.
By the quadratic formula, the roots $x_1$ and $x_2$ are given by $\frac{2k \pm \sqrt{(2k)^2 - 4k(l - 4)}}{2k} = \frac{2k \pm \sqrt{4k^2 - 4k(l - 4)}}{2k} = 1 \pm \sqrt{1 - \frac{l - 4}{k}}$.
Hence, $x_2 - x_1 = 2\sqrt{1 - \frac{l - 4}{k}}$.
But $x_2 - x_1 = 6$, so $2\sqrt{1 - \frac{l - 4}{k}} = 6$, and $\sqrt{1 - \frac{l - 4}{k}} = 3$.
Squaring both sides gives $1 - \frac{l - 4}{k} = 9$, so $\frac{l - 4}{k} = -8$.
Therefore, $l - 4 = -8k$, or $l = 4 - 8k$.
The sum of the squares of the distances from A and B to the origin is $(x_1)^2 + (y_1)^2 + (x_2)^2 + (y_2)^2$, where $y_1 = y_2 = 4$.
We know that $(x_1)^2 + (y_1)^2 = x_1^2 + 4^2 = (1 - \sqrt{1 - \frac{l - 4}{k}})^2 + 4^2 = (1 - \sqrt{1 - \frac{4 - 8k - 4}{k}})^2 + 16 = (1 - \sqrt{1 + \frac{8k}{k}})^2 + 16 = (1 - \sqrt{2})^2 + 16 = 1 - 2\sqrt{2} + 2 + 16 = 19 - 2\sqrt{2}$, and $(x_2)^2 + (y_2)^2 = (1 + \sqrt{1 - \frac{l - 4}{k}})^2 + 16 = (1 + \sqrt{1 + \frac{8k}{k}})^2 + 16 = (1 + \sqrt{2})^2 + 16 = 1 + 2\sqrt{2} + 2 + 16 = 19 + 2\sqrt{2}$.
So the sum of the squares of the distances from A and B to the origin is $(19 - 2\sqrt{2}) + (19 + 2\sqrt{2}) = 38$.
The value of the sum of the squares of the distances from A and B to the origin is 38. The answer is: $38$

Question (hint: positive numerical answer):
"What is the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ when $x$ and $y$ range over all real numbers such that $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$?"
Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:


First, let's consider the equation $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$.
This equation can be rewritten using the absolute value property $|a| = \max\{a,-a\}$ as follows:
\[|x-2y| + |y-2x| = (2y-x) + (2x-y) = x + y = 40.\]
Now, let's consider the expression $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$. We can rewrite it as:
\[5x^2+5y^2-8xy = \frac{1}{2}(10x^2+10y^2-16xy) = \frac{1}{2}((2x-y)^2+(x-2y)^2).\]
Since $x + y = 40$, we can substitute $y = 40 - x$ into the above expression:
\[\frac{1}{2}((2x-(40-x))^2+((x-2(40-x))^2) = \frac{1}{2}((3x-40)^2 + (-x-80)^2).\]
To find the minimum value of this expression, we can find the value of $x$ that minimizes it.
The expression is minimized when both $(3x-40)^2$ and $(-x-80)^2$ are minimized.
Since the square of a real number is always nonnegative, both $(3x-40)^2$ and $(-x-80)^2$ are minimized when $3x-40 = 0$ and $-x-80 = 0$, respectively.
Solving these equations gives $x = \frac{40}{3}$ and $x = -80$.
However, we only consider the value of $x$ in the range of $x$ values that satisfy $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$.
Substituting $x = \frac{40}{3}$ into $x + y = 40$, we get $y = \frac{80}{3}$.
Thus, the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ is:
\[\frac{1}{2}\left((3\cdot \frac{40}{3}-40)^2 + (-\frac{40}{3}-80)^2\right) = \frac{1}{2}(0 + 12000) = 6000.\]
Therefore, the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ when $x$ and $y$ satisfy the given condition is 6000. The answer is: $6000$.

Question (hint: positive numerical answer):
"What is the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ when $x$ and $y$ range over all real numbers such that $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$?"
Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:


We first note that $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$ can be rewritten as $|x-2y| + |2y-x| = 40$. By the triangle inequality, we know that $|x-2y| + |2y-x| \geq |(x-2y) + (2y-x)| = |0| = 0$. But we know that the left-hand side is equal to 40, which is a positive number. This is only possible if both $|x-2y|$ and $|2y-x|$ are equal to 20, so we must have $x-2y = \pm 20$ and $2y-x = \pm 20$. Adding these two equations gives $y = \pm 20$, and substituting this back into the equations gives $x = \pm 60$.
Now we substitute $x=60$ and $y=20$ into the expression $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ to find the minimum value: $5(60)^2 + 5(20)^2 - 8(60)(20) = 18000 + 2000 - 9600 = 18400$.
Therefore, the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ is 18400. The answer is: $18400$.

Question (hint: positive numerical answer):
"What is the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ when $x$ and $y$ range over all real numbers such that $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$?"
Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:


The given expression is $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$. We can rewrite it as $5(x^2+y^2)-8xy$. We know that $(x-y)^2 = x^2 - 2xy + y^2$, so we can rewrite $x^2+y^2$ as $(x-y)^2 + 2xy$. Substituting this into the expression gives $5((x-y)^2 + 2xy) - 8xy = 5(x-y)^2 + 2xy - 8xy = 5(x-y)^2 - 6xy$.

Now we consider the constraint $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$. Without loss of generality, let's assume $x \geq 2y$. Then $|x-2y| = x - 2y$ and $|y-2x| = 2x - y$. So we have $x - 2y + 2x - y = 40$, which simplifies to $3x - 3y = 40$, or $x - y = \frac{40}{3}$.

Now, substituting $x - y = \frac{40}{3}$ into $5(x-y)^2 - 6xy$, we get $5 \left(\frac{40}{3}\right)^2 - 6xy = \frac{8000}{9} - 6xy$.

Now we need to find the minimum value of this expression. Since the expression involves both $x$ and $y$, it's not straightforward to find the minimum directly. But we know from the constraint that $x - y = \frac{40}{3}$, so we can substitute $y = x - \frac{40}{3}$ into the expression and find the minimum of the resulting function with respect to $x$.

After substituting $y = x - \frac{40}{3}$ into the expression $\frac{8000}{9} - 6xy$, we get $\frac{8000}{9} - 6x \left(x - \frac{40}{3}\right) = \frac{8000}{9} - 6x^2 + 80x = -6x^2 + 80x + \frac{8000}{9}$.

Now we need to find the minimum of this quadratic function $-6x^2 + 80x + \frac{8000}{9}$. The minimum occurs at $x = -\frac{b}{2a} = -\frac{80}{2(-6)} = \frac{20}{3}$. Substituting $x = \frac{20}{3}$ back into $y = x - \frac{40}{3}$ gives $y = \frac{20}{3} - \frac{40}{3} = -\frac{20}{3}$.

Substituting $x = \frac{20}{3}$ and $y = -\frac{20}{3}$ back into $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ gives $5 \left(\frac{20}{3}\right)^2 + 5 \left(-\frac{20}{3}\right)^2 - 8 \left(\frac{20}{3}\right) \left(-\frac{20}{3}\right) = \frac{8000}{9}$.

Therefore, the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ under the constraint $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$ is $\frac{8000}{9}$.

The answer is: $8000/9$

Question (hint: positive numerical answer):
"What is the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ when $x$ and $y$ range over all real numbers such that $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$?"
Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:



First, let's rewrite the condition $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$ as $|2y-x| + |2x-y| = 40$. By the Triangle Inequality, $|2y-x| + |2x-y| \ge |(2y-x) - (2x-y)| = |y-3x|$. So we have $|y-3x| = 40$.
Next, we square both sides to get $(y-3x)^2 = 1600$. This simplifies to $y^2 - 6xy + 9x^2 = 1600$.
Now, let's substitute this into the expression we want to minimize: $5x^2+5y^2-8xy = 5x^2 + 5(9x^2 - 6xy + y^2) - 8xy = 50x^2 - 28xy + 5y^2$.

Now we substitute $y^2 - 6xy + 9x^2 = 1600$ into this to get $50x^2 - 28xy + 5(1600 + 6xy - 9x^2) = 50x^2 - 28xy + 8000 + 30xy - 45x^2 = -5x^2 + 2xy + 8000$.

This is a quadratic in $x$ with a coefficient of $x^2$ of $-5$, which is negative, so it opens downwards and has a maximum value. The $x$ value that gives this maximum value is the $x$ value that makes the derivative of this quadratic equal to zero. The derivative is $-10x + 2y = 0$, or $y = 5x$.

Substituting $y = 5x$ into $|y-3x| = 40$, we get $|5x-3x| = 40$, or $|2x| = 40$, or $x = \pm 20$. Then $y = \pm 100$.

Substituting $x = 20$ and $y = 100$ into $-5x^2 + 2xy + 8000$, we get $-5(20^2) + 2(20)(100) + 8000 = -2000 + 4000 + 8000 = 10000$.

So the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ is $10000$. The answer is: $10000$

Question (hint: positive numerical answer):
"What is the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ when $x$ and $y$ range over all real numbers such that $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$?"
Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:


First, we rewrite the expression $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ as $(5x^2-8xy+5y^2)$. This is the square of a binomial: $(5x^2-8xy+5y^2) = (√5x - √5y)^2$. Therefore, its minimum value is $0$.
Next, we consider the equation $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$. Using the property of absolute value, we can rewrite this as $|x-2y| + |2y-x| = 40$, which simplifies to $2|x-2y| = 40$.
Dividing both sides by 2, we get $|x-2y| = 20$.
Since the absolute value of a real number is always non-negative, we have $|x-2y| \ge 0$. Therefore, the minimum value of $|x-2y|$ is 0.
Setting $|x-2y| = 0$, we get $x = 2y$.
Substituting $x = 2y$ into the expression $(√5x - √5y)^2$, we have $(√5(2y) - √5y)^2 = (√10y - √5y)^2 = (√5y)^2 = 5y^2$.
Therefore, the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ is $5y^2$, and to find this minimum value, we need to minimize $y^2$.
Since $y^2$ is always non-negative, its minimum value is 0.
Therefore, the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ is $5(0) = 0$.
However, this is not possible as it contradicts the given condition $|x-2y| = 20 \ne 0$.
So, we must consider the minimum value of the expression under the condition $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$.
Setting $x = 2y$ in the condition, we have $|2y-2y| + |y-4y| = 40$, which simplifies to $0 + 3|y| = 40$.
Dividing both sides by 3, we get $|y| = \frac{40}{3}$.
Since $y^2$ is always non-negative, the minimum value of $y^2$ is 0.
Therefore, the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ is $0$.
However, this is not possible as it contradicts the given condition $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40 \ne 0$.
We made a mistake in our reasoning, and the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ does not necessarily occur when $x = 2y$.
Let's reconsider the given condition $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$.
By the Triangle Inequality, $|x-2y| + |y-2x| \ge |(x-2y) + (y-2x)| = |-x - y| = |-(x+y)| = |x+y|$.
Therefore, we have $|x+y| = 40$.
Now, consider the expression $(√5x - √5y)^2$. By the Binomial Theorem, this is equal to $5x^2 - 10xy + 5y^2$.
Let $A = √5x$ and $B = √5y$. Then, the expression becomes $A^2 - 2AB + B^2 = (A-B)^2$.
The minimum value of $(A-B)^2$ occurs when $A-B = 0$, or $√5x - √5y = 0$.
This gives $√5x = √5y$, or $x = y$.
Substituting $x = y$ into $|x+y| = 40$, we get $2x = 40$, or $x = 20$.
Then, $y = 20$, and the minimum value of the expression $(√5x - √5y)^2$ is $(√5(20) - √5(20))^2 = 0^2 = 0$.
Therefore, the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ is 0. The answer is: $0$

Question (hint: positive numerical answer):
"What is the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ when $x$ and $y$ range over all real numbers such that $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$?"
Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:


First, let's consider the equation $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$. We can rewrite this equation using the property $|a-b| = |b-a|$ to get $|x-2y| + |2y-x| = 40$. Then, we can use the property $|a| + |b| = |a+b|$ to simplify this to $|(x-2y) + (2y-x)| = 40$. This simplifies to $|0| = 40$, which is not possible.
So, let's try another approach.

Let's rewrite the expression $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ as $\frac{1}{2}((5x-4y)^2 + (4y-5x)^2)$. Then, we can use the property $|a-b| = |b-a|$ again to get $\frac{1}{2}(|(5x-4y) - (4y-5x)|^2) = \frac{1}{2}(|10x-8y - 8y+10x|^2) = \frac{1}{2}(|20x-16y|^2)$.

Now, let's consider the condition $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$. We can rewrite this as $|(x-2y) + (2y-x)| = 40$, which simplifies to $|0| = 40$, which is not possible. However, we can rewrite the condition as $|x-2y| = |2y-x| = 20$. This means that $|5x-4y| = |4y-5x| = 20\sqrt{2}$.

Now, we can use the property $|a+b|^2 = (a+b)^2 = a^2 + 2ab + b^2$ to get $\frac{1}{2}(|20x-16y|^2) = \frac{1}{2}((20x-16y)^2) = \frac{1}{2}(400x^2 - 640xy + 256y^2) = 200x^2 - 320xy + 128y^2$.

Now, let's substitute the condition $|5x-4y| = 20\sqrt{2}$ into the expression $200x^2 - 320xy + 128y^2$. We get $200x^2 - 320xy + 128y^2 = 200(x^2 - \frac{4}{5}xy) + 128(y^2 - \frac{4}{5}xy)$.

Now, let's complete the square for both terms. For the first term, we get $200(x^2 - \frac{4}{5}xy) = 200\left(\left(x - \frac{2}{5}y\right)^2 - \left(\frac{2}{5}y\right)^2\right) = 200\left(x - \frac{2}{5}y\right)^2 - 8y^2$.
For the second term, we get $128(y^2 - \frac{4}{5}xy) = 128\left(\left(y - \frac{2}{5}x\right)^2 - \left(\frac{2}{5}x\right)^2\right) = 128\left(y - \frac{2}{5}x\right)^2 - 8x^2$.

Adding these two results together, we get $200x^2 - 320xy + 128y^2 = 200\left(x - \frac{2}{5}y\right)^2 - 8y^2 + 128\left(y - \frac{2}{5}x\right)^2 - 8x^2 = 200\left(x - \frac{2}{5}y\right)^2 + 128\left(y - \frac{2}{5}x\right)^2 - 16(x^2 + y^2)$.

Since $|5x-4y| = 20\sqrt{2}$ and $|4y-5x| = 20\sqrt{2}$ are both positive, we can conclude that $x$ and $y$ must be non-negative. Therefore, the minimum value of the expression occurs when $x = \frac{2}{5}y$ and $y = \frac{2}{5}x$.

Substituting these values into the expression $200x^2 - 320xy + 128y^2$, we get $200x^2 - 320x^2 + 128x^2 = 0$. So, the minimum value of the expression is 0.
The value of the minimum value of the expression is 0.
The answer is: $0$

Question (hint: positive numerical answer):
"For how many positive integers $m$ does the equation \[\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}\] have $4$ distinct solutions?"
Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:


To solve the equation $||\ x-1 \ |-2|=\frac{m}{100}$ for 4 distinct solutions, let's first examine the structure of the equation. The equation involves two absolute values, which means we need to consider the cases for each absolute value separately.

For $|x-1|-2=\frac{m}{100}$, we have two sub-cases to consider:
1. If $x-1 \geq 0$, then $x-1 -2=\frac{m}{100}$, which simplifies to $x-3=\frac{m}{100}$. Solving for $x$, we get $x = \frac{m}{100} + 3$.
2. If $x-1 < 0$, then $-(x-1) -2=\frac{m}{100}$, which simplifies to $-(x-1) -2=\frac{m}{100}$, and further simplifies to $3-x=\frac{m}{100}$, which gives $x = 3 - \frac{m}{100}$.

Similarly, for $|x-1|-2=-\frac{m}{100}$, we have two sub-cases to consider:
1. If $x-1 \geq 0$, then $x-1 -2=-\frac{m}{100}$, which simplifies to $x-3=-\frac{m}{100}$. Solving for $x$, we get $x = 3 - \frac{m}{100}$.
2. If $x-1 < 0$, then $-(x-1) -2=-\frac{m}{100}$, which simplifies to $-(x-1) -2=-\frac{m}{100}$, and further simplifies to $3-x=-\frac{m}{100}$, which gives $x = 3 + \frac{m}{100}$. However, this case doesn't give a valid solution as $x$ would be greater than 3, so we discard this case.

Comparing the four solutions we obtained, we can see that two of them are the same: $x = \frac{m}{100} + 3$ and $x = 3 - \frac{m}{100}$. Therefore, we have two distinct solutions from each equation. For the equation $||\ x-1 \ |-2|=\frac{m}{100}$ to have 4 distinct solutions, we need the equation $||\ x-1 \ |-2=-\frac{m}{100}$ to have 2 additional distinct solutions. 

The equation $||\ x-1 \ |-2=-\frac{m}{100}$ only gives one additional distinct solution $x = 3 + \frac{m}{100}$. Therefore, the equation $||\ x-1 \ |-2=\frac{m}{100}$ has 4 distinct solutions when this additional solution is valid, which is when $3 + \frac{m}{100} < 3$, or $\frac{m}{100} < 0$, but this is impossible since $m$ is a positive integer. 

However, we made an error in our analysis. Notice that we can ignore the second case for $||\ x-1 \ |-2=\frac{m}{100}$, because we only want the number of positive integers $m$ such that the equation has 4 distinct solutions, not all possible solutions. The second case only gives a solution $x = 3 + \frac{m}{100}$, which is always greater than 3 and hence not valid for our original equation.

So we only need to consider the first case for $||\ x-1 \ |-2=\frac{m}{100}$. For this case to have 4 distinct solutions, the additional solution $x = 3 + \frac{m}{100}$ must be valid. This is valid if $3 + \frac{m}{100} < 3$, or $\frac{m}{100} < 0$, but this is impossible since $m$ is a positive integer. Therefore, we must have $\frac{m}{100} + 3 < 1$, or $\frac{m}{100} < -2$, which is also impossible. 

This suggests we must have made a mistake in our analysis. Upon re-examining our work, we realize that the case $x-1 < 0$ for $||\ x-1 \ |-2=\frac{m}{100}$ should not be discarded. This case gives the valid additional solution $x = 3 + \frac{m}{100}$. Therefore, for the equation $||\ x-1 \ |-2=\frac{m}{100}$ to have 4 distinct solutions, the equation $||\ x-1 \ |-2=-\frac{m}{100}$ must also have a valid solution. This happens when $3 - \frac{m}{100} < 1$, or $\frac{m}{100} > 2$, which gives $m > 200$. The positive integers $m$ satisfying this inequality are $m = 201, 202, 203, \ldots$. The number of such integers is infinite. However, we need to find the number of positive integers $m$ such that the equation has exactly 4 distinct solutions. 

From our previous analysis, we found that the equation $||\ x-1 \ |-2=\frac{m}{100}$ has 4 distinct solutions when the additional solution $x = 3 + \frac{m}{100}$ is valid, which is when $\frac{m}{100} < -2$. But this inequality doesn't give a valid solution for $m$ being a positive integer. Therefore, the equation $||\ x-1 \ |-2=\frac{m}{100}$ has 4 distinct solutions when the equation $||\ x-1 \ |-2=-\frac{m}{100}$ has a valid solution, which is when $\frac{m}{100} > 2$, or $m > 200$. The smallest positive integer $m$ satisfying this inequality is $m = 201$. The largest positive integer $m$ satisfying this inequality is not given, but as the problem only asks for the number of positive integers $m$ such that the equation has exactly 4 distinct solutions, we only need to know that such integers exist, and we found the smallest one to be $m = 201$. 

Therefore, the only positive integer $m$ for which the equation $||\ x-1 \ |-2=\frac{m}{100}$ has exactly 4 distinct solutions is $m = 201$. Hence, the number of positive integers $m$ for which the equation has exactly 4 distinct solutions is 1. The answer is: 1

Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:


The equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has 4 distinct solutions.
We know that $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert$ is a "V" shape with a maximum of 2 at $x=1$, so $\frac{m}{100}$ must be equal to 2.
Therefore, we have $\frac{m}{100}=2$, which gives $m=200$.
The value of $m$ that makes the equation have 4 distinct solutions is 200.
The answer is: $1$

Question (hint: positive numerical answer):
"For how many positive integers $m$ does the equation \[\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}\] have $4$ distinct solutions?"
Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:


The equation $||x-1|-2|=\frac{m}{100}$ has 4 distinct solutions if and only if $\frac{m}{100}$ is equal to 2.
So we have $||x-1|-2|=2$.
We can solve this equation in two steps:
Step 1: Solve $|x-1|-2=2$.
Adding 2 to both sides gives $|x-1|=4$.
This breaks down to two cases: $x-1=4$ or $x-1=-4$.
Solving these two equations gives $x=5$ or $x=-3$.
Step 2: Solve $|x-1|-2=-2$.
Adding 2 to both sides gives $|x-1|=0$.
This simplifies to $x-1=0$, and solving for $x$ gives $x=1$.
So the 4 distinct solutions are $x=-3$, $x=1$, $x=5$.
This means that $\frac{m}{100}=2$, so $m=200$.
The number of positive integers $m$ for which the equation has 4 distinct solutions is 1.
Therefore, the answer is $\boxed{1}$. The answer is: $1$.

Question (hint: positive numerical answer):
"For how many positive integers $m$ does the equation \[\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}\] have $4$ distinct solutions?"
Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:


The equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has $4$ distinct solutions. 
The absolute value function $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert$ will be equal to $\frac{m}{100}$ at four different points. 
To find the number of values of $m$ for which this is true, we need to consider the possible values of $\frac{m}{100}$.
The expression $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert$ takes on a value between $0$ and $3$, so $\frac{m}{100}$ must also be between $0$ and $3$. 
Therefore, $m$ must be between $0$ and $300$.
We can test each integer value of $m$ from $1$ to $300$ to see if the equation has $4$ distinct solutions.
We find that the only values of $m$ that work are $100$, $200$, and $300$. 
Therefore, there are $3$ positive integers $m$ for which the equation has $4$ distinct solutions.
The value of the unknown variable is $3$. The answer is: $3$

The equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has 4 distinct solutions.
To find the possible values of $m$, we need to consider the number of steps required to reach a value of $\frac{m}{100}$ from the initial absolute value of $2$.
Let's start from the innermost absolute value:
If $\vert x-1 \vert - 2 = \frac{m}{100}$, then $\vert x-1 \vert = 2 + \frac{m}{100}$.
This can be split into two cases:
Case 1: $x-1 = 2 + \frac{m}{100}$ or $x-1 = - (2 + \frac{m}{100})$.
Case 2: $x-1 = 2 - \frac{m}{100}$ or $x-1 = - (2 - \frac{m}{100})$.
Solving each of these cases will give us the values of $x$ that satisfy the original equation.
For Case 1, we have:
$x = 3 + \frac{m}{100}$ or $x = -1 - \frac{m}{100}$.
For Case 2, we have:
$x = 3 - \frac{m}{100}$ or $x = -1 + \frac{m}{100}$.
To ensure that we have 4 distinct solutions, we need to find the values of $m$ such that:
$3 + \frac{m}{100} \neq -1 - \frac{m}{100}$,
$3 + \frac{m}{100} \neq 3 - \frac{m}{100}$,
$3 + \frac{m}{100} \neq -1 + \frac{m}{100}$,
$-1 - \frac{m}{100} \neq 3 - \frac{m}{100}$,
$-1 - \frac{m}{100} \neq -1 + \frac{m}{100}$.
Simplifying these equations, we get:
$m \neq -500$,
$m \neq 0$,
$m \neq 200$,
$m \neq 400$,
$m \neq -200$.
The only values of $m$ that satisfy these conditions are $m = 100, 300$, and $500$.
Therefore, there are 3 possible positive integer values for $m$. The value of $m$ that satisfies this equation is $100$. The answer is: $1$

Question (hint: positive numerical answer):
"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"
Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:


The expression $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2)$ equals to zero if and only if both factors equal zero.
The first factor equals zero if $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ or $\vert x - y \vert = 10$.
The second factor equals zero if $\vert x \vert = 8$ or $\vert y \vert = 8$.
These conditions describe a square with side length 16.
The area of this square is $16^2 = 256$. The answer is: $256$

Question (hint: positive numerical answer):
"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"
Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:


The product of two numbers is zero if and only if at least one of the numbers is zero. So, the given equation implies that either $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$, $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$, $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$, or $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$.

For $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$, we have $\vert x + y \vert = 10$, which means $x + y = \pm 10$. This gives us two lines $x + y = 10$ and $x + y = -10$.

For $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$, we have $\vert x - y \vert = 10$, which means $x - y = \pm 10$. This gives us two more lines $x - y = 10$ and $x - y = -10$.

For $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$, we have $\vert x \vert = 8$, which means $x = \pm 8$. This gives us two vertical lines $x = 8$ and $x = -8$.

For $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$, we have $\vert y \vert = 8$, which means $y = \pm 8$. This gives us two horizontal lines $y = 8$ and $y = -8$.

The four lines $x + y = 10$, $x + y = -10$, $x - y = 10$, $x - y = -10$, $x = 8$, $x = -8$, $y = 8$, and $y = -8$ enclose a rectangle with vertices at $(8, 2)$, $(-8, 2)$, $(-8, -2)$, and $(8, -2)$. The side lengths of this rectangle are 16 and 4, so its area is $16 \times 4 = 64$. The answer is: $64$.

Question (hint: positive numerical answer):
"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"
Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:


The equation $AB=0$ implies that $A=0$ or $B=0$. Therefore, either $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$, $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$, $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$, or $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$.
If $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$, then $\vert x + y \vert = 10$, which means $x + y = 10$ or $x + y = -10$.
If $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$, then $\vert x - y \vert = 10$, which means $x - y = 10$ or $x - y = -10$.
If $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$, then $\vert x \vert = 8$, which means $x = 8$ or $x = -8$.
If $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$, then $\vert y \vert = 8$, which means $y = 8$ or $y = -8$.
The points that satisfy these conditions are: $(8,8)$, $(8,-8)$, $(-8,8)$, $(-8,-8)$, $(10,0)$, $(0,10)$, $(-10,0)$, and $(0,-10)$.
The plot of these points forms a square with side length 16, so the area of the square is $16^2 = 256$. The answer is: $256$

Question (hint: positive numerical answer):
"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"
Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:



In order for the left hand side of the equation to be 0, one of the two factors must be zero. So, either $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$. 

If $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$, then $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$, which means that $x + y = \pm 10$ and $x - y = \pm 10$. These equations simplify to $x = y$ or $x = -y$, so the points $(x, y)$ that satisfy these equations form a square with side length $20$ and area $400$.

If $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$, then $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$, which means that $x = \pm 8$ and $y = \pm 8$, so the points $(x, y)$ that satisfy these equations form a square with side length $16$ and area $256$.

Therefore, the convex polygon enclosed by the points that satisfy the given equation is the union of these two squares, and its area is the sum of their areas, $400 + 256 = 656$. The answer is: $\boxed{656}$

Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:


The expression equals zero if either of the factors equals zero. The first factor equals zero if either $|x+y| - 10 = 0$ or $|x-y| - 10 = 0$. These conditions simplify to $|x+y| = 10$ and $|x-y| = 10$. The second factor equals zero if either $|x|-8=0$ or $|y|-8=0$. These conditions simplify to $|x|=8$ and $|y|=8$.
The points satisfying $|x+y| = 10$ and $|x-y| = 10$ are the points in a square with side length $10$ centered at the origin. The points satisfying $|x|=8$ and $|y|=8$ are the points in a square with side length $16$ centered at the origin. The intersection of these two squares is the convex polygon we are looking for. The side length of this polygon is $10$, and the area is the square of the side length, so the area is $10^2 = 100$. The answer is: $100$

Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:



A product of two or more factors is equal to zero if and only if at least one of the factors is zero. Therefore, the equation given in the problem can be simplified as follows:
\[((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2) = 0\]
or
\[((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0.\]
The first equation holds if and only if $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. These two equations imply that $x$ and $y$ are both 0 or $x = y$ and $\vert x \vert = 10$, or $x = -y$ and $\vert x \vert = 10$. In other words, the points $(x, y)$ are on the lines $x + y = \pm 10$, $x - y = \pm 10$, $x = \pm 10$, and $y = \pm 10$. These lines form a square with side length 20. Therefore, the area of the convex polygon is $20^2 = 400$. The answer is: $400$

Question (hint: positive numerical answer):
"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"
Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:


To solve this problem, we need to understand the conditions under which the equation $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ holds true. The product of two factors equals zero if and only if at least one of the factors is zero. Therefore, we have two cases:

Case 1: $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$
This implies that $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$.
From these equations, we can conclude that $x + y = \pm 10$ and $x - y = \pm 10$. Solving these equations, we get four lines: $x + y = 10$, $x + y = -10$, $x - y = 10$, and $x - y = -10$.

Case 2: $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$
This implies that $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$. So we get two lines: $x = 8$, $x = -8$, $y = 8$, and $y = -8$.

Now we need to find the intersection points of these lines. The intersection points are $(8, 8)$, $(8, -8)$, $(-8, 8)$, and $(-8, -8)$. These points form a square with side length $16$. The area of this square is $16^2 = 256$. So the area of the convex polygon is $256$. The answer is: $\boxed{256}$

"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"
Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:


The expression $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2)$ is equal to zero if either of the two factors is equal to zero. This means that either:
1. $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$, or
2. $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$.

From the first equation, we have $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. This implies that $x + y = \pm 10$ and $x - y = \pm 10$. Solving these equations gives us the points $(5, 5)$, $(-5, 5)$, $(5, -5)$, and $(-5, -5)$.

From the second equation, we have $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$. This implies that $x = \pm 8$ and $y = \pm 8$. Solving these equations gives us the points $(8, 8)$, $(8, -8)$, $(-8, 8)$, and $(-8, -8)$.

These eight points form a square with side length $10$, so the area of the square is $10^2 = 100$. The answer is: $100$

Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:


The expression $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2)$ is equal to 0 if and only if either of the two factors is equal to 0. 
For the first factor to be 0, either $\vert x + y \vert - 10 = 0$ or $\vert x - y \vert - 10 = 0$, which means $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ or $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. These are the equations of two lines in the coordinate plane.
For the second factor to be 0, either $\vert x \vert - 8 = 0$ or $\vert y \vert - 8 = 0$, which means $\vert x \vert = 8$ or $\vert y \vert = 8$. These are the equations of four lines in the coordinate plane.
The intersection of these lines forms a square with side length 10, since the square with side length 8 encloses the square with side length 10. The area of this square is $10^2 = 100$.
Therefore, the area of the convex polygon is 100. The answer is: $100$

"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"
Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:


The equation given in the problem is equal to zero, which means that one of the factors must be zero. This gives us two separate conditions:
1. $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2) = 0$
2. $((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$
For the first condition to be true, both $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2$ and $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2$ must be zero. This implies that $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. The only way this can happen is if $x = \pm 10$ and $y = \pm 10$.
For the second condition to be true, both $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2$ and $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2$ must be zero. This implies that $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$. The only way this can happen is if $x = \pm 8$ and $y = \pm 8$.
Therefore, the points that satisfy the equation are $(10,10)$, $(10,-10)$, $(-10,10)$, $(-10,-10)$, $(8,8)$, $(8,-8)$, $(-8,8)$, and $(-8,-8)$.
These points form a square with side length $20$, so the area of the square is $20^2 = 400$. The answer is: $400$

Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:


The expression $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2$ is zero if and only if $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$.
This means that $x + y = \pm 10$ and $x - y = \pm 10$.
Solving these equations, we get four lines: $x + y = 10$, $x + y = -10$, $x - y = 10$, and $x - y = -10$.
Similarly, $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ if and only if $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$.
This means that $x = \pm 8$ and $y = \pm 8$.
Solving these equations, we get four lines: $x = 8$, $x = -8$, $y = 8$, and $y = -8$.
The intersection of these lines forms a square with side length 10.
The area of this square is $10^2 = 100$.
So the area of the convex polygon is 100. The answer is: $100$

Question (hint: positive numerical answer):
"A function $f: \mathbb N \to \mathbb N$ satisfies the following two conditions for all positive integers $n$:$f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$ and $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$. Calculate $f(100)$."
Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:



First, we need to find the value of $f(1)$ using the second equation. We set $n=1$ in the equation $f(2n) = 2f(n) + 1$ to get $f(2) = 2f(1) + 1$.

Then, since $f(f(f(1))) = 8(1) - 7 = -1$, and we know $f(f(f(1))) = f(f(2))$ because when $n=1$, $2n = 2$, we can set $n=2$ in the equation $f(f(f(n))) = 8n - 7$ to get $f(f(2)) = 8(2) - 7 = 9$.

So, we have $f(2) = 9$. Now, substitute $f(2) = 9$ into the equation $f(2n) = 2f(n) + 1$ to get $f(4) = 2f(2) + 1 = 2(9) + 1 = 19$.

Then, we have $f(f(f(2))) = 8(2) - 7 = 9$, and since $f(f(f(2))) = f(f(4))$, we can set $n=4$ in the equation $f(f(f(n))) = 8n - 7$ to get $f(f(4)) = 8(4) - 7 = 25$. So, we have $f(4) = 25$.

Now, substitute $f(4) = 25$ into the equation $f(2n) = 2f(n) + 1$ to get $f(8) = 2f(4) + 1 = 2(25) + 1 = 51$.

Then, we have $f(f(f(4))) = 8(4) - 7 = 25$, and since $f(f(f(4))) = f(f(8))$, we can set $n=8$ in the equation $f(f(f(n))) = 8n - 7$ to get $f(f(8)) = 8(8) - 7 = 59$. So, we have $f(8) = 59$.

Now, we can see a pattern that $f(2^k) = 3 + 2^k(2^k - 1)$. Let's check this for $k=1, 2, 3, 4$:

- For $k=1$, $f(2) = 3 + 2(2 - 1) = 3 + 2 = 5$, but $f(2) = 9$. So, the pattern doesn't hold for $k=1$.
- For $k=2$, $f(4) = 3 + 4(4 - 1) = 3 + 12 = 15$, but $f(4) = 25$. So, the pattern doesn't hold for $k=2$.
- For $k=3$, $f(8) = 3 + 8(8 - 1) = 3 + 56 = 59$, and $f(8) = 59$. So, the pattern holds for $k=3$.

Since the pattern holds for $k=3$, we can assume it holds for all positive integers $k$. Now, let's find $f(100)$. Since $100 = 2^2 \cdot 5^2$, we can use the pattern $f(2^k) = 3 + 2^k(2^k - 1)$ to find $f(100)$:

$$f(100) = f(2^2 \cdot 5^2) = f((2^2)(5^2)) = f(4 \cdot 25) = f(f(f(25))).$$

Since $f(25) = 3 + 25(25 - 1) = 3 + 600 = 603$, we can substitute $n=25$ into the equation $f(f(f(n))) = 8n - 7$ to get $f(f(f(25))) = 8(25) - 7 = 200$. So, we have $f(100) = 200$. The answer is: $\boxed{200}$

Question (hint: positive numerical answer):
"A function $f: \mathbb N \to \mathbb N$ satisfies the following two conditions for all positive integers $n$:$f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$ and $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$. Calculate $f(100)$."
Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:



To find the value of $f(100)$, we first need to find a pattern in the function $f$.

From the second equation, we know that $f(2n) = 2f(n) + 1$. Let's try to find the value of $f(1)$ using this equation. We have $f(2) = 2f(1) + 1$. But from the first equation, we know that $f(f(f(1))) = 8(1) - 7 = -1$. And since $f$ maps from $\mathbb{N}$ to $\mathbb{N}$, $f(1)$ must be a positive integer. Therefore, we must have $f(f(f(1))) = 1$, so $f(1) = 1$.

Now, let's find $f(2)$ using the second equation. We have $f(4) = 2f(2) + 1$. But from the first equation, we know that $f(f(f(2))) = 8(2) - 7 = 9$. And since $f(2)$ is also a positive integer, we must have $f(f(f(2))) = 9$, so $f(2) = 3$.

Now, let's find $f(3)$ using the second equation. We have $f(6) = 2f(3) + 1$. But from the first equation, we know that $f(f(f(3))) = 8(3) - 7 = 19$. Since $f(3)$ is also a positive integer, we must have $f(f(f(3))) = 19$, so $f(3) = 5$.

Now, we can continue to find the values of $f(4)$, $f(5)$, and so on, using the second equation. After finding the values of $f(1)$, $f(2)$, $f(3)$, and so on, we can observe a pattern that $f(n) = 2n - 1$ for all positive integers $n$.

Now, we can find the value of $f(100)$ using this pattern. We have $f(100) = 2(100) - 1 = 199$.

So, the value of $f(100)$ is $199$. The answer is: $199$

Question (hint: positive numerical answer):
"A function $f: \mathbb N \to \mathbb N$ satisfies the following two conditions for all positive integers $n$:$f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$ and $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$. Calculate $f(100)$."
Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:



First, let's apply the second equation to the first equation: $f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$ becomes $f(f(2f(n)+1))=8n-7$.
Now, let's substitute $n = f(n)$ into the second equation: $f(2f(n)+1)=2f(f(n))+1$.
Substituting this into the equation we got from the first equation gives us $f(2f(f(n))+1)=8f(n)-7$.
Now, let's substitute $n = f(n)$ into this equation again: $f(2f(f(f(n)))+1)=8f(f(n))-7$.
Since $f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$, this equation simplifies to $f(2(8n-7)+1)=8f(f(n))-7$.
Expanding the left side gives $f(16n-14+1)=8f(f(n))-7$, or $f(16n-13)=8f(f(n))-7$.
Now, let's set $n = 2$: $f(16*2-13)=8f(f(2))-7$ simplifies to $f(13)=8f(f(2))-7$.
Similarly, setting $n = 1$ gives $f(16*1-13)=8f(f(1))-7$, or $f(3)=8f(f(1))-7$.
From the second equation, we have $f(2)=2f(1)+1$.
Substituting this into the equation $f(3)=8f(f(1))-7$, we get $f(3)=8f(2f(1)+1)-7$.
Simplifying this gives $f(3)=8(2f(1)+1)-7$, or $f(3)=16f(1)+8-7$, or $f(3)=16f(1)+1$.
We already know that $f(13)=8f(f(2))-7$, and substituting $f(2)=2f(1)+1$ gives $f(13)=8f(2f(1)+1)-7$.
Simplifying this gives $f(13)=8(2f(1)+1)-7$, or $f(13)=16f(1)+8-7$, or $f(13)=16f(1)+1$.
Since $f(3)=16f(1)+1$, we have $f(13)=f(3)$.
Since $f(13)$ can only have one value, we can conclude that $f(1)=1$.
Now we can use the second equation to find the values of $f(2)$, $f(3)$, $f(4)$, etc.
Continuing this process, we find that $f(2)=3$, $f(3)=7$, $f(4)=15$, and so on.
By examining the pattern, we find that $f(n)=2^n-1$ for all positive integers $n$.
To find $f(100)$, we simply substitute $n = 100$ into the equation: $f(100)=2^{100}-1$.
Therefore, the value of $f(100)$ is $2^{100}-1$.
The answer is: $2^{100}-1$

"A function $f: \mathbb N \to \mathbb N$ satisfies the following two conditions for all positive integers $n$:$f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$ and $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$. Calculate $f(100)$."
Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:



To find $f(100)$, we can use the second equation $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$. We can apply this equation repeatedly to find $f(100)$ in terms of $f(50)$, $f(25)$, and so on.

First, let's find $f(50)$:
$$f(50) = 2f(25)+1.$$
Then, we can apply the second equation again to find $f(25)$:
$$f(25) = 2f(12.5)+1.$$
But $12.5$ is not a positive integer, so we cannot use the second equation directly with it. We need to find another way to express $f(25)$ in terms of a positive integer value.

Notice that $25 = 2*12.5$, so we can substitute $n = 12.5$ into the first equation $f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$:
$$f(f(f(12.5)))=8*12.5-7 = 100.$$
But $f(f(f(12.5)))$ is just $f(25)$, so we have:
$$f(25) = 100.$$
Now we can substitute this into the equation for $f(50)$:
$$f(50) = 2f(25)+1 = 2*100+1 = 201.$$
Finally, we can substitute $f(50)$ into the equation for $f(100)$:
$$f(100) = 2f(50)+1 = 2*201+1 = 403.$$
So, $f(100) = 403$. The answer is: $403$

"A function $f: \mathbb N \to \mathbb N$ satisfies the following two conditions for all positive integers $n$:$f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$ and $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$. Calculate $f(100)$."
Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:


We are given that $f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$ and $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$.

Let's start by plugging in $n=1$ into the equation $f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$, we get $f(f(f(1)))=8(1)-7=1$. Since $f(1)$ is a positive integer, the only possibility is $f(1)=1$.

Now, let's use $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$ with $n=1$, we get $f(2)=2f(1)+1=2(1)+1=3$.

Then, let's use $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$ with $n=2$, we get $f(4)=2f(2)+1=2(3)+1=7$.

Again, let's use $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$ with $n=4$, we get $f(8)=2f(4)+1=2(7)+1=15$.

Continuing this pattern, we find that $f(16)=31$, $f(32)=63$, and $f(64)=127$.

Now, we notice a pattern. We can see that $f(2^k)=2^k-1$ for $k=1,2,3,4$. So, we conjecture that $f(2^k)=2^k-1$ for all positive integers $k$.

To prove this, we will use induction.

Base case: For $k=1$, we have $f(2^1)=f(2)=3=2^1-1$. So, the base case holds.

Inductive step: Suppose that $f(2^k)=2^k-1$ for some positive integer $k$. Then,
\[f(2^{k+1})=f(2 \cdot 2^k)=2f(2^k)+1=2(2^k-1)+1=2^{k+1}-1.\]
So, the formula holds for $k+1$.

By induction, we have proven that $f(2^k)=2^k-1$ for all positive integers $k$.

Now, we can find $f(100)$. Since $100=2^2 \cdot 5^2$, we have
\[f(100)=f(2^2 \cdot 5^2)=f(2^2 \cdot 5^2)=f((2^2 \cdot 5^2))=f(100).\]
Using the formula $f(2^k)=2^k-1$, we get
\[f(100)=2^2-1=4-1=3.\]
So, $f(100)=3$. The answer is: $\boxed{3}$

Question (hint: positive numerical answer):
"A function $f: \mathbb N \to \mathbb N$ satisfies the following two conditions for all positive integers $n$:$f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$ and $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$. Calculate $f(100)$."
Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:



We start by calculating $f(1)$ using the second equation. We have $f(2) = 2f(1) + 1$. Then, applying the function $f$ again, we get $f(f(2)) = f(2f(1) + 1)$. Using the first equation, this becomes $f(f(2)) = 8(f(1)) - 7$. But we also know that $f(f(2)) = f(2f(1) + 1) = 2f(f(1)) + 1$. So we have the equation $2f(f(1)) + 1 = 8f(1) - 7$. Solving this equation gives us $f(1) = 3$.

Now, we can use the second equation to find $f(2) = 2f(1) + 1 = 2(3) + 1 = 7$. Continuing this way, we find $f(3) = f\left(\frac{f(2)+1}{2}\right) = f\left(\frac{7+1}{2}\right) = f(4) = 2f(2)+1 = 2(7)+1 = 15$.

We can continue this process to find $f(4) = 15$, $f(5) = 29$, $f(6) = 53$, $f(7) = 89$, and so on. We notice a pattern: $f(n) = 3 + 4(n - 1)$. To confirm this, we can prove it by induction. It is true for $n = 1$, and if $f(n) = 3 + 4(n - 1)$, then $f(f(n)) = f(3 + 4(n - 1)) = 3 + 4(3 + 4(n - 1) - 1) = 8n - 7$, which verifies the first equation.

Finally, we can calculate $f(100) = 3 + 4(100 - 1) = 3 + 4(99) = 3 + 396 = 400 - 1 = 399$. So $f(100) = 399$. The answer is: $399$

Question (hint: positive numerical answer):
"A function $f: \mathbb N \to \mathbb N$ satisfies the following two conditions for all positive integers $n$:$f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$ and $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$. Calculate $f(100)$."
Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:



Let's start by calculating $f(100)$ using the second equation given in the problem. The equation is $f(2n) = 2f(n) + 1$. We can substitute $n = 50$ into this equation to get:

$$f(2 \cdot 50) = 2f(50) + 1.$$

This simplifies to:

$$f(100) = 2f(50) + 1. \tag{1}$$

Now, let's substitute $n = 25$ into the second equation to get:

$$f(2 \cdot 25) = 2f(25) + 1.$$

This simplifies to:

$$f(50) = 2f(25) + 1. \tag{2}$$

Now, let's substitute $n = 12$ into the second equation to get:

$$f(2 \cdot 12) = 2f(12) + 1.$$

This simplifies to:

$$f(24) = 2f(12) + 1. \tag{3}$$

Finally, let's substitute $n = 6$ into the second equation to get:

$$f(2 \cdot 6) = 2f(6) + 1.$$

This simplifies to:

$$f(12) = 2f(6) + 1. \tag{4}$$

And let's substitute $n = 3$ into the first equation given in the problem:

$$f(f(f(3))) = 8 \cdot 3 - 7 = 19.$$

Since $f(f(f(3))) = 19$, we can rewrite this as:

$$f(f(3)) = f^{-1}(19).$$

And since $f(f(3)) = 6$ (from equation 3), we get:

$$f(3) = f^{-1}(19).$$

Now, let's substitute $n = 3$ into the second equation:

$$f(2 \cdot 3) = 2f(3) + 1.$$

This simplifies to:

$$f(6) = 2f(3) + 1.$$

But we know that $f(3) = f^{-1}(19)$, so we can substitute this into the equation to get:

$$f(6) = 2f^{-1}(19) + 1.$$

And finally, let's substitute $n = 6$ into the second equation:

$$f(2 \cdot 6) = 2f(6) + 1.$$

This simplifies to:

$$f(12) = 2f(6) + 1.$$

But we know that $f(6) = 2f^{-1}(19) + 1$, so we can substitute this into the equation to get:

$$f(12) = 2(2f^{-1}(19) + 1) + 1 = 4f^{-1}(19) + 3.$$

Now, we can substitute this into equation 4:

$$4f^{-1}(19) + 3 = f(12).$$

And substitute $f(12)$ into equation 3:

$$f(24) = 2(4f^{-1}(19) + 3) + 1 = 8f^{-1}(19) + 7.$$

And substitute $f(24)$ into equation 2:

$$f(50) = 2(8f^{-1}(19) + 7) + 1 = 16f^{-1}(19) + 15.$$

And finally, substitute $f(50)$ into equation 1:

$$f(100) = 2(16f^{-1}(19) + 15) + 1 = 32f^{-1}(19) + 31.$$

So, we have found that $f(100) = 32f^{-1}(19) + 31$. However, we don't have a direct way to calculate $f^{-1}(19)$. But we know that $f(f(3)) = 19$, which means $f^{-1}(19) = 3$. Substitute $f^{-1}(19) = 3$ into the equation we found for $f(100)$:

$$f(100) = 32 \cdot 3 + 31 = 96 + 31 = 127.$$

Therefore, the value of $f(100)$ is 127. The answer is: $127$

Question (hint: positive numerical answer):
"A function $f: \mathbb N \to \mathbb N$ satisfies the following two conditions for all positive integers $n$:$f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$ and $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$. Calculate $f(100)$."
Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:



To find $f(100)$, we first need to find the value of $f(n)$ for some base cases.

Using the second condition, we can find $f(1)$:
\[f(2 \cdot 1) = 2f(1) + 1 \implies f(2) = 2f(1) + 1.\]
And from the first condition, we have:
\[f(f(f(1))) = 8 \cdot 1 - 7 = -1.\]
Let's denote $f(1)$ as $a$. Then we have:
\[f(f(a)) = f(a) = -1.\]
Again from the first condition, we have:
\[f(f(f(2))) = 8 \cdot 2 - 7 = 9.\]
Denoting $f(2)$ as $b$, we get:
\[f(f(b)) = 9 \implies f(b) = 9.\]
But we know that $f(2) = b = 2a + 1$, and $f(b) = 9$, so we have:
\[f(2a + 1) = 9.\]
Using the second condition, we get:
\[f(4a + 2) = 2f(2a + 1) + 1 = 2 \cdot 9 + 1 = 19.\]
And from the first condition, we have:
\[f(f(f(4a + 2))) = 8(4a + 2) - 7 = 32a + 15.\]
But we know that $f(4a + 2) = 19$, so we have:
\[f(19) = 32a + 15.\]
Now we can use trial and error to find the value of $a$.
We can try $a = 1$, then $f(1) = 1$, $f(2) = 3$, $f(3) = 1$, $f(4) = 5$, and so on.
We find that when $a = 1$, we get $f(1) = 1$, $f(2) = 3$, $f(3) = 1$, $f(4) = 5$, and so on, until $f(19) = 32a + 15 = 47$.
Thus, the function $f(n)$ defined as:
\[f(n) = \begin{cases} 1 & \text{if } n = 1, \\ 2n - 1 & \text{if } n \text{ is even}, \\ 1 & \text{if } n \text{ is odd and } n > 1. \end{cases}\]
satisfies both conditions.
Now we can calculate $f(100)$.
Since $100$ is even, we have $f(100) = 2 \cdot 100 - 1 = 199$.
So the value of $f(100)$ is $199$. The answer is: $199$

Question (hint: positive numerical answer):
"A function $f: \mathbb N \to \mathbb N$ satisfies the following two conditions for all positive integers $n$:$f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$ and $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$. Calculate $f(100)$."
Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:


We start by plugging in $n=1$ into the second equation to get $f(2)=2f(1)+1$.
Then, we plug in $n=f(1)$ into the first equation to get $f(f(f(f(1)))) = 8f(1) - 7$.
Since $f(f(f(f(1)))) = f(f(f(2))) = f(f(2f(1)+1))$, we can use the second equation to simplify this to $f(f(2f(1)+1)) = f(2(2f(1)+1)+1) = f(4f(1)+3)$.
Using the first equation again, we have $f(4f(1)+3) = 8(4f(1)+3) - 7 = 32f(1)+24-7 = 32f(1)+17$.
But we know that $f(f(f(f(1)))) = 8f(1) - 7$, so we can set these two equal to each other to get $32f(1)+17 = 8f(1) - 7$.
Simplifying this gives $24f(1) = -24$, so $f(1) = -1$.
But the function $f$ is meant to map from $\mathbb N$ to $\mathbb N$, and we got a negative value, so this solution doesn't make sense in the context of the problem.

Let's try another approach.

We know that $f(2n) = 2f(n) + 1$, and we want to find $f(100)$.
Let's find $f(50)$ first.
Using the second equation with $n=25$, we have $f(50) = 2f(25) + 1$.
Similarly, $f(25) = 2f(12.5)$, but $12.5$ is not an integer, so this equation doesn't help us directly.
But we can still use the equation $f(2n) = 2f(n) + 1$ by noticing that $50 = 2 \cdot 25$, so we have $f(50) = 2f(25) + 1$.
Continuing this pattern, we can find $f(100)$ in terms of $f(50)$.
$f(100) = 2f(50) + 1$.
Now we need to find $f(50)$ in terms of $f(25)$.
$f(50) = 2f(25) + 1$.
And we need to find $f(25)$ in terms of $f(12.5)$.
But again, $12.5$ is not an integer, so we need to find another way.

Let's try using the first equation.
We know that $f(f(f(n))) = 8n - 7$, so for $n=50$, we have $f(f(f(50))) = 8 \cdot 50 - 7 = 393$.
And $f(f(f(50))) = f(f(2f(25)+1)) = f(f(50))$.
Now we have $f(f(50)) = 393$.
And we can find $f(50)$ by using the second equation.
$f(50) = 2f(25) + 1$.
So we can substitute this into the equation $f(f(50)) = 393$.
$f(f(50)) = f(2f(25)+1) = 393$.
This becomes $f(2(2f(25)+1)+1) = 393$.
Simplifying gives $f(4f(25)+3) = 393$.
And we know that $f(f(f(25))) = 8 \cdot 25 - 7 = 193$.
So we have $f(4f(25)+3) = 393$ and $f(f(f(25))) = 193$.
By setting these equal to each other, we get $393 = 193 \cdot 2 + 1$.
This simplifies to $393 = 387$, which is a contradiction.

This suggests that we may have made an error in our calculations, so let's go back and check our work.
We found that $f(100) = 2f(50) + 1$, $f(50) = 2f(25) + 1$, and $f(25) = 2f(12.5)$.
But as mentioned earlier, $12.5$ is not an integer, so we can't continue this approach.

Let's try another approach.

Since we are given two equations for the function $f$, we can use them to set up a system of equations.
From the second equation, we have $f(2n) = 2f(n) + 1$.
Plugging in $n=1$, we get $f(2) = 2f(1) + 1$.
And plugging in $n=2$, we get $f(4) = 2f(2) + 1$.
Now we can substitute the expression for $f(2)$ from the previous equation into this equation to get $f(4) = 2(2f(1)+1) + 1 = 4f(1) + 3$.
Using the first equation $f(f(f(n))) = 8n - 7$, we can plug in $n=4$ to get $f(f(f(4))) = 8 \cdot 4 - 7 = 24$.
And $f(f(f(4))) = f(f(4f(1)+3)) = f(4f(1)+3)$.
So we have $f(4f(1)+3) = 24$.
Now we can substitute the expression for $f(4)$ into this equation to get $f(4f(1)+3) = f(4f(1)+3) = 24$.
Simplifying gives $4f(1)+3 = 24$.
Solving for $f(1)$, we get $f(1) = \frac{21}{4}$, which is not an integer, so this approach also doesn't work.

Let's try a different approach.

Since $f$ is a function from $\mathbb N$ to $\mathbb N$, it must be the case that $f(1)$ is a positive integer.
From the second equation, we have $f(2) = 2f(1) + 1$.
Plugging in $n=1$, we get $f(2) = 2f(1) +

Question (hint: positive numerical answer):
"A function $f: \mathbb N \to \mathbb N$ satisfies the following two conditions for all positive integers $n$:$f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$ and $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$. Calculate $f(100)$."
Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:



To solve this problem, we will use the second equation first. We know that $f(2n) = 2f(n) + 1$. So, if we substitute $n = 50$, we get $f(100) = 2f(50) + 1$. We don't know the value of $f(50)$ yet, but we can use the first equation to find it.

We know that $f(f(f(n))) = 8n - 7$. If we substitute $n = 50$, we get $f(f(f(50))) = 8*50 - 7 = 393$. We also know that $f(f(f(50))) = 50$ (since $n$ is 50), so we have $f(f(50)) = 50$.

Now, let's use the second equation again to find $f(50)$. We have $f(100) = 2f(50) + 1$. But we know $f(100) = 393$ from the first equation and $f(f(50)) = 50$, so $f(50) = \frac{393 - 1}{2} = 196$.

Finally, substitute $f(50) = 196$ into the equation $f(100) = 2f(50) + 1$ to find $f(100)$:

$$f(100) = 2*196 + 1 = 393.$$

So, the value of $f(100)$ is $393$.
The answer is: $\boxed{393}$.

Question (hint: positive numerical answer):
"A function $f: \mathbb N \to \mathbb N$ satisfies the following two conditions for all positive integers $n$:$f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$ and $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$. Calculate $f(100)$."
Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:



We know that $f(f(f(100)))=8(100)-7=793$. Since we know the value of $f(f(f(100)))$, we can find $f(f(100))$ by finding the number $n$ such that $f(n)=793$.
From the second condition, we know that $f(2(50))=2f(50)+1$, or $f(100)=2f(50)+1$. Since $f(f(f(100)))=793$, we can substitute $f(100)$ into the first condition to get $f(f(793))=793$.
Again using the second condition, we know that $f(2(396.5))=2f(396.5)+1$, or $f(793)=2f(396.5)+1$. Substituting this into the previous equation, we have $f(2f(396.5)+1)=793$.
Let's set $f(396.5)=x$. Then the equation becomes $f(2x+1)=793$.
Since we know that $f(f(f(100)))=793$, we also know that $f(f(f(396.5)))=793$, or $f(f(793))=793$. From this, we can deduce that $f(793)=793$, and thus $x=396.5$. However, this is a contradiction because the domain and range of $f$ are both natural numbers.

Let's try a different approach. From the first condition, we know that $f(f(f(100)))=793$. This means that $f(f(n))=k$ for some positive integer $k$ such that $f(k)=793$. We can use the second condition to try to find a relationship between $f(n)$ and $f(2n)$.
From the second condition, we have $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$. Let's substitute $2n$ with $n$ to get $f(n/2)=2f(n/4)+1$. Since the domain of $f$ is only natural numbers, we must have $n/2$ is a natural number as well. Therefore, $n$ must be an even number.
Let's substitute $n$ with $2n$ in the second condition to get $f(2(2n))=2f(2n)+1$, or $f(4n)=2f(2n)+1$. We can also substitute $2n$ with $n$ in the first condition to get $f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$.
Since we know that $f(f(f(100)))=793$, we can substitute $n=100$ into the first condition to get $f(f(f(100)))=8(100)-7=793$. This means that $f(f(100))=793$.
From the second condition, we know that $f(2(50))=2f(50)+1$, or $f(100)=2f(50)+1$. Since $f(f(100))=793$, we can substitute this into the equation to get $793=2f(50)+1$. Solving for $f(50)$, we get $f(50)=(793-1)/2=396$.
Since we know that $f(50)=396$, we can substitute $n=50$ into the second condition to get $f(2(50))=2f(50)+1$, or $f(100)=2(396)+1=793$.
Therefore, $f(100)=793$.
The value of $f(100)$ is $793$. The answer is: $793$

"A function $f: \mathbb N \to \mathbb N$ satisfies the following two conditions for all positive integers $n$:$f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$ and $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$. Calculate $f(100)$."
Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:



First, let's try to find $f(1)$ using the second condition $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$.
Setting $n=1$, we get $f(2)=2f(1)+1$.
Since $f(2)$ is the input to the function, and the output is 8 times the input minus 7 from the first condition, we can substitute $f(2)$ into the first condition: $f(f(2))=8*1-7$, or $f(2f(1)+1)=1$.
This implies that $2f(1)+1=1$, which means $f(1)=0$.
Now, we can find $f(100)$ using the second condition.
$f(200)=2f(100)+1$.
Again, substituting this into the first condition, we get $f(f(200))=8*100-7$, or $f(2f(100)+1)=793$.
But we know that $2f(100)+1=200$, so substituting this in, we have $f(200)=793$.
Now we can solve for $f(100)$:
$f(200)=2f(100)+1=793$, so $2f(100)=792$ and $f(100)=396$.
Therefore, $f(100)=396$. The answer is: $396$

Question (hint: positive numerical answer):
"A function $f: \mathbb N \to \mathbb N$ satisfies the following two conditions for all positive integers $n$:$f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$ and $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$. Calculate $f(100)$."
Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:


To find $f(100)$, we need to find the pattern of the function $f$.
Using the second condition, we have $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$. This means that $f(n)$ is an increasing function.
Using the first condition, we have $f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$.
Let's try to find the value of $f(1)$ using this information.
If we let $n=1$ in the first condition, we have $f(f(f(1)))=8(1)-7=1$.
So $f(f(f(1)))=1$.
This means that $f(1)$ is a value such that $f(f(f(1)))=1$.
Let's try to find such a value.
If we let $f(1)=1$, then $f(f(f(1)))=f(f(1))=f(1)=1$, which satisfies the condition.
Therefore, $f(1)=1$.
Now we can use the second condition to find $f(2)$.
We have $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$, so when $n=1$, we have $f(2)=2f(1)+1=2(1)+1=3$.
We can continue to find $f(3)$, $f(4)$, etc., using the second condition.
After some trial and error, we find that $f(n)=2n-1$ satisfies both conditions.
So, $f(100)=2(100)-1=199$. The answer is: $199$

"A function $f: \mathbb N \to \mathbb N$ satisfies the following two conditions for all positive integers $n$:$f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$ and $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$. Calculate $f(100)$."
Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:


First, let's apply the function $f$ on $n = 1$:
$f(f(f(1))) = 8(1) - 7 = -1$.
Since function $f$ only outputs natural numbers, we know that this equation cannot hold. Therefore, we must have made a mistake somewhere in our work.
Let's try applying the function $f$ on $n = 2$:
$f(f(f(2))) = f(f(2f(1) + 1)) = f(f(3)) = 8(3) - 7 = 13$.
We know that $f(f(f(2))) = 13$, but we also know that $f(f(f(2))) = 8(2) - 7 = 9$.
Therefore, our original equation $f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$ is not always true.
We made a mistake in our reasoning. Let's try a different approach.
From the given information, we know that $f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$ and $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$.
We can substitute $n = f(1)$ into the equation $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$:
$f(2f(1)) = 2f(f(1)) + 1$.
Since $2f(1)$ is equal to $f(2)$, this equation becomes $f(f(2)) = 2f(f(1)) + 1$.
We also know that $f(f(f(2))) = 9$, so we can substitute this into the equation:
$9 = 2f(f(1)) + 1$.
Simplifying, we get $2f(f(1)) = 8$, so $f(f(1)) = 4$.
Since $f(f(1)) = 4$, and we know that $f$ outputs natural numbers, the only possible value for $f(1)$ is 2.
Now, let's try to find $f(100)$ using the equation $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$.
If we let $n = 50$, we get $f(100) = 2f(50) + 1$.
Again, using the equation $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$, we can let $n = 25$:
$f(50) = 2f(25) + 1$.
Similarly, $f(50) = 2f(12.5)$.
But $f$ only outputs natural numbers, so this equation doesn't hold.
We made another mistake in our reasoning.
Let's go back to the original equation $f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$.
If we let $n = 100$, we get $f(f(f(100))) = 8(100) - 7 = 793$.
From $f(f(f(100))) = 793$, we can work backwards to find $f(100)$.
We know that $f(f(f(100))) = 8(100) - 7 = 793$.
Then $f(f(100)) = \frac{793}{8} = 99.125$, but this doesn't make sense because $f(100)$ should be a natural number.
Let's try another approach.
From the given information, we know that $f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$.
If we let $n = 2$, we get $f(f(f(2))) = 8(2) - 7 = 9$.
From $f(f(f(2))) = 9$, we can work backwards to find $f(2)$:
$f(f(2)) = \frac{9}{2} = 4.5$, but this doesn't make sense because $f(2)$ should be a natural number.
Again, we made a mistake in our reasoning.
Let's try one more approach.
From the given information, we know that $f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$.
If we let $n = 3$, we get $f(f(f(3))) = 8(3) - 7 = 17$.
From $f(f(f(3))) = 17$, we can work backwards to find $f(3)$:
$f(f(3)) = \frac{17}{2} = 8.5$, but this doesn't make sense because $f(3)$ should be a natural number.
Again, we made a mistake in our reasoning.
Let's try one more approach.
From the given information, we know that $f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$.
If we let $n = 4$, we get $f(f(f(4))) = 8(4) - 7 = 25$.
From $f(f(f(4))) = 25$, we can work backwards to find $f(4)$:
$f(f(4)) = \frac{25}{2} = 12.5$, but this doesn't make sense because $f(4)$ should be a natural number.
Again, we made a mistake in our reasoning.
Let's go back to the original equation $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$.
If we let $n = 100$, we get $f(200) = 2f(100) + 1$.
From $f(200) = 2f(100) + 1$, we can solve for $f(100)$:
$f(100) = \frac{f(200) - 1}{2}$.
We know that $f(200)$ should be a natural number, so let's try plugging in some natural numbers for $f(200)$ until we find one that makes $f(100)$ a natural number.
If we let $f(200) = 201$, then $f(100) = \frac{201 - 1}{2} = 100$, which is a natural number.
So, $f(100) = 100$.
The answer is: $100$

Question (hint: positive numerical answer):
"A function $f: \mathbb N \to \mathbb N$ satisfies the following two conditions for all positive integers $n$:$f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$ and $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$. Calculate $f(100)$."
Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:


First, let's apply the second condition of the function $f$ to find $f(100)$:
$f(100) = 2f(50) + 1$.
Next, we apply the second condition again to find $f(50)$:
$f(50) = 2f(25) + 1$.
Continuing this process, we can keep applying the second condition until we reach a value we know. We know that $f(1) = 1$ from the first equation.
Using the second condition, we find:
$f(2) = 2f(1) + 1 = 2(1) + 1 = 3$.
$f(4) = 2f(2) + 1 = 2(3) + 1 = 7$.
$f(8) = 2f(4) + 1 = 2(7) + 1 = 15$.
$f(16) = 2f(8) + 1 = 2(15) + 1 = 31$.
$f(32) = 2f(16) + 1 = 2(31) + 1 = 63$.
$f(64) = 2f(32) + 1 = 2(63) + 1 = 127$.
Now we can apply the first condition of the function $f$ to find $f(64)$:
$f(f(f(64))) = 8(64) - 7 = 511$.
Since $f(f(f(64))) = f(127)$ and we know that $f(127) = 511$, we can conclude that $f(n) = 8n - 7$.
Finally, we can find $f(100)$ using the expression we found for $f(n)$:
$f(100) = 8(100) - 7 = 793$.
The answer is: $793$

Question (hint: positive numerical answer):
"A function $f: \mathbb N \to \mathbb N$ satisfies the following two conditions for all positive integers $n$:$f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$ and $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$. Calculate $f(100)$."
Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:


To find $f(100)$, we can first find $f(2)$ using the second equation, since we know $f(1)$ from the first equation.

Using the second equation, $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$, when $n=1$, we get $f(2)=2f(1)+1$. But we know from the first equation that $f(f(f(1)))=8(1)-7=1$, so $f(f(1))=1$, and thus $f(1)$ must be the only positive integer solution to this equation. Therefore, $f(1)=1$.

Substituting $f(1)=1$ into $f(2)=2f(1)+1$, we get $f(2)=2*1+1=3$.

Now we can find $f(100)$ by repeatedly applying the second equation.

First, let's find $f(50)$: $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$ gives $f(100)=2f(50)+1$.
Next, let's find $f(25)$: $f(100)=2f(50)+1$ gives $f(50)=2f(25)+1$.
Similarly, $f(12)=2f(6)+1$ and $f(6)=2f(3)+1$.
Finally, we know $f(3)$ from the first equation: $f(f(f(1)))=8(1)-7=1$ gives $f(f(1))=1$, and thus $f(1)=1$. And we've already found $f(2)=3$. Using the second equation $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$, we get $f(3)=2f(1)+1=3$.

Now we can substitute $f(3)=3$ into $f(6)=2f(3)+1$ to get $f(6)=2*3+1=7$.
Then we substitute $f(6)=7$ into $f(12)=2f(6)+1$ to get $f(12)=2*7+1=15$.
And finally we substitute $f(12)=15$ into $f(24)=2f(12)+1$ to get $f(24)=2*15+1=31$.

Then we substitute $f(24)=31$ into $f(50)=2f(25)+1$ to get $f(50)=2f(25)+1$. Since $50$ is in the form of $2n$, we can use the second equation $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$ again, which gives $f(50)=2f(25)+1$.
We know $f(25)=2f(12)+1=2*15+1=31$.
Then substitute $f(25)=31$ into $f(50)=2f(25)+1$ to get $f(50)=2*31+1=63$.

Finally, we substitute $f(50)=63$ into $f(100)=2f(50)+1$ to get $f(100)=2*63+1=127$. So $f(100)=127$.
The answer is: $127$
