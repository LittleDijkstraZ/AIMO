Question (hint: positive numerical answer):
"What is the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ when $x$ and $y$ range over all real numbers such that $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$?"
Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:


First, let's consider the equation $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$.
This equation can be rewritten using the absolute value property $|a| = \max\{a,-a\}$ as follows:
\[|x-2y| + |y-2x| = (2y-x) + (2x-y) = x + y = 40.\]
Now, let's consider the expression $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$. We can rewrite it as:
\[5x^2+5y^2-8xy = \frac{1}{2}(10x^2+10y^2-16xy) = \frac{1}{2}((2x-y)^2+(x-2y)^2).\]
Since $x + y = 40$, we can substitute $y = 40 - x$ into the above expression:
\[\frac{1}{2}((2x-(40-x))^2+((x-2(40-x))^2) = \frac{1}{2}((3x-40)^2 + (-x-80)^2).\]
To find the minimum value of this expression, we can find the value of $x$ that minimizes it.
The expression is minimized when both $(3x-40)^2$ and $(-x-80)^2$ are minimized.
Since the square of a real number is always nonnegative, both $(3x-40)^2$ and $(-x-80)^2$ are minimized when $3x-40 = 0$ and $-x-80 = 0$, respectively.
Solving these equations gives $x = \frac{40}{3}$ and $x = -80$.
However, we only consider the value of $x$ in the range of $x$ values that satisfy $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$.
Substituting $x = \frac{40}{3}$ into $x + y = 40$, we get $y = \frac{80}{3}$.
Thus, the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ is:
\[\frac{1}{2}\left((3\cdot \frac{40}{3}-40)^2 + (-\frac{40}{3}-80)^2\right) = \frac{1}{2}(0 + 12000) = 6000.\]
Therefore, the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ when $x$ and $y$ satisfy the given condition is 6000. The answer is: $6000$.

Question (hint: positive numerical answer):
"What is the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ when $x$ and $y$ range over all real numbers such that $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$?"
Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:


We first note that $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$ can be rewritten as $|x-2y| + |2y-x| = 40$. By the triangle inequality, we know that $|x-2y| + |2y-x| \geq |(x-2y) + (2y-x)| = |0| = 0$. But we know that the left-hand side is equal to 40, which is a positive number. This is only possible if both $|x-2y|$ and $|2y-x|$ are equal to 20, so we must have $x-2y = \pm 20$ and $2y-x = \pm 20$. Adding these two equations gives $y = \pm 20$, and substituting this back into the equations gives $x = \pm 60$.
Now we substitute $x=60$ and $y=20$ into the expression $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ to find the minimum value: $5(60)^2 + 5(20)^2 - 8(60)(20) = 18000 + 2000 - 9600 = 18400$.
Therefore, the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ is 18400. The answer is: $18400$.

Question (hint: positive numerical answer):
"What is the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ when $x$ and $y$ range over all real numbers such that $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$?"
Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:


The given expression is $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$. We can rewrite it as $5(x^2+y^2)-8xy$. We know that $(x-y)^2 = x^2 - 2xy + y^2$, so we can rewrite $x^2+y^2$ as $(x-y)^2 + 2xy$. Substituting this into the expression gives $5((x-y)^2 + 2xy) - 8xy = 5(x-y)^2 + 2xy - 8xy = 5(x-y)^2 - 6xy$.

Now we consider the constraint $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$. Without loss of generality, let's assume $x \geq 2y$. Then $|x-2y| = x - 2y$ and $|y-2x| = 2x - y$. So we have $x - 2y + 2x - y = 40$, which simplifies to $3x - 3y = 40$, or $x - y = \frac{40}{3}$.

Now, substituting $x - y = \frac{40}{3}$ into $5(x-y)^2 - 6xy$, we get $5 \left(\frac{40}{3}\right)^2 - 6xy = \frac{8000}{9} - 6xy$.

Now we need to find the minimum value of this expression. Since the expression involves both $x$ and $y$, it's not straightforward to find the minimum directly. But we know from the constraint that $x - y = \frac{40}{3}$, so we can substitute $y = x - \frac{40}{3}$ into the expression and find the minimum of the resulting function with respect to $x$.

After substituting $y = x - \frac{40}{3}$ into the expression $\frac{8000}{9} - 6xy$, we get $\frac{8000}{9} - 6x \left(x - \frac{40}{3}\right) = \frac{8000}{9} - 6x^2 + 80x = -6x^2 + 80x + \frac{8000}{9}$.

Now we need to find the minimum of this quadratic function $-6x^2 + 80x + \frac{8000}{9}$. The minimum occurs at $x = -\frac{b}{2a} = -\frac{80}{2(-6)} = \frac{20}{3}$. Substituting $x = \frac{20}{3}$ back into $y = x - \frac{40}{3}$ gives $y = \frac{20}{3} - \frac{40}{3} = -\frac{20}{3}$.

Substituting $x = \frac{20}{3}$ and $y = -\frac{20}{3}$ back into $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ gives $5 \left(\frac{20}{3}\right)^2 + 5 \left(-\frac{20}{3}\right)^2 - 8 \left(\frac{20}{3}\right) \left(-\frac{20}{3}\right) = \frac{8000}{9}$.

Therefore, the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ under the constraint $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$ is $\frac{8000}{9}$.

The answer is: $8000/9$

Question (hint: positive numerical answer):
"What is the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ when $x$ and $y$ range over all real numbers such that $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$?"
Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:



First, let's rewrite the condition $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$ as $|2y-x| + |2x-y| = 40$. By the Triangle Inequality, $|2y-x| + |2x-y| \ge |(2y-x) - (2x-y)| = |y-3x|$. So we have $|y-3x| = 40$.
Next, we square both sides to get $(y-3x)^2 = 1600$. This simplifies to $y^2 - 6xy + 9x^2 = 1600$.
Now, let's substitute this into the expression we want to minimize: $5x^2+5y^2-8xy = 5x^2 + 5(9x^2 - 6xy + y^2) - 8xy = 50x^2 - 28xy + 5y^2$.

Now we substitute $y^2 - 6xy + 9x^2 = 1600$ into this to get $50x^2 - 28xy + 5(1600 + 6xy - 9x^2) = 50x^2 - 28xy + 8000 + 30xy - 45x^2 = -5x^2 + 2xy + 8000$.

This is a quadratic in $x$ with a coefficient of $x^2$ of $-5$, which is negative, so it opens downwards and has a maximum value. The $x$ value that gives this maximum value is the $x$ value that makes the derivative of this quadratic equal to zero. The derivative is $-10x + 2y = 0$, or $y = 5x$.

Substituting $y = 5x$ into $|y-3x| = 40$, we get $|5x-3x| = 40$, or $|2x| = 40$, or $x = \pm 20$. Then $y = \pm 100$.

Substituting $x = 20$ and $y = 100$ into $-5x^2 + 2xy + 8000$, we get $-5(20^2) + 2(20)(100) + 8000 = -2000 + 4000 + 8000 = 10000$.

So the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ is $10000$. The answer is: $10000$

Question (hint: positive numerical answer):
"What is the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ when $x$ and $y$ range over all real numbers such that $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$?"
Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:


First, we rewrite the expression $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ as $(5x^2-8xy+5y^2)$. This is the square of a binomial: $(5x^2-8xy+5y^2) = (√5x - √5y)^2$. Therefore, its minimum value is $0$.
Next, we consider the equation $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$. Using the property of absolute value, we can rewrite this as $|x-2y| + |2y-x| = 40$, which simplifies to $2|x-2y| = 40$.
Dividing both sides by 2, we get $|x-2y| = 20$.
Since the absolute value of a real number is always non-negative, we have $|x-2y| \ge 0$. Therefore, the minimum value of $|x-2y|$ is 0.
Setting $|x-2y| = 0$, we get $x = 2y$.
Substituting $x = 2y$ into the expression $(√5x - √5y)^2$, we have $(√5(2y) - √5y)^2 = (√10y - √5y)^2 = (√5y)^2 = 5y^2$.
Therefore, the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ is $5y^2$, and to find this minimum value, we need to minimize $y^2$.
Since $y^2$ is always non-negative, its minimum value is 0.
Therefore, the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ is $5(0) = 0$.
However, this is not possible as it contradicts the given condition $|x-2y| = 20 \ne 0$.
So, we must consider the minimum value of the expression under the condition $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$.
Setting $x = 2y$ in the condition, we have $|2y-2y| + |y-4y| = 40$, which simplifies to $0 + 3|y| = 40$.
Dividing both sides by 3, we get $|y| = \frac{40}{3}$.
Since $y^2$ is always non-negative, the minimum value of $y^2$ is 0.
Therefore, the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ is $0$.
However, this is not possible as it contradicts the given condition $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40 \ne 0$.
We made a mistake in our reasoning, and the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ does not necessarily occur when $x = 2y$.
Let's reconsider the given condition $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$.
By the Triangle Inequality, $|x-2y| + |y-2x| \ge |(x-2y) + (y-2x)| = |-x - y| = |-(x+y)| = |x+y|$.
Therefore, we have $|x+y| = 40$.
Now, consider the expression $(√5x - √5y)^2$. By the Binomial Theorem, this is equal to $5x^2 - 10xy + 5y^2$.
Let $A = √5x$ and $B = √5y$. Then, the expression becomes $A^2 - 2AB + B^2 = (A-B)^2$.
The minimum value of $(A-B)^2$ occurs when $A-B = 0$, or $√5x - √5y = 0$.
This gives $√5x = √5y$, or $x = y$.
Substituting $x = y$ into $|x+y| = 40$, we get $2x = 40$, or $x = 20$.
Then, $y = 20$, and the minimum value of the expression $(√5x - √5y)^2$ is $(√5(20) - √5(20))^2 = 0^2 = 0$.
Therefore, the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ is 0. The answer is: $0$

Question (hint: positive numerical answer):
"What is the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ when $x$ and $y$ range over all real numbers such that $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$?"
Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:


First, let's consider the equation $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$. We can rewrite this equation using the property $|a-b| = |b-a|$ to get $|x-2y| + |2y-x| = 40$. Then, we can use the property $|a| + |b| = |a+b|$ to simplify this to $|(x-2y) + (2y-x)| = 40$. This simplifies to $|0| = 40$, which is not possible.
So, let's try another approach.

Let's rewrite the expression $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ as $\frac{1}{2}((5x-4y)^2 + (4y-5x)^2)$. Then, we can use the property $|a-b| = |b-a|$ again to get $\frac{1}{2}(|(5x-4y) - (4y-5x)|^2) = \frac{1}{2}(|10x-8y - 8y+10x|^2) = \frac{1}{2}(|20x-16y|^2)$.

Now, let's consider the condition $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$. We can rewrite this as $|(x-2y) + (2y-x)| = 40$, which simplifies to $|0| = 40$, which is not possible. However, we can rewrite the condition as $|x-2y| = |2y-x| = 20$. This means that $|5x-4y| = |4y-5x| = 20\sqrt{2}$.

Now, we can use the property $|a+b|^2 = (a+b)^2 = a^2 + 2ab + b^2$ to get $\frac{1}{2}(|20x-16y|^2) = \frac{1}{2}((20x-16y)^2) = \frac{1}{2}(400x^2 - 640xy + 256y^2) = 200x^2 - 320xy + 128y^2$.

Now, let's substitute the condition $|5x-4y| = 20\sqrt{2}$ into the expression $200x^2 - 320xy + 128y^2$. We get $200x^2 - 320xy + 128y^2 = 200(x^2 - \frac{4}{5}xy) + 128(y^2 - \frac{4}{5}xy)$.

Now, let's complete the square for both terms. For the first term, we get $200(x^2 - \frac{4}{5}xy) = 200\left(\left(x - \frac{2}{5}y\right)^2 - \left(\frac{2}{5}y\right)^2\right) = 200\left(x - \frac{2}{5}y\right)^2 - 8y^2$.
For the second term, we get $128(y^2 - \frac{4}{5}xy) = 128\left(\left(y - \frac{2}{5}x\right)^2 - \left(\frac{2}{5}x\right)^2\right) = 128\left(y - \frac{2}{5}x\right)^2 - 8x^2$.

Adding these two results together, we get $200x^2 - 320xy + 128y^2 = 200\left(x - \frac{2}{5}y\right)^2 - 8y^2 + 128\left(y - \frac{2}{5}x\right)^2 - 8x^2 = 200\left(x - \frac{2}{5}y\right)^2 + 128\left(y - \frac{2}{5}x\right)^2 - 16(x^2 + y^2)$.

Since $|5x-4y| = 20\sqrt{2}$ and $|4y-5x| = 20\sqrt{2}$ are both positive, we can conclude that $x$ and $y$ must be non-negative. Therefore, the minimum value of the expression occurs when $x = \frac{2}{5}y$ and $y = \frac{2}{5}x$.

Substituting these values into the expression $200x^2 - 320xy + 128y^2$, we get $200x^2 - 320x^2 + 128x^2 = 0$. So, the minimum value of the expression is 0.
The value of the minimum value of the expression is 0.
The answer is: $0$
