Interesting, let's analyze step by step:



First, let's list the variables and known values from the problem. We have an equation with four distinct solutions and we need to find the number of positive integers $m$ for which this is true.

Now, let's outline the steps using sympy to solve the problem:

1. Identify the sympy functions required for each step.
   We will use the `solve` function from sympy to solve equations and find the number of solutions.

2. Implement these functions step-by-step, commenting each line for clarity.

   First, we need to set up the equation:

   ```python
   from sympy import symbols, Abs, Eq, solve

   def number_of_solutions():
       x, m = symbols('x m')
       equation = Eq(Abs(Abs(x - 1) - 2), m / 100)
       return equation

   equation = number_of_solutions()
   print(equation)
   ```
   ```output
Eq(Abs(Abs(x - 1) - 2), m/100)
```

```
   Apologies for the indentation error, let's fix it:

   ```python
   from sympy import symbols, Abs, Eq, solve

   def number_of_solutions():
       """For how many positive integers $m$ does the equation \[\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}\] have $4$ distinct solutions?"""
       x, m = symbols('x m')
       equation = Eq(Abs(Abs(x - 1) - 2), m / 100)
       return equation

   equation = number_of_solutions()
   print(equation)
   ```
   ```output
Eq(Abs(Abs(x - 1) - 2), m/100)
```

   def number_of_solutions():
       """For how many positive integers $m$ does the equation \[\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}\] have $4$ distinct solutions?"""

Interesting, let's analyze step by step:



The equation is $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$, which has 4 distinct solutions.

First, we need to find the possible values of $m$ for which the equation has four distinct solutions.

1. Let's first set $\frac{m}{100}$ to be $k$. So, we have $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=k$.

2. The function $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=k$ has 4 distinct solutions if and only if $0<k<1$. This is because the function $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert$ has its maximum value of 2 and minimum value of 0.

3. Now, we need to find the values of $m$ such that $\frac{m}{100}$ lies in the interval $(0,1)$. This is equivalent to finding the values of $m$ in the interval $(0,100)$.

4. To find the number of integers in this interval, we simply subtract the lower limit from the upper limit and add 1 (because both limits are inclusive). So, the number of integers in the interval $(0,100)$ is $100 - 0 + 1 = 101$.

However, we only need the positive integers, so the number of positive integers $m$ is 100.

Therefore, the number of positive integers $m$ for which the equation has 4 distinct solutions is 100.
The answer is: $100$

Interesting, let's analyze step by step:



The equation $| |x - 1| - 2 | = \frac{m}{100}$ has four distinct solutions. This equation can be rewritten as two separate cases:

Case 1: $|x - 1| - 2 = \frac{m}{100}$

Case 2: $-(|x - 1| - 2) = \frac{m}{100}$

For case 1, we have $|x - 1| = 2 + \frac{m}{100}$. This gives us two separate equations:

Subcase 1.1: $x - 1 = 2 + \frac{m}{100}$

Subcase 1.2: $-(x - 1) = 2 + \frac{m}{100}$

Similarly, for case 2, we have $|x - 1| = 2 - \frac{m}{100}$. This gives us two separate equations:

Subcase 2.1: $x - 1 = 2 - \frac{m}{100}$

Subcase 2.2: $-(x - 1) = 2 - \frac{m}{100}$

Now, we need to solve each of these subcases and find the values of $m$ that yield four distinct solutions. This process involves solving linear equations and checking for real solutions.

After solving each subcase and checking the solutions, we find that only $m = 100$ yields four distinct solutions. Therefore, there is only one positive integer value for $m$, which is $100$. The answer is: $1$

Interesting, let's analyze step by step:



For how many positive integers $m$ does the equation \[\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}\] have $4$ distinct solutions?

This is a complex problem, but let's start with the first step:

1. Recognize that the left side of the equation, $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert$, is a piecewise function with four linear pieces:

When $x<1$, it equals to $-(x-1) - 2 = -x + 1 - 2 = -x - 1$.
When $1 \leq x < 3$, it equals to $(x-1) - 2 = x - 1 - 2 = x - 3$.
When $3 \leq x < 5$, it equals to $(x-1) - 2 = x - 1 - 2 = x - 3$.
When $x \geq 5$, it equals to $-(x-1) - 2 = -x + 1 - 2 = -x - 1$.

2. We know that the right side of the equation, $\frac{m}{100}$, is always positive. So we only need to consider the cases when the left side equals to the right side.

3. For the left side to equal to the right side, $\frac{m}{100}$ must be greater than 1 (since the absolute value of a real number is always nonnegative and the maximum value of the left side is 2). So $m$ must be greater than 100.

4. Also, for the left side to equal to the right side, $\frac{m}{100}$ must be less than 3 (since the minimum value of the left side is -2 and the absolute value of a real number is always nonnegative). So $m$ must be less than 300.

5. Therefore, we only need to consider the positive integers $m$ that are greater than 100 and less than 300.

6. For each such $m$, the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has 4 distinct solutions.

7. To find out how many such $m$ there are, we just need to count the positive integers from 101 to 299.

8. To do this, we can simply subtract 101 from 299 and get 198. But we must add 1 because both 101 and 299 are included.

So there are 199 such positive integers $m$. However, we must check if 199 is a positive integer. It is. Therefore, the number of positive integers $m$ for which the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has 4 distinct solutions is 199.
The answer is: $199$

Interesting, let's analyze step by step:



The equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has 4 distinct solutions. We need to find the number of positive integer values of $m$.

The solutions to the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ is equal to the number of times the horizontal line $y=\frac{m}{100}$ intersects the graph of $y=\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert$.

The graph of $y=\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert$ is a "hump" shape, reaching a maximum of 2 at $x=1$, and decreasing to 0 on either side. The slope of the line $y=\frac{m}{100}$ increases as $m$ increases.

The line $y=\frac{m}{100}$ will intersect the graph at 4 distinct points when $\frac{m}{100}$ falls strictly between 0 and 2. This occurs when $0 < \frac{m}{100} < 2$, which simplifies to $0 < m < 200$.

The number of positive integer values of $m$ in this range is $200 - 1 = 199$. But we need to check the endpoints. When $m=0$, the equation becomes $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=0$, which simplifies to $\vert x-1 \vert = 2$, yielding two solutions $x=3$ and $x=-1$. When $m=200$, the equation becomes $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=2$, which simplifies to $\vert x-1 \vert = 4$, yielding two solutions $x=5$ and $x=-3$. So the endpoints also give us 4 distinct solutions.

Therefore, the number of positive integer values of $m$ for which the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has 4 distinct solutions is $199+1=200$. However, we are asked to find the number of positive integers $m$, so we need to exclude the value $m=0$. Thus, the number of positive integer values of $m$ is $200-1=199$.

Since 199 is a positive integer, we have found the correct solution.

The final answer is: $199$. The answer is: $199$

Interesting, let's analyze step by step:



1. First, let's denote the number of distinct solutions of the equation as $m$. The equation is given as $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$, and we are asked to find the number of positive integers $m$ for which this equation has $4$ distinct solutions.

2. To solve this problem, we can start by considering the different cases for the absolute value function $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert$. This function can take on three different forms:

   - Case 1: $\vert x-1 \vert -2 = \frac{m}{100}$
   - Case 2: $-\vert x-1 \vert +2 = \frac{m}{100}$
   - Case 3: $\vert x-1 \vert -2 = -\frac{m}{100}$
   - Case 4: $-\vert x-1 \vert +2 = -\frac{m}{100}$

3. For each case, we can solve the absolute value equation by splitting it into two separate equations:

   - Case 1: $\vert x-1 \vert = 2 + \frac{m}{100}$ and $\vert x-1 \vert = 2 - \frac{m}{100}$
   - Case 2: $\vert x-1 \vert = 2 - \frac{m}{100}$ and $\vert x-1 \vert = -2 + \frac{m}{100}$
   - Case 3: $\vert x-1 \vert = 2 + \frac{m}{100}$ and $\vert x-1 \vert = -2 - \frac{m}{100}$
   - Case 4: $\vert x-1 \vert = -2 - \frac{m}{100}$ and $\vert x-1 \vert = -2 + \frac{m}{100}$

4. For each case, we can solve the two separate equations and find the values of $x$ that satisfy them. Then we can count the number of distinct solutions for each case and sum them up.

5. After trying all cases and summing up the number of distinct solutions, we find that only Case 1 and Case 2 give us $4$ distinct solutions. Therefore, we only need to consider these two cases.

6. Solving the equations in Case 1 and Case 2, we find that only Case 1 gives us $4$ distinct solutions when $m=200$. Therefore, the only positive integer $m$ that satisfies the condition is $m=200$.

7. The result is a positive integer, so the answer is $1$. The value of $m$ that satisfies the condition is $m=200$. The answer is: $1$

Interesting, let's analyze step by step:



The equation we're dealing with is $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$. The number of distinct solutions we want is 4.

First, let's set $\frac{m}{100}=k$, where $k$ is a positive real number. Then the equation becomes $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=k$.

The number of solutions to this equation is determined by the value of $k$. If $k<1$, there are no solutions. If $k=1$, there is one solution. If $1<k<2$, there are two solutions. If $k=2$, there are three solutions. If $k>2$, there are four solutions.

So for our equation to have four distinct solutions, $\frac{m}{100}$ must equal 2, which means $m=200$.

Now let's check if $m=200$ is a positive integer:

$m=200$ is indeed a positive integer.

So the number of positive integers $m$ for which the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has four distinct solutions is 1. The answer is: $1$

Interesting, let's analyze step by step:



The expression $| |x - 1| - 2 | = \frac{m}{100}$ has 4 distinct solutions, and we want to find the number of possible values of $m$. 

Let's first rewrite the equation as $|x - 1| - 2 = \pm \frac{m}{100}$. 

This gives us two separate equations to solve: $|x - 1| - 2 = \frac{m}{100}$ and $|x - 1| - 2 = -\frac{m}{100}$.

For each equation, we can rewrite it as $|x - 1| = 2 + \frac{m}{100}$ and $|x - 1| = 2 - \frac{m}{100}$ respectively.

Now, we know that $|x - 1|$ is always non-negative, so for the second equation, if $2 - \frac{m}{100} < 0$, or $m > 200$, there will be no solution because the right side of the equation would be negative. 

So we only need to consider the first equation $|x - 1| = 2 + \frac{m}{100}$.

This gives us two more equations to solve: $x - 1 = 2 + \frac{m}{100}$ and $x - 1 = -(2 + \frac{m}{100})$, or $x = 3 + \frac{m}{100}$ and $x = -1 - \frac{m}{100}$ respectively.

For these equations to have 4 distinct solutions, the distance between the two equations should be equal to 4, which gives us the equation $3 + \frac{m}{100} - (-1 - \frac{m}{100}) = 4$, or $\frac{2m}{100} = 2$, or $m = 100$.

So, there is only one possible value of $m$ that makes the equation have 4 distinct solutions, and it is $100$. This is a positive integer, so our solution is valid.

The answer is: $1$.
