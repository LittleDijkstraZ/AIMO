Below is a math problem you are to solve (positive numerical answer):
"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"

To accomplish this:
- List the variables and known values from the problem.
- Outline the steps using sympy to solve the problem:
  * Identify the sympy functions required for each step.
  * Implement these functions step-by-step, commenting each line for clarity.
- Calculate the final answer and verify it's a positive integer.
- Output the result within \boxed{}.

Interesting, let's analyze step by step:



1. The given equation is $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$
2. The equation equals to 0 if and only if both terms equals to 0. So we have two cases:
   - $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ and $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$, or
   - $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ and $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$
3. For the first case, $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ implies $\vert x + y \vert = 10$, which means $x + y = \pm 10$. And $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ implies $\vert x \vert = \vert y \vert = 8$, which means $x, y = \pm 8$.
4. So the four points are $(8,8)$, $(8,-8)$, $(-8,8)$, and $(-8,-8)$. These points form a square with side length 16.
5. The area of this square is $16^2 = 256$.

Now let's verify it's a positive integer:
```python


INTERMEDIATE OUT :

from sympy import symbols, simplify

def calculate_area():
    # The side length of the square
    side_length = 16

    # Calculate the area of the square
    area = side_length**2

    return area

result = calculate_area()
print(result)
```

CODE RESULTS 256

INTERMEDIATE OUT :
```output
256
```
The area of the convex polygon is $256$. The answer is: $256$

The equation is $0$ if either of the factors is $0$. So we have two cases:

1) $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ and $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$, which implies $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. This means $x + y = \pm 10$ and $x - y = \pm 10$. Solving these equations we get the vertices of the square: $(0, 10)$, $(0, -10)$, $(10, 0)$, $(-10, 0)$.

2) $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ and $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$, which implies $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$. This means $x = \pm 8$ and $y = \pm 8$. Solving these equations we get the vertices of the square: $(8, 0)$, $(-8, 0)$, $(0, 8)$, $(0, -8)$.

So the convex polygon is a square with side length $10$. The area of a square is the side length squared, so the area of this square is $10^2 = 100$. Since $100$ is a positive integer, our answer is valid.

Therefore, the area of the convex polygon is $100$.
The answer is: $100$

The given equation is a product of two terms, and the product equals zero if at least one of the terms is zero. So we have two cases to consider:

Case 1: $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$.

For each of these equations to be zero, the absolute values must be equal to 10 or 8. This gives us the following system of equations:

- $x + y = \pm 10$ or $x + y = 0$
- $x - y = \pm 10$ or $x - y = 0$
- $x = \pm 8$ or $x = 0$
- $y = \pm 8$ or $y = 0$

Solving this system of equations gives us the vertices of the polygon:

- $(8, 2)$, $(8, -2)$, $(-8, 2)$, $(-8, -2)$ from the first and third equations
- $(5, 5)$, $(5, -5)$, $(-5, 5)$, $(-5, -5)$ from the first and fourth equations
- $(10, 0)$, $(0, 10)$, $(-10, 0)$, $(0, -10)$ from the second and third equations
- $(0, 8)$, $(8, 0)$, $(0, -8)$, $(-8, 0)$ from the second and fourth equations

Now we can plot these points and find the vertices of the polygon. The polygon is a square with side length 16. So its area is $16^2 = 256$.

The answer is: $256$

Interesting, let's analyze step by step:



The equation is $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + (\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + (\vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$.

For the product of two numbers to be zero, either the first number is zero or the second number is zero. Therefore, we have two cases:

Case 1: $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ and $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + (\vert y \vert - 8)^2) \neq 0$. This implies $\vert x + y \vert = 10$.

Case 2: $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ and $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + (\vert y \vert - 8)^2) \neq 0$. This implies $\vert x - y \vert = 10$.

From Case 1, we have $x + y = 10$ or $x + y = -10$. Similarly, from Case 2, we have $x - y = 10$ or $x - y = -10$.

Solving these four equations, we get the vertices of the polygon as $(8,2)$, $(8,-2)$, $(-8,2)$, and $(-8,-2)$.

Now, let's calculate the area of the polygon. The polygon is a square with side length 16 (since the distance between $(8,2)$ and $(8,-2)$ is 4 units in the y-direction, and the distance between $(8,2)$ and $(-8,2)$ is 16 units in the x-direction).

The area of the square is $16^2 = 256$. Therefore, the area of the convex polygon is 256 square units.
The answer is: $256$
