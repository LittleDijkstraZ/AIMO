Below is a math problem you are to solve (positive numerical answer!):
"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"
Analyze this problem and think step by step to come to a solution with programs. After solving the problem, output the final numerical answer within \boxed{}.

Assistant:


First, we observe that the product of two numbers is zero if and only if at least one of the numbers is zero. Therefore, we have two cases:

Case 1: $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ and $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$. This implies $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. The solutions to these absolute value equations are the lines $x + y = 10$, $x + y = -10$, $x - y = 10$, and $x - y = -10$.

Case 2: $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ and $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$. This implies $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$. The solutions to these absolute value equations are the lines $x = 8$, $x = -8$, $y = 8$, and $y = -8$.

The intersection of these lines form a square with side length 10. The area of this square is $10^2 = 100$. Therefore, the area of the convex polygon is 100 square units. The answer is: 100

First, we notice that the product of two numbers is zero if and only if at least one of the numbers is zero. This means that either $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$.
If $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$, then $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$, which means $x + y = \pm 10$ and $x - y = \pm 10$. These four equations give us the vertices of the square.
If $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$, then $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$, which means $x = \pm 8$ and $y = \pm 8$. These four equations give us the vertices of the square.
Therefore, the points that satisfy the equation form a square with side length $20$. The area of this square is $20^2 = 400$.
The answer is: $400$

Assistant:

 The given equation is of the form $AB=0$, which means that either $A=0$ or $B=0$.
In this case, we have two products of square terms equal to zero. Each term inside the square is of the form $\vert x \pm y \vert - 10$ or $\vert x \vert - 8$ and $\vert y \vert - 8$.

The equation $\vert x \pm y \vert - 10 = 0$ implies $\vert x \pm y \vert = 10$, and the equation $\vert x \vert - 8 = 0$ or $\vert y \vert - 8 = 0$ implies $\vert x \vert = 8$ or $\vert y \vert = 8$.

Solving these equations, we get the following four lines:

1. $x + y = 10$ and $x - y = 10$, which gives $x = 10$ and $y = 0$.
2. $x + y = -10$ and $x - y = -10$, which gives $x = -10$ and $y = 0$.
3. $x = 8$ and $y = 8$.
4. $x = -8$ and $y = -8$.

These lines form a square with side length 20. The area of this square is $20^2 = 400$.
The answer is: $400$.

Below is a math problem you are to solve (positive numerical answer!):
"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"
Analyze this problem and think step by step to come to a solution with programs. After solving the problem, output the final numerical answer within \boxed{}.

Assistant:

 The expression $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2)$ equals to 0 if and only if at least one of the factors is 0. This happens if and only if either $\vert x + y \vert = 10$, $\vert x - y \vert = 10$, $\vert x \vert = 8$, or $\vert y \vert = 8$. 

The lines $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$ form a square with side length $10\sqrt{2}$. The lines $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$ form a square with side length $16$. 

Therefore, the convex polygon is the union of two squares, one with side length $10\sqrt{2}$ and the other with side length $16$. 

The area of a square with side length $s$ is $s^2$. Therefore, the area of the convex polygon is $(10\sqrt{2})^2 + 16^2 = 200 + 256 = 456$.
The answer is: $456$

"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"

Assistant:

 The given equation is $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$. For the product of two numbers to be zero, one of the numbers must be zero. Therefore, either $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$.
The first equation implies that $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$, which is a square with side length 10. The second equation implies that $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$, which is a square with side length 16.
The side length of the smaller square is 10, so its area is $10^2 = 100$. The side length of the larger square is 16, so its area is $16^2 = 256$.
The convex polygon formed by the intersection of the two squares is a smaller square with side length 10. Therefore, the area of the convex polygon is $10^2 = 100$.
The answer is: $100$

Assistant:

 The given equation is of the form $A \cdot B = 0$, which means that either $A = 0$ or $B = 0$. So we need to consider two cases:

1. $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$. This implies that $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. These equations describe a square with side length $10\sqrt{2}$, centered at the origin $(0,0)$, and its vertices are at $(\pm 10, 0)$, $(0, \pm 10)$.
2. $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$. This implies that $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$, which describes a square with side length $16$, centered at the origin $(0,0)$, and its vertices are at $(\pm 8, 0)$, $(0, \pm 8)$.

The intersection of these two squares is a square with side length $10$ (because the side length of the smaller square is less than the side length of the larger square), and its vertices are at $(\pm 5, 0)$, $(0, \pm 5)$. Therefore, the area of the convex polygon is the area of this square, which is $10^2 = 100$. The answer is: $100$

Assistant:

 The equation $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ is true if and only if either of the two factors is zero. The first factor is zero when $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ or $\vert x - y \vert = 10$, which defines a square. The second factor is zero when $\vert x \vert = 8$ or $\vert y \vert = 8$, which also defines a square. Therefore, the points satisfying the equation form the intersection of these two squares, which is a smaller square. The side length of this square is the minimum of the side lengths of the two squares, which are both 20 units. Therefore, the area of the convex polygon is $20^2 = 400$ square units. The answer is: $400$

Assistant:


The given equation is a product of two terms equal to zero, so either term must be zero for the entire expression to be zero. This gives us two sets of equations:
1. $|x+y| - 10 = 0$ and $|x - y| - 10 = 0$.
2. $|x| - 8 = 0$ and $|y| - 8 = 0$.

The solutions to the first set of equations are $x+y = \pm10$ and $x-y = \pm10$. Solving these we get the lines $y = -x \pm10$ and $y = x \pm10$.

The solutions to the second set of equations are $x = \pm8$ and $y = \pm8$. This gives us the lines $x = 8$, $x = -8$, $y = 8$, and $y = -8$.

These lines form a rectangle with side lengths $20$ and $16$. Therefore, the area of the rectangle is $20 \times 16 = 320$. The answer is: $320$

The expression $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + (\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ implies that $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. This implies that $x + y = \pm 10$ and $x - y = \pm 10$.
Solving these equations, we get four lines: $x + y = 10$, $x + y = -10$, $x - y = 10$, and $x - y = -10$.
Similarly, the expression $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + (\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ implies that $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$, which gives us two lines: $x = \pm 8$ and $y = \pm 8$.
The intersection of these lines form a square with side length $10$, as the maximum possible distance between the lines $x + y = 10$ and $x - y = 10$ (or $x + y = -10$ and $x - y = -10$) is $\sqrt{2} \cdot 10$ by the Pythagorean theorem, and this distance equals the side length of the square.
Therefore, the area of the square is $10^2 = 100$.
The answer is: $100$
