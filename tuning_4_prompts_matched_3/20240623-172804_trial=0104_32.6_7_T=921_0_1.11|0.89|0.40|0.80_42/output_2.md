 The equation $| |x-1|-2|=\frac{m}{100}$ has 4 distinct solutions.
This equation can be split into two cases:
1. $|x-1|-2=\frac{m}{100}$
2. $-(|x-1|-2)=\frac{m}{100}$, which simplifies to $|x-1|+2=\frac{m}{100}$.

For the first case, we have $|x-1|=2+\frac{m}{100}$, so $x-1=2+\frac{m}{100}$ or $x-1=-(2+\frac{m}{100})$.
Solving these equations gives us $x=3+\frac{m}{100}$ or $x=-1-\frac{m}{100}$.

For the second case, we have $|x-1|=2-\frac{m}{100}$, so $x-1=2-\frac{m}{100}$ or $x-1=-(2-\frac{m}{100})$.
Solving these equations gives us $x=3-\frac{m}{100}$ or $x=-1+\frac{m}{100}$.

So the 4 distinct solutions are $x=3+\frac{m}{100}$, $x=-1-\frac{m}{100}$, $x=3-\frac{m}{100}$, and $x=-1+\frac{m}{100}$.

For these solutions to be distinct, we need the expressions $\frac{m}{100}$ to be different from each other.
This means that $m$ must be greater than 200, as otherwise any value of $m$ would make two of these expressions equal to each other.

Therefore, the only positive integer $m$ that satisfies this condition is $m=201$.
So there is only one value of $m$ for which the equation has 4 distinct solutions, namely $m=201$. The answer is: $1$

 The problem asks for the number of positive integers $m$ such that the equation \[\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}\] has $4$ distinct solutions.

Let's first consider the right-hand side of the equation, $\frac{m}{100}$. The right-hand side must be positive, so $m$ must be positive. The maximum value of $\frac{m}{100}$ is $1$, which occurs when $m = 100$. The minimum value of $\frac{m}{100}$ is $0$, which occurs when $m = 0$. However, $m = 0$ does not give us a meaningful equation because it would simply be $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert = 0$. So we only consider positive values of $m$.

Now let's consider the left-hand side of the equation, $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert$. This expression is equal to a positive number, $\frac{m}{100}$. The expression $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert$ can be equal to $\frac{m}{100}$ in four distinct ways:

1. When $\vert x-1 \vert -2 = \frac{m}{100}$, we have $\vert x-1 \vert = \frac{m}{100} + 2$. This gives us two equations: $x-1 = \frac{m}{100} + 2$ and $-(x-1) = \frac{m}{100} + 2$. Solving these equations gives us two solutions for $x$.

2. When $-\vert x-1 \vert +2 = \frac{m}{100}$, we have $\vert x-1 \vert = 2 - \frac{m}{100}$. This gives us two equations: $x-1 = 2 - \frac{m}{100}$ and $-(x-1) = 2 - \frac{m}{100}$. Solving these equations gives us two more solutions for $x$.

In total, we have four distinct solutions for $x$. So the number of positive integers $m$ for which the equation has $4$ distinct solutions is the number of positive integers $m$ such that $\frac{m}{100}$ is between $0$ and $1$. This is the same as the number of positive integers $m$ such that $0 < m < 100$. The number of such integers is $99$. So the number of positive integers $m$ for which the equation has $4$ distinct solutions is $99$.
The answer is: $99$

 This problem is a bit complicated to solve directly with Python. Instead, we can break it down into smaller steps.

First, let's consider the equation $| |x - 1| - 2 | = \frac{m}{100}$. The right side of the equation, $\frac{m}{100}$, should be a non-negative number, so $m$ should be a non-negative integer.

The left side of the equation, $| |x - 1| - 2 |$, is a positive value or zero when $|x - 1| - 2 = \pm \frac{m}{100}$. This means that there are two cases to consider: $|x - 1| - 2 = \frac{m}{100}$ and $|x - 1| - 2 = - \frac{m}{100}$.

For the first case, $|x - 1| = 2 + \frac{m}{100}$, which gives two equations: $x - 1 = 2 + \frac{m}{100}$ and $x - 1 = -(2 + \frac{m}{100})$.

For the second case, $|x - 1| = 2 - \frac{m}{100}$, which gives two equations: $x - 1 = 2 - \frac{m}{100}$ and $x - 1 = -(2 - \frac{m}{100})$.

In total, we have four equations to solve:
1. $x - 1 = 2 + \frac{m}{100}$,
2. $x - 1 = -(2 + \frac{m}{100})$,
3. $x - 1 = 2 - \frac{m}{100}$,
4. $x - 1 = -(2 - \frac{m}{100})$.

Solving these equations will give us the values of $x$ in terms of $m$. We then can find the number of distinct solutions for each value of $m$ and count the number of $m$ for which there are 4 distinct solutions.

Unfortunately, this approach requires solving the equations for each value of $m$, which is time-consuming and error-prone. A better way to solve this problem is to use a graphical approach.

Consider the function $f(x) = | |x - 1| - 2 |$. This function has a V-shape with two vertices at $x = 1 \pm 2$, which are at $y = 0$. The "valleys" of the V-shape are at $y = \frac{m}{100}$ and $y = -\frac{m}{100}$.

For the equation $f(x) = \frac{m}{100}$ to have 4 distinct solutions, the "valley" at $y = \frac{m}{100}$ must intersect the V-shape at four distinct points. Similarly, for the equation $f(x) = -\frac{m}{100}$ to have 4 distinct solutions, the "valley" at $y = -\frac{m}{100}$ must intersect the V-shape at four distinct points.

By analyzing the graph, we find that the only values of $m$ that satisfy these conditions are $m = 200$.

Therefore, the number of positive integers $m$ for which the equation $| |x - 1| - 2 | = \frac{m}{100}$ has 4 distinct solutions is 1. The answer is: $1$

Assistant:


The equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ can have $4$ distinct solutions if and only if $\frac{m}{100}$ is strictly between $1$ and $2$, inclusive. This is because the expression inside the absolute value on the left hand side of the equation, $\vert x-1 \vert -2$, can change its behavior (the number of roots) at $\vert x-1 \vert = 2$. When $\frac{m}{100} < 1$, there are no roots. When $\frac{m}{100} = 1$, there is one root. When $1 < \frac{m}{100} < 2$, there are four roots. When $\frac{m}{100} = 2$, there are two roots. When $\frac{m}{100} > 2$, there are no roots again.

So, we need to find the number of positive integers $m$ such that $1 \leq \frac{m}{100} \leq 2$. Multiplying all parts of the inequality by $100$ gives $100 \leq m \leq 200$. The number of positive integers in this range is $200 - 100 + 1 = 101$.

Therefore, there are $101$ positive integers $m$ for which the equation has $4$ distinct solutions. The answer is: $101$.

The given equation is of the form $|f(x)| = a$. It implies that $f(x) = \pm a$. Applying this to our equation we have two cases:
1. $|x - 1| - 2 = \frac{m}{100}$ and $|x - 1| - 2 = -\frac{m}{100}$.
2. Solving these two cases will give us four distinct solutions if and only if $0 < \frac{m}{100} < 2$. The lower limit of $\frac{m}{100}$ being positive ensures that the absolute value inside isn't negative, and the upper limit of $\frac{m}{100}$ being less than 2 ensures that the absolute value inside isn't more than 2.

So, we just need to find the number of positive integers m that satisfy the inequality $0 < \frac{m}{100} < 2$. Multiplying all sides of the inequality by 100 gives $0 < m < 200$. The number of positive integers that satisfy this inequality is simply $200 - 1 = 199$.
However, we must also remember that m cannot be a multiple of 100 since otherwise $|x - 1| - 2 = \pm \frac{m}{100}$ would not yield 4 distinct solutions. The number of such m's is 2.

So the number of positive integers m for which the given equation has four distinct solutions is $199 - 2 = 197$.

 This is a problem from the American Mathematical Competition (AMC 12B).
The number of distinct solutions to the equation \[\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}\] is determined by the value of $m/100$. 
If $m/100$ is less than 2, there are no solutions. If $m/100$ is equal to 2, there is one solution. If $m/100$ is between 2 and 3, there are two solutions. If $m/100$ is equal to 3, there are three solutions. If $m/100$ is greater than 3, there are four distinct solutions.
Therefore, to have four distinct solutions, $m/100$ must be equal to 3. 
To solve for $m$, we can multiply both sides of the equation $m/100=3$ by 100, giving $m=300$.
So the number of positive integers $m$ for which the equation has four distinct solutions is 1, and the value of $m$ is 300. The answer is: 1 300
The answer is $\boxed{1}$. The value of $m$ is 300.
The answer is $\boxed{300}$.

The problem asks for the number of positive integers $m$ such that the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has 4 distinct solutions.

This equation is a variant of the equation $\vert \vert x \vert -a \vert=b$. The number of solutions depends on the ratio $a/b$. In particular, the equation has 4 distinct solutions when $a/b = 1$.

In our case, $a = 2$ and $b = \frac{m}{100}$, so we need $2 / \frac{m}{100} = 1$. Solving for $m$ gives $m = 200$.

Therefore, there is only one positive integer $m$ that makes the equation have 4 distinct solutions, and that is $m = 200$.

The answer is: $1$.

Here is the python code to solve this problem:

```python
