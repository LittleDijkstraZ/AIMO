 To solve this problem, we can use the second equation to find a pattern in the function $f$.
If we plug in $n=1$ into the second equation, we get $f(2) = 2f(1) + 1$.
If we plug in $n=2$ into the second equation, we get $f(4) = 2f(2) + 1$.
If we continue this process, we can see that $f(2^k) = 2^k f(1) + 2^{k-1} - 1$ for all positive integers $k$.
Now, we can use the first equation to find the value of $f(1)$.
If we plug in $n=1$ into the first equation, we get $f(f(f(1))) = 8*1 - 7 = 1$.
Since $f(f(f(1))) = 1$, we have $f(f(1)) = 1$.
If we plug in $n=f(1)$ into the second equation, we get $f(2f(1)) = 2f(f(1)) + 1$, which simplifies to $f(2) = 2*1 + 1 = 3$.
If we plug in $n=2$ into the second equation, we get $f(4) = 2*3 + 1 = 7$.
Now, we can see that $f(2^k) = 2^k - 1$ for all positive integers $k$.
Finally, we can find $f(100) = f(2^6 + 2^2) = 2^{6} - 1 + 2*2^2 - 1 = 64 - 1 + 8 - 1 = 70$.
The value of $f(100)$ is 70.
The answer is: $70$

This problem seems to be a bit tricky to solve directly. However, by substituting $n = 1$ into the second equation, we get $f(2) = 2f(1) + 1$. Let's denote $f(1) = a$, then we have $f(2) = 2a + 1$. Substituting $f(2)$ into the second equation again when $n = 2$, we get $f(4) = 2f(2) + 1 = 2(2a + 1) + 1 = 4a + 3$. Then substituting $f(4)$ into the second equation when $n = 4$, we get $f(8) = 2f(4) + 1 = 2(4a + 3) + 1 = 8a + 7$. Finally, substituting $f(8)$ into the first equation when $n = 1$, we get $f(f(f(1))) = f(f(a)) = f(8a + 7) = 8*1 - 7 = 1$. So $f(f(a)) = 1$, and substituting $f(a) = f(2)$ into this equation, we get $f(2a + 1) = 1$. By substituting $a = 1$ into $f(2) = 2a + 1$, we get $f(2) = 3$. Then by substituting $f(2) = 3$ into $f(2a + 1) = 1$, we get $f(3) = 1$.

Now we can try to find $f(100)$ step by step:

1. $f(100) = 2f(50) + 1$.
2. $f(50) = 2f(25) + 1$.
3. $f(25) = 2f(12.5)$ (But $12.5$ is not an integer, so we have a problem here. Let's try another way.):
4. $f(100) = f(f(f(100)))$ from the first equation. We know $f(f(f(1))) = 1$, so $f(f(100)) = 1$. Then we have $f(100) = f(1)$.
5. Since we've found that $f(3) = 1$, then $f(100) = f(1) = 3$.

So the solution is $f(100) = 3$. The answer is: $3$.

Computing $f(100)$ directly is not feasible because the function $f$ is defined in a complex way. However, we can use the second condition $f(2n) = 2f(n) + 1$ to simplify the problem.

First, let's compute $f(1)$, then $f(2)$, $f(4)$, $f(8)$, and so on up to $f(100)$.

From the second condition, we have $f(2) = 2f(1) + 1$. 
Then, $f(4) = 2f(2) + 1 = 2(2f(1) + 1) + 1 = 4f(1) + 3$.
Continuing in this way, we find that $f(2^k) = 2^k f(1) + (2^k - 1)$ for all positive integers $k$.

Now, we can use the first condition $f(f(f(n))) = 8n - 7$. 

Setting $n = 1$, we get $f(f(f(1))) = 8*1 - 7 = 1$, so $f(f(1)) = 1$. 

Setting $n = f(1)$ in the second condition, we get $f(2f(1)) = 2f(f(1)) + 1 = 2*1 + 1 = 3$, so $f(3) = 3$. 

Setting $n = 3$ in the first condition, we get $f(f(f(3))) = 8*3 - 7 = 19$. Since $f(3) = 3$, we have $f(f(3)) = f(3) = 3$. So $f(3) = 3$ is a solution to the equation $f(f(f(3))) = 19$.

However, we know that $f(3) = 3$, so $f(f(3)) = f(3) = 3$. Hence, $f(3) = 3$ is the only solution to the equation $f(f(f(3))) = 19$. 

So, $f(1) = 1$. 

Substituting $f(1) = 1$ into the formula $f(2^k) = 2^k f(1) + (2^k - 1)$, we get $f(2^k) = 2^k + (2^k - 1) = 2^{k+1} - 1$. 

In particular, $f(100) = f(2^6 + 2^2) = 2^{6+1} - 1 + 2(2^2 + 1) - 1 = 64 - 1 + 2(4 + 1) - 1 = 63 + 2*5 - 1 = 63 + 10 - 1 = 72$.

So, the value of $f(100)$ is 72. The answer is: $72$

To solve this problem, we will try to find a pattern in the given function $f$ by calculating the first few values and see if we can find a pattern that helps us find $f(100)$.

Let's start with $n=1$:
\[f(f(f(1)))=8(1)-7=1 \implies f(f(1))=1 \implies f(1)=1.\]

Then, for $n=2$:
\[f(f(f(2)))=8(2)-7=9 \implies f(f(2))=3 \implies f(f(1)+f(1))=3 \implies f(2)=3.\]

For $n=3$:
\[f(f(f(3)))=8(3)-7=17 \implies f(f(3))=17 \implies f(3)=17.\]

For $n=4$:
\[f(f(f(4)))=8(4)-7=27 \implies f(f(4))=27 \implies f(4)=27.\]

We can see that $f(n)=n$ for $n=1,2,3,4$. So let's assume that $f(n)=n$ for all $n$. Then, for $n=100$:
\[f(100)=100.\]

To verify our assumption, we will substitute $n=100$ into the second equation $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$:
\[f(200)=2f(100)+1=2(100)+1=201.\]
Now we will check if this value satisfies the first equation:
\[f(f(f(100)))=f(f(100))=f(100)=100.\]
\[8(100)-7=793 \neq 201.\]

So our assumption that $f(n)=n$ for all $n$ is incorrect. We need to find a different approach.

Let's go back to the second equation and try to find a pattern:
\[f(2n)=2f(n)+1.\]
If we substitute $f(n)$ with $n$, we get:
\[f(2n)=2n+1.\]
This seems to be a reasonable guess, let's check if it satisfies the first equation:
\[f(f(f(n)))=f(f(n))=f(2f(n)+1)=2(2f(n)+1)+1=4f(n)+3.\]
\[8n-7 \neq 4f(n)+3.\]

Let's try another approach. If we substitute $n$ with $f(n)$ in the second equation:
\[f(2f(n))=2f(f(n))+1=2n+1.\]
This seems to work. Let's check if it satisfies the first equation:
\[f(f(f(n)))=f(2n)=2n+1.\]
\[8n-7 \neq 2n+1.\]

Let's try another approach. If we substitute $n$ with $f(n)$ in the first equation:
\[f(f(f(n)))=8f(n)-7.\]
This seems to work. Let's check if it satisfies the second equation:
\[f(2f(n))=8f(n)-7.\]
\[2f(f(n))+1=8f(n)-7 \implies 2n+1=8f(n)-7 \implies f(n)=\frac{8f(n)-6}{2} = 4f(n)-3.\]

This equation does not hold for all $n$. Let's try another approach. If we substitute $f(n)$ with $n$ in the first equation:
\[f(f(f(n)))=8n-7.\]
This seems to work. Let's check if it satisfies the second equation:
\[f(2n)=8n-7.\]
\[2f(n)+1=8n-7 \implies 2n+1=8n-7 \implies 6=6n \implies n=1.\]

This equation does not hold for all $n$. Let's try another approach. If we substitute $n$ with $f(n)$ in the second equation:
\[f(2f(n))=2f(f(n))+1=2n+1.\]
This seems to work. Let's check if it satisfies the first equation:
\[f(f(f(n)))=f(2n)=8n-7.\]
This equation also does not hold for all $n$.

Let's try another approach. If we substitute $n$ with $f(n)$ in the first equation:
\[f(f(f(n)))=8f(n)-7.\]
This seems to work. Let's check if it satisfies the second equation:
\[f(2f(n))=8f(n)-7.\]
\[2f(f(n))+1=8f(n)-7 \implies 2n+1=8n-7 \implies 6=6n \implies n=1.\]

This equation does not hold for all $n$.

Let's go back to the original problem. The only condition we have is $f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$. This equation does not provide enough information to determine a unique function $f$. Therefore, we cannot determine $f(100)$ based on this information alone.

However, we can try to find a pattern in the function $f$ by assuming $f(n)=n$ for $n=1,2,3,4$ and seeing if it continues for larger values of $n$. If it does, then $f(100)=100$. If not, then we would need to try another approach.

Let's continue the pattern:
\[f(5)=5, f(6)=6, f(7)=7, f(8)=8, \ldots\]

This pattern seems to continue for all positive integers $n$. Therefore, we can assume that $f(n)=n$ for all positive integers $n$. Then, $f(100)=100$. The answer is: $100$

The function $f(n)$ is defined by two equations. We can try to find a pattern or a specific value for $f(n)$ by substituting some values into the equations.

For example, if we let $n = 1$ in the second equation, we get $f(2) = 2f(1) + 1$. But we also know from the first equation that $f(f(f(1))) = 8*1 - 7 = 1$, so $f(f(1)) = 1$. Then we can substitute $f(1)$ into the equation $f(2) = 2f(1) + 1$. If we let $f(1) = x$, then $f(2) = 2x + 1$. But from $f(f(1)) = 1$, we also know $f(1) = x = 1$, so $f(2) = 2*1 + 1 = 3$.

We can continue this process to find more values of $f(n)$. However, this method can be quite time-consuming and may not lead to a general expression for $f(n)$.

Another way to approach this problem is to use the first equation to find the value of $f(n)$ for some specific values of $n$. For example, if we let $n = 1$ in the first equation, we get $f(f(f(1))) = 8*1 - 7 = 1$, so $f(f(1)) = 1$. Then we can substitute $f(1)$ into the equation $f(2) = 2f(1) + 1$, which gives $f(2) = 2*1 + 1 = 3$.

Now if we let $n = 2$ in the first equation, we get $f(f(f(2))) = 8*2 - 7 = 9$, so $f(f(3)) = 9$. Then we can substitute $f(3)$ into the equation $f(6) = 2f(3) + 1$, which gives $f(6) = 2*3 + 1 = 7$.

Continuing this process, we can find more values of $f(n)$. However, this method can also be quite time-consuming and may not lead to a general expression for $f(n)$.

Instead, we can try to find a pattern or a general expression for $f(n)$ from the given equations.

From the second equation, we know that $f(2n) = 2f(n) + 1$. This means that $f(n)$ is an increasing function.

From the first equation, we know that $f(f(f(n))) = 8n - 7$. This means that $f(n)$ is a three-times iterated function.

By trying some values, we can find that $f(n) = 2n - 1$ satisfies both equations.

To confirm this, let's check if $f(n) = 2n - 1$ satisfies both equations:

For the first equation, if we let $f(n) = 2n - 1$, then $f(f(f(n))) = f(f(2n - 1)) = f(2(2n - 1) - 1) = f(4n - 3) = 8n - 7$. So $f(f(f(n))) = 8n - 7$, which satisfies the first equation.

For the second equation, if we let $f(n) = 2n - 1$, then $f(2n) = 2(2n) - 1 = 4n - 1$ and $2f(n) + 1 = 2(2n - 1) + 1 = 4n - 1$. So $f(2n) = 2f(n) + 1$, which satisfies the second equation.

Therefore, $f(n) = 2n - 1$ is the function that satisfies both equations.

Now we can calculate $f(100)$ by substituting $n = 100$ into the function $f(n) = 2n - 1$:

$$f(100) = 2*100 - 1 = 200 - 1 = 199.$$

So $f(100) = 199$. The answer is: $\boxed{199}$.

 This problem requires some iterative steps to solve, and it may not be possible to find a direct formula for $f(n)$. However, we can use the given equations to calculate $f(100)$ step by step.

Let's start by calculating $f(100)$:

1. From the second equation, we know that $f(200) = 2f(100) + 1$.
2. We can then substitute $f(200)$ into the first equation to get $f(f(f(200))) = 8 \cdot 200 - 7 = 1593$.
3. Substituting $f(200) = 2f(100) + 1$ into $f(f(f(200))) = 1593$ gives us $f(f(2f(100) + 1)) = 1593$.
4. We can use the second equation again to get $f(4f(100) + 2) = 1593$.
5. Now we have $f(4f(100) + 2) = 1593$. Substituting $f(4f(100) + 2)$ into the first equation gives us $f(f(f(4f(100) + 2))) = 8(4f(100) + 2) - 7 = 32f(100) + 15$.
6. So, $32f(100) + 15 = 1593$. Solving this equation for $f(100)$ gives us $f(100) = \frac{1593 - 15}{32} = 48$.

Therefore, $f(100) = 48$. The answer is: $48$.

Solving this problem requires some analysis and iteration, but no specific programming skills are required. We can start by plugging in $n = 1$ into the second equation to get $f(2) = 2f(1) + 1$. Then, we can plug in $f(1)$ into the first equation of the first condition to get $f(f(f(1))) = 8(1) - 7 = -1$. But from the second equation, $f(f(f(1))) = f(f(2)) = f(2f(1) + 1)$, so we have $f(2f(1) + 1) = -1$.

By trying different values for $f(1)$, we find that the only value that satisfies both conditions is $f(1) = 1$. Then, we can use the second equation to find $f(2) = 2f(1) + 1 = 2(1) + 1 = 3$.

Continuing in this way, we can find $f(3) = \frac{f(6) - 1}{2} = \frac{8(3) - 7 - 1}{2} = 4$, and so on.

After some iterations, we find that $f(100) = 199$.
The answer is: $199$

To find $f(100)$, we can't directly use the function definitions. Instead, we need to find a pattern in the function values. Let's start with some simple cases:

- For $n=1$, we have $f(f(f(1)))=8*1-7=1$. Since $f(f(f(1)))=1$, we have $f(1)=1$.
- For $n=2$, we have $f(f(f(2)))=8*2-7=9$. But from the second condition, $f(f(f(2)))=f(f(4))=2f(2)+1=9$. So we can solve $2f(2)+1=9$ to get $f(2)=4$.
- For $n=3$, we have $f(f(f(3)))=8*3-7=17$. But from the second condition, $f(f(f(3)))=f(f(6))=2f(3)+1=17$. So we can solve $2f(3)+1=17$ to get $f(3)=8$.

Now we observe that $f(n)=2n-1$ for all positive integers $n$. Let's check this with the given conditions:

- For the first condition, $f(f(f(n)))=f(f(2n-1))=f(4n-3)=8n-7$, which is true.
- For the second condition, $f(2n)=2f(n)+1=2(2n-1)+1=4n-1$, which is true.

So we can conclude that $f(n)=2n-1$. Now we can calculate $f(100)$ as $f(100)=2*100-1=199$. The answer is: $199$

"A function $f: \mathbb N \to \mathbb N$ satisfies the following two conditions for all positive integers $n$:$f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$ and $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$. Calculate $f(100)$."

Since $f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$, it follows that $f(f(f(1)))=0$ and $f(f(f(2)))=7$. This implies that $f(f(2))=2$. Similarly, $f(f(f(3)))=16$, so $f(f(3))=15$. This pattern continues: $f(f(4))=30$, $f(f(5))=43$, and so on. In general, we can see that $f(f(n)) = 8n - 11$.

We can now use the second equation $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$ to find $f(n)$ for any $n$. For $n=1$, $f(2)=2f(1)+1$, so $f(1)=\frac{f(2)-1}{2}$. Since $f(f(2))=2$, we know that $f(2)$ is the value that when fed into the equation $f(f(n)) = 8n - 11$, gives us 2. Solving for $f(2)$ gives us $f(2)=3$. Therefore, $f(1)=\frac{3-1}{2}=1$.

Now we can use the equation $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$ to find $f(n)$ for any $n$. For $n=100$, $f(200)=2f(100)+1$. Let's denote $f(100)$ as $x$, so we have $f(200)=2x+1$. We can use the equation $f(f(n)) = 8n - 11$ to find $f(200)$: $f(f(100))=8(100)-11=789$. But $f(f(100))=f(200)$, so $f(200)=789$. Substituting $f(200)=2x+1$ into this equation gives us $2x+1=789$, so $2x=788$ and $x=394$.

Therefore, $f(100)=394$. The answer is: $394$

 To solve this problem, we will use a recursive approach.

First, we know that $f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$.

Second, we know that $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$.

Let's calculate $f(100)$ step by step.

We know that $f(f(f(100)))=8*100-7=793$.

So, we need to find a value of $n$ such that $f(n)=100$.

From the second equation, we know that $f(2*50)=2f(50)+1$, which implies that $f(50)=\frac{f(100)-1}{2}$.

Similarly, $f(2*25)=2f(25)+1$, which implies that $f(25)=\frac{f(50)-1}{2}$.

And $f(2*12.5)=2f(12.5)+1$, which implies that $f(12.5)=\frac{f(25)-1}{2}$.

Continuing this process, we can find that $f(100)$ can be expressed as a function of $f(50)$, $f(25)$, $f(12.5)$, and so on.

Let's continue this process until we reach a value of $n$ that we can easily find $f(n)$.

We eventually find that $f(100)=793$.

So, the value of $f(100)$ is $793$.
The answer is: $793$.

 To find $f(100)$, we first need to find a general form of the function $f$. 

Let's start with the second equation: $f(2n) = 2f(n) + 1$. 

If we set $n = 1$, we get $f(2) = 2f(1) + 1$. 

Similarly, if we set $n = 2$, we get $f(4) = 2f(2) + 1$. 

We can substitute $f(2)$ from the previous equation into this equation to get $f(4) = 2(2f(1) + 1) + 1 = 4f(1) + 3$.

Continuing this way, we can find that $f(2^k) = 2^kf(1) + (2^k - 1)$ for all positive integers $k$.

Now let's look at the first equation: $f(f(f(n))) = 8n - 7$.

If we set $n = 1$, we get $f(f(f(1))) = 8*1 - 7 = 1$. 

Since $f(1)$ is a positive integer, the only possibility is $f(1) = 1$. 

Then we can substitute $f(1) = 1$ into the equation $f(2^k) = 2^kf(1) + (2^k - 1)$ to get $f(2^k) = 2^k + (2^k - 1) = 2^{k+1} - 1$.

Now we can find $f(100)$. Since $100 = 2^2 * 5^2$, we know that $f(100) = f(2^2 * 5^2) = f(2^4 * 5^2) = f(16 * 25)$.

Since $f(16) = 2^5 - 1 = 31$ and $f(25) = 2^5 - 1 = 31$, we can substitute these values into the equation $f(16 * 25) = f(16) * f(25) = 31 * 31 = 961$.

However, this value does not match with the value given by the equation $f(f(f(n))) = 8n - 7$ when $n = 1$. 

This suggests that our assumption that $f(1) = 1$ was incorrect. Let's try a different approach.

If we substitute $f(2^k) = 2^k + (2^k - 1)$ into the equation $f(f(f(n))) = 8n - 7$, we get:

$f(f(f(n))) = f(f(2^k)) = f(2^{k+1} - 1) = 2^{k+2} - 2 + (2^{k+2} - 2 - 1) = 2^{k+2} - 2 + 2^{k+2} - 3 = 2^{k+3} - 5$.

Comparing this with $8n - 7$, we see that $2^{k+3} - 5 = 8n - 7$. 

This simplifies to $2^{k+3} = 8n + 2$, or $2^{k+3} = 2^{3+log_2(4n+1)}$.

This implies that $k + 3 = 3 + log_2(4n+1)$, or $k = log_2(4n+1)$.

Since $n = 1$, we get $k = log_2(4*1+1) = log_2(5)$.

But $log_2(5)$ is not an integer, which contradicts our assumption that $k$ is an integer.

This suggests that our assumption that the function $f$ has the form $f(2^k) = 2^k + (2^k - 1)$ was incorrect. 

Let's try another approach. 

Since $f(f(f(n))) = 8n - 7$, we can guess that $f(n) = 2n - 1$. 

Then $f(f(f(n))) = f(f(2n - 1)) = f(2(2n - 1) - 1) = f(4n - 3) = 2(4n - 3) - 1 = 8n - 7$. 

This guess satisfies both equations, so $f(n) = 2n - 1$.

Finally, we can calculate $f(100) = 2*100 - 1 = 199$.

So the answer is $\boxed{199}$.

The Python code for calculating $f(100)$ would be:

```python


INTERMEDIATE OUT :

def f(n):
    return 2*n - 1

result = f(100)
print(result)
```

CODE RESULTS 199

INTERMEDIATE OUT :
```output
199
```
The answer is $\boxed{199}$.
