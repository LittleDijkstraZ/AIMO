Interesting, let's analyze step by step:


The equation $ ((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ 
can be true if either $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2) = 0$ or $((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$.
The former is satisfied when $|x + y| = 10$ and $|x - y| = 10$, which is a square with side length 10. The latter is satisfied when $|x| = 8$ and $|y| = 8$, which is a square with side length 8. The intersection of these two squares forms the convex polygon we're interested in.

Now, to calculate the area of the convex polygon, we simply calculate the area of the larger square minus the area of the smaller square. The area of a square is side length squared, so the area of the larger square is $10^2 = 100$ and the area of the smaller square is $8^2 = 64$.

The area of the convex polygon is therefore $100 - 64 = 36$. 

The result is 36, which is a positive integer, so the answer is $\boxed{36}$.

The given equation: $ ((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$

This equation equals zero if any of the two terms equals zero:

1) $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ or $\vert x + y \vert = 10$
2) $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ or $\vert x - y \vert = 10$
3) $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ or $\vert x \vert = 8$
4) $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ or $\vert y \vert = 8$

Each of these absolute value equations represent two planes, which will divide the coordinate plane into four quadrants. The intersection of these planes forms a square with side length 16.

So the area of the convex polygon is the area of the square, which is calculated as side length squared. The side length of the square is 16, so the area is $16^2 = 256$.

Now we have the result, let's put it in the box:
The area of the convex polygon is $\boxed{256}$.
The answer is: $256$

Interesting, let's analyze step by step:



If $A*B = 0$, then $A=0$ or $B=0$. In this problem, $A = ((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)$ and $B = ((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2)$. Thus either $A=0$ or $B=0$.

If $A=0$, then $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$. This implies $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. Solving these two equations, we get $x + y = \pm 10$ and $x - y = \pm 10$. Solving these equations further gives $x = \pm 5$ and $y = \pm 5$. These are the vertices of a square with side length $10$ and area $100$.

If $B=0$, then $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$. This implies $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$. Solving these two equations gives $x = \pm 8$ and $y = \pm 8$. These are the vertices of a square with side length $16$ and area $256$.

The convex polygon is the union of these two squares. So the area of the convex polygon is the sum of the areas of the two squares, $100 + 256 = 356$. The area is a positive integer.

So the area of the convex polygon is $356$.
The answer is: $356$

Interesting, let's analyze step by step:



The given equation is $f(x, y) = ((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$. For this to be true, either one of the factors must be zero. This breaks down into four cases:

Case 1: $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ and $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$.
This happens when $|x + y| = 10$ and $|x| = 8$. We know that $|x + y| = 10$ represents a circle in the coordinate plane with center $(-10, 0)$ and radius $10$, and $|x| = 8$ represents a circle with center $(0, 0)$ and radius $8$. The intersection of these two circles is the set of points that satisfy this case.

Case 2: $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ and $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$.
This happens when $|x + y| = 10$ and $|y| = 8$. The intersection of these two sets of points is a square with vertices at $(-10, 8)$, $(10, 8)$, $(10, -8)$, and $(-10, -8)$.

Case 3: $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ and $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$.
This is analogous to Case 2, and the intersection gives another square with vertices at $(8, 10)$, $(-8, 10)$, $(-8, -10)$, and $(8, -10)$.

Case 4: $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ and $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$.
This is analogous to Case 1, and the intersection gives a square with vertices at $(0, 10)$, $(0, -10)$, $(16, 0)$, and $(-16, 0)$.

The union of all four cases gives the convex polygon enclosed by the points satisfying the given equation. The polygon is the union of four squares, and we can calculate its area as the sum of the areas of these squares.

The side length of each square is $20$, so the area of each square is $(20)^2 = 400$. Since there are four squares, the total area of the polygon is $4 \times 400 = 1600$.

So, the area of the convex polygon is $1600$. To verify that it's a positive integer, we can check that all our calculations are correct. The steps we took were based on the properties of absolute value and the geometry of circles and squares, so the calculations should be sound. Therefore, the area of the convex polygon is $1600$. The answer is: $1600$

Interesting, let's analyze step by step:



The only way the product can be zero is if one of the factors is zero. So, we have two conditions:
1. $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ 
2. $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$
3. $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$
4. $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$

From conditions 1 and 2, we have: $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$.
From conditions 3 and 4, we have: $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$.

The solutions for these absolute value equations can be split into four cases:
1. $x + y = 10$, $x - y = 10$, $x = 8$, $y = 8$
2. $x + y = 10$, $x - y = 10$, $x = -8$, $y = -8$
3. $x + y = -10$, $x - y = 10$, $x = 8$, $y = -8$
4. $x + y = -10$, $x - y = -10$, $x = -8$, $y = 8$

Now we can solve these systems of equations:
1. Adding the first two equations we get $2x = 20$, so $x = 10$. Then $y = 0$. But $x = 8$ and $y = 8$ contradict this solution. So we discard this solution.
2. Adding the first two equations we get $2x = -20$, so $x = -10$. Then $y = 0$. But $x = -8$ and $y = -8$ contradict this solution. So we discard this solution.
3. Adding the first and third equations we get $2x = 0$, so $x = 0$. Then $y = -10$. This solution satisfies all conditions.
4. Adding the second and fourth equations we get $-2y = 0$, so $y = 0$. Then $x = -10$. This solution also satisfies all conditions.

So the four vertices of the polygon are $(-10, 0)$, $(0, -10)$, $(8, -8)$, and $(-8, 8)$.

To find the area of the polygon, we can split it into two congruent right triangles with legs of length 18 and 10. The area of each triangle is $\frac{1}{2} \cdot 18 \cdot 10 = 90$. So the total area of the polygon is $2 \cdot 90 = 180$.

The answer is: $180$.

Interesting, let's analyze step by step:



First, we should recognize that the product of two numbers is zero if and only if at least one of the numbers is zero. Therefore, the equation $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + (\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + (\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ must be true for all points inside the polygon.

For the first equation $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + (\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ to be true, we must have $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. These conditions imply that $x + y = \pm 10$ and $x - y = \pm 10$. Solving these equations gives us the vertices of the polygon: $(8, 2), (8, -2), (-8, 2), (-8, -2)$.

For the second equation $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + (\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ to be true, we must have $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$. This implies that $x = \pm 8$ and $y = \pm 8$. These conditions give us the same vertices as before.

Therefore, the points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying the given equation form a square with side length 16. The area of a square is side length squared, so the area of this square is $16^2 = 256$. The answer is a positive integer, as required. The answer is: $256$

Interesting, let's analyze step by step:



The product of two numbers is zero if and only if at least one of the numbers is zero. Therefore, the expression in the problem equals zero if and only if each factor equals zero. This gives us the following four equations:

1. $\vert x + y \vert - 10 = 0$
2. $\vert x - y \vert - 10 = 0$
3. $\vert x \vert - 8 = 0$
4. $\vert y \vert - 8 = 0$

The solutions to these equations are the points on the perimeter of a square with side length 16, centered at the origin. The square has vertices at $(\pm8, \pm8)$, so its side length is 16. The area of the square is therefore $16^2 = 256$. So the area of the convex polygon is 256.

The final answer is a positive integer: 256. The answer is: $256$

Interesting, let's analyze step by step:



The expression $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ can be satisfied only when both factors are equal to zero. That is:

1. $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0 \Rightarrow \vert x + y \vert = 10$,
2. $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0 \Rightarrow \vert x - y \vert = 10$,
3. $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0 \Rightarrow \vert x \vert = 8$,
4. $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0 \Rightarrow \vert y \vert = 8$.

Solving these equations, we get:

1. $x + y = 10$ or $x + y = -10$,
2. $x - y = 10$ or $x - y = -10$,
3. $x = 8$ or $x = -8$,
4. $y = 8$ or $y = -8$.

By analyzing all combinations of these equations, we find that the points $(x, y)$ that satisfy the equations are:

$(8, 2)$, $(8, -2)$, $(-8, 2)$, $(-8, -2)$, $(2, 8)$, $(2, -8)$, $(-2, 8)$, $(-2, -8)$.

This forms a square with side length $10$, so its area is $10^2 = 100$. Since $100$ is a positive integer, the answer is: $\boxed{100}$.

We have a equation and want to find the area of the polygon it describes. First, we can observe that the only way the left-hand side of the equation can be zero is if both $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ and $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$, and also $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ and $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$.

This implies $\vert x + y \vert = 10$, $\vert x - y \vert = 10$, $\vert x \vert = 8$, and $\vert y \vert = 8$. The solutions to these equations are $x = 8, y = 8$, $x = 8, y = -8$, $x = -8, y = 8$, and $x = -8, y = -8$.

These are the vertices of a square with side length 16, thus the area of the square is $16^2 = 256$.

As we found the area of the polygon, we will now output the result. However, 256 is a positive integer, and it satisfies all the conditions for our problem. Hence the area of the convex polygon is 256. The answer is: $256$.
