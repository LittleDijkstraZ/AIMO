Interesting, let's analyze step by step:



The equation given is $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$.

This equation equals zero if either of the two factors equals zero. Therefore, we have two sets of equations to solve:

1. $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ and $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$.
2. $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ and $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$.

From the first set of equations, we get:

1.1. $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$.
1.2. $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$.

From the second set of equations, we get:

2.1. $\vert x - y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$.
2.2. $\vert x - y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$.

The solutions to these equations are:

1.1. $x + y = \pm 10$ and $x = \pm 8$ and $y = \pm 8$.
1.2. $x + y = \pm 10$ and $x = \pm 8$ and $y = \pm 8$.
2.1. $x - y = \pm 10$ and $x = \pm 8$ and $y = \pm 8$.
2.2. $x - y = \pm 10$ and $x = \pm 8$ and $y = \pm 8$.

These solutions represent the vertices of the polygon. To find the area of the polygon, we can use the shoelace formula. The vertices of the polygon are:

$A = (8, 2)$, $B = (8, -2)$, $C = (-8, -2)$, $D = (-8, 2)$, $E = (2, 8)$, $F = (-2, 8)$, $G = (-2, -8)$, and $H = (2, -8)$.

Using the shoelace formula, the area of the polygon is:

Area = $\frac{1}{2} \vert (8*2 + 2*8 + -2*-8 + -8*2 + 2*-8 + -2*8 + 8*2 + -2*-8) \vert = 128$.

So the area of the polygon is 128 square units. The answer is: $128$

Interesting, let's analyze step by step:



The equation is given as:
\[((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0\]

This equation is equal to zero if either of the two factors is equal to zero. So we have two cases:

1. $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$
2. $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$

For the first case, either $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ or $( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$. This implies that $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. These are the equations of two lines in the plane, so the points that satisfy this case form a square with side length 10 and area $10^2 = 100$.

For the second case, either $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ or $( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$. This implies that $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$. These are the equations of two circles in the plane, so the points that satisfy this case form a square with side length 16 and area $16^2 = 256$.

However, the intersection of the two cases is the square with side length 10, which is the inner square. The outer square has side length 16, so the area of the convex polygon is the area of the outer square minus the area of the inner square, which is $256 - 100 = 156$.

So the area of the convex polygon is 156.
The answer is: $156$

The equation given is $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$.

This equation equals zero if either of the two factors equals zero. Therefore, we have two sets of equations:

1. $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ and $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ and $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ and $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$.

2. $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ and $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ and $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ and $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$.

From the first set of equations, we get:

- $\vert x + y \vert = 10$, which implies $x + y = 10$ or $x + y = -10$.
- $\vert x \vert = 8$, which implies $x = 8$ or $x = -8$.
- $\vert x - y \vert = 10$, which implies $x - y = 10$ or $x - y = -10$.
- $\vert y \vert = 8$, which implies $y = 8$ or $y = -8$.

From the second set of equations, we get:

- $\vert x + y \vert = 10$, which implies $x + y = 10$ or $x + y = -10$.
- $\vert x \vert = 8$, which implies $x = 8$ or $x = -8$.
- $\vert x - y \vert = 10$, which implies $x - y = 10$ or $x - y = -10$.
- $\vert y \vert = 8$, which implies $y = 8$ or $y = -8$.

These equations represent the vertices of the polygon. By analyzing all possible combinations, we find that the polygon is a square with side length 16. The area of a square is given by side length squared, so the area of this square is $16^2 = 256$.

Therefore, the area of the convex polygon is 256.
The answer is: $256$

Interesting, let's analyze step by step:



The expression $A \cdot B = 0$ implies that at least one of the factors is zero. Thus, either $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$.

From $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$, we get $\vert x + y \vert = 10$. This implies $x + y = 10$ or $x + y = -10$.

From $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$, we get $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. This implies $x - y = 10$ or $x - y = -10$.

From $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$, we get $\vert x \vert = 8$. This implies $x = 8$ or $x = -8$.

From $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$, we get $\vert y \vert = 8$. This implies $y = 8$ or $y = -8$.

Now, we need to find the intersection points of these lines and plot them on a coordinate plane. The intersection points are:

$(8, 2)$, $(8, -2)$, $(-8, 2)$, $(-8, -2)$, $(2, 8)$, $(-2, 8)$, $(2, -8)$, $(-2, -8)$.

The convex polygon formed by these points is a square with side length $16$. Therefore, the area of the square is $16^2 = 256$.

The answer is: $256$

Interesting, let's analyze step by step:



The expression $A = ((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2)$ is equal to zero if and only if at least one of the factors is zero. This gives us four conditions:

1. $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$.
2. $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$.

From these conditions, we get the following equations:

1. $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ or $\vert x \vert = 8$.
2. $\vert x - y \vert = 10$ or $\vert y \vert = 8$.

The solutions to these equations are the vertices of the polygon.

To find the area of the polygon, we can use the shoelace formula. The vertices of the polygon are:

1. $(8, 0)$, $(0, 8)$, $(-8, 0)$, $(0, -8)$.
2. $(8, 10)$, $(0, 2)$, $(-8, 10)$, $(0, -10)$.
3. $(10, 8)$, $(2, 0)$, $(10, -8)$, $(-2, 0)$.
4. $(10, 0)$, $(2, -8)$, $(10, 0)$, $(-2, 8)$.

The shoelace formula gives us the area of the polygon as $\frac{1}{2} \vert (8*0 + 0*(-8) + (-8)*0 + 0*8) - (10*8 + 2*(-8) + 10*(-8) + (-2)*8) \vert = 128$.

So the area of the convex polygon is 128 square units. The answer is: $128$

Interesting, let's analyze step by step:



The equation is a product of two terms equal to zero. This means that either the first term is zero or the second term is zero.

The first term is $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)$. This term equals zero if and only if both $\vert x + y \vert - 10 = 0$ and $\vert x - y \vert - 10 = 0$, which means $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. This implies that $x + y = \pm 10$ and $x - y = \pm 10$. Solving these equations, we get the four lines $x + y = 10$, $x + y = -10$, $x - y = 10$, and $x - y = -10$.

The second term is $((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2)$. This term equals zero if and only if both $\vert x \vert - 8 = 0$ and $\vert y \vert - 8 = 0$, which means $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$. This implies that $x = \pm 8$ and $y = \pm 8$. So we get the four lines $x = 8$, $x = -8$, $y = 8$, and $y = -8$.

The intersection of these lines forms a square with side length 10 (the distance between the lines $x + y = 10$ and $x + y = -10$, or $x - y = 10$ and $x - y = -10$). The area of this square is $10^2 = 100$.

So the area of the convex polygon is 100. The answer is: $100$

Interesting, let's analyze step by step:



The equation is a product of two terms equal to zero, so either the first term is zero or the second term is zero. This gives us two systems of equations to solve:

2. $\vert x \vert - 8 = 0$ and $\vert y \vert - 8 = 0$

For the first system, we have $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. This implies that $x + y = \pm 10$ and $x - y = \pm 10$. Solving these equations gives us the vertices of the polygon: $(0, 10)$, $(0, -10)$, $(10, 0)$, and $(-10, 0)$.

For the second system, we have $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$. This implies that $x = \pm 8$ and $y = \pm 8$. Solving these equations gives us the vertices of the polygon: $(8, 8)$, $(8, -8)$, $(-8, 8)$, and $(-8, -8)$.

Now, we can plot these points on a coordinate plane and connect them to form a square with side length 16. The area of this square is $16^2 = 256$.

So, the area of the convex polygon is 256.
