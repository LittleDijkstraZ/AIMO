Below is a math problem you are to solve (positive numerical answer):
"For how many positive integers $m$ does the equation \[\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}\] have $4$ distinct solutions?"

To accomplish this:
- List the variables and known values from the problem.
- Outline the steps using sympy to solve the problem:
  * Identify the sympy functions required for each step.
  * Implement these functions step-by-step, commenting each line for clarity.
- Calculate the final answer and verify it's a positive integer.
- Output the result within \boxed{}.

Interesting, let's analyze step by step:



The equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has 4 distinct solutions. This means that the right side of the equation, $\frac{m}{100}$, must be equal to 2. This is because the absolute value function $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert$ can take on the value of 2 only when it equals $\frac{m}{100}$.

So, we have $\frac{m}{100} = 2$, which implies $m = 200$.

Now, we need to verify that $m = 200$ is a positive integer. It is, so the answer is $\boxed{1}$.

```python


INTERMEDIATE OUT :

def verify_m():
    m = 200
    return m > 0 and m.is_integer()

result = verify_m()
print(result)
```

CODE RESULTS Traceback: line 7, in verify_m
    return m > 0 and m.is_integer()
AttributeError: 'int' object has no attribute 'is_integer'

FAIL


INTERMEDIATE OUT :
```output
Traceback: line 7, in verify_m
    return m > 0 and m.is_integer()
AttributeError: 'int' object has no attribute 'is_integer'

FAIL

```

The `is_integer` method is not available for integers in Python. However, we can manually check that $200$ is a positive integer. It is, so the answer is $\boxed{1}$.

The correct implementation should be:

```python


INTERMEDIATE OUT :

def verify_m():
    m = 200
    return m > 0 and isinstance(m, int)

result = verify_m()
print(result)
```

CODE RESULTS True

INTERMEDIATE OUT :
```output
True
```
The value of $m$ is indeed a positive integer, so the answer is $\boxed{1}$. The value of $m$ is 200.
The answer is: $1$

The equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has 4 distinct solutions. This means that the right side of the equation, $\frac{m}{100}$, must be equal to 2. This is because the absolute value function makes the expression inside the absolute value greater than or equal to 0, and the absolute value of a number equals to 2 has 4 distinct solutions. So we have:

\[\frac{m}{100} = 2 \implies m = 200.\]

Now we need to check if $m = 200$ is a positive integer. It is, so the number of positive integers $m$ for which the equation has 4 distinct solutions is 1.

The answer is: $1$

This is because the absolute value function creates two branches, and the absolute value of a number can be equal to 2 only if the number itself is either 2 or -2. Therefore, we have:

\[\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=2.\]

This equation will have 4 distinct solutions if and only if $\frac{m}{100} = 2$. Solving for $m$ gives us $m = 200$.

Now, we need to verify that $m = 200$ is a positive integer. It is, so the number of positive integers $m$ for which the equation has 4 distinct solutions is 1. The answer is: $1$
