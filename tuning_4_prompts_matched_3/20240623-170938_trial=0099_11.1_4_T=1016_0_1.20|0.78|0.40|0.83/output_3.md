Assistant:


The equation $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + (\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ and $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + (\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ can only be true if $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$. 

This means $x + y = \pm 10$, $x - y = \pm 10$, $x = \pm 8$, and $y = \pm 8$.

There are 16 possible combinations of signs and absolute values that satisfy these equations. However, by plotting these points and connecting them, we find that the resulting shape is a square with side length 16. The area of a square is the side length squared, so the area of the polygon is $16^2 = 256$. The answer is: 256.

The area of the convex polygon is 256.

"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"

The given equation is a product of two expressions equal to zero. This means that either the first expression is zero or the second expression is zero.

The first expression is $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)$. This expression is zero only when both $\vert x + y \vert - 10 = 0$ and $\vert x - y \vert - 10 = 0$, which simplifies to $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. These are the equations of two lines in the coordinate plane. The intersection points of these lines are the vertices of the polygon.

The second expression is $((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2)$. This expression is zero only when both $\vert x \vert - 8 = 0$ and $\vert y \vert - 8 = 0$, which simplifies to $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$. These are the equations of two circles in the coordinate plane with radius 8 centered at the origin. The intersection points of these circles are also the vertices of the polygon.

The vertices of the polygon are the solutions to the system of equations formed by the intersections of the lines and the circles. By solving this system of equations, we find that the vertices of the polygon are the points $(8,8)$, $(-8,8)$, $(-8,-8)$, and $(8,-8)$.

The polygon is a square with side length 16, so its area is $16^2 = 256$. The answer is: 256.

"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"
Analyze this problem and think step by step to come to a solution with programs. After solving the problem, output the final numerical answer within \boxed{}.

 The given equation is satisfied if and only if either $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$.
The first two equations are satisfied if and only if $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ or $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. These are the equations of two lines.
The last two equations are satisfied if and only if $\vert x \vert = 8$ or $\vert y \vert = 8$. These are the equations of two circles.
The intersection of these lines and circles forms a convex polygon. The vertices of this polygon are the points where the lines intersect the circles.
The lines $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$ form a cross shape, and the circles $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$ form a square. The vertices of the polygon are the intersections of these shapes.
The square has side length 16, so its area is $16^2 = 256$. The cross shape has 4 right angles, so it is a rectangle with length 20 and width 8. Its area is $20 \times 8 = 160$. The area of the convex polygon is the sum of the areas of the square and rectangle, which is $256 + 160 = 416$.
So the area of the convex polygon is 416. The answer is: $416$

"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"

The given equation is equal to zero if and only if both $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ and $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ or both $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ and $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$.
From this, we can deduce that $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$.
This implies that the values of $x$ and $y$ must be between -8 and 8.
The points satisfying $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$ form a square with side length 10 and vertices at $(\pm 8, \pm 2)$.
Therefore, the area of the convex polygon is $10^2 = 100$. The answer is: $100$

Below is a math problem you are to solve (positive numerical answer!):
"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"

 The given equation is equivalent to the product of two terms being zero:
\[((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0.\]
This means that either of the two terms must be zero.
For the first term to be zero, we have:
\[\vert x + y \vert - 10 = 0 \quad \text{and} \quad \vert x - y \vert - 10 = 0.\]
This implies that $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$.
The solutions to these equations are the lines $x + y = 10$ and $x - y = 10$.
For the second term to be zero, we have:
\[\vert x \vert - 8 = 0 \quad \text{and} \quad \vert y \vert - 8 = 0.\]
This implies that $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$.
The solutions to these equations are the lines $x = 8$ and $x = -8$, and the lines $y = 8$ and $y = -8$.
These lines enclose a square with side length 16.
The area of this square is $16^2 = 256$. The answer is: 256 The area of the convex polygon is 256 square units.
The answer is: $256$
