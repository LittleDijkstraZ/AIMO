Question (hint: positive numerical answer):
"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"
Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:


The equation $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + (\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + (\vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ implies that at least one of the factors is zero. This means that either $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + (\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + (\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$.

If $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + (\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$, then $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. This means that $x + y = \pm 10$ and $x - y = \pm 10$, which gives us four lines: $x + y = 10$, $x + y = -10$, $x - y = 10$, and $x - y = -10$.

If $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + (\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$, then $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$, which means $x = \pm 8$ and $y = \pm 8$, giving us four lines: $x = 8$, $x = -8$, $y = 8$, and $y = -8$.

The intersection of these lines form a square with side length $20$. Therefore, the area of the convex polygon is $20^2 = 400$. The answer is: $\boxed{400}$

Question (hint: positive numerical answer):
"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"
Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:


The expression equals zero if either of the factors equals zero.
For the first factor to be zero, either $\vert x + y \vert - 10 = 0$ or $\vert x - y \vert - 10 = 0$.
If $\vert x + y \vert - 10 = 0$, then $\vert x + y \vert = 10$, which implies that $x + y = \pm 10$.
If $\vert x - y \vert - 10 = 0$, then $\vert x - y \vert = 10$, which implies that $x - y = \pm 10$.
So, the points satisfying the first factor being zero lie on the lines $x + y = 10$, $x + y = -10$, $x - y = 10$, and $x - y = -10$.
For the second factor to be zero, either $\vert x \vert - 8 = 0$ or $\vert y \vert - 8 = 0$.
If $\vert x \vert - 8 = 0$, then $\vert x \vert = 8$, which implies that $x = \pm 8$.
If $\vert y \vert - 8 = 0$, then $\vert y \vert = 8$, which implies that $y = \pm 8$.
So, the points satisfying the second factor being zero lie on the lines $x = 8$, $x = -8$, $y = 8$, and $y = -8$.
The intersections of these lines form a square with side length 10.
The area of this square is $10^2 = 100$.
The answer is: 100.

Question (hint: positive numerical answer):
"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"
Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:



First, let's look at the equation:
\[((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0.\]

For the product of two numbers to be zero, one of them must be zero. This means that either
\[((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2) = 0\]
or
\[((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0.\]

For the first expression to be zero, we need both $\vert x + y \vert - 10 = 0$ and $\vert x - y \vert - 10 = 0$. This implies $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. Solving these equations gives the lines $x + y = 10$ and $x - y = 10$.

For the second expression to be zero, we need both $\vert x \vert - 8 = 0$ and $\vert y \vert - 8 = 0$. This implies $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$. Solving these equations gives the lines $x = 8$ and $x = -8$, and the lines $y = 8$ and $y = -8$.

These lines enclose a square with side length 16 (since the distance between the lines $x = 8$ and $x = -8$ or the lines $y = 8$ and $y = -8$ is 16). Therefore, the area of the convex polygon is $16^2 = 256$.
The answer is: $256$

"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"
Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:



For the product of two numbers to be zero, either one of them has to be zero. Therefore, we have two cases to consider:

Case 1: $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$. This can only happen if both $(\vert x + y \vert - 10) = 0$ and $(\vert x - y \vert - 10) = 0$, which implies $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. Solving these equations gives $x + y = \pm 10$ and $x - y = \pm 10$. Solving these four equations gives us the vertices of the square: $(0, 10), (0, -10), (10, 0), (-10, 0)$.

Case 2: $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$. This can only happen if both $(\vert x \vert - 8) = 0$ and $(\vert y \vert - 8) = 0$, which implies $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$. Solving these equations gives $x = \pm 8$ and $y = \pm 8$. These four points are also vertices of the square.

So the points satisfying the given equation are the vertices of a square with side length $10$. The area of a square is given by the square of the length of its side, so the area of this square is $10^2 = 100$.
The answer is: $\boxed{100}$.

Question (hint: positive numerical answer):
"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"
Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:


The expression $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2)$ equals to 0 if and only if at least one of the factors equals to 0. Therefore, we have two sets of equations:
1) $\vert x + y \vert - 10 = 0$ and $\vert x - y \vert - 10 = 0$;
2) $\vert x \vert - 8 = 0$ and $\vert y \vert - 8 = 0$.
From the first set of equations we have $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. This implies that the coordinates of the point $(x, y)$ lie on a square with side length of 10 units. The vertices of this square are $(0, 10)$, $(0, -10)$, $(10, 0)$, and $(-10, 0)$.
From the second set of equations we have $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$. This implies that the coordinates of the point $(x, y)$ lie on a square with side length of 16 units. The vertices of this square are $(8, 8)$, $(8, -8)$, $(-8, 8)$, and $(-8, -8)$.
The area of the convex polygon formed by the intersection of these two squares is equal to the area of the smaller square, which is $10^2 = 100$ square units. Therefore, the area of the convex polygon is 100 square units.
The answer is: $100$

Question (hint: positive numerical answer):
"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"
Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:


The expression $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ is equal to zero if and only if either of the two factors is equal to zero.

The first factor is equal to zero if and only if either $\vert x + y \vert - 10 = 0$ or $\vert x - y \vert - 10 = 0$. This implies that $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ or $\vert x - y \vert = 10$.
The second factor is equal to zero if and only if either $\vert x \vert - 8 = 0$ or $\vert y \vert - 8 = 0$, which implies that $\vert x \vert = 8$ or $\vert y \vert = 8$.

So the points satisfying the equation are those that satisfy either $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ or $\vert x - y \vert = 10$ or $\vert x \vert = 8$ or $\vert y \vert = 8$.

The lines $\vert x + y \vert = 10$, $\vert x - y \vert = 10$, $\vert x \vert = 8$, and $\vert y \vert = 8$ form a square with side length 10. The area of this square is $10^2 = 100$. So the area of the convex polygon is $\boxed{100}$.
The answer is: $100$.
