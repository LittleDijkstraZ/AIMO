Question (hint: positive numerical answer):
"For how many positive integers $m$ does the equation \[\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}\] have $4$ distinct solutions?"
Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:


The equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has $4$ distinct solutions, which means that the right side of the equation, $\frac{m}{100}$, must be equal to $2$. This is because the absolute value equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=2$ has $4$ solutions, which are $x=-1, 1, 3, 5$.

Setting $\frac{m}{100}=2$, we can solve for $m$ to get $m=200$. Therefore, there is only $1$ positive integer $m$ that makes the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ have $4$ distinct solutions.
The value of $m$ is $200$. The answer is: $1$

Question (hint: positive numerical answer):
"For how many positive integers $m$ does the equation \[\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}\] have $4$ distinct solutions?"
Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:


The equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has $4$ distinct solutions if and only if $\frac{m}{100} = 2$. This is because the expression inside the absolute value, $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert$, can be $2$ in $4$ different ways, but for it to have $4$ distinct solutions, it must be exactly $2$. Therefore, we set $\frac{m}{100} = 2$ and solve for $m$:
$$m = 2 \times 100 = 200.$$
So, there is only $1$ positive integer $m$ that makes the equation have $4$ distinct solutions, which is $200$.
The value of $m$ is $200$. The answer is: $200$

Question (hint: positive numerical answer):
"For how many positive integers $m$ does the equation \[\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}\] have $4$ distinct solutions?"
Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:



The equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has 4 distinct solutions, we need to find the number of positive integer values of $m$ that make this true.

First, let's consider the absolute value function $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert$. This function is 0 when $\vert x-1 \vert = 2$, which gives us $x = 3$ and $x = -1$. The function is greater than 0 when $\vert x-1 \vert > 2$, which gives us $x > 3$ and $x < -1$. The function is less than 0 when $\vert x-1 \vert < 2$, which gives us $-1 < x < 3$.

So the function $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert$ has the value 2 for $x = -1$ and $x = 3$, it has the value less than 2 for $-1 < x < 3$, and it has the value greater than 2 for $x < -1$ and $x > 3$.

Now, we want $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert = \frac{m}{100}$ to have 4 distinct solutions. This means that the right side $\frac{m}{100}$ must be in the range of 0 to 2. So $0 \leq \frac{m}{100} \leq 2$, which implies $0 \leq m \leq 200$.

The problem asks for the number of positive integer values of $m$ that satisfy this inequality. The positive integers from 1 to 200 inclusive are exactly the positive integers that satisfy this inequality. Therefore, the number of positive integer values of $m$ that make the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ have 4 distinct solutions is 200.
The answer is: 200

Question (hint: positive numerical answer):
"For how many positive integers $m$ does the equation \[\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}\] have $4$ distinct solutions?"
Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:


The equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has $4$ distinct solutions.

First, let's consider the right side of the equation, $\frac{m}{100}$. Since $m$ is a positive integer, $\frac{m}{100}$ is a positive fraction.

The left side of the equation, $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert$, is a modulus function composed of another modulus function. The graph of this function will have a "hump" shape, with the interior of the absolute value function (inside the outer absolute value function) equal to zero at $x=1$. 

The equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ will have four distinct solutions when the height of the "hump" is equal to $\frac{m}{100}$.

Since the "hump" is a distance of $2$ from the point $x=1$, the height of the "hump" is $2$. Therefore, $\frac{m}{100}=2$.

Solving for $m$, we find $m=200$.

So the only positive integer value of $m$ that makes the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ have four distinct solutions is $m=200$. Therefore, the number of positive integers $m$ is $1$. The answer is: $1$

Question (hint: positive numerical answer):
"For how many positive integers $m$ does the equation \[\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}\] have $4$ distinct solutions?"
Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:


The number of distinct solutions to the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ is equal to $4$ if and only if $\frac{m}{100}=1$. This is because the expression inside the absolute value on the left-hand side, $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert$, can take on exactly three distinct values: $1, 0,$ and $-1$. 

If $\frac{m}{100}=1$, then $m=100$.

So, the number of positive integers $m$ for which the equation has $4$ distinct solutions is $1$. The answer is: $1$

Question (hint: positive numerical answer):
"For how many positive integers $m$ does the equation \[\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}\] have $4$ distinct solutions?"
Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:


The equation $| |x - 1| - 2| = \frac{m}{100}$ has 4 distinct solutions.
Consider the equation $|x - 1| - 2 = \pm \frac{m}{100}$.
Let's first consider the case $|x - 1| - 2 = \frac{m}{100}$.
Rearranging the equation gives $|x - 1| = 2 + \frac{m}{100}$.
This means that $x - 1 = 2 + \frac{m}{100}$ or $x - 1 = -2 - \frac{m}{100}$.
Solving the first equation gives $x = 3 + \frac{m}{100}$, and solving the second equation gives $x = -1 - \frac{m}{100}$.
For these to be distinct solutions, we need $3 + \frac{m}{100} \neq -1 - \frac{m}{100}$.
Simplifying gives $4 = \frac{2m}{100}$, or $m = 200$.
Now let's consider the case $|x - 1| - 2 = - \frac{m}{100}$.
Rearranging the equation gives $|x - 1| = 2 - \frac{m}{100}$.
This means that $x - 1 = 2 - \frac{m}{100}$ or $x - 1 = -2 + \frac{m}{100}$.
Solving the first equation gives $x = 3 - \frac{m}{100}$, and solving the second equation gives $x = -1 + \frac{m}{100}$.
For these to be distinct solutions, we need $3 - \frac{m}{100} \neq -1 + \frac{m}{100}$.
Simplifying gives $4 = \frac{2m}{100}$, or $m = 200$.
So in both cases, we have $m = 200$.
Therefore, there is only 1 positive integer $m$ for which the equation has 4 distinct solutions, and that integer is 200. The answer is: $1$
