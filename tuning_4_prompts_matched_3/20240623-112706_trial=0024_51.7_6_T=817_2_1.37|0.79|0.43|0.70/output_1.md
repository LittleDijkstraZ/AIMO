Question (hint: positive numerical answer):
"What is the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ when $x$ and $y$ range over all real numbers such that $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$?"
Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:


First, we note that the expression $|x-2y| + |y-2x|$ is equal to $|x-2y| + |2y-x| = |x-2y| + |-1(x-2y)| = |x-2y| + |-1| \cdot |x-2y| = 2|x-2y|$.
So we have $2|x-2y| = 40$, which implies $|x-2y| = 20$.
The absolute value equation $|x-2y| = 20$ can be split into two cases:
1) $x - 2y = 20$ or
2) $x - 2y = -20$.
For case 1, solving for $y$ in terms of $x$ gives $y = \frac{x - 20}{2}$.
Substituting this into the expression $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ gives
\[5x^2 + 5\left(\frac{x-20}{2}\right)^2 - 8x\left(\frac{x-20}{2}\right) = 5x^2 + \frac{5(x^2 - 40x + 400)}{4} - 4x^2 + 40x = \frac{5x^2 + 5x^2 - 200x + 2000 - 16x^2 + 160x}{4} = \frac{-x^2 - 40x + 2000}{4}.\]
Let $f(x) = \frac{-x^2 - 40x + 2000}{4}$. To find the minimum value of $f(x)$, we can take the derivative and set it equal to zero:
\[f'(x) = \frac{-2x - 40}{4} = 0 \implies -2x - 40 = 0 \implies x = -20.\]
Substituting $x = -20$ into $y = \frac{x - 20}{2}$ gives $y = 0$.
So when $x = -20$ and $y = 0$, we have
\[5x^2 + 5y^2 - 8xy = 5(-20)^2 + 5(0)^2 - 8(-20)(0) = 2000.\]
For case 2, solving for $y$ in terms of $x$ gives $y = \frac{x + 20}{2}$.
Substituting this into the expression $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ gives
\[5x^2 + 5\left(\frac{x+20}{2}\right)^2 - 8x\left(\frac{x+20}{2}\right) = 5x^2 + \frac{5(x^2 + 40x + 400)}{4} - 4x^2 - 40x = \frac{5x^2 + 5x^2 + 200x + 2000 - 16x^2 - 160x}{4} = \frac{-x^2 + 80x + 2000}{4}.\]
Let $g(x) = \frac{-x^2 + 80x + 2000}{4}$. To find the minimum value of $g(x)$, we can take the derivative and set it equal to zero:
\[g'(x) = \frac{-2x + 80}{4} = 0 \implies -2x + 80 = 0 \implies x = 40.\]
Substituting $x = 40$ into $y = \frac{x + 20}{2}$ gives $y = 30$.
So when $x = 40$ and $y = 30$, we have
\[5x^2 + 5y^2 - 8xy = 5(40)^2 + 5(30)^2 - 8(40)(30) = 8000 + 4500 - 9600 = 2900.\]
Comparing the two minimum values, $2000$ and $2900$, we see that the smaller value is $2000$. Therefore, the minimum value of the expression $5x^2 + 5y^2 - 8xy$ is $2000$. The answer is: $2000$.

Question (hint: positive numerical answer):
"What is the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ when $x$ and $y$ range over all real numbers such that $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$?"
Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:


We know that $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$.
By the triangle inequality, $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = |x-2y + (y-2x)| = | - x + 2y + y - 2x | = |-3x + 3y| = 3|x-y| = 40$.
So $|x-y| = \frac{40}{3}$.
Now let's consider the expression $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$. We can rewrite it as $5(x^2+y^2) - 8xy$.
Using the identity $(x-y)^2 = x^2 + y^2 - 2xy$, we have $x^2 + y^2 - 2xy = (x-y)^2 = \left(\frac{40}{3}\right)^2 = \frac{1600}{9}$.
Multiplying both sides by 5, we get $5(x^2 + y^2) - 10xy = 5\left(\frac{1600}{9}\right)$.
Now we can rewrite the expression $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ as $5(x^2+y^2) - 8xy = 5\left(\frac{1600}{9}\right) + 2xy$.
Since we want to minimize this expression, we want to minimize $2xy$.
By AM-GM, we have $2xy \ge - \left(\frac{x^2+y^2}{2}\right)$, so $5(x^2+y^2) - 8xy \ge 5\left(\frac{1600}{9}\right) - \left(\frac{x^2+y^2}{2}\right)$.
By substituting $x^2 + y^2 - 2xy = \frac{1600}{9}$, we get $5(x^2+y^2) - 8xy \ge 5\left(\frac{1600}{9}\right) - \frac{1}{2}\left(\frac{1600}{9}\right) = \frac{7200}{9} - \frac{800}{9} = \frac{6400}{9}$.
Therefore, the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ is $\frac{6400}{9}$.
The answer is: $\frac{6400}{9}$

Question (hint: positive numerical answer):
"What is the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ when $x$ and $y$ range over all real numbers such that $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$?"
Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:


First, let's simplify the expression $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$. We can rewrite it as $5(x^2+y^2)-8xy$. Now, we can use the identity $x^2+y^2=(x-y)^2+2xy$ to rewrite the expression further as $5((x-y)^2+2xy)-8xy = 5(x-y)^2+3xy$.
Now, let's consider the constraint $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$. By the triangle inequality, we have $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = |(x-2y) - (y-2x)| = |x-2y-y+2x| = |3x-3y| = 3|x-y| = 40$, so $|x-y| = \frac{40}{3}$.
Now, let's substitute $x-y = \frac{40}{3}$ into the expression $5(x-y)^2+3xy$ to get $5\left(\frac{40}{3}\right)^2+3xy = \frac{8000}{9}+3xy$.
Now, we want to minimize this expression. By the Trivial Inequality, we know that for any real numbers $a$ and $b$, $ab \geq \frac{(a+b)^2}{4}$. Applying this inequality to $ab = xy$, with $a+b = x-y = \frac{40}{3}$, we get $xy \geq \left(\frac{40}{3}\cdot \frac{1}{2}\right)^2 = \frac{400}{9}$.
Therefore, the minimum value of $5(x-y)^2+3xy$ is $\frac{8000}{9} + 3\cdot \frac{400}{9} = \frac{8000+1200}{9} = \frac{9200}{9}$.
However, this value is not an integer. We must have made a mistake somewhere.
Let's go back and check our work.
We made a mistake in our use of the Trivial Inequality. The correct version of the Trivial Inequality for this problem is $ab \geq -\frac{(a-b)^2}{4}$.
Let's apply this inequality to $ab = xy$, with $a-b = x-y = \frac{40}{3}$. We get $xy \geq -\left(\frac{40}{3}\cdot \frac{1}{2}\right)^2 = -\frac{400}{9}$.
But this inequality doesn't make sense, as $xy$ cannot be less than zero.
Let's try another approach.
Consider the expression $5(x-y)^2+3xy$. We can rewrite it as $5(x^2-2xy+y^2)+3xy = 5x^2-8xy+5y^2$.
This is a quadratic in $xy$. Completing the square, we get $5(x^2-2xy+y^2)+3xy = 5(x^2-2xy+y^2) + 3(xy-\frac{25}{3}) + \frac{25}{3} = 5(x-y)^2+3(xy-\frac{25}{3}) + \frac{25}{3}$.
The minimum value of this expression occurs when $xy = \frac{25}{3}$. This can be achieved when $x=2$ and $y=1$, or when $x=1$ and $y=2$.
Substituting $xy = \frac{25}{3}$ into the expression $5(x-y)^2+3xy$, we get $5\left(\frac{40}{3}\right)^2+3\cdot \frac{25}{3} = \frac{8000}{9} + \frac{75}{3} = \frac{8000+225}{9} = \frac{8225}{9}$.
But this value doesn't match our previous result.

Question (hint: positive numerical answer):
"What is the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ when $x$ and $y$ range over all real numbers such that $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$?"
Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:


The expression we want to minimize is $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$. Notice that we can rewrite it as a perfect square:
\[5x^2+5y^2-8xy = \left( \sqrt{5}x - \sqrt{5}y \right)^2.\]

The equation $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$ can be rewritten as $|x-2y| + |2y-x| = 40$.
Since the absolute values of two expressions are equal to each other, the expressions themselves must be equal or opposite:
\[x-2y = 2y-x \quad \text{or} \quad x-2y = -(2y-x).\]
Solving the first equation gives $x=y$, and solving the second equation gives $x=3y$.

Substituting $x=y$ into the expression $\left( \sqrt{5}x - \sqrt{5}y \right)^2$ gives $0$.

Substituting $x=3y$ into the expression $\left( \sqrt{5}x - \sqrt{5}y \right)^2$ gives:
\[\left( \sqrt{5}(3y) - \sqrt{5}y \right)^2 = \left( 2\sqrt{5}y \right)^2 = 20y^2.\]

The equation $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$ also implies that $|x-2y|$ and $|y-2x|$ are both equal to $20$, which means $|x-2y| = 20$ or $|y-2x| = 20$.
Without loss of generality, assume $|x-2y| = 20$, so $|x-2y| = 20 \Rightarrow x-2y = \pm 20$.
If $x-2y = 20$, then $y = 0$ and $x=20$. If $x-2y = -20$, then $y = -10$ and $x=-10$.
Checking these values in the equation $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$, we see that they both satisfy the equation.

Substituting $x=20$ and $y=0$ into $20y^2$ gives $0$.
Substituting $x=-10$ and $y=-10$ into $20y^2$ gives $200$.

Therefore, the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ is $0$. The answer is: $0$

Question (hint: positive numerical answer):
"What is the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ when $x$ and $y$ range over all real numbers such that $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$?"
Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:


First, let's rewrite the given equation $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$ in a more convenient form.
By the absolute value definition, $|a| = \sqrt{a^2}$, we can rewrite the equation as $\sqrt{(x-2y)^2} + \sqrt{(y-2x)^2} = 40$.
Expanding and simplifying, we get $(x-2y)^2 + (y-2x)^2 = 1600$.
This simplifies to $x^2 - 4xy + 4y^2 + y^2 - 4xy + 4x^2 = 1600$,
which further simplifies to $5x^2 + 5y^2 - 8xy = 1600$.
Now, we want to minimize the value of $5x^2 + 5y^2 - 8xy$ under the condition that $x$ and $y$ satisfy $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$.
From the above derivation, we see that the value of the expression $5x^2 + 5y^2 - 8xy$ is equal to 1600 when $x$ and $y$ satisfy $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$.
Therefore, the minimum value of $5x^2 + 5y^2 - 8xy$ is 1600. The answer is: $1600$

Question (hint: positive numerical answer):
"What is the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ when $x$ and $y$ range over all real numbers such that $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$?"
Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:


First, let's rewrite the equation $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$ as $|2y-x| + |2x-y| = 40$.
Using the property $|a-b| = |b-a|$, we can further simplify this to $|2y-x| + |x-2y| = 40$.
This equation can be split into two cases:
Case 1: $2y-x \ge 0$ and $x-2y \ge 0$. In this case, the equation becomes $2y-x + x-2y = 40$, which simplifies to $0 = 40$, a contradiction.
Case 2: $2y-x < 0$ and $x-2y > 0$. In this case, the equation becomes $-(2y-x) + (x-2y) = 40$, which simplifies to $0 = 40$, another contradiction.
Case 3: $2y-x \ge 0$ and $x-2y < 0$. In this case, the equation becomes $2y-x - (x-2y) = 40$, which simplifies to $0 = 40$, yet again a contradiction.
Case 4: $2y-x < 0$ and $x-2y \ge 0$. In this case, the equation becomes $-(2y-x) + (x-2y) = 40$, which simplifies to $0 = 40$. This is also a contradiction.
However, we notice that $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = |x-2y| + |2x-y| = 40$ implies that $|2x-y| = |y-2x|$, which means that $2x-y = y-2x$ or $2x-y = -(y-2x)$.
Solving the equation $2x-y = y-2x$ gives us $4x = 2y$, or $y = 2x$.
Substituting $y = 2x$ into $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$ gives us $|x-4x| + |2x-x| = 40$, which simplifies to $|-3x| + |x| = 40$, or $3|x| + |x| = 40$.
This gives us $4|x| = 40$, so $|x| = 10$, which means $x = \pm 10$.
Since $y = 2x$, we have $y = \pm 20$.
Now, we can substitute $x = 10$ and $y = 20$ into the expression $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ to get $5(10)^2 + 5(20)^2 - 8(10)(20) = 500 + 2000 - 1600 = 1900$.
And we can also substitute $x = -10$ and $y = -20$ into the expression to get $5(-10)^2 + 5(-20)^2 - 8(-10)(-20) = 500 + 2000 - 1600 = 1900$.
Therefore, the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ when $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$ is $1900$.
The answer is: $1900$

Question (hint: positive numerical answer):
"What is the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ when $x$ and $y$ range over all real numbers such that $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$?"
Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:


Let's solve the problem step by step.

Step 1: Simplify the expression
The given expression is $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$. We can rewrite this as $(5x^2-8xy+5y^2)$.

Step 2: Recognize the expression as a perfect square trinomial
Now, we recognize that $(5x^2-8xy+5y^2)$ is a perfect square trinomial in the form $(a-b)^2 = a^2 - 2ab + b^2$. Comparing this with $5x^2-8xy+5y^2$, we can see that $a=x\sqrt{5}$ and $b=y\sqrt{5}$. So, $(5x^2-8xy+5y^2) = (x\sqrt{5} - y\sqrt{5})^2$.

Step 3: Calculate the value of the perfect square trinomial
The minimum value of a square of a real number is 0, which happens when the real number is 0. Therefore, the minimum value of $(x\sqrt{5} - y\sqrt{5})^2$ is 0, which happens when $x\sqrt{5} = y\sqrt{5}$, or $x=y$.

Step 4: Solve the constraint equation
The constraint equation is $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$. When $x=y$, this simplifies to $|x-2x| + |x-2x| = 40$, or $| -x | + | -x | = 40$, which simplifies to $2|x| = 40$. Solving for $x$, we get $|x| = 20$, so $x = \pm 20$. But since $x=y$, we have $x=y=\pm 20$.

Step 5: Substitute the value of $x$ into the expression
When $x=y=20$, the value of the expression $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ is $5(20)^2 + 5(20)^2 - 8(20)(20) = 2000$.
When $x=y=-20$, the value of the expression is also $2000$.

So, the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ is 2000.
The answer is: $2000$.

Question (hint: positive numerical answer):
"What is the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ when $x$ and $y$ range over all real numbers such that $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$?"
Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:


First, let's consider the condition $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$.
Without loss of generality, we can assume that $x-2y \geq 0$ and $y-2x \geq 0$,
which gives us $x-2y + y-2x = 40$. Simplifying this equation gives us $y=x$.

Now, substitute $y=x$ into the expression $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$,
we get $5x^2+5x^2-8x^2 = 2x^2$.

To find the minimum value of $2x^2$, we know that the minimum value of $x^2$ is $0$ (when $x=0$),
so the minimum value of $2x^2$ is $2*0 = 0$.

Therefore, the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ when $x$ and $y$ range over all real numbers such that $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$ is $0$. The answer is: $0$
