Solve the following problem with a Python Script (positive numerical answer):
"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"
Write comments to indicate the steps you take. Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Approach:


The equation given is a product of two expressions equal to zero, which means that either the first expression is zero or the second expression is zero. So we have two cases to consider:

1. $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$
2. $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$

For the first case, the only way for a sum of squares to be zero is if each term is zero. This gives us:
$\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$.
The solution to these equations gives us the vertices of a square with side length 10.

For the second case, the only way for a sum of squares to be zero is if each term is zero. This gives us:
$\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$.
The solution to these equations gives us the vertices of a square with side length 8.

The area of the convex polygon formed by the intersection of the two squares is the area of the smaller square.

The area of a square is given by the square of the side length, so the area of the smaller square is $8^2 = 64$.
The answer is: $64$.

Solve the following problem with a Python Script (positive numerical answer):
"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"

Approach:

 The equation $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ implies that either $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$.
If $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$, then both $\vert x + y \vert - 10 = 0$ and $\vert x - y \vert - 10 = 0$, which means $x + y = 10$ and $x - y = 10$ or $x + y = 10$ and $x - y = -10$.
The first pair of equations leads to $x = y = 5$, and the second pair leads to $x = 0$ and $y = 15$ or $x = 10$ and $y = -5$.
If $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$, then both $\vert x \vert - 8 = 0$ and $\vert y \vert - 8 = 0$, which means $x = \pm 8$ and $y = \pm 8$.
The eight points that satisfy the equation are $(5, 5)$, $(0, 15)$, $(10, -5)$, $(8, 8)$, $(-8, 8)$, $(8, -8)$, $(-8, -8)$, and $(0, -15)$.
These points form a square with side length 10, so the area of the square is $10^2 = 100$. The answer is: $100$

Solve the following problem with a Python Script (positive numerical answer):
"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"
Write comments to indicate the steps you take. Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Assistant:

Approach:


The given equation is $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$. According to the zero-product rule, this equation will be zero if either of the two factors is zero. This means we have two separate sets of equations to solve:

1. $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ and $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$.
2. $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ and $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$.

For each set, we solve the equations:

1. $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x \vert = 8$. This gives us four lines: $x + y = 10$, $x + y = -10$, $x = 8$, and $x = -8$.
2. $\vert x - y \vert = 10$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$. This gives us four more lines: $x - y = 10$, $x - y = -10$, $y = 8$, and $y = -8$.

The intersection points of these lines are the vertices of the polygon: $(8, 2)$, $(8, -2)$, $(-8, 2)$, $(-8, -2)$, $(2, 8)$, $(-2, 8)$, $(2, -8)$, and $(-2, -8)$.

The polygon formed by these vertices is a square with side length 8. The area of a square is the square of its side length, so the area of the polygon is $8^2 = 64$.
The answer is: $64$

Solve the following problem with a Python Script (positive numerical answer):
"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"

Assistant:

Approach:

 The equation given is a product of two expressions equal to zero, so one of the expressions must be zero. This gives us two cases to consider:

1. $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$
2. $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$

For the first case, both $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2$ and $( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2$ must be zero. This implies that $|x + y| = 10$ and $|x - y| = 10$. This forms a square with side length 10, the vertices of which are $(0, 10)$, $(0, -10)$, $(10, 0)$, and $(-10, 0)$.

For the second case, both $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2$ and $( \vert y \vert - 8)^2$ must be zero. This implies that $|x| = 8$ and $|y| = 8$. This forms a square with side length 16, the vertices of which are $(8, 8)$, $(8, -8)$, $(-8, 8)$, and $(-8, -8)$.

The intersection of these two squares is a square with side length 8. The area of this square is $8^2 = 64$. Therefore, the area of the convex polygon formed by the points satisfying the given equation is 64.

The answer is: $64$.

Solve the following problem with a Python Script (positive numerical answer):
"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"

Approach:


The equation $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ implies that either $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$.

If $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$, then $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$, which implies that $x + y = \pm 10$ and $x - y = \pm 10$. Solving these equations gives us the vertices of the square: $(0, 10)$, $(0, -10)$, $(10, 0)$, and $(-10, 0)$.

If $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$, then $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$, which implies that $x = \pm 8$ and $y = \pm 8$. Solving these equations gives us the vertices of the square: $(8, 0)$, $(-8, 0)$, $(0, 8)$, and $(0, -8)$.

Therefore, the points satisfying the equation enclose a square with side length 10. The area of a square is given by the square of the length of its side, so the area of this square is $10^2 = 100$. The answer is: $100$

"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"

Approach:

 The given equation is of the form $A \cdot B = 0$, which means that either $A = 0$ or $B = 0$. This translates to either $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$.

For the first equation to be $0$, both $\vert x + y \vert - 10 = 0$ and $\vert x - y \vert - 10 = 0$, which simplifies to $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. This forms a square with side length 10, and its area is $10^2 = 100$.

For the second equation to be $0$, both $\vert x \vert - 8 = 0$ and $\vert y \vert - 8 = 0$, which simplifies to $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$. This forms a square with side length 8, and its area is $8^2 = 64$.

The area of the convex polygon formed by the points satisfying the given equation is the sum of the areas of the two squares, which is $100 + 64 = 164$.

Therefore, the area of the convex polygon is $164$. The answer is: $164$

Solve the following problem with a Python Script (positive numerical answer):
"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"

Approach:


The equation is of the form $A \cdot B = 0$, which implies that either $A=0$ or $B=0$. This gives us two separate cases to consider:
1. $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$
2. $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$
For the first case, the only way the equation can be zero is if both terms inside the absolute value are zero. This gives us two equations:
- $x + y = 10$
- $x - y = 10$
Solving these two equations simultaneously, we find that $x = 10$ and $y = 0$.
For the second case, the only way the equation can be zero is if both terms inside the absolute value are zero. This gives us two equations:
- $x = 8$
- $y = 8$
Thus, the points satisfying the original equation are (10, 0) and (8, 8). These two points form a line segment, which is a polygon with area 0. However, we are asked for the area of a convex polygon. In this case, we can consider the convex hull of these two points. The convex hull is a rectangle with vertices at (10, 0), (10, 8), (8, 8), and (8, 0). The area of this rectangle is $(10-8) \times (8-0) = 2 \times 8 = 16$. Therefore, the area of the convex polygon is 16 square units.

The answer is: $16$

Write comments to indicate the steps you take. Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Assistant:

Approach:

 The given equation is zero if either of the terms inside the products is zero. That is, we have two conditions:
1. $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$
2. $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$
From the first condition, we have $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$.
This implies that $x + y = \pm 10$ and $x - y = \pm 10$.
Solving these equations, we find that the points $(x, y)$ that satisfy the first condition are $(5, 5)$, $(-5, -5)$, $(5, -5)$, and $(-5, 5)$.
From the second condition, we have $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$.
This implies that $x = \pm 8$ and $y = \pm 8$.
Solving these equations, we find that the points $(x, y)$ that satisfy the second condition are $(8, 8)$, $(-8, -8)$, $(8, -8)$, and $(-8, 8)$.
The points that satisfy both conditions are the intersection points of the points that satisfy each condition.
By plotting these points, we find that they form a square with side length $10$.
The area of this square is $10^2 = 100$.
So, the area of the convex polygon is $100$.
The answer is: $\boxed{100}$

Solve the following problem with a Python Script (positive numerical answer):
"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"
Write comments to indicate the steps you take. Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Assistant:

Approach:


The equation given in the problem is a product of two expressions equaling zero, so either the first expression is zero or the second expression is zero. This gives us two sets of equations to solve:

1. $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ and $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$.
2. $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ and $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$.

Solving the first set of equations gives us $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x \vert = 8$. The solutions for these equations are:

- For $\vert x + y \vert = 10$: $x + y = 10$ or $x + y = -10$.
- For $\vert x \vert = 8$: $x = 8$ or $x = -8$.

Similarly, solving the second set of equations gives us $\vert x - y \vert = 10$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$. The solutions for these equations are:

- For $\vert x - y \vert = 10$: $x - y = 10$ or $x - y = -10$.
- For $\vert y \vert = 8$: $y = 8$ or $y = -8$.

Now we can find the intersections of these lines to get the vertices of the polygon:

- Intersection of $x + y = 10$ and $x = 8$: $(8, 2)$.
- Intersection of $x + y = 10$ and $y = 8$: $(2, 8)$.
- Intersection of $x + y = 10$ and $x = -8$: $(-8, 18)$.
- Intersection of $x + y = 10$ and $y = -8$: $(-18, 8)$.
- Intersection of $x - y = 10$ and $x = 8$: $(8, -2)$.
- Intersection of $x - y = 10$ and $y = 8$: $(18, 8)$.
- Intersection of $x - y = 10$ and $x = -8$: $(-8, -18)$.
- Intersection of $x - y = 10$ and $y = -8$: $(-18, -8)$.

Now we can calculate the side lengths of the polygon and use the formula for the area of a polygon with given vertices:

- Side length 1: Distance between $(8, 2)$ and $(2, 8)$: $\sqrt{(8 - 2)^2 + (2 - 8)^2} = \sqrt{36 + 36} = \sqrt{72} = 6\sqrt{2}$.
- Side length 2: Distance between $(2, 8)$ and $(-18, 8)$: $20$.
- Side length 3: Distance between $(-18, 8)$ and $(-18, -8)$: $16$.
- Side length 4: Distance between $(-18, -8)$ and $(8, -2)$: $\sqrt{(-18 - 8)^2 + (-8 + 2)^2} = \sqrt{484 + 36} = \sqrt{520} = 2\sqrt{130}$.
- Side length 5: Distance between $(8, -2)$ and $(8, 2)$: $4$.

Now we can use the formula for the area of a polygon given its side lengths:

Area = $\frac{1}{2} \times \text{base} \times \text{height}$

For side lengths 1 and 2:
- Base: $6\sqrt{2}$
- Height: $20$
- Area: $\frac{1}{2} \times 6\sqrt{2} \times 20 = 60\sqrt{2}$.

For side lengths 3 and 4:
- Base: $16$
- Height: $16$
- Area: $\frac{1}{2} \times 16 \times 16 = 128$.

Now we add the areas of these two triangles to get the total area of the polygon:

Area = $60\sqrt{2} + 128 = 128 + 84.85 = 212.85$.

However, this is not the correct solution. The calculation seems to have gone wrong. The actual area of the polygon is $128$. Let's revisit the calculations.

The area of the polygon is a square with side length 16, so the area is $16 \times 16 = 256$. However, this value seems to be incorrect. The calculation of the side lengths seems to have gone wrong. Let's revisit the calculations.

The area of the polygon is a square with side length 16, so the area is $16 \times 16 = 256$. However, this value seems to be incorrect. The calculation of the side lengths seems to have gone wrong. Let's revisit the calculations.

After reviewing the calculations, we realize that the side lengths of the polygon are not being calculated correctly. The side lengths should be as follows:

- Side length 1: Distance between $(8, 2)$ and $(2, 8)$: $\sqrt{(8 - 2)^2 + (2 - 8)^2} = \sqrt{36 + 36} = \sqrt{72} = 6\sqrt{2}$.
- Side length 2: Distance between $(2, 8)$ and $(-18, 8)$: $20$.
- Side length 3: Distance between $(-18, 8)$ and $(-18, -8)$: $16$.
- Side length 4: Distance between $(-18, -8)$ and $(8, -2)$: $\sqrt{(-18 - 8)^2 + (-8 + 2)^2} = \sqrt{484 + 36} = \sqrt{520} = 2\sqrt{130}$.
- Side length 5: Distance between $(8, -2)$ and $(8, 2)$: $4$.

However, the side lengths do not match up with the given conditions. Let's reevaluate the equations:

The equations $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ and $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ give us $x + y = \pm 10$ and $x = \pm 8$. The equations $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ and $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ give us $x - y = \pm 10$ and $y = \pm 8$.

Solving these equations, we find the vertices of the polygon:

- For $x + y = 10$ and $

Solve the following problem with a Python Script (positive numerical answer):
"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"
Write comments to indicate the steps you take. Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Assistant:

Approach:


The expression $A \cdot B = 0$ is equivalent to either $A = 0$ or $B = 0$. Therefore, the given equation is satisfied if either $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$.

The equation $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ implies that $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. This results in a square with side length 10, which has a diagonal of length $10\sqrt{2}$. So the side length of the square is $10/\sqrt{2} = 5\sqrt{2}$.

The equation $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ implies that $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$, which results in a square with side length 8.

Therefore, the points that satisfy the given equation enclose a polygon that is the union of two squares: one with side length $5\sqrt{2}$ and the other with side length 8.

The area of a square with side length $s$ is $s^2$. So the area of the square with side length $5\sqrt{2}$ is $(5\sqrt{2})^2 = 50$, and the area of the square with side length 8 is $8^2 = 64$.

Therefore, the total area of the convex polygon is $50 + 64 = 114$.

The answer is: $114$.

Solve the following problem with a Python Script (positive numerical answer):
"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"

Approach:



The equation $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + (\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + (\vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ is true if and only if at least one of the two factors is zero. This means that either $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + (\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2) = 0$ or $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + (\vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$.

If $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + (\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2) = 0$, then $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. This implies that $x + y = \pm 10$ and $x - y = \pm 10$, which gives us the lines $x + y = 10$, $x + y = -10$, $x - y = 10$, and $x - y = -10$.

If $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + (\vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$, then $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$, which implies that $x = \pm 8$ and $y = \pm 8$. This gives us the lines $x = 8$, $x = -8$, $y = 8$, and $y = -8$.

The intersection of these lines forms a square with side length 10. The area of this square is $10^2 = 100$. Therefore, the area of the convex polygon is $100$. The answer is: $100$
