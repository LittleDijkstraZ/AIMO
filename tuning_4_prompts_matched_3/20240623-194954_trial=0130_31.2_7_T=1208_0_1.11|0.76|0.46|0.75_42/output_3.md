Below is a math problem you are to solve (positive numerical answer!):
"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"
Analyze this problem and think step by step to come to a solution with programs. After solving the problem, output the final numerical answer within \boxed{}.

Assistant:


The given equation is a product of two terms, and for the product to be zero, one or both of the terms must be zero. This gives us four cases to consider:

1. $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ and $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$.
2. $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ and $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$.
3. $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ and $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$.
4. $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ and $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$.

For each case, we can set each term equal to zero and solve for $x$ and $y$. This will give us the vertices of the polygon. Once we have the vertices, we can calculate the area of the polygon.

Let's start with the first case:

1. $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ gives $\vert x + y \vert = 10$, so $x + y = 10$ or $x + y = -10$.
2. $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ gives $\vert x \vert = 8$, so $x = 8$ or $x = -8$.

By considering all combinations of the above equations, we find the vertices of the polygon:

$(8, 2), (8, -18), (-8, 18), (-8, -2)$.

Similarly, we can find the vertices for the other three cases:

2. $(8, 2), (8, -18), (18, 8), (-18, -8)$.
3. $(-2, 8), (18, 8), (-18, -8), (-2, -8)$.
4. $(8, 2), (-18, 8), (-2, -8), (18, -8)$.

All four cases give the same set of vertices: $(8, 2), (8, -18), (18, 8), (-18, -8), (-2, 8), (-2, -8), (18, -8), (-18, 8)$.

The polygon is a square with side length 16. The area of the square is $16^2 = 256$.

So, the area of the convex polygon is 256 square units. The answer is: $256$

Below is a math problem you are to solve (positive numerical answer!):
"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"

The expression $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ is equal to zero if and only if at least one of the factors is equal to zero. This means that either $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$.

For the first factor to be zero, we must have $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. These conditions describe a square with side length 10, centered at the origin, with vertices at $(\pm 10, 0)$ and $(0, \pm 10)$.

For the second factor to be zero, we must have $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$. These conditions describe a square with side length 16, centered at the origin, with vertices at $(\pm 8, 0)$ and $(0, \pm 8)$.

The intersection of these two squares is the convex polygon we are looking for. This polygon is a square with side length 10 (the smaller square), and its area is $10^2 = 100$.

Therefore, the area of the convex polygon is 100. The answer is: $100$

Below is a math problem you are to solve (positive numerical answer!):
"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"

 The given equation is equal to zero if and only if both factors are equal to zero. So we have two cases to consider:

1. $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ and $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ and $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$.
2. $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ and $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ and $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$.

For the first case, we have $\vert x + y \vert = 10$, $\vert x \vert = 8$, and $\vert y \vert = 8$. This implies that $-8 \leq x, y \leq 8$. For the second case, we have $\vert x - y \vert = 10$, $\vert x \vert = 8$, and $\vert y \vert = 8$. This implies that $x + y = \pm 10$ or $x - y = \pm 10$.

The points that satisfy these conditions form a square with side length 16. Therefore, the area of the convex polygon is $16^2 = 256$. The answer is: $256$

Assistant:

 The given equation is equal to zero if and only if both of the factors are equal to zero. This means we have two separate cases to consider:

1. $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$. This is possible only if $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. Solving these two equations, we find that the points that satisfy this case are of the form $(a, -a+10)$ or $(-a+10, a)$, where $0 \le a \le 10$. These points form a square with side length 10.

2. $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$. This is possible only if $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$. Solving these two equations, we find that the points that satisfy this case are of the form $(8, y)$ or $(-8, y)$ or $(x, 8)$ or $(x, -8)$, where $-8 \le x, y \le 8$. These points form a square with side length 16.

The convex polygon enclosed by the points satisfying the given equation is the intersection of the two squares described above. This intersection is another square with side length 8. The area of this square is $8^2 = 64$.

So, the area of the convex polygon is 64. The answer is: $64$

Assistant:

 The given equation is a product of two expressions equal to zero. Therefore, the equation is satisfied if either of the expressions is zero.

The first expression is $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2) = 0$. For this expression to be zero, we must have $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. This means that the points $(x, y)$ must lie on the lines $x + y = 10$ and $x - y = 10$ or their opposites. These lines form a rectangle with vertices at $(0, 10), (10, 0), (-10, 0),$ and $(0, -10)$.

The second expression is $((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$. For this expression to be zero, we must have $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$. This means that the points $(x, y)$ must lie on the lines $x = 8$ and $y = 8$ or their opposites. These lines form a square with vertices at $(8, 8), (8, -8), (-8, -8),$ and $(-8, 8)$.

The intersection of the two regions is the convex polygon formed by the intersection of the rectangle and the square. This intersection is a square with side length 8. The area of this square is $8^2 = 64$. Therefore, the area of the convex polygon is 64. The answer is: $64$

"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"

Assistant:

 The given equation is a product of two terms, which equals to zero. This means that either the first term equals to zero, or the second term equals to zero. 

The first term equals to zero when $\vert x + y \vert - 10 = 0$ or $\vert x - y \vert - 10 = 0$, which simplifies to $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. These two equations represent two lines in the plane, and the points that satisfy these equations are the points that lie on these lines.

The second term equals to zero when $\vert x \vert - 8 = 0$ or $\vert y \vert - 8 = 0$, which simplifies to $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$. These two equations represent two lines in the plane, and the points that satisfy these equations are the points that lie on these lines.

The intersection of these lines form a square with side length 16 (since $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$ implies $-8 \leq x, y \leq 8$, and $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$ implies that the maximum difference between x and y is 10, so the maximum value of x or y is 8).

The area of this square is $16^2 = 256$. Therefore, the area of the convex polygon is 256.

The python code to calculate the area of the square is:

```python


INTERMEDIATE OUT :

def area_of_square():
    side_length = 16
    area = side_length ** 2
    return area

result = area_of_square()
print(result)
```

CODE RESULTS 256

INTERMEDIATE OUT :
```output
256
```
The area of the convex polygon is $256$. The answer is: $256$.
