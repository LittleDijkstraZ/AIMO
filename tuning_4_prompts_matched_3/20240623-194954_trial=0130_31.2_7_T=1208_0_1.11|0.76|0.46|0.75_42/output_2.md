 This problem requires a detailed analysis of the absolute value equation and the number of its distinct solutions. The equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has 4 distinct solutions.

The expression $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert$ can take on three possible forms:
1. If $\vert x-1 \vert -2 \geq 0$, then $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert = \vert x-1 \vert -2$.
2. If $-\frac{m}{100} \leq \vert x-1 \vert -2 < 0$, then $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert = -\vert x-1 \vert +2 + \frac{m}{100}$.
3. If $\vert x-1 \vert -2 < 0$, then $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert = -( \vert x-1 \vert -2) = - \vert x-1 \vert +2$.

The number of solutions to the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ is 4 if and only if the equation $\vert x-1 \vert -2 = \frac{m}{100}$ has two distinct solutions and the equation $\vert x-1 \vert -2 = -\frac{m}{100}$ has two distinct solutions.

This means that the expressions $\vert x-1 \vert -2 = \frac{m}{100}$ and $\vert x-1 \vert -2 = -\frac{m}{100}$ must each have two distinct solutions.

For the equation $\vert x-1 \vert -2 = \frac{m}{100}$, the solutions are given by $x = 1 \pm (2 + \frac{m}{100})$. Similarly, for the equation $\vert x-1 \vert -2 = -\frac{m}{100}$, the solutions are given by $x = 1 \pm (2 - \frac{m}{100})$.

The number of solutions to each of these equations is determined by the values of $m$. Specifically, the equation $\vert x-1 \vert -2 = \frac{m}{100}$ has two distinct solutions if and only if $0 < \frac{m}{100} < 4$, and the equation $\vert x-1 \vert -2 = -\frac{m}{100}$ has two distinct solutions if and only if $0 < \frac{m}{100} < 4$.

This implies that $0 < m < 400$ and the only positive integer values of $m$ for which both conditions are satisfied are $m = 1, 2, 3, ..., 399$.

Therefore, there are 399 possible values of $m$ for which the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has 4 distinct solutions.

However, we are asked for the number of positive integers $m$ for which the equation has 4 distinct solutions. So we must count the number of positive integers in the range $1$ to $399$. This is simply $399$.

Therefore, the number of positive integers $m$ for which the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has 4 distinct solutions is 399. The answer is: $399$

The equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has $4$ distinct solutions, which means the right side of the equation should be $2$. Thus, we have $\frac{m}{100}=2$, which gives $m=200$. Therefore, the only positive integer $m$ for which the equation has $4$ distinct solutions is $200$. So the answer is $\boxed{200}$.

 To solve this problem, we need to understand the properties of the absolute value function and the number of solutions of the equation.

The equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has 4 distinct solutions if and only if $\frac{m}{100} = 2$.

This is because the expression inside the absolute value, $\vert x-1 \vert -2$, can be either positive or negative. The absolute value function splits into two cases:

1. $\vert x-1 \vert -2 = \frac{m}{100}$: In this case, $\vert x-1 \vert = 2 + \frac{m}{100}$. This has 2 solutions if $2 + \frac{m}{100} > 0$, which implies $m < 200$.

2. $\vert x-1 \vert -2 = -\frac{m}{100}$: In this case, $\vert x-1 \vert = 2 - \frac{m}{100}$. This has 2 solutions if $2 - \frac{m}{100} > 0$, which implies $m < 200$.

Combining these two cases, we see that the equation has 4 distinct solutions if and only if $\frac{m}{100} = 2$, which gives $m = 200$.

Therefore, the number of positive integers $m$ for which the equation has 4 distinct solutions is 1, namely $m = 200$. The answer is: $1$

Assistant:

 The problem asks for the number of positive integers $m$ such that the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has $4$ distinct solutions.

The equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ represents a piecewise function with $4$ cases, depending on the value of $x$. Each case corresponds to a different value of $m$.

We can start by considering the case where $x \geq 3$. In this case, the equation simplifies to $\vert x - 3 \vert = \frac{m}{100}$. This equation has two solutions for $x$ if $\frac{m}{100} < 2$, i.e., $m < 200$.

Next, consider the case where $1 < x < 3$. The equation simplifies to $\vert x - 1 \vert - 2 = \frac{m}{100}$, or $\vert x - 1 \vert = 2 + \frac{m}{100}$. This equation has two solutions for $x$ if $2 + \frac{m}{100} > 0$, i.e., $m > -200$. However, since $m$ is a positive integer, this condition is always true.

For $x < 1$, the equation simplifies to $\vert 1 - x \vert - 2 = \frac{m}{100}$, or $\vert 1 - x \vert = 2 + \frac{m}{100}$. This equation has two solutions for $x$ if $2 + \frac{m}{100} > 1$, i.e., $m > -100$. Again, since $m$ is a positive integer, this condition is always true.

Putting all these conditions together, we find that the equation has four distinct solutions for $x$ if $0 < m < 200$. Therefore, the number of positive integers $m$ that satisfy this condition is $199$.

```python

Analyze this problem and think step by step to come to a solution with programs. After solving the problem, output the final numerical answer within \boxed{}.

Assistant:

 The problem is asking for the number of positive integers $m$ such that the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has exactly 4 distinct solutions.

This equation is equivalent to a piecewise function with four cases:
1. $|x-1 - 2| = \frac{m}{100} \implies |x - 3| = \frac{m}{100}$.
2. $|x-1 + 2| = \frac{m}{100} \implies |x + 1| = \frac{m}{100}$.
3. $|-x + 1 - 2| = \frac{m}{100} \implies |-x - 1| = \frac{m}{100}$.
4. $|-x + 1 + 2| = \frac{m}{100} \implies |-x + 3| = \frac{m}{100}$.

Each of these cases gives rise to two linear equations:
1. $x - 3 = \frac{m}{100}$ and $x - 3 = -\frac{m}{100}$.
2. $x + 1 = \frac{m}{100}$ and $x + 1 = -\frac{m}{100}$.
3. $x + 1 = \frac{m}{100}$ and $x + 1 = -\frac{m}{100}$.
4. $x - 3 = \frac{m}{100}$ and $x - 3 = -\frac{m}{100}$.

For each case, we need to find the value of $m$ such that the four solutions are distinct. This means that the four right-hand sides must be distinct.

After solving the four linear equations for $x$ in each case, we find that the four solutions are:
1. $x = 3 + \frac{m}{100}$, $x = 3 - \frac{m}{100}$, $x = 1 - \frac{m}{100}$, and $x = 1 + \frac{m}{100}$.
2. $x = -\frac{m}{100} + 1$, $x = \frac{m}{100} + 1$, $x = -\frac{m}{100} - 1$, and $x = \frac{m}{100} - 1$.
3. $x = -\frac{m}{100} - 1$, $x = \frac{m}{100} - 1$, $x = -\frac{m}{100} + 1$, and $x = \frac{m}{100} + 1$.
4. $x = 3 + \frac{m}{100}$, $x = 3 - \frac{m}{100}$, $x = 1 + \frac{m}{100}$, and $x = 1 - \frac{m}{100}$.

For each case, the four solutions are distinct if and only if the four right-hand sides are distinct. After analyzing the four cases, we find that only the second case has the four right-hand sides distinct. Thus, the only values of $m$ that work are those for which the four right-hand sides in the second case are distinct.

This occurs when $m$ is a positive integer such that $1 \leq m \leq 100$. Therefore, the number of positive integers $m$ such that the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has exactly 4 distinct solutions is 100. The answer is: 100

Assistant:

 The problem asks for how many positive integers $m$ does the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ have $4$ distinct solutions.

The equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ can be solved graphically. The left-hand side of the equation represents a wave function with a period of $1$ and an amplitude of $2$. The right-hand side of the equation is a horizontal line at $\frac{m}{100}$. The number of distinct solutions is equal to the number of times the wave function intersects the horizontal line.

The wave function intersects the horizontal line at $4$ distinct points when the height of the horizontal line, $\frac{m}{100}$, is between $1$ and $2$. Therefore, we have $1 < \frac{m}{100} < 2$, which gives $100 < m < 200$.

The positive integers $m$ that satisfy this inequality are the integers from $101$ to $199$, inclusive. The number of such integers is $199 - 101 + 1 = 99$.

Therefore, the number of positive integers $m$ for which the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has $4$ distinct solutions is $99$.

The answer is: $99$.

 The number of distinct solutions of the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ is equal to 4 if and only if $\frac{m}{100} = 2$.
This is because the expression $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert$ takes on the value of 2 exactly 4 times.

Therefore, we can solve for $m$ by setting $\frac{m}{100} = 2$ and multiplying both sides by 100:

 This problem involves understanding the behavior of the absolute value function and solving for the number of integer solutions to a given equation.

Let's first analyze the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$.

The expression $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert$ is equal to $\frac{m}{100}$ for 4 distinct values of $x$.

The expression $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert$ is a piecewise function that takes on the values of 3, 1, -1, and -3 when $x$ is in the intervals $(-\infty, -1), (-1, 1), (1, 3),$ and $(3, \infty)$, respectively.

Therefore, the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ will have 4 distinct solutions if $\frac{m}{100}$ is equal to 3, 1, -1, or -3.

This implies that $m$ is equal to 300, 100, -100, or -300. However, we are only interested in positive integer solutions for $m$, so the only valid solution is $m=100$.

So, there is only one positive integer $m$ for which the equation has 4 distinct solutions.
The answer is: 1

Assistant:

 The number of distinct solutions to the equation $| |x - 1| - 2| = \frac{m}{100}$ is equal to 4 if and only if $\frac{m}{100}$ is strictly between 1 and 2. This is because the function $| |x - 1| - 2|$ takes on the value of 1 at exactly 3 points and the value of 2 at exactly 2 points. Therefore, for the equation to have 4 distinct solutions, the right side of the equation, $\frac{m}{100}$, must be strictly between 1 and 2.

This gives us the inequality $1 < \frac{m}{100} < 2$. Multiplying all sides by 100 gives $100 < m < 200$. The number of positive integers in this range is $200 - 100 - 1 = 99$. So, there are 99 positive integers $m$ for which the equation has 4 distinct solutions.
The answer is: $99$.

Assistant:

 The equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has $4$ distinct solutions when $\frac{m}{100}$ is between $1$ and $2$, inclusive. This is because the expression on the left-hand side of the equation is a "double absolute value" function, which has a characteristic "V" shape. When the right-hand side is between $1$ and $2$, the equation will have $4$ distinct solutions.

Therefore, we need to find the value of $m$ such that $\frac{m}{100}$ is between $1$ and $2$. This can be achieved by multiplying all parts of the inequality by $100$:

$$1 \leq \frac{m}{100} \leq 2.$$

Multiplying all parts of the inequality by $100$ gives:

$$100 \leq m \leq 200.$$

The positive integers $m$ that satisfy this inequality are all the integers from $100$ to $200$, inclusive. To find out how many such integers there are, we can subtract the smallest possible value of $m$ from the largest possible value of $m$ and then add $1$ (because both endpoints are included):

$$200 - 100 + 1 = 101.$$

Therefore, there are $101$ positive integers $m$ such that the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has $4$ distinct solutions. The answer is: $101$.

 To find the number of positive integers $m$ for which the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has 4 distinct solutions, we need to analyze the properties of the absolute value function and the number of solutions it generates.

The function $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ is equivalent to the following two equations:

1. $\vert x-1 \vert -2 = \frac{m}{100}$, and
2. $\vert x-1 \vert -2 = -\frac{m}{100}$.

Each of these equations will have 2 sub-equations of the form $x-1 - 2 = \frac{m}{100}$ and $-(x-1) - 2 = \frac{m}{100}$, and the same for the second equation. Simplifying these gives:

1. $x-1 - 2 = \frac{m}{100}$ and $-(x-1) - 2 = \frac{m}{100}$,
2. $x-1 - 2 = -\frac{m}{100}$ and $-(x-1) - 2 = -\frac{m}{100}$.

Solving these equations will give us the 4 distinct solutions for $x$. The number of solutions will depend on the value of $m$.

For example, if $m=100$, the first equation becomes $\vert x-1 \vert -2 = 1$, which has two solutions. The second equation becomes $\vert x-1 \vert -2 = -1$, which has no solutions. So, for $m=100$, there are 2 solutions.

Similarly, we can check for other values of $m$ and observe that the number of solutions will vary. We need to find the values of $m$ for which there are exactly 4 distinct solutions.

After analyzing the properties of the absolute value function and the number of solutions it generates, we find that there is only one positive integer value of $m$ for which the equation has 4 distinct solutions, and that value is $m=50$.

So, the number of positive integers $m$ for which the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has 4 distinct solutions is 1. The answer is: $1$
