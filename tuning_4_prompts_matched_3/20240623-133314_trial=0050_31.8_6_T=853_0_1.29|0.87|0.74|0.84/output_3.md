Below is a math problem you are to solve (positive numerical answer!):
"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"

The equation $A \cdot B = 0$ implies that either $A = 0$ or $B = 0$. In this problem, we have two products of terms inside square brackets that are multiplied together, so we need to consider two cases:

Case 1: $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$. This implies that $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. Solving these two equations gives $x = y$ or $x = -y$. 

Case 2: $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$. This implies that $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$, which gives $x = 8$ or $x = -8$ and $y = 8$ or $y = -8$.

The intersection of these cases gives us the vertices of the polygon: $(8,8)$, $(8,-8)$, $(-8,8)$, and $(-8,-8)$. These points form a square with side length 16. The area of a square is given by the square of the length of its side, so the area of the polygon is $16^2 = 256$. The answer is: $256$.

Assistant:

 The given equation is a product of two terms, which means that either term must be equal to zero for the whole expression to be zero. This gives us two separate conditions to consider.

First, let's consider $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$. This implies that $\vert x + y \vert = 10$, which means $x + y = \pm 10$. This forms two lines in the plane, $x + y = 10$ and $x + y = -10$.

Second, let's consider $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$. This implies that $\vert x - y \vert = 10$, which means $x - y = \pm 10$. This forms two more lines in the plane, $x - y = 10$ and $x - y = -10$.

The four lines intersect to form a rectangle with vertices at $(8,8)$, $(8,-8)$, $(-8,8)$, and $(-8,-8)$. The area of this rectangle is $16 \times 16 = 256$. So, the area of the convex polygon is 256. The answer is: $256$

Below is a math problem you are to solve (positive numerical answer!):
"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"
Analyze this problem and think step by step to come to a solution with programs. After solving the problem, output the final numerical answer within \boxed{}.

Assistant:

 To solve this problem, we first analyze the equation and notice that it equals zero if either of the two terms inside the product equals zero. That is,
\[(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0 \quad \text{or} \quad (\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0\]
or
\[(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0 \quad \text{or} \quad (\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0.\]
This gives us the following four conditions:
1. $\vert x + y \vert = 10$,
2. $\vert x - y \vert = 10$,
3. $\vert x \vert = 8$,
4. $\vert y \vert = 8$.
Solving these four conditions, we find the points that satisfy these conditions are:
1. $(x, y) = (10, 0), (0, 10), (-10, 0), (0, -10)$,
2. $(x, y) = (10, 10), (10, -10), (-10, 10), (-10, -10)$,
3. $(x, y) = (8, 0), (-8, 0), (0, 8), (0, -8)$,
4. $(x, y) = (0, 8), (0, -8), (8, 0), (-8, 0)$.
These points form a square with side length 16. The area of this square is $16^2 = 256$. So, the area of the convex polygon is 256 square units. The answer is: $256$

Below is a math problem you are to solve (positive numerical answer!):
"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"
Analyze this problem and think step by step to come to a solution with programs. After solving the problem, output the final numerical answer within \boxed{}.

Assistant:

 The given equation is of the form $f(x, y) \cdot g(x, y) = 0$. This implies that either $f(x, y) = 0$ or $g(x, y) = 0$. Therefore, the points that satisfy the equation are the union of the points that satisfy $f(x, y) = 0$ and the points that satisfy $g(x, y) = 0$.

For $f(x, y) = ((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2) = 0$, this happens if and only if $|x + y| = 10$ and $|x - y| = 10$. The solutions to these equations are the points of a square with side length 20.

For $g(x, y) = ((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$, this happens if and only if $|x| = 8$ and $|y| = 8$. The solutions to these equations are the points of a square with side length 16.

So, the points that satisfy the given equation are the union of the points of a 20 by 20 square and the points of an 8 by 8 square. The resulting figure is the union of these two squares and is a 28 by 28 square.

The area of a square is given by the square of the length of its side, so the area of this square is $28^2 = 784$.

Therefore, the area of the convex polygon is 784 square units. The answer is: $784$

"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"

Assistant:

 The equation $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ is equal to zero if and only if either $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$, $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$, $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$, or $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$.
This means that the points must satisfy either $\vert x + y \vert = 10$, $\vert x - y \vert = 10$, $\vert x \vert = 8$, or $\vert y \vert = 8$.
The first two equations describe a square with side length 20, and the second two equations describe a square with side length 16.
The area of the square with side length 20 is $20^2 = 400$, and the area of the square with side length 16 is $16^2 = 256$.
The convex polygon formed by the intersection of these two squares is a smaller square, which is also a square with side length 16.
Therefore, the area of the convex polygon is $16^2 = 256$. The answer is: 256
