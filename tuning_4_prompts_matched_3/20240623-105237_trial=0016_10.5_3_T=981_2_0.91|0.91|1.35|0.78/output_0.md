Question (hint: positive numerical answer):
"Let $k, l > 0$ be parameters. The parabola $y = kx^2 - 2kx + l$ intersects the line $y = 4$ at two points $A$ and $B$. These points are distance 6 apart. What is the sum of the squares of the distances from $A$ and $B$ to the origin?"
Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:


First, we set $y = 4$ in the equation of the parabola to find the x-coordinates of points $A$ and $B$. We get the equation $4 = kx^2 - 2kx + l$. Rearranging, we have $kx^2 - 2kx + (l - 4) = 0$.

Let the roots of this equation be $x_1$ and $x_2$, which represent the x-coordinates of points $A$ and $B$ respectively. We are given that $|x_2 - x_1| = 6$, so by the quadratic formula, we have $\sqrt{(2k)^2 - 4k(l - 4)} = 6$. Simplifying, we get $4k^2 - 4kl + 16k = 36$.

Now, we want to find the sum of the squares of the distances from $A$ and $B$ to the origin. The distance from a point $(x, y)$ to the origin is $\sqrt{x^2 + y^2}$. For point $A$ with coordinates $(x_1, 4)$, this distance is $\sqrt{x_1^2 + 4^2} = \sqrt{x_1^2 + 16}$. Similarly, for point $B$ with coordinates $(x_2, 4)$, this distance is $\sqrt{x_2^2 + 16}$.

So, we want to find the sum of $(x_1^2 + 16)$ and $(x_2^2 + 16)$, which is $x_1^2 + x_2^2 + 32$. We know that $(x_1 + x_2)^2 - 2x_1x_2 = (x_1^2 + x_2^2)$, so we can use the fact that $x_1 + x_2 = \frac{2k}{k} = 2$ and $x_1x_2 = \frac{l - 4}{k}$ to find $x_1^2 + x_2^2$.

We have $x_1^2 + x_2^2 = (x_1 + x_2)^2 - 2x_1x_2 = 2^2 - 2\cdot \frac{l - 4}{k} = 4 - \frac{2l - 8}{k} = \frac{4k - 2l + 8}{k}$.

Substituting this into our expression for the sum of the squares of the distances, we have $\frac{4k - 2l + 8}{k} + 32$.

We want to find the value of this expression in terms of $k$ and $l$. But we have one more equation to use: the equation $4k^2 - 4kl + 16k = 36$. We can solve this equation for $l$ to get $l = \frac{4k^2 + 16k - 36}{4k}$.

Substituting this into our expression for the sum of the squares of the distances, we have $\frac{4k - 2\left(\frac{4k^2 + 16k - 36}{4k}\right) + 8}{k} + 32$.

Simplifying this expression, we get $\frac{4k - \left(4k^2 + 16k - 36\right)/2k + 8}{k} + 32$.

Further simplifying, we have $\frac{4k - 2k^2 - 8k + 18/k + 8}{k} + 32$.

Combining like terms, we get $\frac{-2k^2 + 18/k + 4k + 8}{k} + 32$.

Finally, simplifying this expression, we find that it simplifies to $100$.
The answer is: $100$

Question (hint: positive numerical answer):
"Let $k, l > 0$ be parameters. The parabola $y = kx^2 - 2kx + l$ intersects the line $y = 4$ at two points $A$ and $B$. These points are distance 6 apart. What is the sum of the squares of the distances from $A$ and $B$ to the origin?"
Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:


First, we need to find the x-coordinates of points A and B by setting the y-values of the parabola and line equal to each other:
\[kx^2 - 2kx + l = 4.\]
Rearranging, we have:
\[kx^2 - 2kx + l - 4 = 0.\]
Let $x_1$ and $x_2$ be the x-coordinates of points A and B, respectively.
By the distance formula, the distance between A and B is given by $|x_2 - x_1| = 6$.
Using the quadratic formula, we find that the x-coordinates of the points of intersection are given by:
\[x = \frac{2k \pm \sqrt{(2k)^2 - 4k(l - 4)}}{2k} = 1 \pm \frac{\sqrt{4k^2 - 4k(l - 4)}}{2k} = 1 \pm \frac{\sqrt{4k^2 - 4kl + 16k}}{2k}.\]
Thus, $|x_2 - x_1| = \left|\frac{\sqrt{4k^2 - 4kl + 16k}}{k}\right| = 6$.
Squaring both sides, we get:
\[4k^2 - 4kl + 16k = 36k^2.\]
Simplifying, we have:
\[32k^2 = 4kl \implies 8k = l.\]
Now we want to find the sum of the squares of the distances from A and B to the origin.
The distance from a point $(x, y)$ to the origin is given by $\sqrt{x^2 + y^2}$.
For point A, the distance is $\sqrt{(x_1)^2 + (kx_1^2 - 2kx_1 + l)^2}$.
For point B, the distance is $\sqrt{(x_2)^2 + (kx_2^2 - 2kx_2 + l)^2}$.
We can simplify this to:
\[(x_1)^2 + (kx_1^2 - 2kx_1 + l)^2 = (x_2)^2 + (kx_2^2 - 2kx_2 + l)^2.\]
Substituting $l = 8k$, we have:
\[(x_1)^2 + (kx_1^2 - 2kx_1 + 8k)^2 = (x_2)^2 + (kx_2^2 - 2kx_2 + 8k)^2.\]
Since $|x_2 - x_1| = 6$, we can substitute $x_2 = x_1 + 6$:
\[(x_1)^2 + (kx_1^2 - 2kx_1 + 8k)^2 = ((x_1 + 6))^2 + (k(x_1 + 6)^2 - 2k(x_1 + 6) + 8k)^2.\]
Expanding and simplifying, we find that the sum of the squares of the distances from A and B to the origin is:
\[(x_1)^2 + (kx_1^2 - 2kx_1 + 8k)^2 + (x_2)^2 + (kx_2^2 - 2kx_2 + 8k)^2 = 100k^2.\]
Therefore, the sum of the squares of the distances from A and B to the origin is $100k^2$.
Since the value of $k$ is not given, we cannot determine the exact numerical value of the sum.
However, we have found the general expression for the sum in terms of $k$.
The answer is: $100k^2$.

Question (hint: positive numerical answer):
"Let $k, l > 0$ be parameters. The parabola $y = kx^2 - 2kx + l$ intersects the line $y = 4$ at two points $A$ and $B$. These points are distance 6 apart. What is the sum of the squares of the distances from $A$ and $B$ to the origin?"
Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:


To find the points $A$ and $B$, we need to solve the system of equations:
\[y = kx^2 - 2kx + l, \quad y = 4.\]
Setting the two equations equal to each other, we have:
\[kx^2 - 2kx + l = 4.\]
Rearranging, we get:
\[kx^2 - 2kx + (l - 4) = 0.\]
This is a quadratic equation, and we know that the parabola intersects the line $y=4$ at two points, so the quadratic equation has two distinct real roots, say $x_1$ and $x_2$, which represent the x-coordinates of $A$ and $B$.
We are given that the distance between $A$ and $B$ is 6, so we have:
\[|x_2 - x_1| = 6.\]
The quadratic formula gives us:
\[x = \frac{2k \pm \sqrt{4k^2 - 4k(l - 4)}}{2k} = 1 \pm \sqrt{1 - (l - 4)/k}.\]
Since $|x_2 - x_1| = 6$, we have:
\[2\sqrt{1 - (l - 4)/k} = 6 \implies \sqrt{1 - (l - 4)/k} = 3.\]
Squaring both sides, we get:
\[1 - (l - 4)/k = 9 \implies (l - 4)/k = -8.\]
Solving for $l$, we get:
\[l = 4 - 8k.\]
Now we need to find the sum of the squares of the distances from $A$ and $B$ to the origin. The distance from a point $(x, y)$ to the origin is given by $\sqrt{x^2 + y^2}$. For point $A$ with x-coordinate $x_1$, the y-coordinate is $4$, so the distance to the origin is $\sqrt{x_1^2 + 4^2}$. Similarly, for point $B$ with x-coordinate $x_2$, the distance to the origin is $\sqrt{x_2^2 + 4^2}$. The sum of the squares of these distances is:
\[(\sqrt{x_1^2 + 4^2})^2 + (\sqrt{x_2^2 + 4^2})^2 = x_1^2 + 16 + x_2^2 + 16 = (x_1^2 + x_2^2) + 32.\]
We know that $(x_1 + x_2)^2 - 4x_1x_2 = (2)^2 - 4(1)(1 - (l - 4)/k) = 4 + 4(1 - (l - 4)/k) = 4 + 4(1 + 8) = 4 + 36 = 40$. And $(x_1x_2)^2 = (1 - (l - 4)/k)^2 = 9^2 = 81$. So $x_1^2 + x_2^2 = (x_1 + x_2)^2 - 2x_1x_2 = 40 - 2(81) = 40 - 162 = -122$. But this is not possible since the sum of two squares cannot be negative.
Therefore, we must have made an error in our calculations. Let's go back and check our work.
We have:
\[x = \frac{2k \pm \sqrt{4k^2 - 4k(l - 4)}}{2k} = 1 \pm \sqrt{1 - (l - 4)/k}.\]
Squaring both sides of this equation, we get:
\[x^2 = 1 + 1 - \frac{l - 4}{k} = 2 - \frac{l - 4}{k}.\]
But we also have:
\[x^2 = (\frac{2k \pm \sqrt{4k^2 - 4k(l - 4)}}{2k})^2 = 1 \pm \sqrt{1 - (l - 4)/k} + 1 = 2 \pm 2\sqrt{1 - (l - 4)/k}.\]
Equating the two expressions for $x^2$, we get:
\[2 - \frac{l - 4}{k} = 2 \pm 2\sqrt{1 - (l - 4)/k}.\]
Subtracting 2 from both sides, we get:
\[-\frac{l - 4}{k} = \pm 2\sqrt{1 - (l - 4)/k}.\]
Squaring both sides again, we get:
\[\frac{l - 4}{k^2} = 4 - 4(l - 4)/k + (l - 4)/k^2.\]
Simplifying, we get:
\[(l - 4)/k = 4.\]
Solving for $l$, we get:
\[l = 4 + 4k.\]
Now we substitute this back into the equation $(l - 4)/k = -8$:
\[\frac{4 + 4k - 4}{k} = -8 \implies \frac{4k}{k} = -8 \implies 4 = -8,\]
which is not true. Therefore, we made another error in our calculations.
After rechecking our work, we realize that we have made an error in the quadratic formula. The correct quadratic formula is:
\[x = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}.\]
In this case, $a = k$, $b = -2k$, and $c = l - 4$. So the correct equation is:
\[x = \frac{2k \pm \sqrt{(-2k)^2 - 4k(l - 4)}}{2k} = 1 \pm \sqrt{1 - (l - 4)/k}.\]
Now, let's go back and correct our calculations.
Using the correct quadratic formula, we get:
\[x = \frac{2k \pm \sqrt{4k^2 - 4k(l - 4)}}{2k} = 1 \pm \sqrt{1 - (l - 4)/k}.\]
Squaring both sides of this equation, we get:
\[x^2 = 1 + 1 - \frac{l - 4}{k} = 2 - \frac{l - 4}{k}.\]
But we also have:
\[x^2 = (\frac{2k \pm \sqrt{4k^2 - 4k(l - 4)}}{2k})^2 = 1 \pm \sqrt{1 - (l - 4)/k} + 1 = 2 \pm 2\sqrt{1 - (l - 4)/k}.\]
Equating the two expressions for $x^2$, we get:
\[2 - \frac{l - 4}{k} = 2 \

Question (hint: positive numerical answer):
"Let $k, l > 0$ be parameters. The parabola $y = kx^2 - 2kx + l$ intersects the line $y = 4$ at two points $A$ and $B$. These points are distance 6 apart. What is the sum of the squares of the distances from $A$ and $B$ to the origin?"
Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:



The parabola $y = kx^2 - 2kx + l$ intersects the line $y = 4$ at two points $A$ and $B$. This means that the solutions to the equation $kx^2 - 2kx + l - 4 = 0$ are the $x$-coordinates of $A$ and $B$. Let's call these solutions $x_1$ and $x_2$. We know that the distance between $A$ and $B$ is 6, which means $|x_2 - x_1| = 6$. This is equivalent to $(x_2 - x_1)^2 = 36$.

By Vieta's formulas, we know that $x_1 + x_2 = \frac{2k}{k} = 2$ and $x_1x_2 = \frac{l - 4}{k}$. We can then use the identity $(x_1 - x_2)^2 = (x_1 + x_2)^2 - 4x_1x_2$ to find $(x_1 - x_2)^2 = 4 - 4\cdot\frac{l - 4}{k} = 4 - \frac{4l - 16}{k} = \frac{16 - 4l}{k}$.

Setting this equal to $36$, we get $\frac{16 - 4l}{k} = 36$, or $16 - 4l = 36k$. Rearranging, we get $4l = 16 - 36k$, or $l = 4 - 9k$.

The distance from a point $(x, y)$ to the origin is $\sqrt{x^2 + y^2}$. So the square of the distance from a point $(x, y)$ to the origin is $x^2 + y^2$. The coordinates of $A$ and $B$ are $(x_1, kx_1^2 - 2kx_1 + l)$ and $(x_2, kx_2^2 - 2kx_2 + l)$, respectively. So the sum of the squares of the distances from $A$ and $B$ to the origin is

\[(x_1^2 + (kx_1^2 - 2kx_1 + l)^2) + (x_2^2 + (kx_2^2 - 2kx_2 + l)^2).\]

Substituting $x_1 + x_2 = 2$, $x_1x_2 = \frac{l - 4}{k}$, and $l = 4 - 9k$, we get

\[(2^2 + (k(2)^2 - 2k(2) + 4 - 9k)^2) + (0 + (k(0)^2 - 2k(0) + 4 - 9k)^2).\]

Simplifying, we get

\[(4 + (4k - 4k + 4 - 9k)^2) + (0 + (0 - 0 + 4 - 9k)^2) = (4 + (4 - 9k)^2) + (0 + (4 - 9k)^2).\]

This simplifies to $4 + (4 - 9k)^2 + (4 - 9k)^2 = 4 + 2(4 - 9k)^2$.

Finally, substituting $l = 4 - 9k$, we get

\[4 + 2(4 - 9k)^2 = 4 + 2(16 - 72k + 81k^2) = 4 + 32 - 144k + 162k^2 = 36 + 162k^2 - 144k.\]

Now, we know that $k > 0$ and $l > 0$. From $l = 4 - 9k$, we have $4 - 9k > 0$, or $4 > 9k$, or $k < \frac{4}{9}$. But we also know that $k > 0$, so $0 < k < \frac{4}{9}$.

Consider the expression $36 + 162k^2 - 144k$. This is a quadratic in $k$ with a positive coefficient of $k^2$, so it achieves its minimum value at $k = \frac{72}{324} = \frac{2}{9}$.

Substituting $k = \frac{2}{9}$ into the expression $36 + 162k^2 - 144k$, we get

\[36 + 162\left(\frac{2}{9}\right)^2 - 144\cdot\frac{2}{9} = 36 + 162\cdot\frac{4}{81} - 144\cdot\frac{2}{9} = 36 + 8 - 32 = 12.\]

So the sum of the squares of the distances from $A$ and $B$ to the origin is $12$. The answer is: $12$

Question (hint: positive numerical answer):
"Let $k, l > 0$ be parameters. The parabola $y = kx^2 - 2kx + l$ intersects the line $y = 4$ at two points $A$ and $B$. These points are distance 6 apart. What is the sum of the squares of the distances from $A$ and $B$ to the origin?"
Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:



First, we need to find the x-coordinates of points A and B. We set $kx^2 - 2kx + l = 4$ and solve for x.

$kx^2 - 2kx + l - 4 = 0$.

Let $f(x) = kx^2 - 2kx + l - 4$. By the distance formula, the distance between A and B is the difference of the x-coordinates of A and B, which is $\sqrt{(x_2 - x_1)^2 + (y_2 - y_1)^2} = 6$. Since the y-coordinates of A and B are both 4, the difference of their x-coordinates is 6.

By Vieta's formulas, the sum of the roots of $f(x) = 0$ is $\frac{2k}{k} = 2$, and the product of the roots is $\frac{l - 4}{k}$. Let the roots be $x_1$ and $x_2$. Then $x_1 + x_2 = 2$ and $x_1x_2 = \frac{l - 4}{k}$.

By the distance formula, the square of the distance from a point $(x, y)$ to the origin is $x^2 + y^2$. Therefore, the sum of the squares of the distances from A and B to the origin is $(x_1)^2 + 4 + (x_2)^2 + 4 = (x_1)^2 + (x_2)^2 + 8$.

By the identity $(x_1 + x_2)^2 = (x_1)^2 + (x_2)^2 + 2x_1x_2$, we have $(x_1)^2 + (x_2)^2 = (x_1 + x_2)^2 - 2x_1x_2 = 2^2 - 2\left(\frac{l - 4}{k}\right) = 4 - \frac{2l - 8}{k} = \frac{8 + 2l}{k}$.

Therefore, the sum of the squares of the distances from A and B to the origin is $\frac{8 + 2l}{k} + 8 = \frac{8 + 2l + 8k}{k}$.

From the equation $kx^2 - 2kx + l - 4 = 0$, we can see that $k \neq 0$. Therefore, the sum of the squares of the distances from A and B to the origin is $\frac{8 + 2l + 8k}{k}$.

We are given that the difference of the x-coordinates of A and B is 6, so $x_2 - x_1 = 6$. By the distance formula, $(x_2 - x_1)^2 = (x_2)^2 + (x_1)^2 - 2x_1x_2 = 6^2 = 36$. Substituting $(x_1)^2 + (x_2)^2 = \frac{8 + 2l}{k}$ and $x_1x_2 = \frac{l - 4}{k}$, we have $\frac{8 + 2l}{k} - 2\left(\frac{l - 4}{k}\right) = 36$.

Simplifying, we get $\frac{8 + 2l - 2l + 8}{k} = 36$, or $\frac{16}{k} = 36$. Solving for k, we find $k = \frac{4}{9}$.

Substituting $k = \frac{4}{9}$ into the equation for the sum of the squares of the distances, we get $\frac{8 + 2l + 8\left(\frac{4}{9}\right)}{ \frac{4}{9}} = \frac{8 + 2l + \frac{32}{9}}{\frac{4}{9}} = \frac{9(8 + 2l) + 32}{4} = \frac{72 + 18l + 32}{4} = \frac{104 + 18l}{4}$.

We also know that $x_1x_2 = \frac{l - 4}{k} = \frac{l - 4}{\frac{4}{9}} = \frac{9(l - 4)}{4}$. Since $x_1$ and $x_2$ are the roots of $f(x) = 0$, we have $x_1x_2 = \frac{l - 4}{k} = \frac{2^2}{k} = \frac{4}{k}$.

Setting these two expressions for $x_1x_2$ equal to each other, we get $\frac{9(l - 4)}{4} = \frac{4}{k}$. Since we already know that $k = \frac{4}{9}$, we can substitute that in to get $\frac{9(l - 4)}{4} = 1$. Solving for l, we find $l = 4 + \frac{4}{9} = \frac{40}{9}$.

Substituting $l = \frac{40}{9}$ into the equation for the sum of the squares of the distances, we get $\frac{104 + 18\left(\frac{40}{9}\right)}{4} = \frac{104 + 80}{4} = \frac{184}{4} = 46$.
The value of the sum of the squares of the distances from A and B to the origin is 46. The answer is: $46$

Question (hint: positive numerical answer):
"Let $k, l > 0$ be parameters. The parabola $y = kx^2 - 2kx + l$ intersects the line $y = 4$ at two points $A$ and $B$. These points are distance 6 apart. What is the sum of the squares of the distances from $A$ and $B$ to the origin?"
Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:


First, we set $y = 4$ in the equation of the parabola to find the x-coordinates of points $A$ and $B$. This gives us:
$$4 = kx^2 - 2kx + l.$$
Rearranging the equation, we get:
$$kx^2 - 2kx + l - 4 = 0.$$
This is a quadratic equation in $x$, and its solutions correspond to the x-coordinates of points $A$ and $B$. Since the distance between $A$ and $B$ is 6, the difference of the roots of this quadratic equation is 6. By Vieta's formulas, the difference of the roots of a quadratic equation $ax^2 + bx + c = 0$ is $\frac{\sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{a}$. Here, $a = k$, $b = -2k$, and $c = l - 4$. Therefore, we have:
$$\frac{\sqrt{(-2k)^2 - 4*k*(l - 4)}}{k} = 6.$$
Simplifying the expression under the square root gives:
$$\frac{\sqrt{4k^2 - 4k(l - 4)}}{k} = 6.$$
$$\frac{\sqrt{4k^2 - 4kl + 16k}}{k} = 6.$$
Squaring both sides to eliminate the square root gives:
$$\frac{4k^2 - 4kl + 16k}{k^2} = 36.$$
Multiplying both sides by $k^2$ to clear the denominator gives:
$$4k^2 - 4kl + 16k = 36k^2.$$
Rearranging terms gives:
$$32k^2 = 4kl.$$
Dividing both sides by $4k$ gives:
$$8k = l.$$
Now we substitute $l = 8k$ into the equation of the parabola to get:
$$y = kx^2 - 2kx + 8k.$$
The distance from a point $(x, y)$ to the origin is $\sqrt{x^2 + y^2}$. So the square of the distance from $A$ to the origin is $x_A^2 + y_A^2 = x_A^2 + (kx_A^2 - 2kx_A + 8k)^2$, and similarly for point $B$. The sum of the squares of the distances from $A$ and $B$ to the origin is:
$$(x_A^2 + (kx_A^2 - 2kx_A + 8k)^2) + (x_B^2 + (kx_B^2 - 2kx_B + 8k)^2).$$
However, we know that $x_A$ and $x_B$ are the roots of the quadratic equation $kx^2 - 2kx + 8k - 4 = 0$, and by Vieta's formulas, $x_A + x_B = \frac{2k}{k} = 2$ and $x_Ax_B = \frac{8k - 4}{k}$. Substituting these into the expression above gives:
$$(2^2 + (k*2^2 - 2k*2 + 8k)^2) + ((2 - x_A)^2 + (k*(2 - x_A)^2 - 2k*(2 - x_A) + 8k)^2).$$
This simplifies to:
$$(4 + (4k - 4k + 8k)^2) + ((4 - 4x_A + x_A^2) + (k*(4 - 4x_A + x_A^2) - 2k*(2 - x_A) + 8k)^2).$$
Simplifying further gives:
$$(4 + (8k)^2) + ((4 - 4x_A + x_A^2) + (k*(4 - 4x_A + x_A^2) - 2k*(2 - x_A) + 8k)^2).$$
Finally, substituting $x_Ax_B = \frac{8k - 4}{k}$ into the expression gives:
$$(4 + 64k^2) + ((4 - 4*\frac{8k - 4}{k} + (\frac{8k - 4}{k})^2) + (k*(4 - 4*\frac{8k - 4}{k} + (\frac{8k - 4}{k})^2) - 2k*(2 - \frac{8k - 4}{k}) + 8k)^2).$$
This simplifies to:
$$(4 + 64k^2) + ((4 - 32k + 4 + 64k^2 - \frac{64k^2 - 32k + 4}{k}) + (k*(4 - 32k + 4 + 64k^2 - \frac{64k^2 - 32k + 4}{k}) - 2k*(2 - \frac{8k - 4}{k}) + 8k)^2).$$
Further simplification gives:
$$(4 + 64k^2) + ((8k^2) + (k*(8k^2) - 4k + 8k)^2).$$
Finally, simplifying gives:
$$(4 + 64k^2) + (8k^2) + (64k^4 - 32k^2 + 64k^2)^2.$$
This simplifies to:
$$(4 + 64k^2) + (8k^2) + (64k^4).$$
Finally, simplifying gives:
$$64k^4 + 72k^2 + 4.$$
This is the sum of the squares of the distances from $A$ and $B$ to the origin.
The value of $k$ can be found by substituting $l = 8k$ into the equation of the parabola and finding the value of $k$ that gives a valid solution for $x$ (i.e., a solution that lies on the line $y = 4$). After some trial and error, we find that $k = 1$ gives a valid solution. Substituting $k = 1$ into the expression above gives:
$$64 + 72 + 4 = 140.$$
So the sum of the squares of the distances from $A$ and $B$ to the origin is 140. The answer is: $140$

Question (hint: positive numerical answer):
"Let $k, l > 0$ be parameters. The parabola $y = kx^2 - 2kx + l$ intersects the line $y = 4$ at two points $A$ and $B$. These points are distance 6 apart. What is the sum of the squares of the distances from $A$ and $B$ to the origin?"
Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:


The parabola $y = kx^2 - 2kx + l$ intersects the line $y = 4$ at two points $A$ and $B$, so we can set $kx^2 - 2kx + l = 4$.
This simplifies to $kx^2 - 2kx + l - 4 = 0$.
Let the $x$-coordinates of $A$ and $B$ be $x_1$ and $x_2$, respectively.
By the distance formula, the distance between $A$ and $B$ is $\sqrt{(x_2 - x_1)^2 + (4 - 4)^2} = |x_2 - x_1| = 6$.
Using Vieta's formulas, we know that $x_1 + x_2 = \frac{2k}{k} = 2$ and $x_1x_2 = \frac{l - 4}{k}$.
We are also given that $|x_2 - x_1| = 6$, so $(x_2 - x_1)^2 = 36$.
Expanding, we have $(x_2 - x_1)^2 = (x_2 + x_1)^2 - 4x_1x_2 = 4 - 4\left(\frac{l - 4}{k}\right) = 4 - \frac{4l - 16}{k} = 36$.
Simplifying, we have $4k - 4l + 16 = 36k$, or $4l - 36k = 16$.
We want to find the sum of the squares of the distances from $A$ and $B$ to the origin.
The distance from $A$ to the origin is $\sqrt{x_1^2 + 4^2} = \sqrt{x_1^2 + 16}$ and the distance from $B$ to the origin is $\sqrt{x_2^2 + 16}$.
So the sum of the squares of the distances is $(x_1^2 + 16) + (x_2^2 + 16) = x_1^2 + x_2^2 + 32$.
Using the identity $(x_1 + x_2)^2 - 2x_1x_2 = x_1^2 + x_2^2$, we have $x_1^2 + x_2^2 = (x_1 + x_2)^2 - 2x_1x_2 = 2^2 - 2\left(\frac{l - 4}{k}\right) = 4 - \frac{2l - 8}{k}$.
Substituting this into the sum of squares, we have $x_1^2 + x_2^2 + 32 = 4 - \frac{2l - 8}{k} + 32 = 36 - \frac{2l - 8}{k}$.
From the equation $4k - 4l + 16 = 36k$, we have $\frac{2l - 8}{k} = \frac{4k - 16}{k} = 4 - 4$.
Substituting this into the sum of squares, we have $x_1^2 + x_2^2 + 32 = 36 - (4 - 4) = 36$.
So the sum of the squares of the distances from $A$ and $B$ to the origin is 36. The answer is: $36$

Question (hint: positive numerical answer):
"Let $k, l > 0$ be parameters. The parabola $y = kx^2 - 2kx + l$ intersects the line $y = 4$ at two points $A$ and $B$. These points are distance 6 apart. What is the sum of the squares of the distances from $A$ and $B$ to the origin?"
Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:



First, we set $y = kx^2 - 2kx + l$ equal to $y = 4$:
\[kx^2 - 2kx + l = 4.\]
Rearranging terms, we get:
\[kx^2 - 2kx + l - 4 = 0.\]
This is a quadratic equation in $x$. Let's call the solutions $x_1$ and $x_2$, which represent the x-coordinates of points $A$ and $B$. We know that the distance between $A$ and $B$ is 6, so we can use the formula for the distance between two points in the x-axis: $|x_2 - x_1| = 6$. The absolute value is not needed since we know the distance is positive.

Now, we can use the quadratic formula to find the solutions $x_1$ and $x_2$. The quadratic formula states that for an equation of the form $ax^2 + bx + c = 0$, the solutions are given by $x = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}$. Here, $a = k$, $b = -2k$, and $c = l - 4$. So the solutions are:
\[x = \frac{2k \pm \sqrt{(-2k)^2 - 4k(l - 4)}}{2k} = \frac{2k \pm \sqrt{4k^2 - 4k(l - 4)}}{2k} = \frac{2k \pm \sqrt{4k^2 - 4kl + 16k}}{2k} = 1 \pm \sqrt{\frac{k^2 - kl + 4k}{k}}.\]
Thus, $x_1 = 1 - \sqrt{\frac{k^2 - kl + 4k}{k}}$ and $x_2 = 1 + \sqrt{\frac{k^2 - kl + 4k}{k}}$.

Now we need to find the sum of the squares of the distances from $A$ and $B$ to the origin. The distance from a point $(x, y)$ to the origin $(0, 0)$ is given by $\sqrt{x^2 + y^2}$. We already know that $y = 4$ for both points $A$ and $B$. So the distance from $A$ to the origin is $\sqrt{x_1^2 + 4^2}$ and the distance from $B$ to the origin is $\sqrt{x_2^2 + 4^2}$. The sum of the squares of these distances is:
\[(\sqrt{x_1^2 + 4^2})^2 + (\sqrt{x_2^2 + 4^2})^2 = x_1^2 + 16 + x_2^2 + 16 = x_1^2 + x_2^2 + 32.\]

We can find $x_1^2 + x_2^2$ by using the identity $(x_1 + x_2)^2 - 2x_1x_2 = x_1^2 + x_2^2$. We already know that $x_1 + x_2 = 2$ (from the sum of the roots of the quadratic equation) and $x_1x_2 = \frac{l - 4}{k}$ (from the product of the roots). So:
\[x_1^2 + x_2^2 = (x_1 + x_2)^2 - 2x_1x_2 = 2^2 - 2\left(\frac{l - 4}{k}\right) = 4 - \frac{2(l - 4)}{k} = 4 - \frac{2l - 8}{k} = \frac{4k - 2l + 8}{k}.\]

Substituting this into the sum of the squares of the distances, we get:
\[x_1^2 + x_2^2 + 32 = \frac{4k - 2l + 8}{k} + 32 = \frac{4k - 2l + 8 + 32k}{k} = \frac{36k - 2l + 8}{k}.\]

We are given that $k, l > 0$. We can now substitute the values of $k$ and $l$ from the equation $kx^2 - 2kx + l = 4$ to find the sum of the squares of the distances from $A$ and $B$ to the origin.

From $kx^2 - 2kx + l = 4$, we can rearrange to get $kx^2 - 2kx + (l - 4) = 0$. Comparing this to the standard form $ax^2 + bx + c = 0$, we have $a = k$, $b = -2k$, and $c = l - 4$. The discriminant of this quadratic equation is $b^2 - 4ac = (-2k)^2 - 4k(l - 4) = 4k^2 - 4k(l - 4)$.

We are given that the distance between $A$ and $B$ is 6, and we know that $|x_2 - x_1| = 6$. The discriminant must be a positive number, so $4k^2 - 4k(l - 4) > 0$. Simplifying this inequality gives $k^2 - k(l - 4) > 0$, or $k^2 - kl + 4k > 0$. This is exactly the condition we derived for the solutions $x_1$ and $x_2$.

So we can substitute $k^2 - kl + 4k = 0$ into the expression for the sum of the squares of the distances:
\[\frac{36k - 2l + 8}{k} = \frac{36k}{k} = 36.\]
Therefore, the sum of the squares of the distances from $A$ and $B$ to the origin is 36.
The answer is: $36$

Question (hint: positive numerical answer):
"Let $k, l > 0$ be parameters. The parabola $y = kx^2 - 2kx + l$ intersects the line $y = 4$ at two points $A$ and $B$. These points are distance 6 apart. What is the sum of the squares of the distances from $A$ and $B$ to the origin?"
Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:


To find the points $A$ and $B$, we set $y = 4$ in the equation of the parabola, so we get $4 = kx^2 - 2kx + l$.
Rearranging, we have $kx^2 - 2kx + (l - 4) = 0$.
Let $x_1$ and $x_2$ be the x-coordinates of $A$ and $B$, respectively. Then by the distance formula,
the distance between $A$ and $B$ is $\sqrt{(x_2 - x_1)^2 + (0)^2} = |x_2 - x_1| = 6$.
By the quadratic formula, we have $x = \frac{2k \pm \sqrt{4k^2 - 4k(l - 4)}}{2k} = 1 \pm \frac{\sqrt{4k^2 - 4k(l - 4)}}{2k}$.
Since $x_2 - x_1 = \frac{\sqrt{4k^2 - 4k(l - 4)}}{k}$, we have $\sqrt{4k^2 - 4k(l - 4)} = 6k$.
Squaring both sides, we get $4k^2 - 4k(l - 4) = 36k^2$, or $32k^2 = 4k(l - 4)$, or $8k = l - 4$, or $l = 8k + 4$.
Now we want to find the sum of the squares of the distances from $A$ and $B$ to the origin.
The distance from $A$ to the origin is $\sqrt{x_1^2 + y_1^2} = \sqrt{x_1^2 + (kx_1^2 - 2kx_1 + l)^2}$,
and the distance from $B$ to the origin is $\sqrt{x_2^2 + y_2^2} = \sqrt{x_2^2 + (kx_2^2 - 2kx_2 + l)^2}$.
Let's find a common expression for these distances.
By Vieta's formulas, we have $x_1x_2 = \frac{l - 4}{k} = \frac{8k + 4 - 4}{k} = 8$, and $x_1 + x_2 = \frac{2k}{k} = 2$.
Then $x_1^2x_2^2 = (x_1x_2)^2 = 64$, and $(x_1 + x_2)^2 = 4$.
By expanding the squares of the distances, we get
\begin{align*}
\text{Distance}^2_A &= x_1^2 + (kx_1^2 - 2kx_1 + l)^2 \\
&= x_1^2 + (k^2x_1^4 - 4k^2x_1^3 + 4k^2x_1^2 + l^2 - 2l(kx_1^2 - 2kx_1)) \\
&= x_1^2 + k^2x_1^4 - 4k^2x_1^3 + 4k^2x_1^2 + l^2 - 2l(kx_1^2 - 2kx_1) \\
&= x_1^2 + k^2x_1^4 - 4k^2x_1^3 + 4k^2x_1^2 + (8k + 4)^2 - 2(8k + 4)(kx_1^2 - 2kx_1) \\
&= x_1^2 + k^2x_1^4 - 4k^2x_1^3 + 4k^2x_1^2 + 64k^2 + 64 + 32k(kx_1^2 - 2kx_1) - 16k^2(kx_1^2 - 2kx_1) \\
&= x_1^2 + k^2x_1^4 - 4k^2x_1^3 + 4k^2x_1^2 + 64k^2 + 64 + 32k^2x_1^2 - 64kx_1^2 - 16k^3x_1^3 + 32k^3x_1^2 \\
&= k^2x_1^4 - 4k^2x_1^3 + (x_1^2 + 4k^2x_1^2) + 64k^2 + 64 + (32k^2x_1^2 - 64kx_1^2) + (32k^3x_1^2 - 16k^3x_1^3) \\
&= k^2x_1^4 - 4k^2x_1^3 + 5x_1^2 + 64k^2 + 64 + 64k^2x_1^2 - 64kx_1^2 + 32k^3x_1^2 - 16k^3x_1^3 \\
&= k^2x_1^4 - 4k^2x_1^3 + 5x_1^2 + 128k^2 + 64k^2x_1^2 - 64kx_1^2 + 32k^3x_1^2 - 16k^3x_1^3.
\end{align*}
Similarly, we can find that the square of the distance from $B$ to the origin is
\[k^2x_2^4 - 4k^2x_2^3 + 5x_2^2 + 128k^2 + 64k^2x_2^2 - 64kx_2^2 + 32k^3x_2^2 - 16k^3x_2^3.\]
Adding these two expressions, we get
\begin{align*}
&\text{Distance}^2_A + \text{Distance}^2_B \\
&= (k^2x_1^4 - 4k^2x_1^3 + 5x_1^2 + 128k^2 + 64k^2x_1^2 - 64kx_1^2 + 32k^3x_1^2 - 16k^3x_1^3) \\
&\quad + (k^2x_2^4 - 4k^2x_2^3 + 5x_2^2 + 128k^2 + 64k^2x_2^2 - 64kx_2^2 + 32k^3x_2^2 - 16k^3x_2^3

Question (hint: positive numerical answer):
"Let $k, l > 0$ be parameters. The parabola $y = kx^2 - 2kx + l$ intersects the line $y = 4$ at two points $A$ and $B$. These points are distance 6 apart. What is the sum of the squares of the distances from $A$ and $B$ to the origin?"
Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:


First, we set $y = kx^2 - 2kx + l$ equal to $y = 4$ to find the $x$-coordinates of points $A$ and $B$:
\[kx^2 - 2kx + l = 4.\]
Rearranging, we get
\[kx^2 - 2kx + l - 4 = 0.\]
Let's call this equation (1).

The distance between points $A$ and $B$ is given as 6. The distance between two points $(x_1, y_1)$ and $(x_2, y_2)$ is given by $\sqrt{(x_2 - x_1)^2 + (y_2 - y_1)^2}$. Here, $y_1 = y_2 = 4$, so the distance simplifies to $\sqrt{(x_2 - x_1)^2} = |x_2 - x_1| = 6$.

By Vieta's formulas, the sum of the roots of equation (1) is $\frac{2k}{k} = 2$, and the product of the roots is $\frac{l - 4}{k}$. Let's call the roots $x_1$ and $x_2$. Then $x_1 + x_2 = 2$ and $x_1x_2 = \frac{l - 4}{k}$.

We know that $(x_2 - x_1)^2 = 6^2 = 36$, and by difference of squares, we have $(x_2 - x_1)^2 = (x_2 + x_1)^2 - 4x_1x_2$. Substituting the known values, we get
\[36 = 2^2 - 4\left(\frac{l - 4}{k}\right).\]
Simplifying, we have $36 = 4 - \frac{4(l - 4)}{k}$.

Multiplying both sides by $k$, we get $36k = 4k - 4(l - 4)$.
Rearranging, we have $36k - 4k = -4(l - 4)$, or $32k = -4(l - 4)$.
Dividing both sides by $-4$, we get $8k = l - 4$, so $l = 8k + 4$.

Now, we want to find the sum of the squares of the distances from $A$ and $B$ to the origin. The distance from a point $(x, y)$ to the origin is $\sqrt{x^2 + y^2}$. For point $A$, this is $\sqrt{x_1^2 + 4^2} = \sqrt{x_1^2 + 16}$, and for point $B$, it's $\sqrt{x_2^2 + 4^2} = \sqrt{x_2^2 + 16}$.

The sum of the squares of the distances is then $(\sqrt{x_1^2 + 16})^2 + (\sqrt{x_2^2 + 16})^2 = x_1^2 + 16 + x_2^2 + 16 = x_1^2 + x_2^2 + 32$.

We know that $x_1^2 + x_2^2 = (x_1 + x_2)^2 - 2x_1x_2 = 2^2 - 2\left(\frac{l - 4}{k}\right) = 4 - 2\left(\frac{8k + 4 - 4}{k}\right) = 4 - 16 = -12$.

But this result is negative, which is not possible. We must have made an error in our calculations. Let's go back and check our work.

Upon revisiting our calculations, we realize that we made a mistake when we used Vieta's formulas. The sum of the roots of equation (1) is indeed $\frac{2k}{k} = 2$, but the product of the roots is $\frac{4 - l}{k}$. So we should have
\[36 = 2^2 - 4\left(\frac{4 - l}{k}\right).\]
Simplifying, we have $36 = 4 - \frac{16 - 4l}{k}$.

Multiplying both sides by $k$, we get $36k = 4k - 16 + 4l$.
Rearranging, we have $36k - 4k = 4l - 16$, or $32k = 4l - 16$.
Dividing both sides by 4, we get $8k = l - 4$, so $l = 8k + 4$.

This is the same equation we got before, so we can continue with our calculations.

Now, we want to find the sum of the squares of the distances from $A$ and $B$ to the origin. The sum of the squares of the distances is then $(\sqrt{x_1^2 + 16})^2 + (\sqrt{x_2^2 + 16})^2 = x_1^2 + 16 + x_2^2 + 16 = x_1^2 + x_2^2 + 32$.

We know that $x_1^2 + x_2^2 = (x_1 + x_2)^2 - 2x_1x_2 = 2^2 - 2\left(\frac{4 - l}{k}\right) = 4 - 2\left(\frac{4 - (8k + 4)}{k}\right) = 4 - 2\left(\frac{4 - 8k - 4}{k}\right) = 4 - 2\left(\frac{-8k}{k}\right) = 4 + 16 = 20$.

So the sum of the squares of the distances from $A$ and $B$ to the origin is $20 + 32 = 52$. The answer is: $52$

Question (hint: positive numerical answer):
"Let $k, l > 0$ be parameters. The parabola $y = kx^2 - 2kx + l$ intersects the line $y = 4$ at two points $A$ and $B$. These points are distance 6 apart. What is the sum of the squares of the distances from $A$ and $B$ to the origin?"
Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:


First, we set $kx^2 - 2kx + l = 4$ to find the x-coordinates of points $A$ and $B$. This gives us the equation $kx^2 - 2kx + l - 4 = 0$.
Let the roots of this equation be $x_1$ and $x_2$. Since the parabola intersects the line at two points, the discriminant of the quadratic equation is positive. That is, $(-2k)^2 - 4*k*(l - 4) > 0$, or $4k^2 - 4k(l - 4) > 0$, which simplifies to $k^2 - k(l - 4) > 0$.
We are given that $|x_1 - x_2| = 6$, which means $|x_1 - x_2|^2 = 36$. By the quadratic formula, we have $|x_1 - x_2|^2 = (\frac{2k}{\sqrt{k^2 - k(l - 4)}})^2 = \frac{4k^2}{k^2 - k(l - 4)}$. Setting this equal to 36, we get $\frac{4k^2}{k^2 - k(l - 4)} = 36$, or $4k^2 = 36k^2 - 36k(l - 4)$. Simplifying, we have $32k^2 = 36k(l - 4)$, or $8k = 9(l - 4)$.
Now, we want to find the sum of the squares of the distances from $A$ and $B$ to the origin. The distance from a point $(x, y)$ to the origin is $\sqrt{x^2 + y^2}$. For point $A$, this is $\sqrt{x_1^2 + (kx_1^2 - 2kx_1 + l - 4)^2}$, and for point $B$, this is $\sqrt{x_2^2 + (kx_2^2 - 2kx_2 + l - 4)^2}$.
To simplify this, we can use the fact that the sum of the squares of the roots of a quadratic equation $ax^2 + bx + c = 0$ is $\frac{b^2 - 2ac}{a^2}$. In our case, $a = k$, $b = -2k$, and $c = l - 4$. So the sum of the squares of the distances from $A$ and $B$ to the origin is $\frac{(-2k)^2 - 2k(l - 4)}{k^2} + \frac{(-2k)^2 - 2k(l - 4)}{k^2} = \frac{4k^2 - 2k(l - 4)}{k^2} + \frac{4k^2 - 2k(l - 4)}{k^2} = \frac{8k^2 - 4k(l - 4)}{k^2}$.
We already found that $8k = 9(l - 4)$, so we can substitute this into the expression above to get $\frac{8k^2 - 4k(l - 4)}{k^2} = \frac{8k^2 - \frac{36k^2}{9}}{k^2} = \frac{8k^2 - \frac{4k^2}{1}}{k^2} = \frac{72k^2}{9k^2} = 8$.
So the sum of the squares of the distances from $A$ and $B$ to the origin is 8. The answer is: 8

Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:



First, we need to find the $x$-coordinates of points $A$ and $B$. Since they are both on the line $y=4$, we can substitute $4$ into the equation of the parabola to get:
\[4 = kx^2 - 2kx + l.\]
Rearranging terms, we have:
\[kx^2 - 2kx + l - 4 = 0.\]
Let's call this equation $(1)$.

Given that the points $A$ and $B$ are distance $6$ apart, we know that the difference of the $x$-coordinates of $A$ and $B$ is $6$. Let's call the $x$-coordinate of $A$ as $x_1$ and the $x$-coordinate of $B$ as $x_2$. Then, we have:
\[|x_1 - x_2| = 6.\]
By Vieta's formulas, we know that the sum of the roots of equation $(1)$ is $\frac{2k}{k} = 2$, and the product of the roots is $\frac{l-4}{k}$. Let's call these roots $x_1$ and $x_2$. Then we have:
\[x_1 + x_2 = 2, \quad x_1x_2 = \frac{l-4}{k}.\]
Squaring the equation $|x_1 - x_2| = 6$ gives:
\[(x_1 - x_2)^2 = 36.\]
Expanding, we get:
\[x_1^2 - 2x_1x_2 + x_2^2 = 36.\]
Substituting $x_1 + x_2 = 2$ and $x_1x_2 = \frac{l-4}{k}$ into this equation, we get:
\[(2)^2 - 2\left(\frac{l-4}{k}\right) + \left(\frac{l-4}{k}\right)^2 = 36.\]
Simplifying, we have:
\[4 - \frac{2(l-4)}{k} + \frac{(l-4)^2}{k^2} = 36.\]
Multiplying through by $k^2$ to clear the fractions, we get:
\[4k^2 - 2k(l-4) + (l-4)^2 = 36k^2.\]
Rearranging terms, we have:
\[(l-4)^2 - 2k(l-4) + 4k^2 - 36k^2 = 0.\]
This simplifies to:
\[(l-4)^2 - 34k^2 = 2k(l-4).\]
Now, we want to find the sum of the squares of the distances from $A$ and $B$ to the origin. The distance from a point $(x,y)$ to the origin is $\sqrt{x^2+y^2}$. Since both $A$ and $B$ are on the line $y=4$, the distance to the origin is just the $x$-coordinate. So we want to find $(x_1)^2 + (x_2)^2$. Using the identity $(x_1 + x_2)^2 - 2x_1x_2 = (x_1^2 + x_2^2)$, we have:
\[(x_1 + x_2)^2 - 2x_1x_2 = (x_1^2 + x_2^2).\]
Substituting $x_1 + x_2 = 2$ and $x_1x_2 = \frac{l-4}{k}$, we get:
\[(2)^2 - 2\left(\frac{l-4}{k}\right) = (x_1^2 + x_2^2).\]
Simplifying, we have:
\[4 - \frac{2(l-4)}{k} = x_1^2 + x_2^2.\]
We already found that $(l-4)^2 - 34k^2 = 2k(l-4)$, so we can substitute this into the equation above to get:
\[4 - \frac{2(l-4)}{k} = x_1^2 + x_2^2 = \frac{(l-4)^2 - 34k^2}{k^2}.\]
Simplifying the right side, we have:
\[4 - \frac{2(l-4)}{k} = \frac{(l-4)^2 - 34k^2}{k^2}.\]
Multiplying through by $k^2$ to clear the fractions, we get:
\[4k^2 - 2k(l-4) = (l-4)^2 - 34k^2.\]
Rearranging terms, we have:
\[(l-4)^2 - 36k^2 = 2k(l-4).\]
This is exactly the same equation we derived earlier, so we can conclude that the sum of the squares of the distances from $A$ and $B$ to the origin is $x_1^2 + x_2^2 = \frac{(l-4)^2 - 34k^2}{k^2}$.

However, we still need to find the numerical value of this expression. We can do this by substituting the values of $l$ and $k$ that satisfy the equation $(l-4)^2 - 34k^2 = 2k(l-4)$. From the equation $(l-4)^2 - 34k^2 = 0$, we have $(l-4)^2 = 34k^2$. Taking the square root of both sides, we get $l-4 = \pm \sqrt{34}k$. Since $l > 0$, we must have $l-4 = \sqrt{34}k$, or $l = 4 + \sqrt{34}k$.

Substituting this into the equation $(l-4)^2 - 34k^2 = 2k(l-4)$, we get:
\[(\sqrt{34}k)^2 - 34k^2 = 2k(\sqrt{34}k - 4).\]
Simplifying, we have:
\[34k^2 - 34k^2 = 2k\sqrt{34}k - 8k.\]
This simplifies to:
\[0 = 2k^2\sqrt{34} - 8k.\]
Factoring out $2k$, we get:
\[0 = 2k(k\sqrt{34} - 4).\]
So either $2k = 0$, or $k\sqrt{34} - 4 = 0$. The first equation gives $k = 0$, which is not possible since $k > 0$. The second equation gives $k\sqrt{34} = 4$, or $k = \frac{4}{\sqrt{34}} = \frac{4\sqrt{34}}{34}$.

Substituting this value of $k$ into $l = 4

Question (hint: positive numerical answer):
"Let $k, l > 0$ be parameters. The parabola $y = kx^2 - 2kx + l$ intersects the line $y = 4$ at two points $A$ and $B$. These points are distance 6 apart. What is the sum of the squares of the distances from $A$ and $B$ to the origin?"
Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:


The parabola $y = kx^2 - 2kx + l$ intersects the line $y = 4$ at two points $A$ and $B$. So we can set $kx^2 - 2kx + l = 4$, which simplifies to $kx^2 - 2kx + l - 4 = 0$. Let's call this equation (1).

The distance between points $A$ and $B$ is given as 6. If $x_1$ and $x_2$ are the x-coordinates of $A$ and $B$, respectively, then we know that $|x_2 - x_1| = 6$. By Vieta's formulas, we know that $x_1 + x_2 = \frac{2k}{k} = 2$ and $x_1x_2 = \frac{l - 4}{k}$.

Now, we use the distance formula to find the distance from each point to the origin. The distance from a point $(x, y)$ to the origin is $\sqrt{x^2 + y^2}$. For point $A$, which has coordinates $(x_1, 4)$, the distance to the origin is $\sqrt{x_1^2 + 4^2} = \sqrt{x_1^2 + 16}$. Similarly, the distance for point $B$ is $\sqrt{x_2^2 + 16}$.

We want to find the sum of the squares of these distances, which is $(\sqrt{x_1^2 + 16})^2 + (\sqrt{x_2^2 + 16})^2 = x_1^2 + 16 + x_2^2 + 16 = x_1^2 + x_2^2 + 32$.

We know that $(x_1 + x_2)^2 - 2x_1x_2 = x_1^2 + x_2^2$. Substituting the values we found earlier, we have $2^2 - 2\left(\frac{l - 4}{k}\right) = x_1^2 + x_2^2$. Simplifying, we get $4 - 2\left(\frac{l - 4}{k}\right) = x_1^2 + x_2^2$.

Substituting this into our expression for the sum of the squares of the distances, we get $4 - 2\left(\frac{l - 4}{k}\right) + 32 = x_1^2 + x_2^2 + 32 = 36 - 2\left(\frac{l - 4}{k}\right)$.

But we know that $|x_2 - x_1| = 6$, which implies $(x_2 - x_1)^2 = 36$. Expanding, we get $x_1^2 - 2x_1x_2 + x_2^2 = 36$, or $x_1^2 + x_2^2 = 36 + 2x_1x_2$.

Substituting this into our expression for the sum of the squares of the distances, we get $36 + 2x_1x_2 + 32 = 68 + 2x_1x_2$.

But we know that $x_1x_2 = \frac{l - 4}{k}$, so we substitute that in and get $68 + 2\left(\frac{l - 4}{k}\right) = 68 + \frac{2(l - 4)}{k}$.

So the sum of the squares of the distances from $A$ and $B$ to the origin is $68 + \frac{2(l - 4)}{k}$. But we know that this is equal to $36 - 2\left(\frac{l - 4}{k}\right)$, so we can set these two equal to each other and solve for $l$:
\[68 + \frac{2(l - 4)}{k} = 36 - 2\left(\frac{l - 4}{k}\right).\]
Simplifying, we get $32 = -\frac{4(l - 4)}{k}$. Multiplying both sides by $k$, we get $32k = -4(l - 4)$, or $8k = -(l - 4)$. Adding $l - 4$ to both sides, we get $8k + l - 4 = l$, or $8k = 4$, or $k = \frac{1}{2}$.

Substituting this into our expression for the sum of the squares of the distances, we get $36 - 2\left(\frac{l - 4}{\frac{1}{2}}\right) = 36 - 4(l - 4) = 36 - 4l + 16 = 52 - 4l$.

But we know that $8k = -(l - 4)$, so $8\left(\frac{1}{2}\right) = -(l - 4)$, or $4 = -(l - 4)$, or $l = 8$.

Substituting this into our expression for the sum of the squares of the distances, we get $52 - 4(8) = 52 - 32 = 20$.
The answer is: $20$

Question (hint: positive numerical answer):
"Let $k, l > 0$ be parameters. The parabola $y = kx^2 - 2kx + l$ intersects the line $y = 4$ at two points $A$ and $B$. These points are distance 6 apart. What is the sum of the squares of the distances from $A$ and $B$ to the origin?"
Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:


To find the points of intersection, we set $kx^2 - 2kx + l = 4$. Rearranging terms gives $kx^2 - 2kx + l - 4 = 0$. This is a quadratic equation, and we know that the solutions (the x-coordinates of A and B) are distance 6 apart. Let's call the roots of this equation $x_1$ and $x_2$, then we have $x_2 - x_1 = 6/1 = 6$ (by the property of the roots of a quadratic equation).

Now, let's find the sum of the squares of the distances from A and B to the origin. The distance from a point $(x, y)$ to the origin is $\sqrt{x^2 + y^2}$. For point A with coordinates $(x_1, kx_1^2 - 2kx_1 + l)$, the distance to the origin is $\sqrt{x_1^2 + (kx_1^2 - 2kx_1 + l)^2}$. Similarly, for point B with coordinates $(x_2, kx_2^2 - 2kx_2 + l)$, the distance to the origin is $\sqrt{x_2^2 + (kx_2^2 - 2kx_2 + l)^2}$.

We want to find the sum of the squares of these distances, which is
\[x_1^2 + (kx_1^2 - 2kx_1 + l)^2 + x_2^2 + (kx_2^2 - 2kx_2 + l)^2.\]
Using the fact that $x_2 - x_1 = 6$, we can rewrite this as
\[(x_1 + 6)^2 + (k(x_1 + 6)^2 - 2k(x_1 + 6) + l)^2 + x_1^2 + (kx_1^2 - 2kx_1 + l)^2.\]
Expanding and simplifying, we get
\[2x_1^2 + 24x_1 + 144 + 2(k^2x_1^2 + 12k^2x_1 + l^2 - 4kl + 4k^2x_1^2 - 8k^2x_1 + 2kl) = 2x_1^2 + 24x_1 + 144 + 4k^2x_1^2 + 24k^2x_1 + 2l^2 - 8kl.\]
Simplifying further, we get
\[2x_1^2 + 24x_1 + 144 + 4k^2x_1^2 + 24k^2x_1 + 2l^2 - 8kl = 2x_1^2 + 24x_1 + 144 + 4k^2x_1^2 + 24k^2x_1 + 2l^2 - 8kl.\]
This simplifies to $144 + 144k^2 + 2l^2 - 8kl$.

However, we know that $kx^2 - 2kx + l = 4$ has roots $x_1$ and $x_2$, so by Vieta's formulas, $x_1 + x_2 = \frac{2k}{k} = 2$ and $x_1x_2 = \frac{l - 4}{k}$.
Using the identity $(x_1 + x_2)^2 = x_1^2 + x_2^2 + 2x_1x_2$, we can solve for $x_1^2 + x_2^2$:
\[(x_1 + x_2)^2 - 2x_1x_2 = x_1^2 + x_2^2.\]
Substituting $x_1 + x_2 = 2$ and $x_1x_2 = \frac{l - 4}{k}$, we get
\[4 - 2\left(\frac{l - 4}{k}\right) = x_1^2 + x_2^2.\]
So the sum of the squares of the distances from A and B to the origin is
\[144 + 144k^2 + 2l^2 - 8kl = 144 + 144k^2 + 2(l - 4)^2 - 8kl = 144 + 144k^2 + 2(l^2 - 8l + 16) - 8kl = 144 + 144k^2 + 2l^2 - 16l + 32 - 8kl = 184 + 144k^2 + 2l^2 - 16l - 8kl.\]
Using the identity $x_1^2 + x_2^2 = 4 - 2\left(\frac{l - 4}{k}\right)$, we can simplify further:
\[184 + 144k^2 + 2l^2 - 16l - 8kl = 184 + 144k^2 + 2(l^2 - 8l + 16) - 8kl = 184 + 144k^2 + 2l^2 - 16l + 32 - 8kl = 216 + 144k^2 + 2l^2 - 16l - 8kl.\]
Finally, using the fact that $x_1^2 + x_2^2 = 4 - 2\left(\frac{l - 4}{k}\right)$, we can simplify further:
\[216 + 144k^2 + 2l^2 - 16l - 8kl = 216 + 144k^2 + 2(l^2 - 8l + 16) - 8kl = 216 + 144k^2 + 2l^2 - 16l + 32 - 8kl = 248 + 144k^2 + 2l^2 - 16l - 8kl.\]
Since the value of the expression does not depend on $x_1$ or $x_2$, we can remove the dependence on them and just consider the final expression $248 + 144k^2 + 2l^2 - 16l - 8kl$.

Therefore, the sum of the squares of the distances from A and B to the origin is $248 + 144k^2 + 2l^2 - 16l - 8kl$.
However, we know that $kx^2 - 2kx + l = 4$ has roots $x_1$ and $x_2$, so by Vieta's formulas, $x_1 + x_2

Question (hint: positive numerical answer):
"Let $k, l > 0$ be parameters. The parabola $y = kx^2 - 2kx + l$ intersects the line $y = 4$ at two points $A$ and $B$. These points are distance 6 apart. What is the sum of the squares of the distances from $A$ and $B$ to the origin?"
Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:


To find the $x$-coordinates of points $A$ and $B$, we set $y = kx^2 - 2kx + l$ equal to $4$:
\[kx^2 - 2kx + l - 4 = 0.\]
We are given that the distance between $A$ and $B$ is 6.
Let $x_1$ and $x_2$ be the $x$-coordinates of $A$ and $B$, respectively. Then $x_2 - x_1 = 6$.
By Vieta's formulas, we know that $x_1 + x_2 = \frac{2k}{k} = 2$ and $x_1x_2 = \frac{l - 4}{k}$.
Using the difference of squares, we have $(x_2 - x_1)^2 = (x_2 + x_1)^2 - 4x_1x_2$. Substituting the known values, we get:
\[6^2 = 2^2 - 4\left(\frac{l - 4}{k}\right).\]
Simplifying, we get:
\[36 = 4 - \frac{4l - 16}{k}.\]
Rearranging terms, we get:
\[\frac{4l - 16}{k} = -32.\]
Multiplying both sides by $k$, we get:
\[4l - 16 = -32k.\]
Adding 16 to both sides, we get:
\[4l = -32k + 16.\]
Dividing both sides by 4, we get:
\[l = -8k + 4.\]
Now we want to find the sum of the squares of the distances from $A$ and $B$ to the origin. The distance from a point $(x, y)$ to the origin is $\sqrt{x^2 + y^2}$. For point $A$ with $x$-coordinate $x_1$, the $y$-coordinate is $k{x_1}^2 - 2k{x_1} + l$. So the distance from $A$ to the origin is $\sqrt{{x_1}^2 + (k{x_1}^2 - 2k{x_1} + l)^2}$. Similarly, the distance from $B$ to the origin is $\sqrt{{x_2}^2 + (k{x_2}^2 - 2k{x_2} + l)^2}$. We want to find the sum of these squares.

Using the fact that $(a+b)^2 = a^2 + 2ab + b^2$, we can expand the squares:
\[\begin{aligned}
&{x_1}^2 + (k{x_1}^2 - 2k{x_1} + l)^2 + {x_2}^2 + (k{x_2}^2 - 2k{x_2} + l)^2 \\
&= {x_1}^2 + k^2{x_1}^4 - 4k^2{x_1}^3 + 4k^2{x_1}^2 - 2kl{x_1} + l^2 + {x_2}^2 + k^2{x_2}^4 - 4k^2{x_2}^3 + 4k^2{x_2}^2 - 2kl{x_2} + l^2 \\
&= {x_1}^2 + {x_2}^2 + k^2({x_1}^4 + {x_2}^4) - 4k^2({x_1}^3 + {x_2}^3) + 4k^2({x_1}^2 + {x_2}^2) - 2k(l{x_1} + l{x_2}) + 2l^2.
\end{aligned}\]
We know that ${x_1}^2 + {x_2}^2 = (x_1 + x_2)^2 - 2x_1x_2 = 2^2 - 2\left(\frac{l - 4}{k}\right) = 4 - 2\left(\frac{l - 4}{k}\right) = 4 - 2\left(\frac{-8k + 4 - 4}{k}\right) = 4 - 2\left(\frac{-8k}{k}\right) = 4 + 16 = 20$.

We also know that $l{x_1} + l{x_2} = l(x_1 + x_2) = (-8k + 4)(2) = -16k + 8$.

So the sum of the squares of the distances from $A$ and $B$ to the origin is:
\[\begin{aligned}
&{x_1}^2 + {x_2}^2 + k^2({x_1}^4 + {x_2}^4) - 4k^2({x_1}^3 + {x_2}^3) + 4k^2({x_1}^2 + {x_2}^2) - 2k(l{x_1} + l{x_2}) + 2l^2 \\
&= 20 + k^2({x_1}^4 + {x_2}^4) - 4k^2({x_1}^3 + {x_2}^3) + 4k^2(20) - 2k(-16k + 8) + 2(-8k + 4)^2 \\
&= 20 + k^2({x_1}^4 + {x_2}^4) - 4k^2({x_1}^3 + {x_2}^3) + 80k^2 + 32k^2 - 16k^2 + 2(64k^2 - 64k + 16) \\
&= 20 + k^2({x_1}^4 + {x_2}^4) - 4k^2({x_1}^3 + {x_2}^3) + 96k^2 + 128k^2 - 64k + 32 \\
&= 20 + k^2({x_1}^4 + {x_2}^4) - 4k^2({x_1}^3 + {x_2}^3) + 216k^2 - 64k + 32.
\end{aligned}\]
We know that ${x_1}^4 + {x_2}^4 = (x_1^2 + x_2^2)^2 - 2{x_1}^2{x_2}^2 = 20^2 - 2({x_1}{x_2})^2 = 400 - 2\left(\frac{l - 4}{k}\right)^2 = 400 - 2\left(\frac{-8k + 4 - 4}{k}\right)^2 = 400 -

Question (hint: positive numerical answer):
"Let $k, l > 0$ be parameters. The parabola $y = kx^2 - 2kx + l$ intersects the line $y = 4$ at two points $A$ and $B$. These points are distance 6 apart. What is the sum of the squares of the distances from $A$ and $B$ to the origin?"
Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:



First, let's find the points $A$ and $B$ where the parabola $y = kx^2 - 2kx + l$ intersects the line $y = 4$. Setting the two equations equal to each other, we get:
\[4 = kx^2 - 2kx + l.\]
Rearranging terms, we have:
\[kx^2 - 2kx + l - 4 = 0.\]

We are given that the points $A$ and $B$ are distance 6 apart. Let $x_1$ and $x_2$ be the x-coordinates of $A$ and $B$, respectively. Then, by the distance formula, we have:
\[(x_2 - x_1)^2 = 36.\]
Using the difference of squares, this simplifies to:
\[(x_2 + x_1)^2 - 4x_1x_2 = 36.\]

Now, let's recall Vieta's formulas. If $x_1$ and $x_2$ are the roots of the equation $kx^2 - 2kx + l - 4 = 0$, then:
\[x_1 + x_2 = \frac{2k}{k} = 2,\]
and
\[x_1x_2 = \frac{l - 4}{k}.\]
Substituting these into the equation $(x_2 + x_1)^2 - 4x_1x_2 = 36$, we get:
\[4 - 4\left(\frac{l - 4}{k}\right) = 36.\]
Simplifying, we have:
\[4 - \frac{4(l - 4)}{k} = 36.\]
Multiplying through by $k$, we get:
\[4k - 4(l - 4) = 36k.\]
Expanding and rearranging terms, we have:
\[4k - 4l + 16 = 36k.\]
Simplifying further, we get:
\[-32k = -4l + 16.\]
Rearranging terms, we have:
\[4l = 32k + 16.\]
Dividing both sides by 4, we get:
\[l = 8k + 4.\]

Now, let's find the sum of the squares of the distances from $A$ and $B$ to the origin. The distance from a point $(x, y)$ to the origin is $\sqrt{x^2 + y^2}$. For point $A$, this is $\sqrt{x_1^2 + (4)^2} = \sqrt{x_1^2 + 16}$. Similarly, for point $B$, this is $\sqrt{x_2^2 + 16}$.

The sum of the squares of the distances from $A$ and $B$ to the origin is then:
\[\sqrt{x_1^2 + 16}^2 + \sqrt{x_2^2 + 16}^2 = x_1^2 + 16 + x_2^2 + 16 = x_1^2 + x_2^2 + 32.\]

We know that $(x_2 - x_1)^2 = 36$, so $(x_2 + x_1)^2 - 4x_1x_2 = 36$. Using Vieta's formulas, we have:
\[(2)^2 - 4\left(\frac{l - 4}{k}\right) = 36.\]
Simplifying, we get:
\[4 - \frac{4(l - 4)}{k} = 36.\]
Multiplying through by $k$, we get:
\[4k - 4(l - 4) = 36k.\]
Expanding and rearranging terms, we have:
\[4k - 4l + 16 = 36k.\]
Simplifying further, we get:
\[-32k = -4l + 16.\]
Rearranging terms, we have:
\[4l = 32k + 16.\]
Dividing both sides by 4, we get:
\[l = 8k + 4.\]

Substituting $l = 8k + 4$ into the equation $4k - 4(l - 4) = 36k$, we get:
\[4k - 4(8k + 4 - 4) = 36k.\]
Simplifying, we have:
\[4k - 4(8k) = 36k.\]
Expanding, we get:
\[4k - 32k = 36k.\]
Simplifying further, we get:
\[-28k = 36k.\]
Adding $28k$ to both sides, we get:
\[0 = 64k.\]
Dividing both sides by 64, we get:
\[k = 0.\]
But $k > 0$, so this solution is not valid.

Let's try another approach. We know that the sum of the squares of the distances from $A$ and $B$ to the origin is $x_1^2 + x_2^2 + 32$. Using the identity $(x_2 - x_1)^2 = (x_2 + x_1)^2 - 4x_1x_2$, we can rewrite this as:
\[x_1^2 + x_2^2 + 32 = (2)^2 - 4\left(\frac{l - 4}{k}\right) + 32 = 4 - \frac{4(l - 4)}{k} + 32.\]
Multiplying through by $k$, we get:
\[kx_1^2 + kx_2^2 + 32k = 4k - 4(l - 4) + 32k.\]
Expanding and rearranging terms, we have:
\[kx_1^2 + kx_2^2 = -32k + 4k + 16 = -28k + 16.\]
Since $x_1^2$ and $x_2^2$ are both nonnegative, the left side of the equation is nonnegative. Therefore, the right side must also be nonnegative:
\[-28k + 16 \geq 0.\]
Adding $28k$ to both sides, we get:
\[16 \geq 28k.\]
Dividing both sides by 28, we get:
\[\frac{16}{28} \geq k.\]
Simplifying the left side, we have:
\[\frac{4}{7} \geq k.\]
But $k > 0$, so this solution is not valid.

Let's try another approach. We know that the sum of the squares of the distances from $A$ and $B$ to the origin is $x_1^2 + x_2^2 + 32$. Using the identity $(x_2 - x_1)^2 = (
