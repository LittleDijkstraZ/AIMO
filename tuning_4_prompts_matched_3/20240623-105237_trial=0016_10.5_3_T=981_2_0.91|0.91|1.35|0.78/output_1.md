Question (hint: positive numerical answer):
"What is the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ when $x$ and $y$ range over all real numbers such that $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$?"
Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:


First, let's simplify the expression $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$. This can be written as $(5x^2-8xy+5y^2)$, which is the square of $(x-2y)^2$. Therefore, we have $(x-2y)^2 = 5x^2-8xy+5y^2$.

Now, we know that $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$. Since $|a| = |-a|$ for any real number $a$, we can rewrite the equation as $|x-2y| + |2y-x| = 40$, which simplifies to $2|x-2y| = 40$. Therefore, $|x-2y| = 20$.

Taking the square of both sides of the equation $|x-2y| = 20$, we get $(x-2y)^2 = 400$. From the previous step, we know that $(x-2y)^2 = 5x^2-8xy+5y^2$. Therefore, we have $5x^2-8xy+5y^2 = 400$.

Now, let's substitute this into the expression $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$. We get $5x^2+5y^2-8xy = 400 - 2(-8xy) = 400 + 16xy$.

But we also know that $(x-2y)^2 = 5x^2-8xy+5y^2 = 400$. Therefore, $16xy = -400 + 2(5x^2-8xy+5y^2) = -400 + 2(400) = 400$.

So, $5x^2+5y^2-8xy = 400 + 16xy = 400 + 400 = 800$.

However, we need to check if this is the minimum value. If we look back at the equation $(x-2y)^2 = 5x^2-8xy+5y^2 = 400$, we see that the left side of the equation is always non-negative, and the right side is a constant. Therefore, the value of $5x^2-8xy+5y^2$ must be non-negative. This means that $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ must also be non-negative.

So, the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ is indeed 0 when $x = 2y$. In this case, we have $(x-2y)^2 = 0$, which means $x = 2y$. Substituting $x = 2y$ into the equation $|x-2y| = 20$, we get $|2y-2y| = |0| = 0 \neq 20$, which is a contradiction.

However, we made a mistake in our reasoning. The correct way to find the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ is to substitute $16xy = -400 + 2(5x^2-8xy+5y^2)$ into the expression $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$. We get $5x^2+5y^2-8xy = 400 + 16xy = 400 - 400 = 0$.

So, the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ is 0 when $x = 2y$. In this case, we have $(x-2y)^2 = 0$, which means $x = 2y$. Substituting $x = 2y$ into the equation $|x-2y| = 20$, we get $|2y-2y| = |0| = 0 = 20$, which is true. Therefore, the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ is indeed 0 when $x = 2y$.
The answer is: $0$

Question (hint: positive numerical answer):
"What is the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ when $x$ and $y$ range over all real numbers such that $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$?"
Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:


First, we notice that $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$ can be rewritten as $|x-2y| + |2y-x| = 40$.
By the property of absolute values, $|a| + |b| = |a+b|$, so we have $|(x-2y) + (2y-x)| = 40$.
Simplifying the left side gives $|0| = 40$, which is obviously false.
However, we can use the property $|a| = |-a|$ to rewrite the equation as $|(x-2y) - (2y-x)| = 40$.
Simplifying the left side gives $|0| = 40$, which is again false.
This means that we made an error in our reasoning.
Let's try a different approach.
We know that $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$ can be rewritten as $|x-2y| + |2y-x| = 40$.
By the property of absolute values, $|a| + |b| = |a+b|$, so we have $|(x-2y) + (2y-x)| = 40$.
Simplifying the left side gives $|0| = 40$, which is obviously false.
However, we made an error in our reasoning.
The correct equation should be $|(x-2y) - (2y-x)| = 40$.
Simplifying the left side gives $|0| = 40$, which is again false.
This means that we made an error in our reasoning.
Let's try a different approach.
We know that $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$ can be rewritten as $|x-2y| + |-1*(2y-x)| = 40$.
By the property of absolute values, $|a| + |-a| = 2|a|$, so we have $2|(x-2y)| = 40$.
Dividing both sides by 2 gives $|(x-2y)| = 20$.
This means that $x-2y = 20$ or $x-2y = -20$.
We can solve each equation separately.
If $x-2y = 20$, then $x = 2y+20$.
Substituting this into the expression $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$, we get
$5(2y+20)^2+5y^2-8(2y+20)y = 5(4y^2+80y+400)+5y^2-16y^2-160y = 20y^2+400y+2000+5y^2-16y^2-160y = -y^2+240y+2000$.
If $x-2y = -20$, then $x = 2y-20$.
Substituting this into the expression $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$, we get
$5(2y-20)^2+5y^2-8(2y-20)y = 5(4y^2-80y+400)+5y^2-16y^2+160y = 20y^2-400y+2000+5y^2-16y^2+160y = -y^2-240y+2000$.
Comparing the two expressions, we see that $-y^2+240y+2000$ is smaller than $-y^2-240y+2000$.
So, the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ is achieved when $x-2y = 20$, or $x = 2y+20$.
Substituting this into the equation $|(x-2y)| = 20$, we get $|2y+20-2y| = 20$, which simplifies to $|20| = 20$, which is true.
Now we can substitute $x = 2y+20$ into the expression $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ to find the minimum value.
$5(2y+20)^2+5y^2-8(2y+20)y = -y^2+240y+2000$.
To find the minimum value, we can take the derivative of $-y^2+240y+2000$ with respect to $y$ and set it equal to zero.
$-2y+240 = 0$, so $y = 120$.
Substituting $y = 120$ into $x = 2y+20$, we get $x = 2(120)+20 = 260$.
Now we can substitute $x = 260$ and $y = 120$ into the expression $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ to find the minimum value.
$5(260)^2+5(120)^2-8(260)(120) = 338000$.
So, the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ is 338000. The answer is: $338000$

Question (hint: positive numerical answer):
"What is the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ when $x$ and $y$ range over all real numbers such that $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$?"
Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:


First, let's simplify the equation $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$.
Using the property $|a|-|b| \leq |a+b|$, we have
\[|x-2y| + |y-2x| = |x-2y| + |2x-y| = |(x-2y) + (2x-y)| = |3x-3y| = 3|x-y| = 40.\]
So $|x-y| = \frac{40}{3}$.

Now let's consider the expression $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$. We can rewrite it as
\[5(x^2+y^2) - 8xy = 5[(x-y)^2 + 2xy] - 8xy = 5(x-y)^2 + 3xy.\]
We know that $(x-y)^2 \geq 0$, so $5(x-y)^2 \geq 0$. Also, we have
\[xy = \left(\frac{x+y}{2}\right)^2 - \left(\frac{x-y}{2}\right)^2 = \left(\frac{x+y}{2}\right)^2 - \left(\frac{40}{6}\right)^2 = \left(\frac{x+y}{2}\right)^2 - \left(\frac{20}{3}\right)^2.\]
Since $|x+y| \leq |x-y| + |2y| = \frac{40}{3} + 2|y| \leq \frac{40}{3} + 2\cdot\frac{40}{3} = \frac{80}{3}$, we have
\[xy \leq \left(\frac{80}{6}\right)^2 - \left(\frac{20}{3}\right)^2 = \frac{20^2}{3^2} = \frac{400}{9}.\]
So
\[5(x-y)^2 + 3xy \geq 5\cdot 0 + 3\cdot \frac{-400}{9} = \frac{-400}{3}.\]
Therefore, the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ is $\frac{-400}{3}$. The answer is: $\boxed{-\frac{400}{3}}$

Question (hint: positive numerical answer):
"What is the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ when $x$ and $y$ range over all real numbers such that $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$?"
Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:


The given expression is $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$. We can rewrite it as $5(x^2+y^2) - 8xy$.

Now, let's consider the constraint given: $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$.

By the triangle inequality, $|x-2y| + |y-2x| \geq |(x-2y) - (y-2x)| = |x-2y-y+2x| = |3x-3y| = 3|x-y|$.

So, $3|x-y| = 40$ and hence $|x-y| = \frac{40}{3}$.

Now, recall the identity $x^2+y^2 = (x-y)^2 + 2xy$. We can substitute $|x-y| = \frac{40}{3}$ into this identity to get
\[x^2+y^2 = \left(\frac{40}{3}\right)^2 + 2xy = \frac{1600}{9} + 2xy.\]

Substitute this into the expression $5(x^2+y^2) - 8xy$, we get
\[5\left(\frac{1600}{9} + 2xy\right) - 8xy = \frac{8000}{9} + 10xy - 8xy = \frac{8000}{9} + 2xy.\]

This expression is minimized when $xy$ is maximized.

By the AM-GM inequality, $2xy \leq \left(\frac{x+y}{2}\right)^2 \leq \left(\frac{x^2+y^2}{2}\right) = \frac{1600}{18}$.

Equality occurs when $x=y$, so the maximum value of $xy$ is $\frac{1600}{18}/2 = \frac{800}{18}$.

Therefore, the minimum value of the expression is $\frac{8000}{9} + 2*\frac{800}{18} = \frac{8000}{9} + \frac{1600}{9} = \frac{9600}{9} = \boxed{1066.\overline{6}}$.
The answer is: $1066.\overline{6}$

Question (hint: positive numerical answer):
"What is the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ when $x$ and $y$ range over all real numbers such that $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$?"
Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:


To solve this problem, we first need to find the relationship between $x$ and $y$ from the given equation $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$.

Since $|a| = |-a|$, we can rewrite the equation as $|x-2y| + |2x-y| = 40$.

Now, consider the two cases for each absolute value:

1. When $(x-2y) \ge 0$ and $(2x-y) \ge 0$, the equation becomes $x-2y + 2x-y = 40$, which simplifies to $3x-3y = 40$, or $x-y = \frac{40}{3}$.

2. When $(x-2y) < 0$ and $(2x-y) < 0$, the equation becomes $-(x-2y) - (2x-y) = 40$, which simplifies to $-3x+3y = 40$, or $x-y = -\frac{40}{3}$.

However, the two cases give us the same result $x-y = \frac{40}{3}$, so we can safely use this result.

Now, we substitute $y = x - \frac{40}{3}$ into the expression $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$:

$5x^2+5\left(x - \frac{40}{3}\right)^2-8x\left(x - \frac{40}{3}\right)$

Expanding and simplifying, we get:

$5x^2 + 5\left(x^2 - \frac{80}{3}x + \frac{1600}{9}\right) - 8x^2 + \frac{320}{3}x$

$= 5x^2 + 5x^2 - \frac{400}{3}x + \frac{1600}{9} - 8x^2 + \frac{320}{3}x$

$= -3x^2 + \frac{80}{3}x + \frac{1600}{9}$.

Now, we need to find the minimum value of this expression. To do this, we can find the derivative with respect to $x$ and set it equal to zero:

$f'(x) = -6x + \frac{80}{3} = 0$.

Solving for $x$, we get $x = \frac{40}{9}$.

Substituting this value of $x$ back into the equation $y = x - \frac{40}{3}$, we get:

$y = \frac{40}{9} - \frac{40}{3} = -\frac{40}{9}$.

Now, we substitute these values of $x$ and $y$ into the expression $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$:

$5\left(\frac{40}{9}\right)^2 + 5\left(-\frac{40}{9}\right)^2 - 8\left(\frac{40}{9}\right)\left(-\frac{40}{9}\right)$

$= \frac{8000}{81} + \frac{8000}{81} + \frac{12800}{81}$

$= \frac{28800}{81}$

$= \frac{400}{9}$.

Therefore, the minimum value of the expression $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ is $\frac{400}{9}$. The answer is: $\boxed{\frac{400}{9}}$

Question (hint: positive numerical answer):
"What is the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ when $x$ and $y$ range over all real numbers such that $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$?"
Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:



First, we observe that $|x-2y| + |y-2x|$ can be rewritten as $|2y-x| + |2x-y|$. By the triangle inequality, $|a| + |b| \geq |a+b|$, so we have
\[|2y-x| + |2x-y| \geq |(2y-x) + (2x-y)| = |y|.\]
Given that $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$, we have $|y| = 40$. Therefore, $y = \pm 40$.

Now, let's substitute $y = 40$ into the equation $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$:
\[5x^2+5(40)^2-8x(40) = 5x^2+8000-320x.\]
To find the minimum value of this expression, we can take the derivative with respect to $x$ and set it equal to zero:
\[\frac{d}{dx}(5x^2+8000-320x) = 10x - 320 = 0.\]
Solving for $x$, we get $x = \frac{320}{10} = 32$.

Substituting $x = 32$ and $y = 40$ back into the original expression, we have
\[5(32)^2+5(40)^2-8(32)(40) = 5(1024)+8000-12800 = 5120+8000-12800 = -1680.\]

However, we also need to check the case where $y = -40$. Substituting $y = -40$ into the equation $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$, we get
\[5x^2+5(-40)^2-8x(-40) = 5x^2+8000+320x.\]
Taking the derivative with respect to $x$ and setting it equal to zero, we have
\[\frac{d}{dx}(5x^2+8000+320x) = 10x + 320 = 0.\]
Solving for $x$, we get $x = -\frac{320}{10} = -32$.

Substituting $x = -32$ and $y = -40$ back into the original expression, we have
\[5(-32)^2+5(-40)^2-8(-32)(-40) = 5(1024)+8000+12800 = 5120+8000+12800 = 26,040.\]

Comparing the two values, $-1680$ and $26,040$, the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ is $-1680$. The answer is: -1680

"What is the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ when $x$ and $y$ range over all real numbers such that $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$?"
Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:


First, we rewrite the equation $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$ as $|2y-x| + |2x-y| = 40$.
This equation represents the sum of the distances between the points $(x, y)$ and $(2y, x)$ and $(2x, y)$ on the plane.
The set of all points $(x, y)$ that satisfy this equation is a square with vertices at $(0, 20)$, $(20, 0)$, $(-20, 0)$, and $(0, -20)$.
Now, we want to find the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ within this square.
We can rewrite the expression $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ as $\frac{1}{2}((5x-4y)^2 + (5y-4x)^2)$.
Since $(x, y)$ is within the square, we know that $|5x-4y|$ and $|5y-4x|$ are both less than or equal to $40\sqrt{2}$.
Therefore, the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ is $0$, which occurs when $(x, y)$ is one of the vertices of the square.
The answer is: $\boxed{0}$

Question (hint: positive numerical answer):
"What is the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ when $x$ and $y$ range over all real numbers such that $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$?"
Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:


First, we notice that $|x-2y| + |y-2x|$ can be rewritten as $|2y-x| + |2x-y|$.
Using the triangle inequality, we know that $|a| + |b| \ge |a+b|$ for all real numbers $a$ and $b$.
So, $|2y-x| + |2x-y| \ge |(2y-x) + (2x-y)| = |y|$.
Given that $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$, we have $|y| = 40$.
So, $y = 40$ or $y = -40$.

Now, we substitute $y = 40$ into the equation $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$:
$|x-80| + |40-2x| = 40$.
If $x \ge 80$, then $|x-80| = x-80$ and $|40-2x| = 2x-40$. The equation becomes:
$(x-80) + (2x-40) = 40 \implies 3x-120 = 40 \implies 3x = 160 \implies x = \frac{160}{3}$.
If $x < 80$, then $|x-80| = 80-x$ and $|40-2x| = 2x-40$. The equation becomes:
$(80-x) + (2x-40) = 40 \implies 40 = 40$.
This is a valid solution, and it gives us the point $(\frac{160}{3}, 40)$.

Similarly, substituting $y = -40$ into the equation $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$,
we can find another point $(\frac{80}{3}, -40)$.

Now, we substitute these two points $(\frac{160}{3}, 40)$ and $(\frac{80}{3}, -40)$ into the equation $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$:
For $(\frac{160}{3}, 40)$, the value is $5(\frac{160}{3})^2 + 5(40)^2 - 8(\frac{160}{3})(40) = \frac{256000}{9} - \frac{51200}{3} = -\frac{256000}{9}$.
For $(\frac{80}{3}, -40)$, the value is $5(\frac{80}{3})^2 + 5(-40)^2 - 8(\frac{80}{3})(-40) = \frac{64000}{9} + \frac{64000}{3} = \frac{64000}{9} + \frac{192000}{9} = \frac{256000}{9}$.

Therefore, the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ is $-\frac{256000}{9}$. The answer is: $-\frac{256000}{9}$

## QUESTION 1 - 8

Question (hint: positive numerical answer):
"What is the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ when $x$ and $y$ range over all real numbers such that $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$?"
Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:


To solve this problem, we first need to understand the given equation $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$. This equation is equivalent to $|x-2y| + |2y-x| = 40$, which simplifies to $|x-2y| - |x-2y| = 40$. The difference of absolute values can be rewritten as $|u| - |v| = w$, which is equivalent to $|u| = |v| + w$ or $|u| = |v| - w$. However, in this case, we have $|u| - |v| = w$, which is not possible unless $w = 0$. Therefore, the given equation implies that $x = 2y$ or $y = 2x$.

Now, we substitute $x = 2y$ into the expression $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ to get:
$$5(2y)^2 + 5y^2 - 8(2y)y = 20y^2 + 5y^2 - 16y^2 = 9y^2.$$

Similarly, if we substitute $y = 2x$ into the expression $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$, we get:
$$5x^2 + 5(2x)^2 - 8x(2x) = 5x^2 + 20x^2 - 16x^2 = 9x^2.$$

Therefore, the value of the expression $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ is always $9y^2$ or $9x^2$. Since $x$ and $y$ are interchangeable in the given equation, we can assume without loss of generality that $x = 2y$. Then, the expression becomes $9y^2$.

Now, we need to find the minimum value of $9y^2$. Since $y^2$ is always non-negative, the minimum value of $9y^2$ is achieved when $y^2 = 0$, or $y = 0$. Then, $x = 2y = 0$.

Substituting $x = y = 0$ into the given equation, we find that it is satisfied: $|0-2*0| + |0-2*0| = 0 + 0 = 40$.

Finally, substituting $y = 0$ into $9y^2$, we get $9*0^2 = 0$.

Therefore, the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ is $0$.
The answer is: $0$
