Question (hint: positive numerical answer):
"For how many positive integers $m$ does the equation \[\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}\] have $4$ distinct solutions?"
Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:


The equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has 4 distinct solutions if and only if $\frac{m}{100} = 2$. This is because the expression inside the absolute value, $\vert x-1 \vert -2$, can only equal 2 or -2 for the equation to have 4 distinct solutions. Setting $\frac{m}{100} = 2$, we can solve for $m$:
\[m = 2 \cdot 100 = 200.\]
Therefore, there is only 1 positive integer $m$ that satisfies the condition, namely $m=200$. The answer is: $\boxed{1}$

Question (hint: positive numerical answer):
"For how many positive integers $m$ does the equation \[\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}\] have $4$ distinct solutions?"
Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:


The equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has $4$ distinct solutions.
This means that the expression inside the absolute value, $\vert x-1 \vert -2$, must be equal to $\frac{m}{100}$ or $-\frac{m}{100}$.
So we have two equations:
$\vert x-1 \vert -2 = \frac{m}{100}$ and $\vert x-1 \vert -2 = -\frac{m}{100}$.
For the first equation, adding $2$ to both sides gives $\vert x-1 \vert = \frac{m}{100} + 2$.
Then we have two cases:
1) $x-1 = \frac{m}{100} + 2$ and 2) $-(x-1) = \frac{m}{100} + 2$.
Simplifying these gives:
1) $x = \frac{m}{100} + 3$ and 2) $x = - \frac{m}{100} + 1$.
For the second equation, adding $2$ to both sides gives $\vert x-1 \vert = 2 - \frac{m}{100}$.
Again, we have two cases:
3) $x-1 = 2 - \frac{m}{100}$ and 4) $-(x-1) = 2 - \frac{m}{100}$.
Simplifying these gives:
3) $x = \frac{12}{100} - \frac{m}{100}$ and 4) $x = - \frac{8}{100} + \frac{m}{100}$.
To have $4$ distinct solutions, we need the two expressions for $x$ in case 1) to be different from the expressions for $x$ in case 3). This gives us the equation $\frac{m}{100} + 3 \neq \frac{12}{100} - \frac{m}{100}$, which simplifies to $m \neq \frac{3}{2}$.
Similarly, we need the expressions for $x$ in case 2) to be different from the expressions for $x$ in case 4). This gives us the equation $-\frac{m}{100} + 1 \neq - \frac{8}{100} + \frac{m}{100}$, which simplifies to $m \neq \frac{10}{3}$.
Therefore, we need $m$ to be an integer that is not equal to $\frac{3}{2}$ or $\frac{10}{3}$. The only positive integers that satisfy this condition are $1$ and $3$.
Therefore, there are $2$ possible values of $m$ for which the equation has $4$ distinct solutions. The answer is: $2$

Question (hint: positive numerical answer):
"For how many positive integers $m$ does the equation \[\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}\] have $4$ distinct solutions?"
Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:


The equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has four distinct solutions.
We know that the absolute value function $\vert x \vert$ is defined as $x$ if $x \geq 0$ and $-x$ if $x < 0$. So we can rewrite the equation as follows:
\[\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}.\]
This equation has four distinct solutions, which means that the expression inside the absolute value, $\vert x-1 \vert -2$, must be equal to $\frac{m}{100}$, $-\frac{m}{100}$, $\frac{m}{100}$ and $-\frac{m}{100}$ at four different values of $x$.

The expression $\vert x-1 \vert -2$ changes its sign at $x=1$. So the solutions must be in the intervals $(-\infty, 1)$ and $(1, \infty)$.

For $x < 1$, we have $\vert x-1 \vert = -(x-1) = 1-x$. So the equation becomes:
\[1-x-2 = \frac{m}{100},\]
which simplifies to:
\[x = 1 - \frac{m}{100} - 2 = 1 - \frac{m+200}{100} = \frac{800-m}{100}.\]
For $x > 1$, we have $\vert x-1 \vert = x-1$. So the equation becomes:
\[x-1-2 = \frac{m}{100},\]
which simplifies to:
\[x = 1 + \frac{m}{100} + 2 = 1 + \frac{m+200}{100} = \frac{m+300}{100}.\]
For the equation to have four distinct solutions, the expressions $\frac{800-m}{100}$ and $\frac{m+300}{100}$ must be distinct for different values of $m$. This happens when $m$ is between 100 and 700 (inclusive). Therefore, there are 6 possible values for $m$ (100, 200, 300, 400, 500, 600, 700). The answer is: 6

Question (hint: positive numerical answer):
"For how many positive integers $m$ does the equation \[\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}\] have $4$ distinct solutions?"
Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:


The equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has 4 distinct solutions if and only if $\frac{m}{100}$ is a positive number less than 2 but greater than or equal to 0. This is because the expression inside the absolute value on the left side, $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert$, can take on any value from 0 to 2, inclusive.

So we have $0 \leq \frac{m}{100} < 2$. Multiplying through by 100 gives $0 \leq m < 200$. The positive integers $m$ that satisfy this inequality and are also divisors of 200 are 1, 2, 4, 5, 8, 10, 20, 25, 40, 50, 100, and 200. However, we only want the values of $m$ for which the equation has 4 distinct solutions. 

By analyzing the graph of $y = \vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert$, we can see that it intersects the line $y = \frac{m}{100}$ at 4 distinct points when $\frac{m}{100}$ is greater than 1 but less than 2. This means the only values of $m$ that we need to consider are 100 and 200. 

For $m=100$, we have $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{100}{100}=1$, which gives us two solutions for $x$. For $m=200$, we have $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{200}{100}=2$, which gives us four solutions for $x$. Therefore, the only value of $m$ that results in 4 distinct solutions is $m=200$.

The number of positive integers $m$ that satisfy the condition is 1. The answer is: $1$

Question (hint: positive numerical answer):
"For how many positive integers $m$ does the equation \[\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}\] have $4$ distinct solutions?"
Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:



First, we need to understand the graph of the function $f(x) = ||x-1| - 2|$. The function is a piecewise function that looks like a "V" shape with the vertex at $x=1$. The width of the "V" is determined by the value of $2$. The equation $|f(x)| = \frac{m}{100}$ will have four distinct solutions when $\frac{m}{100}$ is equal to the height of the "V".

The height of the "V" can be found by looking at the maximum and minimum values of the function $f(x) = ||x-1| - 2|$. The minimum value of $f(x)$ is $-2$ and the maximum value is $2$. So, the height of the "V" is $2 - (-2) = 4$.

Therefore, the equation $|f(x)| = \frac{m}{100}$ will have four distinct solutions when $\frac{m}{100} = 4$. Solving for $m$, we get $m = 400$. So there is only one value of $m$ for which the equation has four distinct solutions, and that value is $m = 400$.
The value of $m$ is $400$. The answer is: $\boxed{1}$

Question (hint: positive numerical answer):
"For how many positive integers $m$ does the equation \[\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}\] have $4$ distinct solutions?"
Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:


The equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has $4$ distinct solutions.
We know that the absolute value function $\vert x \vert$ splits into two cases: $x$ if $x \geq 0$, and $-x$ if $x < 0$. So, we can split the equation into two cases as well.
Case 1: $\vert x-1 \vert -2 = \frac{m}{100}$.
This simplifies to $\vert x-1 \vert = 2 + \frac{m}{100}$.
Again, we split into two cases:
Case 1.1: $x-1 = 2 + \frac{m}{100}$, which simplifies to $x = 3 + \frac{m}{100}$.
Case 1.2: $-(x-1) = 2 + \frac{m}{100}$, which simplifies to $x = -1 + \frac{m}{100}$.
So for Case 1, we have two solutions: $x = 3 + \frac{m}{100}$ and $x = -1 + \frac{m}{100}$.
Case 2: $\vert x-1 \vert -2 = -\frac{m}{100}$.
This simplifies to $\vert x-1 \vert = 2 - \frac{m}{100}$.
Again, we split into two cases:
Case 2.1: $x-1 = 2 - \frac{m}{100}$, which simplifies to $x = 3 - \frac{m}{100}$.
Case 2.2: $-(x-1) = 2 - \frac{m}{100}$, which simplifies to $x = -1 - \frac{m}{100}$.
So for Case 2, we have two more solutions: $x = 3 - \frac{m}{100}$ and $x = -1 - \frac{m}{100}$.
In total, we have four distinct solutions: $x = 3 + \frac{m}{100}$, $x = -1 + \frac{m}{100}$, $x = 3 - \frac{m}{100}$, and $x = -1 - \frac{m}{100}$.
These four solutions are distinct if and only if the four denominators $\frac{m}{100}$ are distinct. This happens if and only if $m$ is one of the $100$ positive integers from $1$ to $100$.
Therefore, the number of positive integers $m$ such that the equation has $4$ distinct solutions is $100$.
The answer is: $100$

Question (hint: positive numerical answer):
"For how many positive integers $m$ does the equation \[\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}\] have $4$ distinct solutions?"
Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:


To begin, let's first understand the problem. The equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has 4 distinct solutions, and we're asked to find the number of positive integers $m$ that satisfy this condition.

The equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ is a problem involving absolute value, which can be tricky to solve. However, we can simplify it by considering the different cases for the absolute value.

The absolute value function $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert$ will be equal to $\frac{m}{100}$ when the expression inside the absolute value is equal to either $\frac{m}{100}$ or $-\frac{m}{100}$. So, we can split the equation into two sub-equations:

1. $\vert x-1 \vert -2 = \frac{m}{100}$
2. $\vert x-1 \vert -2 = -\frac{m}{100}$

Now, let's solve each sub-equation separately:

1. $\vert x-1 \vert -2 = \frac{m}{100} \implies \vert x-1 \vert = \frac{m}{100} + 2$
2. $\vert x-1 \vert -2 = -\frac{m}{100} \implies \vert x-1 \vert = 2 - \frac{m}{100}$

For each of these equations, we need to consider the two cases for the absolute value:

For equation 1:
Case 1: $x-1 = \frac{m}{100} + 2 \implies x = \frac{m}{100} + 3$
Case 2: $x-1 = -(\frac{m}{100} + 2) \implies x = 1 - \frac{m}{100} - 2 \implies x = - \frac{m}{100} - 1$

For equation 2:
Case 1: $x-1 = 2 - \frac{m}{100} \implies x = 3 - \frac{m}{100}$
Case 2: $x-1 = - (2 - \frac{m}{100}) \implies x = 1 - 2 + \frac{m}{100} \implies x = \frac{m}{100} - 1$

Now, we need to find the values of $m$ for which these equations give 4 distinct solutions. By analyzing the solutions, we can see that for equation 1, we get 2 distinct solutions when $\frac{m}{100} + 3 > - \frac{m}{100} - 1$, which simplifies to $m > -200$. Similarly, for equation 2, we get 2 distinct solutions when $3 - \frac{m}{100} > \frac{m}{100} - 1$, which simplifies to $m < 100$.

Therefore, the values of $m$ that satisfy both conditions are the positive integers in the range $1 \leq m \leq 100$. There are exactly 100 such integers. So, the number of positive integers $m$ that make the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ have 4 distinct solutions is 100. The answer is: 100

Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:


The equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has $4$ distinct solutions if and only if $\frac{m}{100}=2$.
This is because the expression inside the absolute value, $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert$, can be $2$ in exactly $4$ ways: it can be $2$, $-2$, $2- \frac{m}{100}$, or $2 + \frac{m}{100}$.
Setting $\frac{m}{100}=2$, we get $m=200$.
Therefore, there is only $1$ positive integer $m$ that satisfies the condition, namely $m=200$. The answer is: $1$
