Question (hint: positive numerical answer):
"For how many positive integers $m$ does the equation \[\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}\] have $4$ distinct solutions?"
Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:


The equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has 4 distinct solutions if and only if $\frac{m}{100}$ is in the interval $(0,2)$. This is because the function $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert$ has a graph that is a "V" shape with two "humps" each of height 1 centered at $x=1$. The distance between the humps is 4, so for the equation to have 4 distinct solutions, the right side of the equation, $\frac{m}{100}$, must be strictly between 0 and 2.

If $\frac{m}{100} < 0$, then the equation has no solutions because the absolute value function is always nonnegative.

If $\frac{m}{100} = 0$, then the equation has at most 2 solutions because the left side of the equation is always nonnegative while the right side is 0.

If $\frac{m}{100} > 2$, then the equation has at most 2 solutions because the absolute value function "compresses" the graph of $y = \vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert$ to a graph that is bounded above by 2, while the right side of the equation is greater than 2.

Therefore, the equation has 4 distinct solutions if and only if $0 < \frac{m}{100} < 2$. Multiplying all parts of the inequality by 100 gives $0 < m < 200$. The number of positive integers in this interval is 199. However, we must exclude the value $m=100$ because in this case the equation simplifies to $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=1$, which has only 2 solutions. Therefore, the number of positive integers $m$ for which the equation has 4 distinct solutions is 199-1 = 198. The answer is: $198$

Question (hint: positive numerical answer):
"For how many positive integers $m$ does the equation \[\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}\] have $4$ distinct solutions?"
Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:


The equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has 4 distinct solutions if and only if $\frac{m}{100}=2$. This is because the graph of $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert$ consists of a "V" shape that has a maximum value of 2 and a minimum value of 0. The equation $\frac{m}{100}=2$ has only one solution, $m=200$. Therefore, there is only one positive integer $m$ for which the equation has 4 distinct solutions. The answer is: $1$

Question (hint: positive numerical answer):
"For how many positive integers $m$ does the equation \[\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}\] have $4$ distinct solutions?"
Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:


The equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has 4 distinct solutions.
The right side of the equation is always positive, so the left side of the equation must also be positive.
This means that $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert > 0$.
The expression $\vert x-1 \vert -2$ can be positive or negative, so we consider both cases separately.

Case 1: $\vert x-1 \vert -2 > 0$.
This implies that $\vert x-1 \vert > 2$.
This means that $x-1 > 2$ or $x-1 < -2$.
Simplifying these inequalities gives $x > 3$ or $x < -1$.
So the solutions are $x > 3$ or $x < -1$.

Case 2: $\vert x-1 \vert -2 < 0$.
This implies that $\vert x-1 \vert < 2$.
This means that $-2 < x-1 < 2$.
Adding 1 to all parts of the inequality gives $-1 < x < 3$.
So the solutions are $-1 < x < 3$.

Combining the solutions from both cases, we see that the solutions are $x < -1$, $-1 < x < 3$, and $x > 3$.
To have 4 distinct solutions, we need the value of $\frac{m}{100}$ to be equal to the distance between the endpoints of the intervals.
The distance between the endpoints of the interval $-1 < x < 3$ is 4.
Therefore, we must have $\frac{m}{100} = 4$, which implies $m = 400$.

Therefore, there is only one positive integer $m$ that satisfies the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ and has 4 distinct solutions. The value of $m$ is 400.
The answer is: 1

Question (hint: positive numerical answer):
"For how many positive integers $m$ does the equation \[\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}\] have $4$ distinct solutions?"
Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:


The equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has $4$ distinct solutions,
which means that the right side of the equation is between $0$ and $2$.
So we have $0<\frac{m}{100}<2$, which gives $0<m<200$.
The positive integers $m$ that satisfy this inequality are $1, 2, \ldots, 199$.
Therefore, there are $199$ positive integers $m$ for which the equation has $4$ distinct solutions. The answer is: $199$

Question (hint: positive numerical answer):
"For how many positive integers $m$ does the equation \[\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}\] have $4$ distinct solutions?"
Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:


The equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has 4 distinct solutions if and only if $\frac{m}{100}$ is equal to the value of $|\vert x-1 \vert -2|$ at the points where the two functions intersect.
The graph of $|\vert x-1 \vert -2|$ is a "hockey stick" with vertices at $(1-2,0)$, $(1,2)$, and $(1+2,0)$, which means it takes values between 0 and 2.
Thus, $\frac{m}{100}$ must be a value in the interval $(0,2)$, so $0 < \frac{m}{100} < 2$.
Multiplying all sides of the inequalities by 100 gives $0 < m < 200$.
The positive integers $m$ that satisfy this inequality are the integers from 1 to 199.
However, we need the number of these integers that divide 100 evenly, so we divide 200 by 100 to get 2.
Therefore, there are 2 positive integers $m$ for which the equation has 4 distinct solutions.
The answer is: 2

Question (hint: positive numerical answer):
"For how many positive integers $m$ does the equation \[\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}\] have $4$ distinct solutions?"
Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:


The equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has 4 distinct solutions if and only if $\frac{m}{100}$ is strictly between 1 and 2. This is because the expression on the left side of the equation, $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert$, can take on any value from 0 to 3, and if $\frac{m}{100}$ is less than or equal to 1 or greater than or equal to 2, the equation will have either 2 or 0 solutions respectively.
So, we want to find the number of positive integers $m$ such that $1 < \frac{m}{100} < 2$. Multiplying all sides of the inequalities by 100 gives $100 < m < 200$. The positive integers $m$ that satisfy this inequality are the integers from 101 to 199, inclusive. To find the number of these integers, we subtract the smallest integer in the range from the largest integer in the range and then add 1 (because both endpoints are included). So, the number of such integers is $199 - 101 + 1 = 99$.
Therefore, there are 99 positive integers $m$ for which the equation has 4 distinct solutions. The answer is: $99$.

Question (hint: positive numerical answer):
"For how many positive integers $m$ does the equation \[\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}\] have $4$ distinct solutions?"
Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:


The equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has four distinct solutions if and only if $\frac{m}{100} = 2$.

To see why, let's first consider the absolute value equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=k$ for some positive constant $k$. This equation will have four distinct solutions if and only if $k = 2$.

When $k < 2$, the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=k$ has two distinct solutions. When $k = 2$, the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=k$ has four distinct solutions. When $k > 2$, the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=k$ has no solutions.

So, we need to find the value of $m$ such that $\frac{m}{100} = 2$, which gives $m = 200$.

Therefore, there is only one positive integer $m$ for which the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has four distinct solutions. The value of $m$ is 200. The answer is: $1$

Question (hint: positive numerical answer):
"For how many positive integers $m$ does the equation \[\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}\] have $4$ distinct solutions?"
Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:


The equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has 4 distinct solutions if and only if $\frac{m}{100} = 2$.
This is because the expression $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert$ oscillates between 0 and 4, and only when the right side is equal to 2 does it have 4 distinct solutions.

If we solve the equation $\frac{m}{100} = 2$, we find that $m = 200$.

Therefore, there is only one positive integer $m$ for which the equation has 4 distinct solutions, and that is $m = 200$.
The answer is: 1
