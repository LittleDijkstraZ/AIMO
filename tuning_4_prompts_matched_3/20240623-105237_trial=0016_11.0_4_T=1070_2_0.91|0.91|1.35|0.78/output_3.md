Question (hint: positive numerical answer):
"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"
Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:



The expression $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2)$ equals to 0 if and only if either $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$, $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$, $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$, or $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$.

The first two equations are equivalent to $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. The absolute value equations can be rewritten as $x + y = \pm 10$ and $x - y = \pm 10$. These four lines form a square with side length 10.

The last two equations are equivalent to $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$, which can be rewritten as $x = \pm 8$ and $y = \pm 8$. These four lines form a square with side length 16.

Therefore, the points $\left(x, y\right)$ that satisfy the original equation are those that lie on the boundary of the two squares. The convex polygon that these points enclose is the union of the two squares, so its area is the sum of the areas of the two squares.

The area of a square with side length $a$ is $a^2$, so the area of the smaller square is $10^2 = 100$ and the area of the larger square is $16^2 = 256$. Adding these areas gives a total area of $100 + 256 = 356$.

So the area of the convex polygon is 356. The answer is: $356$

"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"
Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:


The equation $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + (\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ implies that $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. These are the equations of two lines, $x + y = 10$ and $x + y = -10$, and $x - y = 10$ and $x - y = -10$.
Similarly, the equation $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + (\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ implies that $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$. These are the equations of two lines, $x = 8$ and $x = -8$, and $y = 8$ and $y = -8$.
The four lines intersect to form a square with side length 10. The area of this square is $10^2 = 100$. The answer is: $100$

Question (hint: positive numerical answer):
"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"
Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:


The equation given is a product of two expressions equal to zero. This means that either the first expression is zero or the second expression is zero.

Let's consider the first expression: $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2) = 0$.

For this expression to be zero, both $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ and $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$. This means $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$.

The absolute value equation $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ gives us two lines: $x + y = 10$ and $x + y = -10$. Similarly, $\vert x - y \vert = 10$ gives us the lines $x - y = 10$ and $x - y = -10$.

These lines form a rectangle with vertices at $(10,0)$, $(0,10)$, $(-10,0)$ and $(0,-10)$.

Now let's consider the second expression: $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$.

For this expression to be zero, both $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ and $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$. This means $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$.

The absolute value equation $\vert x \vert = 8$ gives us two lines: $x = 8$ and $x = -8$. Similarly, $\vert y \vert = 8$ gives us the lines $y = 8$ and $y = -8$.

These lines form a square with vertices at $(8,8)$, $(8,-8)$, $(-8,8)$ and $(-8,-8)$.

The intersection of the rectangle and the square is the convex polygon whose area we are asked to find. This polygon is a smaller square, with side length 10 (the smaller of the two lengths).

The area of a square is given by the square of the length of its side. So the area of the polygon is $10^2 = 100$. The answer is: $100$

"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"
Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:


The expression $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2)$ is equal to zero if and only if either $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$.
This means that either $\vert x + y \vert = 10$, $\vert x - y \vert = 10$, $\vert x \vert = 8$, or $\vert y \vert = 8$.

The equations $\vert x + y \vert = 10$, $\vert x - y \vert = 10$, $\vert x \vert = 8$, and $\vert y \vert = 8$ represent the boundaries of the points satisfying the equation.

The graph of these equations is a square with side length 16, so the area of the convex polygon is $16^2 = 256$.
The answer is: 256

Question (hint: positive numerical answer):
"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"
Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:


The expression $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2)$ is equal to zero if and only if at least one of the factors is zero.
This means that either $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$.
For the first factor to be zero, we must have $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$.
This implies that $x + y = \pm 10$ and $x - y = \pm 10$.
Solving these equations gives us the vertices of a square with side length 10: $(5,5), (5,-5), (-5,-5), (-5,5)$.
For the second factor to be zero, we must have $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$.
This implies that $x = \pm 8$ and $y = \pm 8$.
Solving these equations gives us the vertices of a square with side length 16: $(8,8), (8,-8), (-8,-8), (-8,8)$.
The total region enclosed by the two squares is a rectangle with length 24 and width 16.
The area of this rectangle is $24 \times 16 = 384$.
The answer is: 384

"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"
Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:



The product of two numbers is zero if and only if at least one of the numbers is zero. Therefore, the equation $A \cdot B = 0$ implies that either $A = 0$ or $B = 0$.

So, the given equation $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + (\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + (\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$.

For the first equation, $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + (\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$, to be true, both $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ and $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$. This implies that $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. These are the equations of two lines in the coordinate plane, and they form a square with side length 10.

For the second equation, $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + (\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$, to be true, both $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ and $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$. This implies that $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$. This is a square with side length 16 (from -8 to 8 on both axes).

The area of the square formed by the first equation is $10 \times 10 = 100$, and the area of the square formed by the second equation is $16 \times 16 = 256$. The area of the convex polygon formed by the intersection of these two squares is the sum of the areas of the two squares, which is $100 + 256 = 356$.
The answer is: $356$

"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"
Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:


The product of two numbers is zero if and only if at least one of the numbers is zero. Therefore, the equation
$$((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$$
is satisfied if and only if either
$$((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2) = 0$$
or
$$((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0.$$
The first equation is satisfied if and only if $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$, which implies that $x = 0$ and $y = 0$.
The second equation is satisfied if and only if $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$, which implies that $-8 \leq x \leq 8$ and $-8 \leq y \leq 8$.
Therefore, the points satisfying the equation are the points on the square with vertices at $(8,8)$, $(8,-8)$, $(-8,8)$, and $(-8,-8)$, as well as the origin $(0,0)$.
The side length of this square is $16$, so the area of the square is $16^2 = 256$.
Therefore, the area of the convex polygon enclosed by the points is $256$. The answer is: $256$

Question (hint: positive numerical answer):
"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"
Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:


The expression $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2)$ equals to zero if and only if either $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$, $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$, $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$, or $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$.
Each of these equations is satisfied if and only if the absolute values of their arguments are equal to 10 or 8.
For the equations $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ and $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$, this means that $x + y = \pm 10$ and $x - y = \pm 10$.
These four lines are the sides of a square with side length 10.
For the equations $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ and $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$, this means that $x = \pm 8$ and $y = \pm 8$.
These four lines are the sides of a square with side length 8.
The intersection of the two squares is the convex polygon in question.
The side length of the smaller square is 8, so its area is $8^2 = 64$.
The side length of the larger square is 10, so its area is $10^2 = 100$.
The area of the convex polygon is the difference of the areas of the two squares, which is $100 - 64 = 36$.
So the area of the convex polygon is 36. The answer is: $36$

Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:


The equation $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + (\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ implies that $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$.

Question (hint: positive numerical answer):
"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"
Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:



The expression $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2)$ equals zero if and only if at least one of the factors equals zero.

Setting each factor equal to zero gives us the following systems of equations:

1. $\vert x + y \vert - 10 = 0$ and $\vert x - y \vert - 10 = 0$ which implies $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$.
2. $\vert x \vert - 8 = 0$ and $\vert y \vert - 8 = 0$ which implies $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$.

For the first system, we have four cases to consider:

1. $x + y = 10$ and $x - y = 10$ which implies $x = 10$ and $y = 0$.
2. $x + y = 10$ and $x - y = -10$ which implies $x = 0$ and $y = 10$.
3. $x + y = -10$ and $x - y = 10$ which implies $x = 0$ and $y = -10$.
4. $x + y = -10$ and $x - y = -10$ which implies $x = -10$ and $y = 0$.

For the second system, we have four cases to consider:

1. $x = 8$ and $y = 8$.
2. $x = 8$ and $y = -8$.
3. $x = -8$ and $y = 8$.
4. $x = -8$ and $y = -8$.

Therefore, the points that satisfy the given equation are $(10, 0)$, $(0, 10)$, $(0, -10)$, $(-10, 0)$, $(8, 8)$, $(8, -8)$, $(-8, 8)$, and $(-8, -8)$. These points form a square with side length 20. The area of this square is $20^2 = 400$.

"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"
Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:


The given equation is $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$. For the product of two numbers to be zero, either one of the numbers must be zero. Therefore, either $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$.
If $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$, then $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$, which implies that $x + y = \pm 10$ and $x - y = \pm 10$. Solving these equations gives us the vertices of the square $(4,6)$, $(4,-6)$, $(-4,-6)$, and $(-4,6)$.
If $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$, then $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$, which implies that $x = \pm 8$ and $y = \pm 8$. Solving these equations gives us the vertices of the square $(8,8)$, $(8,-8)$, $(-8,-8)$, and $(-8,8)$.
The union of these two squares forms a larger square with side length $10\sqrt{2}$, so its area is $(10\sqrt{2})^2 = 200$.
Therefore, the area of the convex polygon is $200$. The answer is: $200$

Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:



The product of two numbers is zero if and only if at least one of the numbers is zero. Therefore, the equation
\[((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0\]
implies that either $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$.

If $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$, then $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$, which implies that $x + y = \pm 10$ and $x - y = \pm 10$. Solving these equations gives us the vertices of the square: $(8, 2)$, $(8, -2)$, $(-8, -2)$, and $(-8, 2)$.

If $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$, then $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$, which implies that $x = \pm 8$ and $y = \pm 8$. Solving these equations gives us the vertices of the square: $(8, 8)$, $(8, -8)$, $(-8, -8)$, and $(-8, 8)$.

Therefore, the points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying the equation enclose a square with side length $20$. The area of this square is $20^2 = 400$. The answer is: $400$.

Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:


The product of two numbers is zero if and only if at least one of the numbers is zero. Therefore, the equation $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ is satisfied if either $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$.

If $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$, then both $\vert x + y \vert - 10 = 0$ and $\vert x - y \vert - 10 = 0$, which implies that $x + y = \pm 10$ and $x - y = \pm 10$. Solving these equations, we get the vertices of the polygon as $(0, 10), (0, -10), (10, 0), (-10, 0)$.

If $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$, then both $\vert x \vert - 8 = 0$ and $\vert y \vert - 8 = 0$, which implies that $x = \pm 8$ and $y = \pm 8$. So, we get the vertices of the polygon as $(8, 8), (8, -8), (-8, 8), (-8, -8)$.

The convex polygon formed by these vertices is a square with side length 10. The area of the square is $10^2 = 100$. So, the area of the convex polygon is 100. The answer is: $100$
