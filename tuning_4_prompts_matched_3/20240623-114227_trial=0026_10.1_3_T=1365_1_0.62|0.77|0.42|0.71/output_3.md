Interesting, let's analyze step by step:



The equation $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + (\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + (\vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ is satisfied only when both $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ and $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ and $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ and $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$.

This implies that $\vert x + y \vert = 10$, $\vert x - y \vert = 10$, $\vert x \vert = 8$, and $\vert y \vert = 8$.

Solving these equations, we get the following:

1. $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ gives $x + y = 10$ or $x + y = -10$.
2. $\vert x - y \vert = 10$ gives $x - y = 10$ or $x - y = -10$.
3. $\vert x \vert = 8$ gives $x = 8$ or $x = -8$.
4. $\vert y \vert = 8$ gives $y = 8$ or $y = -8$.

By solving these equations, we find that the points that satisfy the equation are:

$(8, 8)$, $(8, -8)$, $(-8, 8)$, and $(-8, -8)$.

These points form a square with side length $16$. The area of the square is $16^2 = 256$.

So the area of the convex polygon is $256$. The answer is: $256$

Below is a math problem you are to solve (positive numerical answer):
"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"

Interesting, let's analyze step by step:



The equation is a product of two terms equal to zero, so either the first term is zero or the second term is zero. This gives us two systems of equations to solve:

1. $\vert x + y \vert - 10 = 0$ and $\vert x - y \vert - 10 = 0$
2. $\vert x \vert - 8 = 0$ and $\vert y \vert - 8 = 0$

For the first system, we have $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. This implies that $x + y = \pm 10$ and $x - y = \pm 10$. Solving these equations, we get the vertices of the polygon: $(0, 10)$, $(0, -10)$, $(10, 0)$, and $(-10, 0)$.

For the second system, we have $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$. This implies that $x = \pm 8$ and $y = \pm 8$. Solving these equations, we get the vertices of the polygon: $(8, 8)$, $(8, -8)$, $(-8, 8)$, and $(-8, -8)$.

Now we can plot these points on a coordinate plane and connect them to form a square with side length 10. The area of this square is $10^2 = 100$.

The answer is: $100$

Below is a math problem you are to solve (positive numerical answer):
"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"

Interesting, let's analyze step by step:



The equation given is $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$.

For the product of two factors to be zero, either one of the factors must be zero. Therefore, we have two cases:

1. $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$
2. $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$

From case 1, we have $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. This implies that $x + y = \pm 10$ and $x - y = \pm 10$. Solving these equations, we get the vertices of the polygon as $(0, 10)$, $(0, -10)$, $(10, 0)$, $(-10, 0)$, $(8, 8)$, $(8, -8)$, $(-8, 8)$, and $(-8, -8)$.

From case 2, we have $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$. This implies that $x = \pm 8$ and $y = \pm 8$.

Now, let's plot these points on a graph and connect them to form the polygon. The polygon is a square with side length 16.

The area of a square is given by side length squared, so the area of this square is $16^2 = 256$.

So, the area of the convex polygon is 256 square units. The answer is: $256$

Interesting, let's analyze step by step:



The given equation is a product of two terms equal to zero. This means that either the first term is zero or the second term is zero.

The first term is $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)$. This term equals zero if and only if both $\vert x + y \vert - 10 = 0$ and $\vert x - y \vert - 10 = 0$. This implies that $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$.

The second term is $((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2)$. This term equals zero if and only if both $\vert x \vert - 8 = 0$ and $\vert y \vert - 8 = 0$. This implies that $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$.

From $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$, we can deduce that $x = 0$ and $y = 0$.

From $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$, we can deduce that $-8 \leq x \leq 8$ and $-8 \leq y \leq 8$.

Therefore, the points that satisfy the given equation are the points in the square with vertices at $(8,8)$, $(-8,8)$, $(-8,-8)$, and $(8,-8)$. The side length of this square is $16$, so its area is $16^2 = 256$.

So, the area of the convex polygon is $256$. The answer is: $256$

Interesting, let's analyze step by step:



The equation given is a product of two expressions equal to zero. This means that either the first expression is zero or the second expression is zero. 

The first expression is $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)$ and the second expression is $((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2)$.

Setting each expression to zero, we get:

1. $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0 \Rightarrow \vert x + y \vert = 10$
2. $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0 \Rightarrow \vert x - y \vert = 10$
3. $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0 \Rightarrow \vert x \vert = 8$
4. $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0 \Rightarrow \vert y \vert = 8$

From 3 and 4, we get that the points must lie within a square with side length 16 (since $|x| = 8$ and $|y| = 8$ means $-8 \leq x \leq 8$ and $-8 \leq y \leq 8$).

From 1 and 2, we get that the points must lie on a square grid with a spacing of 10 units (since $|x + y| = 10$ and $|x - y| = 10$ means that the points must be 10 units apart in both the x and y directions).

The intersection of these two conditions is a square with side length 10 (the smaller square that fits within the larger square).

The area of this square is $10^2 = 100$.

So, the area of the convex polygon is 100 square units. The answer is: $100$

Interesting, let's analyze step by step:



The equation given is:
$$((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$$

This equation is equal to zero if either of the two terms is zero. So we have two cases:

Case 1: $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ and $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ and $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$.
From the first equation, we have $\vert x + y \vert = 10$, and from the second and third equations, we have $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$.

Case 2: $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ and $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ and $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$.
From the first equation, we have $\vert x - y \vert = 10$, and from the second and third equations, we have $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$.

For both cases, we have $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$, which means $-8 \leq x, y \leq 8$.

Now, let's consider the absolute value equations in each case:

Case 1: $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$.
These equations represent a square with side length 10, centered at the origin (0,0), with vertices at $(\pm 5, 0)$, $(0, \pm 5)$, $(0, \pm 5)$, and $(\pm 5, 0)$.

Case 2: $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$.
These equations represent a square with side length 10, centered at the origin (0,0), with vertices at $(\pm 5, 0)$, $(0, \pm 5)$, $(0, \pm 5)$, and $(\pm 5, 0)$.

In both cases, we get the same square with side length 10. The area of this square is $10^2 = 100$.

So, the area of the convex polygon is 100.

The answer is: $100$

Interesting, let's analyze step by step:



The equation given is $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$.

This equation equals to zero if and only if either of the two factors equals to zero. Therefore, we have two cases:

1. $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$. This equation implies that $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. The only way this can happen is if $x = y = \pm 10$ or $x = -y = \pm 10$. This gives us the vertices of a square with side length 20.

2. $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$. This equation implies that $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$. The only way this can happen is if $x = y = \pm 8$ or $x = -y = \pm 8$. This gives us the vertices of a square with side length 16.

Now, we can find the area of the convex polygon formed by the union of these two squares. The side length of the larger square is 20, so its area is $20^2 = 400$. The side length of the smaller square is 16, so its area is $16^2 = 256$. The area of the convex polygon is the sum of the areas of these two squares, which is $400 + 256 = 656$.

Therefore, the area of the convex polygon is 656. Since we are asked for a positive integer, the result is valid. The answer is: $656$.

Interesting, let's analyze step by step:



The equation is given as:
$$((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$$

This equation equals zero if either of the two factors equals zero. This gives us two sets of equations to solve:

1. $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ and $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$
2. $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ and $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$

For the first set of equations, we have:

1.1. $\vert x + y \vert = 10$
1.2. $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$

For the second set of equations, we have:

2.1. $\vert x - y \vert = 10$
2.2. $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$

From 1.2 and 2.2, we can see that $x$ and $y$ must be in the range $[-8, 8]$.

Now, let's consider 1.1 and 2.1. For 1.1, we have $x + y = 10$ or $x + y = -10$. For 2.1, we have $x - y = 10$ or $x - y = -10$.

These equations describe a square with side length 10, centered at the origin, and its vertices are at $(8, 2)$, $(8, -2)$, $(-8, -2)$, and $(-8, 2)$.

The area of this square is $10^2 = 100$.

So, the area of the convex polygon is 100.

The answer is: $100$
