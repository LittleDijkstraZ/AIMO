Interesting, let's analyze step by step:



The equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has 4 distinct solutions. We know that $\frac{m}{100}$ is a positive number, so $m$ must be a positive integer. We want to find the number of such $m$.

First, let's consider the absolute value function $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert$. This function has a "V" shape, and it equals 0 when $\vert x-1 \vert = 2$, which gives us $x = 3$ and $x = -1$. So the function $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert$ is equal to 0 when $x = 3$ or $x = -1$.

Now, let's consider the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$. This equation has 4 distinct solutions when the value of $\frac{m}{100}$ is equal to the distance between the two "V"s in the graph of $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert$. The distance between the two "V"s is 2, so we must have $\frac{m}{100} = 2$, which gives us $m = 200$.

So the only positive integer $m$ for which the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has 4 distinct solutions is $m = 200$.

Therefore, the number of positive integers $m$ for which the equation has 4 distinct solutions is 1. The answer is: $1$

Interesting, let's analyze step by step:



The equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has 4 distinct solutions. This means that the right-hand side $\frac{m}{100}$ must be equal to 2. Therefore, we have $m=200$.

Now, let's verify that this value of $m$ indeed gives us 4 distinct solutions. Substituting $m=200$ into the equation, we get $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{200}{100}=2$. This simplifies to $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=2$.

We can solve this equation by considering two cases:

1. If $\vert x-1 \vert -2 \geq 0$, then the equation becomes $\vert x-1 \vert -2=2$, which simplifies to $\vert x-1 \vert =4$. This gives us two solutions: $x-1=4$ or $x-1=-4$, so $x=5$ or $x=-3$.

2. If $\vert x-1 \vert -2 < 0$, then the equation becomes $-\vert x-1 \vert +2=2$, which simplifies to $\vert x-1 \vert =0$. This gives us one solution: $x=1$.

So, the 4 distinct solutions are $x=-3$, $x=1$, and $x=5$.

Therefore, the value of $m$ that gives us 4 distinct solutions is indeed $m=200$. Since $200$ is a positive integer, the answer is $\boxed{1}$.
The answer is: $1$

Interesting, let's analyze step by step:



1. We have the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ and we want to find the number of values of $m$ for which this equation has 4 distinct solutions.

2. We know that the expression $\frac{m}{100}$ must be positive, so $m$ must be positive. Also, since the absolute value function is always non-negative, the number of solutions of the equation will depend on the value of $\frac{m}{100}$.

3. If $\frac{m}{100} < 2$, the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ will have 4 distinct solutions. This happens when $m < 200$.

4. Now, we need to find the number of positive integers $m$ such that $m < 200$. This is simply the number of positive integers from 1 to 199, which is 199.

So, the number of positive integers $m$ for which the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has 4 distinct solutions is 199. However, we need to check if this number is a positive integer. Since 199 is a positive integer, we can conclude that the number of positive integers $m$ for which the equation has 4 distinct solutions is indeed 199.
The answer is: $199$

Assistant:

Interesting, let's analyze step by step:



The equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has 4 distinct solutions. This means that the right side of the equation, $\frac{m}{100}$, must be equal to 2. This is because the left side of the equation, $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert$, can take on the values 0, 1, 2, and 3 only, and it equals 2 gives us 4 distinct solutions.

So, we have $\frac{m}{100}=2$, which implies $m=200$.

Now we need to verify that $m=200$ is a positive integer. It is, so the number of positive integers $m$ for which the equation has 4 distinct solutions is 1.

Therefore, the answer is $1$. However, the question asks for the value of $m$, not the number of possible values of $m$. We found that $m=200$.

So, the value of $m$ for which the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has 4 distinct solutions is 200.

The value of $m$ is 200. The answer is: $200$
