Solve the following problem with a Python Script (positive numerical answer):
"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"

Approach:

 The equation
\[((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0\]
is satisfied when either of the two factors is zero. 

This gives us two sets of equations to solve:
1. $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0 \implies \vert x + y \vert = 10$
   and $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0 \implies \vert x \vert = 8$,
   which simplify to $x + y = \pm 10$ and $x = \pm 8$.

2. $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0 \implies \vert x - y \vert = 10$
   and $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0 \implies \vert y \vert = 8$,
   which simplify to $x - y = \pm 10$ and $y = \pm 8$.

Solving these equations for all combinations of $+$ and $-$ signs, we find the points:
\[
(8, 0), (-8, 0), (0, 8), (0, -8),
(8, 2), (-8, -2), (8, -2), (-8, 2).
\]
These points form a rectangle with side lengths 16 and 10. Therefore, the area of the convex polygon is $16 \times 10 = 160$. The answer is: $160$

Approach:


The equation given is a product of two expressions equal to zero. Therefore, either of the expressions must be zero for the entire equation to hold true. This gives us two systems of absolute value equations to solve:

1. $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ and $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ and $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$.
2. $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$

For the first system, solving the three equations gives us the vertices of the polygon:

$\vert x + y \vert = 10$, $\vert x \vert = 8$, $\vert y \vert = 8$. The solutions are: $(8,8), (8,-8), (-8,8), (-8,-8)$.

For the second system, solving the equation $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ gives us $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. Since we have the vertices of the polygon, we can connect them to form a square with side length of 16 (from $(8,8)$ to $(8,-8)$ or from $(8,8)$ to $(-8,8)$).

The area of a square is calculated as the side length squared. So, the area of the convex polygon is $16^2 = 256$.

So, the area of the convex polygon is 256. The answer is: $256$

Approach:


The equation given is a product of two expressions equal to zero, so either $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$. The second expression will hold true if and only if both $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$, which means the point lies in a square with side length $16$ centered at the origin.
The first equation holds true if and only if $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$, which forms a square with side length $10\sqrt{2}$. So the vertices of this square are at $(5,5)$, $(-5,5)$, $(-5,-5)$ and $(5,-5)$.
The area of the polygon is thus the sum of the areas of these two squares. The area of the larger square is $10\sqrt{2}^2 = 200$, while the area of the smaller square is $8^2 = 64$. So the total area is $200+64=264$.
The answer is $\boxed{264}$.

Solve the following problem with a Python Script (positive numerical answer):
"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"

Approach:



The given equation is $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$. For the product of two numbers to be zero, either one of them must be zero. This gives us two cases:

Case 1: $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$. The only way this can happen is if both terms are zero, i.e., $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. The absolute value equations can be split into two separate cases, giving us the lines $x + y = 10$, $x + y = -10$, $x - y = 10$, and $x - y = -10$. This forms a square with side length $10\sqrt{2}$, and the area of the square is $(10\sqrt{2})^2 = 200$.

Case 2: $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$. Similar to the first case, this can only happen if both terms are zero, i.e., $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$. This forms a square with side length $16$, and the area of the square is $16^2 = 256$.

However, the second case does not satisfy the conditions of the problem because it does not enclose a convex polygon. Therefore, the only solution that makes sense in the context of the problem is the one from the first case, which forms a square with side length $10\sqrt{2}$ and an area of $200$.

So the area of the convex polygon is 200.

The answer is: $200$.

Approach:


The equation is of the form $AB = 0$, therefore at least one of the expressions $A = 0$ or $B = 0$ must be true. 
Let's consider two cases:
1) $A = (|x + y| - 10)^2 + (|x - y| - 10)^2 = 0$
2) $B = (|x| - 8)^2 + (|y| - 8)^2 = 0$

Case 1: $A = 0$
This implies that $|x + y| = 10$ and $|x - y| = 10$.
From the definition of absolute value, we have four possible combinations:

1.1) $x + y = 10$ and $x - y = 10$
1.2) $x + y = 10$ and $x - y = -10$
1.3) $x + y = -10$ and $x - y = 10$
1.4) $x + y = -10$ and $x - y = -10$

Solving each of the above combinations, we find that all of them lead to $x = y = 5$. Therefore, there is only one point $(5, 5)$ that satisfies $A = 0$.

Case 2: $B = 0$
This implies that $|x| = 8$ and $|y| = 8$.
From the definition of absolute value, we have four possible combinations:

2.1) $x = 8$ and $y = 8$
2.2) $x = 8$ and $y = -8$
2.3) $x = -8$ and $y = 8$
2.4) $x = -8$ and $y = -8$

Solving each of the above combinations, we find that all of them satisfy $B = 0$.

Therefore, the points that satisfy the given equation are $(5, 5)$, $(8, 8)$, $(8, -8)$, $(-8, 8)$, and $(-8, -8)$. These five points form a square with side length $16$. The area of this square is $16^2 = 256$.
The answer is: $\boxed{256}$

Solve the following problem with a Python Script (positive numerical answer):
"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"

Assistant:

Approach:

 The equation is of the form $(a)(b)=0$. This is true if and only if either $a=0$ or $b=0$. So we can solve two separate systems of equations: 
1. $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$
2. $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$

For the first system of equations, we know that a square of a real number is zero if and only if the number itself is zero. Thus, we have:
$\vert x + y \vert - 10 = 0$ and $\vert x - y \vert - 10 = 0$
Adding these two equations gives $2(\vert x \vert + \vert y \vert) - 20 = 0$ which simplifies to $\vert x \vert + \vert y \vert = 10$. This is the equation of a square with side length $10$ and vertices at $(\pm 10, 0)$ and $(0, \pm 10)$. The area of this square is $10^2 = 100$.

For the second system of equations, we have:
$\vert x \vert - 8 = 0$ and $\vert y \vert - 8 = 0$, which gives $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$. This means $x = \pm 8$ and $y = \pm 8$. This gives us a square with side length $16$ and vertices at $(\pm 8, 0)$, $(0, \pm 8)$. The area of this square is $16^2 = 256$.

However, we are interested in the area of the convex polygon enclosed by the points that satisfy the original equation. This is the intersection of the two squares, which is just the smaller square with side length $10$. So the area of this convex polygon is $10^2 = 100$.
The answer is: $\boxed{100}$.

Approach:

 The equation given is a product of two expressions equal to zero. This means that either the first expression is zero or the second expression is zero.

We have four absolute value expressions, and each of them will be zero when the expression inside the absolute value is zero. Let's solve each case:

1. $|x+y| - 10 = 0$ gives $|x+y| = 10$ which implies $x+y = \pm 10$.
2. $|x-y| - 10 = 0$ gives $|x-y| = 10$ which implies $x-y = \pm 10$.
3. $|x| - 8 = 0$ gives $|x| = 8$ which implies $x = \pm 8$.
4. $|y| - 8 = 0$ gives $|y| = 8$ which implies $y = \pm 8$.

Now, we will find the intersection points of these lines to determine the vertices of the polygon:

The lines $x+y = \pm 10$ intersect the lines $x = \pm 8$ and $y = \pm 8$ to form a square with side length 16.

To find the area of this square, we simply square the length of one side: $16^2 = 256$. So the area of the square is 256 square units. The answer is: $256$

Write comments to indicate the steps you take. Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Assistant:

Approach:

 The given equation is a product of two expressions equal to zero. This means that either the first expression is zero, or the second expression is zero, or both are zero. Let's consider each case separately.

Case 1: The first expression $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + (\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ equals zero. This implies that $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. The solutions to these two equations are $x + y = \pm 10$ and $x - y = \pm 10$. These are the equations of four lines forming a square with side length 10 units.

Case 2: The second expression $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + (\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ equals zero. This implies that $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$, which are the equations of two more lines $x = \pm 8$ and $y = \pm 8$. These lines intersect with the lines from case 1, forming a square with side length 16 units.

So, the points satisfying the given equation enclose a square with side length 16 units. The area of this square is $16^2 = 256$ square units. The answer is: $256$
