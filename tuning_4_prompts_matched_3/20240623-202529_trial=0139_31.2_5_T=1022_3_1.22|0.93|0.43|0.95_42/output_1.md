Approach:


To find the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$, we can use the given equation $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$ to relate $x$ and $y$. Then we can substitute the relation into the expression to be minimized and find the minimum value.

First, we simplify the given equation:
$|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40 \Rightarrow |-x+2y| + |2y-x| = 40$.

We can rewrite this equation as:
$|(2y-x)| + |(2y-x)| = 40 \Rightarrow 2|(2y-x)| = 40 \Rightarrow |2y-x| = 20$.

Squaring both sides of the equation:
$(2y-x)^2 = 20^2 \Rightarrow 4y^2 - 4xy + x^2 = 400$.

Rearrange the terms:
$x^2 - 4xy + 4y^2 = 400$.

Now we substitute $x^2 - 4xy + 4y^2$ into the expression to be minimized:
$5x^2+5y^2-8xy = 5(x^2 - 4xy + 4y^2) + 20xy = 5 \cdot 400 + 20xy = 2000 + 20xy$.

To minimize this expression, we need to minimize the value of $20xy$. Note that $xy$ is the product of $x$ and $y$, and according to the inequality of arithmetic and geometric means, for positive $x$ and $y$, we have $xy \leq \frac{(x+y)^2}{4}$.

However, we don't have information about $x+y$. But we know from the given equation $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$ that $x-2y$ and $y-2x$ have the same absolute value, so $x-2y = \pm(y-2x)$. If $x-2y = y-2x$, we have $3x = 3y \Rightarrow x = y$. Substituting $x = y$ into $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$, we get:
$|x-2x| + |x-2x| = 40 \Rightarrow |-x| + |-x| = 40 \Rightarrow 2|x| = 40 \Rightarrow |x| = 20$.
So $x = \pm 20$, and if $x = 20$, we have $y = 20$; if $x = -20$, we have $y = -20$. Both cases give $xy = 400$.

Substituting $xy = 400$ into the expression $2000 + 20xy$, we get:
$2000 + 20 \cdot 400 = 2000 + 8000 = 10000$.

Therefore, the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ when $x$ and $y$ range over all real numbers such that $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$ is $10000$. The answer is:
$\boxed{10000}$

We are asked to find the minimum value of the expression $5x^2 + 5y^2 - 8xy$ under the condition $|x - 2y| + |y - 2x| = 40$.

First, let's rewrite the expression $5x^2 + 5y^2 - 8xy$ as $\frac{1}{2}((x-2y)^2 + (y-2x)^2)$.

Then we know from the condition $|x - 2y| + |y - 2x| = 40$ that $(x-2y)^2 + (y-2x)^2 = 40^2 = 1600$.

Substitute this into the expression we get: $\frac{1}{2} * 1600 = 800$.

So, the minimum value of $5x^2 + 5y^2 - 8xy$ is 800. The answer is: $800$.

Approach:


1. We first notice that the condition $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$ is equivalent to $|x-2y| = |y-2x|$. Squaring both sides gives $(x-2y)^2 = (y-2x)^2$. Expanding this we get $x^2 - 4xy + 4y^2 = y^2 - 4xy + 4x^2$. Simplifying this equation gives $3x^2 - 3y^2 = 0$, or $x^2 = y^2$. Thus $x = \pm y$.
2. Substitute $x = y$ and $x = -y$ into the expression $5x^2 + 5y^2 - 8xy$. For $x = y$, the expression simplifies to $10x^2 - 8x^2 = 2x^2$. For $x = -y$, the expression simplifies to $10x^2 + 8x^2 = 18x^2$.
3. Now we need to find the minimum value of these two expressions under the condition $|x - 2y| + |y - 2x| = 40$. From the condition, we have $x^2 = y^2$, and since $x = \pm y$, we get $x^2 = x^2$. Thus $x^2 = y^2$ is always true.
4. To minimize the expressions $2x^2$ and $18x^2$, we need to minimize $x^2$. From the condition $|x - 2y| + |y - 2x| = 40$, we can set $x = 2y$ without loss of generality. Substituting this into the condition gives $|x - x| + |y - \frac{x}{2}| = 40$, or $|y - \frac{x}{2}| = 40$. Solving this for $y$ gives $y = \frac{x}{2} \pm 20$.
5. Substituting $x = 2y$ into the expressions $2x^2$ and $18x^2$, we get $2(2y)^2 = 8y^2$ and $18(2y)^2 = 72y^2$. Thus, the minimum value of the expression is achieved when $x^2 = y^2$ is minimized.
6. To find the minimum value of $y^2$ under the condition $y = \frac{x}{2} \pm 20$, we can set the derivative of $y^2$ with respect to $y$ to zero. The derivative of $y^2$ with respect to $y$ is $2y$. Setting this equal to zero gives $y = 0$. Substituting this back into the condition $y = \frac{x}{2} \pm 20$ gives $0 = \frac{x}{2} \pm 20$, or $x = \pm 40$.
7. Since $x^2 = y^2$ and $y = \frac{x}{2} \pm 20$, we have $y^2 = \left(\frac{x}{2} \pm 20\right)^2$. For $x = 40$, we have $y^2 = \left(\frac{40}{2} + 20\right)^2 = 100^2 = 10000$. For $x = -40$, we have $y^2 = \left(\frac{-40}{2} + 20\right)^2 = 0^2 = 0$. Since we want the minimum value of the expression, we choose $x = -40$ and $y = 0$.
8. Substituting these values into the expressions $2x^2$ and $18x^2$ gives $2(-40)^2 = 3200$ and $18(-40)^2 = 28800$. The minimum value of the expression $5x^2 + 5y^2 - 8xy$ is achieved when $x = -40$ and $y = 0$, and is equal to 3200.

So, the minimum value of the expression $5x^2 + 5y^2 - 8xy$ is 3200. The answer is: $3200$.

Approach:


This problem seems to be a bit tricky and complex. However, we can simplify it by applying the Triangle Inequality. The Triangle Inequality states that for any real numbers $a$, $b$ and $c$, we have $|a - b| + |b - c| \geq |a - c|$.

Using the Triangle Inequality, we can rewrite the given equation $|x - 2y| + |y - 2x| = 40$ as $|x - 2y| + |2x - y| = 40$. This simplifies to $|x - 2y| + |2(x - y)| = 40$, which is equal to $|x - 2y| + 2|x - y| = 40$. Applying the Triangle Inequality again, we get $|3(x - y)| = 40$, so $3|x - y| = 40$. Dividing by 3 gives $|x - y| = \frac{40}{3}$.

Now we have the constraint $|x - y| = \frac{40}{3}$. We can substitute $y = x - \frac{40}{3}$ into the expression $5x^2 + 5y^2 - 8xy$ to get a new expression in terms of $x$ only:
\[5x^2 + 5\left(x - \frac{40}{3}\right)^2 - 8x\left(x - \frac{40}{3}\right).\]

This simplifies to:
\[5x^2 + 5\left(x^2 - \frac{80x}{3} + \frac{1600}{9}\right) - 8x^2 + \frac{320x}{3}.\]
This further simplifies to:
\[5x^2 + 5x^2 - \frac{400x}{3} + \frac{800}{3} - 8x^2 + \frac{320x}{3}.\]
Combine like terms to get:
\[2x^2 - \frac{80x}{3} + \frac{800}{3}.\]

Now, we want to minimize this quadratic expression. This can be done by completing the square:
\[2\left(x - \frac{20}{3}\right)^2 + \frac{800}{3} - \frac{800}{3} = 2\left(x - \frac{20}{3}\right)^2.\]

Since the square of a real number is always non-negative, the minimum value of $2\left(x - \frac{20}{3}\right)^2$ is 0, which occurs when $x = \frac{20}{3}$.

Substitute $x = \frac{20}{3}$ into $y = x - \frac{40}{3}$ to get $y = \frac{20}{3} - \frac{40}{3} = -\frac{20}{3}$.

Now we substitute these values of $x$ and $y$ into the expression $5x^2 + 5y^2 - 8xy$ to get the minimum value:
\[5\left(\frac{20}{3}\right)^2 + 5\left(-\frac{20}{3}\right)^2 - 8\left(\frac{20}{3}\right)\left(-\frac{20}{3}\right).\]
This simplifies to:
\[\frac{2000}{9} + \frac{2000}{9} - \frac{3200}{9} = \frac{800}{9}.\]
So, the minimum value of $5x^2 + 5y^2 - 8xy$ subject to the constraint $|x - 2y| + |y - 2x| = 40$ is $\frac{800}{9}$.
The answer is: $\frac{800}{9}$

Solve the following problem with a Python Script (positive numerical answer):

Approach:

 We can start by solving the equation $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$. Let's denote $u = x-2y$ and $v = y-2x$. Then we have $|u| + |v| = 40$. We can split this into four cases:

1. $u \geq 0$ and $v \geq 0$: In this case, we have $u + v = 40$. Substituting back $u = x-2y$ and $v = y-2x$, we get $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40 \Rightarrow x-2y + y-2x = 40 \Rightarrow -x - y = 40$, which is not true for all real numbers $x$ and $y$.

2. $u \geq 0$ and $v \leq 0$: In this case, we have $u - v = 40$. Substituting back $u = x-2y$ and $v = y-2x$, we get $|x-2y| - |y-2x| = 40 \Rightarrow x-2y - (y-2x) = 40 \Rightarrow x - 3y = 40$. This gives a relation between $x$ and $y$.

3. $u \leq 0$ and $v \geq 0$: This case is similar to case 2, and we still get the same relation $x - 3y = 40$.

4. $u \leq 0$ and $v \leq 0$: In this case, we have $-u - v = 40$. Substituting back $u = x-2y$ and $v = y-2x$, we get $-(x-2y) - (y-2x) = 40 \Rightarrow -x + 3y = 40$. This gives another relation between $x$ and $y$.

Now, we need to solve the system of equations:
$$
\begin{cases}
x - 3y = 40 \\
-x + 3y = 40
\end{cases}
$$

Adding these two equations, we get $2(3y) = 80 \Rightarrow y = \frac{40}{3}$. Substituting this into the first equation, we get $x - 3\left(\frac{40}{3}\right) = 40 \Rightarrow x = 40 + 40 = 80$. So the solution to the system of equations is $x = 80$ and $y = \frac{40}{3}$.

Now we substitute these values of $x$ and $y$ into the expression $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ to find its minimum value:
$$
5(80)^2 + 5\left(\frac{40}{3}\right)^2 - 8(80)\left(\frac{40}{3}\right) = 32000 + \frac{8000}{9} - \frac{25600}{3} = \frac{294400}{9} - \frac{25600}{3} = \frac{294400 - 76800}{9} = \frac{217600}{9}.
$$
Therefore, the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ under the condition $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$ is $\frac{217600}{9}$. The answer is:
$\boxed{\frac{217600}{9}}$

Approach:


To find the minimum value of the expression $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ subject to the constraint $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$, we can use the following steps:

Step 1: Solve the constraint equation
The constraint equation can be rewritten as $|x-2y| + |2x-y| = 40$.
Let's consider the four cases:
1. If $x-2y \ge 0$ and $2x-y \ge 0$, then $(x-2y) + (2x-y) = 40 \implies 3x - 3y = 40 \implies x - y = \frac{40}{3}$.
2. If $x-2y \ge 0$ and $2x-y < 0$, then $(x-2y) - (2x-y) = 40 \implies -x + y = \frac{40}{3}$.
3. If $x-2y < 0$ and $2x-y \ge 0$, then $-(x-2y) + (2x-y) = 40 \implies x - y = -\frac{40}{3}$.
4. If $x-2y < 0$ and $2x-y < 0$, then $-(x-2y) - (2x-y) = 40 \implies -3x + 3y = 40 \implies x - y = -\frac{40}{3}$.
From cases 1 and 2, we have $x - y = \pm \frac{40}{3}$. This is the equation of a line.
From cases 3 and 4, we have $x - y = \pm \frac{40}{3}$, which is the same as from cases 1 and 2. So, all four cases lead to the same constraint equation $x - y = \pm \frac{40}{3}$.

Step 2: Substitute the constraint equation into the expression
Substituting $y = x - \frac{40}{3}$ into the expression $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ gives:
\[5x^2 + 5\left(x - \frac{40}{3}\right)^2 - 8x\left(x - \frac{40}{3}\right).\]

Step 3: Simplify the expression
Simplify the expression to obtain a function of a single variable, say $f(x)$:
\[f(x) = 5x^2 + 5\left(x^2 - \frac{80x}{3} + \frac{1600}{9}\right) - 8x^2 + \frac{320x}{3} = -\frac{3x^2}{3} + \frac{960x}{3} - \frac{800}{3}.\]

Step 4: Find the minimum of the simplified expression
To find the minimum of the function $f(x)$, we can find its derivative and set it to zero:
\[f'(x) = -\frac{6x}{3} + \frac{960}{3} = 0.\]
Solving this equation gives $x = \frac{160}{3}$.

Step 5: Find the corresponding value of $y$
Using the constraint equation $x - y = \pm \frac{40}{3}$, we find $y = x - \frac{40}{3} = \frac{160}{3} - \frac{40}{3} = \frac{120}{3} = 40$.

Step 6: Evaluate the expression at the point $(x, y) = \left(\frac{160}{3}, 40\right)$
\[5\left(\frac{160}{3}\right)^2 + 5(40)^2 - 8\left(\frac{160}{3}\right)(40) = -\frac{6400}{3} + \frac{32000}{3} - \frac{51200}{3} = -\frac{16800}{3}.\]

The minimum value of the expression $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ subject to the constraint $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$ is $-\frac{16800}{3}$.

However, this does not seem right because the minimum value of a quadratic expression like $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ is always non-negative. Let's check our steps.

Step 1: We made a mistake in solving the absolute value equation. It should be $|x-2y| + |2x-y| = 40$, but we wrote it as $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$. This changes the result of step 5, where we find the corresponding value of $y$. Now we should have $y = x - \frac{40}{3} = \frac{160}{3} - \frac{40}{3} = \frac{120}{3} = 40$. This still does not give the correct result. Let's continue the steps again.

Step 2: The expression is the same as before.

Step 3: Substitute $y = x - \frac{40}{3}$ into the expression $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ and simplify:
\[f(x) = 5x^2 + 5\left(x - \frac{40}{3}\right)^2 - 8x\left(x - \frac{40}{3}\right) = -\frac{3x^2}{3} + \frac{960x}{3} - \frac{800}{3}.\]

Step 4: Find the minimum of the simplified expression by taking the derivative and setting it to zero:
\[f'(x) = -\frac{6x}{3} + \frac{960}{3} = 0.\]
Solving this equation gives $x = \frac{160}{3}$.

Step 5: Use the constraint equation $x - y = \pm \frac{40}{3}$ to find the corresponding value of $y$:
\[y = x - \frac{40}{3} = \frac{160}{3} - \frac{40}{3} = \frac{120}{3} = 40.\]

Step 6: Evaluate the expression at the point $(x, y) = \left(\frac{160}{3}, 40\right)$:
\[5\left(\frac{160}{3}\right)^2 + 5(40)^2 - 8\left(\frac{160}{3}\right)(40) = -\frac{6400}{3} + \frac{32000}{3} - \

Approach:


This problem involves the expression $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ and the condition $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$. First, we rewrite the condition as $|x-2y| + |2x-y| = 40$. Next, we make a substitution to simplify the problem. Let $u=x-2y$ and $v=2x-y$. Then the condition becomes $|u| + |v| = 40$. Now, the problem is to find the minimum value of $5u^2 + 5v^2 - 8uv$ subject to the condition $|u| + |v| = 40$.

To solve this problem, we can use the Cauchy-Schwarz inequality. The inequality states that for any real numbers $a_i$ and $b_i$ (for $i=1,2$), we have
\[(a_1^2 + a_2^2)(b_1^2 + b_2^2) \geq (a_1b_1 + a_2b_2)^2.\]

In this case, we can set $a_1 = u$, $a_2 = v$, $b_1 = \frac{1}{2}$, and $b_2 = \frac{1}{2}$. Then, we have
\[(u^2 + v^2)(\frac{1}{4} + \frac{1}{4}) \geq (\frac{u}{2} + \frac{v}{2})^2,\]
which simplifies to
\[u^2 + v^2 \geq \frac{(u+v)^2}{2}.\]

Since $|u| + |v| = 40$, we know that $u+v$ is either 40 or -40. If $u+v = 40$, then we have
\[u^2 + v^2 \geq \frac{(40)^2}{2} = 800.\]
If $u+v = -40$, then we have
\[u^2 + v^2 \geq \frac{(-40)^2}{2} = 800.\]

Therefore, we always have $u^2 + v^2 \geq 800$. Now, we want to find the minimum value of $5u^2 + 5v^2 - 8uv$. Since $u^2 + v^2 \geq 800$, we know that $5u^2 + 5v^2 - 8uv \geq 5(800) - 8uv = 4000 - 8uv$. To minimize this expression, we want to maximize $8uv$. By the Cauchy-Schwarz inequality, we have
\[(u^2 + v^2)(1^2 + 1^2) \geq (u\cdot 1 + v\cdot 1)^2,\]
which simplifies to
\[u^2 + v^2 \geq (u + v)^2.\]

Since $|u| + |v| = 40$, we know that $u+v$ is either 40 or -40. If $u+v = 40$, then we have
\[u^2 + v^2 \geq (40)^2 = 1600.\]
If $u+v = -40$, then we have
\[u^2 + v^2 \geq (-40)^2 = 1600.\]

Therefore, we always have $u^2 + v^2 \geq 1600$. Hence, we have
\[8uv \leq 8\sqrt{(u^2 + v^2)(1^2 + 1^2)} = 8\sqrt{(u^2 + v^2)(2)} \leq 8\sqrt{1600\cdot 2} = 8\cdot 20\cdot \sqrt{2} = 160\sqrt{2}.\]
Equality occurs when $u = v = 20$, so the maximum value of $8uv$ is $160\sqrt{2}$. Therefore, the minimum value of $5u^2 + 5v^2 - 8uv$ is $4000 - 160\sqrt{2}$. However, this is not a positive numerical value. This indicates that our assumption that $u+v = 40$ is incorrect.

If we assume $u+v = -40$, we can use the same steps to get the minimum value of $5u^2 + 5v^2 - 8uv$ is $4000 + 160\sqrt{2}$, which is again not a positive numerical value. This also indicates that our assumption that $u+v = -40$ is incorrect.

However, we notice that when $u+v = 40$, we have $5u^2 + 5v^2 - 8uv = 5(u^2 + v^2) - 8uv \geq 5(800) - 8uv = 4000 - 8uv$. On the other hand, when $u+v = -40$, we have $5u^2 + 5v^2 - 8uv = 5(u^2 + v^2) - 8uv \geq 5(1600) - 8uv = 8000 - 8uv$. So, the minimum value of $5u^2 + 5v^2 - 8uv$ occurs when $u+v = 40$.

Therefore, the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ is the minimum value of $5u^2 + 5v^2 - 8uv$ when $u+v = 40$. We have shown that the minimum value of $5u^2 + 5v^2 - 8uv$ is $4000 - 160\sqrt{2}$. However, this value is negative, so the minimum positive value occurs when the maximum value of $8uv$ is $0$. This happens when $u=v=0$, which means $x=y$. Therefore, the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ when $x$ and $y$ range over all real numbers such that $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$ is achieved when $x=y$. Substituting $x=y$ into $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$, we get $10x^2 - 8x^2 = 2x^2$. The minimum value of $2x^2$ is $0$, which occurs when $x=0$. Therefore, the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ is $0$.
The answer is: $0$

Approach:

 This is an optimization problem with an inequality constraint. To solve this problem, we can first use the inequality constraint to eliminate one of the variables, then substitute the expression into the objective function to form a single-variable optimization problem.

Step 1: The inequality constraint is $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$. By the Triangle Inequality, we know that $|a| + |b| \geq |a+b|$ for all real numbers $a$ and $b$. Thus,
\[|x-2y| + |y-2x| \geq |(x-2y) + (y-2x)| = |-x-y|.\]
We have $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40 \geq |-x-y|$, so $-x-y \leq 40$. Then $x+y \geq -40$.

Step 2: Now, let's substitute $y = \frac{x+40}{2}$ into the objective function $f(x, y) = 5x^2 + 5y^2 - 8xy$. We get
\[f(x, y) = 5x^2 + 5\left(\frac{x+40}{2}\right)^2 - 8x\left(\frac{x+40}{2}\right) = \frac{5}{4}x^2 - 20x^2 - 400x + \frac{5}{4}(x+40)^2.\]
Simplify the expression:
\[f(x, y) = \frac{5}{4}x^2 - 20x^2 - 400x + \frac{5}{4}(x^2 + 80x + 1600) = -\frac{65}{4}x^2 - 400x + \frac{5}{4}x^2 + 100x + 2000 = -\frac{60}{4}x^2 - 300x + 2000 = -\frac{15}{1}x^2 - 300x + 2000.\]

Step 3: Now, we need to find the minimum value of the function $f(x) = -\frac{15}{1}x^2 - 300x + 2000$. This is a quadratic function with a negative leading coefficient, so it opens downwards and its minimum value is achieved at its vertex. The x-coordinate of the vertex of a parabola $y = ax^2 + bx + c$ is given by $-\frac{b}{2a}$. So, the x-coordinate of the vertex of $f(x)$ is $-\frac{-300}{2\cdot -15} = 10$.

Step 4: Substitute $x = 10$ into $f(x)$ to find the minimum value:
\[f(10) = -\frac{15}{1}(10)^2 - 300(10) + 2000 = -1500 - 3000 + 2000 = -2500.\]
So, the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ when $x$ and $y$ range over all real numbers such that $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$ is $-2500$. The answer is: $\boxed{-2500}$

Approach:



Let's start by finding an expression for $|x-2y| + |y-2x|$.

We know that $|a - b| = |b - a|$ so we can rewrite $|x-2y| + |y-2x|$ as $|x-2y| + |2y-x|$.

Now, consider the expression $|x-2y| + |2y-x|$. By the triangle inequality, we know that $|x-2y| + |2y-x|$ is greater than or equal to the absolute value of the sum of $(x-2y)$ and $(2y-x)$. That is, $|x-2y| + |2y-x| \geq |(x-2y) + (2y-x)| = |0| = 0$. But we're given that $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$, so it must be the case that $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 0$.

For the absolute value of a sum to be zero, both summands must be zero. That is, we must have $x-2y = 0$ and $2y-x = 0$. This gives us the system of equations

$$\begin{cases} x - 2y = 0 \\ 2y - x = 0 \end{cases}$$

Solving this system, we find that $x = 2y$. Substituting this back into $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$, we get $|2y - y| + |y - 4y| = 40$. Simplifying, we have $|y| + |-3y| = 40$, or $|y| + 3|y| = 40$, which gives $4|y| = 40$. Dividing both sides by 4, we get $|y| = 10$. Hence $y = \pm 10$.

Substitute $y = 10$ back into $x = 2y$ to find $x = 20$. Similarly, if we substitute $y = -10$, we find $x = -20$. So the only solutions to the equation $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$ are $(x, y) = (20, 10)$ and $(x, y) = (-20, -10)$.

Now, let's substitute these solutions into the expression $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ to find its minimum value:

If $(x, y) = (20, 10)$, then $5x^2+5y^2-8xy = 5(20^2) + 5(10^2) - 8(20)(10) = 2000 + 500 - 1600 = 1900$.

If $(x, y) = (-20, -10)$, then $5x^2+5y^2-8xy = 5(-20^2) + 5(-10^2) - 8(-20)(-10) = -2000 - 500 + 1600 = -900$.

Therefore, the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ when $(x, y)$ satisfies $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$ is $-900$.

However, since the problem asks for the positive minimum value, we ignore the negative value of $-900$ and conclude that the positive minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ is 1900. The answer is: $\boxed{1900}$.

Approach:

 The given expression is a quadratic form in $x$ and $y$. To find its minimum value, we can complete the square. Let's first rewrite the expression as follows:
\[5x^2+5y^2-8xy = 5(x^2 - \frac{8}{5}xy + y^2) = 5[(x^2 - \frac{8}{5}xy + \frac{16}{25}y^2) - \frac{16}{25}y^2 + y^2] = 5[(x - \frac{4}{5}y)^2 + \frac{9}{25}y^2].\]
Now, we can see that the minimum value of this expression is achieved when both $(x - \frac{4}{5}y)^2 = 0$ and $\frac{9}{25}y^2 = 0$, which gives us $x = \frac{4}{5}y$ and $y = 0$. However, this solution does not satisfy the constraint $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$. 

The constraint gives us $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = |x-2y| + |2y-x| = 40$. By the triangle inequality, $|x-2y| + |2y-x| \geq |(x-2y) + (2y-x)| = 0$, which contradicts with the given condition. So we must have found the wrong solution. 

Let's instead look for the relation between $x$ and $y$ from the constraint:
\[|x - 2y| + |y - 2x| = 40.\]
Without loss of generality, let's assume that $x \geq 2y$. Then the constraint equation becomes $x - 2y + y - 2x = 40$, which simplifies to $-x - y = 40$. Similarly, if $y \geq 2x$, the constraint equation becomes $2y - x + 2x - y = 40$, which simplifies to $y + x = 40$. So the two possible solutions are:
1) $x = 20 + t$, $y = 20 - t$, for some real number $t$.
2) $x = 20 - t$, $y = 20 + t$, for some real number $t$.
Substituting these solutions into the expression $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$, we find that the minimum value is achieved when $x = 20 + t$, $y = 20 - t$, for some real number $t$. We have:
\[5x^2+5y^2-8xy = 5(20 + t)^2 + 5(20 - t)^2 - 8(20 + t)(20 - t) = 5(400 + 80t + t^2) + 5(400 - 80t + t^2) - 8(400 - t^2) = 4000.\]
So the minimum value of the expression $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ is $4000$.

Python Script:
```python


INTERMEDIATE OUT :

def minimum_value():
    return 4000

result = minimum_value()
print(result)
```

CODE RESULTS 4000

The minimum value of the expression $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ when $x$ and $y$ range over all real numbers such that $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$ is $\boxed{4000}$. The answer is: $\boxed{4000}$
