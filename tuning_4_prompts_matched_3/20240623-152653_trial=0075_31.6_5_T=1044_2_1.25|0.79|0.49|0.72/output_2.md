Question (hint: positive numerical answer):
"For how many positive integers $m$ does the equation \[\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}\] have $4$ distinct solutions?"
Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:


To find the number of positive integers $m$ for which the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has 4 distinct solutions, we first need to understand the behavior of the function $f(x) = \vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert$.

The function $f(x)$ has four branches, depending on the value of $x$:
1. If $x < 1$, then $|x - 1| = -(x - 1) = 1 - x$, so $f(x) = |1 - x - 2| = |-x - 1| = x + 1 - 2 = x - 1$.
2. If $1 \leq x \leq 3$, then $|x - 1| = x - 1$, so $f(x) = |x - 1 - 2| = |x - 3| = 3 - x$.
3. If $x > 3$, then $|x - 1| = x - 1$, so $f(x) = |x - 1 - 2| = |x - 3| = x - 3 - 2 = x - 5$.

Thus, the graph of $f(x)$ consists of two line segments with slopes $-1$ and $-1$, and two "corners" at $x = 1$ and $x = 3$.

The equation $f(x) = \frac{m}{100}$ will have 4 distinct solutions if $\frac{m}{100}$ falls strictly between the minimum and maximum values of $f(x)$, which are $f(1) = 0$ and $f(3) = -2$. This means that $0 < \frac{m}{100} < 2$, or equivalently, $0 < m < 200$. The positive integers in this range are exactly the integers from 1 to 199, so there are 199 such integers. However, the value $m = 0$ does not give a valid equation, so we must exclude it. Therefore, there are 198 possible values of $m$.

But we must check if the solutions are distinct. For $m = 1$, the equation becomes $| |x-1| - 2 | = 0.01$. The equation $|x - 1| = 2.01$ has two solutions, $x = 3.01$ and $x = -1.01$, but since we only consider positive integers, $x = -1.01$ is not valid. So the solutions are not distinct.

Similarly, for $m = 200$, the equation becomes $| |x-1| - 2 | = 2$, which has solutions $x = 1$, $x = 3$, $x = 5$, and $x = 7$, but the two solutions $x = 1$ and $x = 3$ are not distinct according to our definition.

Therefore, we need to exclude these two values of $m$ as well. So, the number of positive integers $m$ for which the equation has 4 distinct solutions is $198 - 2 = 196$. The answer is: 196.

Question (hint: positive numerical answer):
"For how many positive integers $m$ does the equation \[\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}\] have $4$ distinct solutions?"
Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:


The equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has 4 distinct solutions if and only if $\frac{m}{100} = 2$. This is because the function $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert$ reaches its maximum value of 2 exactly once, and that is when it has 4 distinct solutions.

To find $m$, we multiply both sides of the equation $\frac{m}{100} = 2$ by 100 to get $m = 200$.

So the only positive integer $m$ for which the equation has 4 distinct solutions is 200. The answer is: 1

Remember, this question asks for the number of positive integers $m$, not the value of $m$ itself. So the number of positive integers $m$ that satisfy the equation is 1. The answer is: $\boxed{1}$.

Question (hint: positive numerical answer):
"For how many positive integers $m$ does the equation \[\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}\] have $4$ distinct solutions?"
Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:



First, let's understand what the equation is asking. The equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has four distinct solutions. That means we are looking for a value of $m$ such that the equation has four different values of $x$ that make the equation true.

The equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ is a piecewise function, which can be broken down into two cases:

Case 1: $\vert x-1 \vert -2 = \frac{m}{100}$
Case 2: $-\vert x-1 \vert +2 = \frac{m}{100}$

Now let's solve these two cases separately.

Case 1: $\vert x-1 \vert -2 = \frac{m}{100}$ can be rewritten as $\vert x-1 \vert = 2 + \frac{m}{100}$. This further breaks down into two sub-cases:

Sub-case 1.1: $x-1 = 2 + \frac{m}{100}$ or $x = 3 + \frac{m}{100}$.
Sub-case 1.2: $-(x-1) = 2 + \frac{m}{100}$ or $x = -1 + \frac{m}{100}$.

Case 2: $-\vert x-1 \vert +2 = \frac{m}{100}$ can be rewritten as $\vert x-1 \vert = 2 - \frac{m}{100}$. This further breaks down into two sub-cases:

Sub-case 2.1: $x-1 = 2 - \frac{m}{100}$ or $x = 3 - \frac{m}{100}$.
Sub-case 2.2: $-(x-1) = 2 - \frac{m}{100}$ or $x = -1 - \frac{m}{100}$.

Now we have four possible values of $x$ for each value of $m$:

$x = 3 + \frac{m}{100}$, $x = -1 + \frac{m}{100}$, $x = 3 - \frac{m}{100}$, and $x = -1 - \frac{m}{100}$.

For these four values of $x$ to be distinct, the value of $\frac{m}{100}$ must be different for each case. This implies that $2 + \frac{m}{100} \neq 2 - \frac{m}{100}$, which simplifies to $\frac{m}{100} \neq -\frac{m}{100}$. This means $m \neq 0$.

Also, for the values of $x$ to be real, we must have $2 + \frac{m}{100} \geq 0$ and $2 - \frac{m}{100} \geq 0$. These simplify to $\frac{m}{100} \geq -2$ and $\frac{m}{100} \leq 2$, which gives $-200 \leq m \leq 200$.

But we also know that $m$ must be positive, so we have $0 < m \leq 200$. The only positive integer in this range is the set of integers from 1 to 200.

Therefore, the number of positive integers $m$ for which the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has four distinct solutions is equal to the number of integers from 1 to 200, which is 200.
The answer is: $200$

Question (hint: positive numerical answer):
"For how many positive integers $m$ does the equation \[\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}\] have $4$ distinct solutions?"
Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:


The equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has $4$ distinct solutions.
For the expression inside the absolute value, we have two cases:
1. $\vert x-1 \vert -2 = \frac{m}{100}$ or $\vert x-1 \vert -2 = -\frac{m}{100}$.
2. $\vert x-1 \vert -2 = \frac{m}{100}$ or $\vert x-1 \vert -2 = -\frac{m}{100}$.

Let's consider the first case: $\vert x-1 \vert -2 = \frac{m}{100}$.
This equation can be rewritten as $\vert x-1 \vert = 2 + \frac{m}{100}$.

If $2 + \frac{m}{100} > 0$, then we have two sub-cases:
1.1. $x-1 = 2 + \frac{m}{100}$ or $x-1 = -(2 + \frac{m}{100})$.
1.2. $x-1 = 2 + \frac{m}{100}$ or $x-1 = -(2 + \frac{m}{100})$.

Similarly, for the second case: $\vert x-1 \vert -2 = -\frac{m}{100}$,
we can rewrite it as $\vert x-1 \vert = 2 - \frac{m}{100}$.

If $2 - \frac{m}{100} > 0$, then we have two sub-cases:
2.1. $x-1 = 2 - \frac{m}{100}$ or $x-1 = -(2 - \frac{m}{100})$.
2.2. $x-1 = 2 - \frac{m}{100}$ or $x-1 = -(2 - \frac{m}{100})$.

In total, we have $8$ sub-cases. However, we know that for the equation to have $4$ distinct solutions, we need to have $2 + \frac{m}{100} > 0$ and $2 - \frac{m}{100} > 0$.

This implies that $0 < \frac{m}{100} < 2$, or equivalently, $0 < m < 200$.

So the possible values of $m$ are the positive integers from $1$ to $199$.

Therefore, the number of positive integers $m$ that satisfy the condition is $199$.
The answer is: $199$

"For how many positive integers $m$ does the equation \[\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}\] have $4$ distinct solutions?"
Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:


The equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has $4$ distinct solutions.
This means that the right side of the equation, $\frac{m}{100}$, must be equal to $2$.
If $\frac{m}{100}=2$, then $m=200$.
Therefore, there is only one positive integer value of $m$ that satisfies the condition, and that is $m=200$. The answer is: $1$

Question (hint: positive numerical answer):
"For how many positive integers $m$ does the equation \[\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}\] have $4$ distinct solutions?"
Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:


The equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has 4 distinct solutions.
We know that $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert$ is a piecewise function that can take the values 0, 1, or 2.
Therefore, $\frac{m}{100}$ must be equal to 1 or 2.
If $\frac{m}{100} = 1$, then $m = 100$.
If $\frac{m}{100} = 2$, then $m = 200$.
So, there are only 2 possible values for $m$.
Therefore, the number of positive integers $m$ that satisfy the condition is 2.
The answer is: $2$

"For how many positive integers $m$ does the equation \[\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}\] have $4$ distinct solutions?"
Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:


The equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has 4 distinct solutions if and only if $\frac{m}{100}$ is equal to the value of the function $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert$ at 4 different points.
The function $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert$ takes the value of 2 at $x=3$ and $x=-1$, the value of 0 at $x=1$, and the value of -2 at $x=-1$ and $x=3$.
Therefore, $\frac{m}{100}$ must be equal to 2.
So, $m=200$.
Therefore, the only positive integer $m$ for which the equation has 4 distinct solutions is 200. The answer is: $1$
