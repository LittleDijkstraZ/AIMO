Question (hint: positive numerical answer):
"For how many positive integers $m$ does the equation \[\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}\] have $4$ distinct solutions?"
Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:


The equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has 4 distinct solutions if and only if $\frac{m}{100}$ is between 1 and 2.
This is because the function $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert$ is a "hump" function that oscillates between 1 and 2.
So, we need to find the number of positive integers $m$ such that $1 < \frac{m}{100} < 2$.
Multiplying all parts of the inequality by 100 gives $100 < m < 200$.
The positive integers $m$ that satisfy this inequality are the integers from 101 to 199, inclusive.
To find the number of these integers, we subtract the smallest value (101) from the largest value (199) and add 1.
So, the number of positive integers $m$ is $199 - 101 + 1 = 99$.
Therefore, the value of $m$ that satisfies the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ and has 4 distinct solutions is 99. The answer is: $1$

Question (hint: positive numerical answer):
"For how many positive integers $m$ does the equation \[\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}\] have $4$ distinct solutions?"
Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:



The equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has four distinct solutions if and only if $\frac{m}{100}$ is equal to $2$. This is because the function $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert$ has a graph that is a series of V-shapes, and it equals $2$ at four distinct points.

So we have $\frac{m}{100}=2$, which implies $m=200$. Therefore, there is only one positive integer $m$ for which the equation has four distinct solutions, and that is $m=200$.
The answer is: $1$

Question (hint: positive numerical answer):
"For how many positive integers $m$ does the equation \[\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}\] have $4$ distinct solutions?"
Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:


The equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has 4 distinct solutions,
which means that the right side of the equation must be between 0 and 2.
Since $\frac{m}{100}$ is between 0 and 2, we have $0 < \frac{m}{100} < 2$.
Multiplying all sides of the inequality by 100 gives $0 < m < 200$.
So the possible values of $m$ are the positive integers from 1 to 199.
To count the number of positive integers in this range, we subtract the smallest value from the largest value and then add 1.
Thus, the number of positive integers $m$ is $199 - 1 + 1 = 199$.
The value of $m$ is 199.
The answer is: $199$

Question (hint: positive numerical answer):
"For how many positive integers $m$ does the equation \[\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}\] have $4$ distinct solutions?"
Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:


The equation $| |x - 1| - 2 | = \frac{m}{100}$ has four distinct solutions.
The expression $| |x - 1| - 2 |$ is a "hump" function that takes on the value $2 - \frac{m}{100}$ at $x = 1 - 2 + \frac{m}{100} = \frac{m}{100}$ and the value $2 + \frac{m}{100}$ at $x = 1 + 2 + \frac{m}{100} = 3 + \frac{m}{100}$.
For the equation to have four distinct solutions, the two values $2 - \frac{m}{100}$ and $2 + \frac{m}{100}$ must be between 0 and 4.
So, we have the inequalities:
\[0 < 2 - \frac{m}{100} < 4 \quad \text{and} \quad 0 < 2 + \frac{m}{100} < 4.\]
Solving these inequalities gives:
\[2 - \frac{m}{100} > 0 \implies m < 200,\]
\[2 - \frac{m}{100} < 4 \implies m > -200,\]
\[2 + \frac{m}{100} > 0 \implies m > -200,\]
\[2 + \frac{m}{100} < 4 \implies m < 200.\]
Combining these inequalities, we find $-200 < m < 200$.
The only positive integer values of $m$ that satisfy this inequality are $m = 1, 2, ..., 199$.
The number of these positive integers is 199.
The answer is: 199

Question (hint: positive numerical answer):
"For how many positive integers $m$ does the equation \[\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}\] have $4$ distinct solutions?"
Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:



The equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has $4$ distinct solutions.
We know that the absolute value function $\vert x \vert$ is equal to $x$ if $x \geq 0$ and $-x$ if $x < 0$.
So, we can break the absolute value function inside the absolute value function in the equation into two cases:

Case 1: $\vert x-1 \vert -2 = \frac{m}{100}$.
Then, we have $\vert x-1 \vert = 2 + \frac{m}{100}$.
This gives us two subcases:
Subcase 1.1: $x-1 = 2 + \frac{m}{100}$, so $x = 3 + \frac{m}{100}$.
Subcase 1.2: $x-1 = -2 - \frac{m}{100}$, so $x = -1 - \frac{m}{100}$.

Case 2: $\vert x-1 \vert -2 = -\frac{m}{100}$.
Then, we have $\vert x-1 \vert = 2 - \frac{m}{100}$.
This gives us two subcases:
Subcase 2.1: $x-1 = 2 - \frac{m}{100}$, so $x = 3 - \frac{m}{100}$.
Subcase 2.2: $x-1 = -2 + \frac{m}{100}$, so $x = -1 + \frac{m}{100}$.

Now, we need to find the values of $m$ such that all four solutions are distinct.
The solutions from Case 1 are $x = 3 + \frac{m}{100}$ and $x = -1 - \frac{m}{100}$.
The solutions from Case 2 are $x = 3 - \frac{m}{100}$ and $x = -1 + \frac{m}{100}$.
For the solutions to be distinct, the four values of $x$ must be different.
This means that $\frac{m}{100} \neq \pm 2$.
Therefore, $m$ must be an integer such that $0 < m < 200$ and $m \neq 200$.
There are $199$ positive integers $m$ that satisfy these conditions.
So, the number of positive integers $m$ for which the equation has $4$ distinct solutions is $199$.
The value of $m$ that satisfies this condition is $199$. The answer is: $199$

Question (hint: positive numerical answer):
"For how many positive integers $m$ does the equation \[\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}\] have $4$ distinct solutions?"
Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:


The equation $| |x-1| - 2 | = \frac{m}{100}$ has 4 distinct solutions if and only if $\frac{m}{100} = 2$. This is because the function $| |x-1| - 2 |$ has a graph that is a "V" shape with the "bottom" of the "V" at $y=2$.

To find $m$, we set up the equation $\frac{m}{100} = 2$ and solve for $m$:
\[m = 2 \cdot 100 = 200.\]

Therefore, there is only 1 positive integer $m$ that satisfies the given condition, and that is $m=200$.
The answer is: $1$

Question (hint: positive numerical answer):
"For how many positive integers $m$ does the equation \[\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}\] have $4$ distinct solutions?"
Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:


The equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has 4 distinct solutions if and only if $\frac{m}{100}$ is strictly between 1 and 2. This is because the function $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert$ has a graph that is a series of V-shapes, with the $x$-intercepts of the "walls" of the V's at $x=1-2 = -1$, $x=1$, and $x=1+2 = 3$. The function is equal to 0 at $x=1\pm2 = -1, 3$, and is equal to 1 at $x=1$, and $-1$ at $x=3$. The function is equal to 2 for $x$ strictly between $-1$ and $3$. Thus, the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has 4 distinct solutions when $1 < \frac{m}{100} < 2$. This means $100 < m < 200$. The positive integers $m$ that satisfy this inequality are the integers from 101 to 199, inclusive. To find the number of these integers, we subtract the smallest integer from the largest and add 1. So, the number of positive integers $m$ is $199 - 101 + 1 = 99$.
The answer is: $99$

Question (hint: positive numerical answer):
"For how many positive integers $m$ does the equation \[\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}\] have $4$ distinct solutions?"
Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:


The equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has 4 distinct solutions if and only if $\frac{m}{100} = 2$.

This is because the expression on the left side of the equation, $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert$, can take on the values of 2, 0, or any value between 0 and 2. The equation has 4 distinct solutions only when it equals 2.

So, we set $\frac{m}{100} = 2$ and solve for $m$:
\[m = 2 \cdot 100 = 200.\]

Therefore, the value of $m$ that makes the equation have 4 distinct solutions is 200. So the number of positive integers $m$ is 1.
The answer is: $1$
