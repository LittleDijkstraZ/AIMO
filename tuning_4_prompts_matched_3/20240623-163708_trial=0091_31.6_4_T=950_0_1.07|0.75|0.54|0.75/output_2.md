To solve this problem, we need to analyze the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ and find out for how many positive integers $m$ it has 4 distinct solutions.

The equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ can be solved by considering the cases when $\vert x-1 \vert -2$ is positive, zero, or negative. 

When $\vert x-1 \vert -2 > 0$, we have $\vert x-1 \vert > 2$, which implies $x-1 > 2$ or $x-1 < -2$. Solving these inequalities gives $x > 3$ or $x < -1$.

When $\vert x-1 \vert -2 = 0$, we have $\vert x-1 \vert = 2$, which implies $x-1 = 2$ or $x-1 = -2$. Solving these equations gives $x = 3$ or $x = -1$.

When $\vert x-1 \vert -2 < 0$, we have $\vert x-1 \vert < 2$, which implies $-2 < x-1 < 2$. Solving these inequalities gives $-1 < x < 3$.

So, the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has 4 distinct solutions when $x$ is in the intervals $(-\infty, -1)$, $(-1, 1)$, $(1, 3)$, and $(3, \infty)$.

For the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ to have 4 distinct solutions, $\frac{m}{100}$ must be equal to the distance between consecutive solution intervals. The distance between $(-\infty, -1)$ and $(-1, 1)$ is 2, the distance between $(-1, 1)$ and $(1, 3)$ is also 2, and the distance between $(1, 3)$ and $(3, \infty)$ is 2. So, $\frac{m}{100} = 2$, which implies $m = 200$.

Therefore, the only positive integer $m$ for which the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has 4 distinct solutions is 200. The answer is: $1$

Assistant:

 The equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has 4 distinct solutions if and only if $\frac{m}{100}$ is strictly between 1 and 2. This is because the function $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert$ has a "V" shape with vertices at $x=1,3$, and the distance between these vertices is 2. So, for the equation to have 4 distinct solutions, the right hand side $\frac{m}{100}$ must be strictly between 1 and 2. This gives $1 < \frac{m}{100} < 2$, which simplifies to $100 < m < 200$. The number of positive integers $m$ in this range is $200 - 100 - 1 = 99$. So, there are 99 positive integers $m$ for which the equation has 4 distinct solutions.

To find the numerical answer, you can simply calculate the number of positive integers $m$ in the range $(100, 200)$. The number of such integers is $200 - 100 - 1 = 99$.

So the number of positive integers $m$ for which the equation has 4 distinct solutions is 99. The answer is: $99$

Assistant:

 The equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has 4 distinct solutions if and only if $\frac{m}{100}$ is strictly between 1 and 2. This is because the expression inside the absolute value, $\vert x-1 \vert -2$, can only change its sign twice in the range of $x$, which gives us 3 "sections" in which the equation can have a different number of solutions. For $\frac{m}{100}$ to be strictly between 1 and 2, we must have $1<\frac{m}{100}<2$, which implies $100<m<200$. The positive integers $m$ that satisfy this inequality are exactly the integers from 101 to 199, inclusive. To count the number of such integers, we can subtract the smallest value from the largest value and add 1. This gives us $199 - 101 + 1 = 99$. Therefore, there are 99 positive integers $m$ for which the equation has 4 distinct solutions. The answer is: $99$

Assistant:

 The number of distinct solutions to the equation $| |x-1| - 2 | = \frac{m}{100}$ is equal to 4 if and only if $\frac{m}{100} = 2$. This is because the expression $| |x-1| - 2 |$ takes on the value of 2 exactly 4 times.

So we need to solve the equation $\frac{m}{100} = 2$ for $m$. Multiplying both sides by 100 gives $m = 200$. Therefore, the only positive integer $m$ for which the equation has 4 distinct solutions is 200. The answer is: $200$

Assistant:

 The equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has 4 distinct solutions if and only if $\frac{m}{100}$ is strictly between 1 and 2. This is because the function $f(x) = \vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert$ has a graph that is a "V" shape with the "valleys" at $x=1,3$. The distance between the valleys is 2, so any value of $\frac{m}{100}$ strictly between 1 and 2 will result in 4 distinct solutions to the equation.

To find the number of such positive integers $m$, we need to find the number of positive integers $m$ such that $1 < \frac{m}{100} < 2$. This is equivalent to finding the number of positive integers $m$ such that $100 < m < 200$. The number of such integers is $200 - 100 - 1 = 99$.

So the number of positive integers $m$ for which the equation has 4 distinct solutions is 99.
The answer is: $99$

Assistant:

 The equation $| |x - 1| - 2 | = \frac{m}{100}$ has 4 distinct solutions when the right side is between 1 and 2. This is because the function $| |x - 1| - 2 |$ has a graph that is a "V" shape with its peak at 2, and the number of solutions to the equation is the number of times the horizontal line $|y| = \frac{m}{100}$ intersects the graph. If the line is below 1, there are no solutions, if it is at 1, there is one solution, if it is between 1 and 2, there are 4 solutions, and if it is above 2, there are 2 solutions. So we need to find the value of $m$ such that $\frac{m}{100} = 1$, which gives $m = 100$. This is the smallest value of $m$ for which the equation has 4 solutions. Similarly, we need to find the value of $m$ such that $\frac{m}{100} = 2$, which gives $m = 200$. This is the largest value of $m$ for which the equation has 4 solutions. So the possible values of $m$ are the integers from 100 to 200, inclusive. The number of such integers is $200 - 100 + 1 = 101$. Therefore, the number of positive integers $m$ for which the equation has 4 distinct solutions is 101. The answer is: 101

 To solve this problem, we need to analyze the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ and find for how many positive integers $m$ it has $4$ distinct solutions.

The equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ is a piecewise function with $4$ cases depending on the value of $x$. We can solve each case separately and find the range of $m$ for which the equation has $4$ distinct solutions.

1. If $x < 1$, then $\vert x-1 \vert = 1-x$. So the equation becomes $\vert 1-x-2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$, or $\vert -x-1 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$. This simplifies to $\vert x+1 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$. The solutions are $x=-1-\frac{m}{100}$ and $x=-1+\frac{m}{100}$. For these solutions to be distinct, we must have $-1+\frac{m}{100} > -1-\frac{m}{100}$, which gives $\frac{m}{100} > -\frac{m}{100}$. This implies $m > 0$.

2. If $1 \leq x < 3$, then $\vert x-1 \vert = x-1$. So the equation becomes $\vert x-1-2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$, or $\vert x-3 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$. This simplifies to $x-3=\frac{m}{100}$ and $3-x=\frac{m}{100}$. The solutions are $x=3+\frac{m}{100}$ and $x=3-\frac{m}{100}$. For these solutions to be distinct, we must have $3+\frac{m}{100} > 3-\frac{m}{100}$, which gives $\frac{m}{100} > -\frac{m}{100}$. This implies $m > 0$.

3. If $x \geq 3$, then $\vert x-1 \vert = x-1$. So the equation becomes $\vert x-1-2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$, or $\vert x-3 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$. This simplifies to $x-3=\frac{m}{100}$ and $3-x=\frac{m}{100}$. The solutions are $x=3+\frac{m}{100}$ and $x=3-\frac{m}{100}$. For these solutions to be distinct, we must have $3+\frac{m}{100} < 3-\frac{m}{100}$, which gives $\frac{m}{100} < -\frac{m}{100}$. This implies $m < 0$. But $m$ must be positive, so this case is not possible.

From the analysis above, we can conclude that the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has $4$ distinct solutions when $m > 0$. The smallest positive integer $m$ that satisfies this condition is $1$, and the largest is not limited. Therefore, the number of positive integers $m$ for which the equation has $4$ distinct solutions is infinite. However, the question asks for a positive integer $m$, so we must have missed something.

Upon revisiting the analysis, we realize that we have missed a crucial point: the right-hand side of the equation, $\frac{m}{100}$, must be less than $2$. This is because the absolute value of a quantity cannot be negative, so the left-hand side of the equation, $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert$, must also be less than $2$. This gives us the inequality $\frac{m}{100} < 2$, or $m < 200$. The largest positive integer $m$ that satisfies this condition is $199$.

Therefore, the number of positive integers $m$ for which the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has $4$ distinct solutions is $199$.

However, upon further inspection, we realize that we have made a mistake in our analysis. The equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ does not have $4$ distinct solutions for all positive integers $m$. The correct analysis should be as follows:

The equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has $4$ distinct solutions when $0 < \frac{m}{100} < 2$. This gives us the inequality $0 < m < 200$. The largest positive integer $m$ that satisfies this condition is $199$.

Therefore, the number of positive integers $m$ for which the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has $4$ distinct solutions is $199$.

However, upon further inspection, we realize that we have made a mistake in our analysis. The equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ does not have $4$ distinct solutions for all positive integers $m$. The correct analysis should be as follows:

The equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has $4$ distinct solutions when $0 < \frac{m}{100} < 2$. This gives us the inequality $0 < m < 200$. The largest positive integer $m$ that satisfies this condition is $199$.

However, we must also ensure that the solutions for each case are distinct. This is not guaranteed for all positive integers $m$ in the range $0 < m < 200$. We must find the specific values of $m$ that give rise to $4$ distinct solutions.

After careful analysis, we find that the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has $4$ distinct solutions when $m = 1, 3, 5, \dots, 199$. There are exactly $100$ such values of $m$.

Therefore, the number of positive integers $m$ for which the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has $4$ distinct solutions is $100$.
The answer is: $100$

 The equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has $4$ distinct solutions if and only if $\frac{m}{100} = 1$. This is because the function $f(x) = \vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert$ has a maximum value of $3$ and a minimum value of $1$, and it attains each value in the interval $[1, 3]$ exactly twice. Therefore, the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has $4$ distinct solutions if and only if $\frac{m}{100} = 1$, which implies $m = 100$. So, there is only one positive integer $m$ for which the equation has $4$ distinct solutions, and that is $m = 100$. The answer is: $1$

 The problem asks for how many positive integers $m$ the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has $4$ distinct solutions. 

The equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has $4$ distinct solutions when $\frac{m}{100}$ is between $1$ and $2$, inclusive. This is because the function $f(x) = \vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert$ has a graph that consists of a series of "V"s, with the height of each "V" being $1$ unit. Therefore, for the equation to have $4$ distinct solutions, the right side of the equation, $\frac{m}{100}$, must be between $1$ and $2$.

To find the corresponding values of $m$, we can multiply the bounds of $\frac{m}{100}$ by $100$:
$$1 \leq \frac{m}{100} \leq 2.$$
Multiplying through by $100$ gives:
$$100 \leq m \leq 200.$$
The positive integers $m$ in this range are $101, 102, ..., 200$, of which there are $100$. Therefore, there are $100$ positive integers $m$ for which the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has $4$ distinct solutions. The answer is: $100$.

 The equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has $4$ distinct solutions if and only if $\frac{m}{100}$ is strictly between $1$ and $2$.

The number of positive integers $m$ in this range is $200 - 100 - 1 = 99$.
