"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"

The equation $AB = 0$ implies that either $A = 0$ or $B = 0$. So the given equation is equivalent to either $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$, $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$, $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$, or $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$.

From $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$, we get $\vert x + y \vert = 10$, which implies $x + y = \pm 10$.
From $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$, we get $\vert x - y \vert = 10$, which implies $x - y = \pm 10$.
From $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$, we get $\vert x \vert = 8$, which implies $x = \pm 8$.
From $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$, we get $\vert y \vert = 8$, which implies $y = \pm 8$.

The solutions to these equations are the vertices of the polygon:
$(8, 2)$, $(8, -2)$, $(-8, 2)$, $(-8, -2)$, $(2, 8)$, $(-2, 8)$, $(2, -8)$, and $(-2, -8)$.

To find the area of the polygon, we can use the shoelace formula. The coordinates of the vertices are listed in counterclockwise order: $(8, 2)$, $(8, -2)$, $(-8, -2)$, $(-8, 2)$, $(2, 8)$, $(-2, 8)$, $(2, -8)$, and $(-2, -8)$. The shoelace formula gives the area as:
$$\frac{1}{2} \left| (8 \cdot -2 + 8 \cdot -2 + -8 \cdot 2 + -8 \cdot 2 + 2 \cdot 8 + -2 \cdot 8 + 2 \cdot -8 + -2 \cdot -8) \right| = \frac{1}{2} \left| (-16 - 16 - 16 - 16 + 16 - 16 - 16 + 16) \right| = 0.$$

However, this result is incorrect because the shoelace formula gives the area of a polygon with the vertices listed in counterclockwise order. The vertices of the polygon are listed in the order $(8, 2)$, $(8, -2)$, $(-8, -2)$, $(-8, 2)$, $(2, 8)$, $(-2, 8)$, $(2, -8)$, and $(-2, -8)$, which is not in counterclockwise order.

To find the correct area, we can list the vertices in clockwise order: $(8, 2)$, $(-8, 2)$, $(-8, -2)$, $(8, -2)$, $(2, 8)$, $(-2, 8)$, $(2, -8)$, and $(-2, -8)$. Now the shoelace formula gives the area as:
$$\frac{1}{2} \left| (8 \cdot 2 + -8 \cdot 2 + -8 \cdot -2 + 8 \cdot -2 + 2 \cdot 8 + -2 \cdot 8 + 2 \cdot -8 + -2 \cdot -8) \right| = \frac{1}{2} \left| (16 - 16 + 16 - 16 + 16 - 16 - 16 + 16) \right| = 64.$$

So the area of the polygon is 64 square units. The answer is: $64$

Below is a math problem you are to solve (positive numerical answer!):
"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"
Analyze this problem and think step by step to come to a solution with programs. After solving the problem, output the final numerical answer within \boxed{}.

Assistant:

 The given equation is $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$. For the product of two numbers to be zero, either one of the numbers must be zero. Therefore, either $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$.

If $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$, then $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$, which implies that $x + y = \pm 10$ and $x - y = \pm 10$. Solving these equations gives the vertices of the square with side length 10: $(5,5), (5,-5), (-5,5), (-5,-5)$.

If $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$, then $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$, which implies that $x = \pm 8$ and $y = \pm 8$. Solving these equations gives the vertices of the square with side length 16: $(8,8), (8,-8), (-8,8), (-8,-8)$.

The union of these two squares forms a rectangle with length 16 and width 10. The area of this rectangle is $16 \times 10 = 160$. Therefore, the area of the convex polygon is 160. The answer is: $160$

Below is a math problem you are to solve (positive numerical answer!):
"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"

Assistant:

 The given equation is $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$.
For the product of two factors to be zero, either one of the factors must be zero. So we have two cases:
1. $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$
2. $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$

In the first case, both $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2$ and $( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2$ must be zero, which means $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. This implies that $x + y = \pm 10$ and $x - y = \pm 10$. Solving these equations gives us the vertices of a square with side length 10 and diagonals of length $10\sqrt{2}$.

In the second case, both $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2$ and $( \vert y \vert - 8)^2$ must be zero, which means $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$. This implies that $x = \pm 8$ and $y = \pm 8$. Solving these equations gives us the vertices of a square with side length 16 and diagonals of length $16\sqrt{2}$.

The combined solution is the union of the two squares, which forms a larger square with side length 16 and diagonals of length $16\sqrt{2}$. The area of a square is given by side length squared, so the area of this square is $16^2 = 256$.

So, the area of the convex polygon is 256. The answer is: $256$

The expression $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2)$ is equal to zero if and only if both factors are equal to zero. This happens if and only if $\vert x + y \vert = 10$, $\vert x - y \vert = 10$, $\vert x \vert = 8$, and $\vert y \vert = 8$.
The equations $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$ represent the four lines $x + y = \pm 10$ and $x - y = \pm 10$. The equations $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$ represent the four lines $x = \pm 8$ and $y = \pm 8$. These lines enclose a rectangle with side lengths 16 and 20, so the area of the rectangle is $16 \times 20 = 320$. Therefore, the area of the convex polygon is 320.
The answer is: $320$

 The given equation is of the form $A \cdot B = 0$, which implies that either $A = 0$ or $B = 0$. Therefore, the given equation is satisfied if either of the following conditions hold:

1. $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$.
2. $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$.

For the first condition to be true, we must have $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. This implies that $x + y = \pm 10$ and $x - y = \pm 10$. Solving these equations gives us the vertices of the square: $(8, 2)$, $(8, -2)$, $(-8, -2)$, and $(-8, 2)$.

For the second condition to be true, we must have $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$, which implies that $x = \pm 8$ and $y = \pm 8$. This gives us the vertices of the square: $(8, 8)$, $(8, -8)$, $(-8, -8)$, and $(-8, 8)$.

The points that satisfy the given equation are the vertices of the two squares. The convex polygon formed by these points is a larger square with side length $10\sqrt{2}$. The area of this square is $(10\sqrt{2})^2 = 200$. Therefore, the area of the convex polygon is 200 square units.

The answer is: $200$

 The given equation is equal to zero if and only if both $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ and $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ and $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$.
From this, we have $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x \vert = 8$ or $\vert x - y \vert = 10$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$.
The first pair of equations gives us $x + y = \pm 10$ and $x = \pm 8$.
The second pair of equations gives us $x - y = \pm 10$ and $y = \pm 8$.
These equations represent the lines $x + y = \pm 10$, $x = \pm 8$, $x - y = \pm 10$, and $y = \pm 8$.
These lines enclose a rectangle with vertices at $(8, 2)$, $(8, -2)$, $(-8, 2)$, $(-8, -2)$, $(2, 8)$, $(-2, 8)$, $(-2, -8)$, and $(2, -8)$.
To find the area of this rectangle, we simply multiply the lengths of its sides: $(8-(-8))(2-(-2)) = 16 \cdot 4 = 64$.
Therefore, the area of the convex polygon is 64 square units.
The answer is: $64$

The equation $A \cdot B = 0$ implies that at least one of the factors is zero. Thus, either
\begin{align*}
((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2) = 0, \quad \text{or} \\
((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0.
\end{align*}
If $A = 0$, then $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$, which implies that $x + y = \pm 10$ and $x - y = \pm 10$. Solving these equations gives the vertices of the square: $(8, 2), (8, -2), (-8, -2), (-8, 2)$.
If $B = 0$, then $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$, which implies that $x = \pm 8$ and $y = \pm 8$. Solving these equations gives the vertices of the square: $(8, 8), (8, -8), (-8, -8), (-8, 8)$.
Thus, the convex polygon is a square with side length $16$. The area of the square is $16^2 = 256$. The answer is: $256$

The given equation is a product of two expressions equal to zero, so either the first expression is zero or the second expression is zero. 

If the first expression $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$, then we must have $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. This implies that $x + y = \pm 10$ and $x - y = \pm 10$. Solving these four equations gives us the vertices of the square: $(8, 2)$, $(8, -2)$, $(-8, -2)$, and $(-8, 2)$.

If the second expression $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$, then we must have $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$. This implies that $x = \pm 8$ and $y = \pm 8$. Solving these four equations gives us the vertices of the square: $(8, 8)$, $(8, -8)$, $(-8, -8)$, and $(-8, 8)$.

Combining these two sets of vertices, we see that the points satisfying the given equation enclose a square with side length $16$. The area of this square is $16^2 = 256$.

So the area of the convex polygon is $256$.

Here is a Python code to calculate the area of the square:

```python


INTERMEDIATE OUT :

def square_area():
    side_length = 16
    area = side_length ** 2
    return area

result = square_area()
print(result)
```

CODE RESULTS 256

INTERMEDIATE OUT :
```output
256
```
The area of the convex polygon is $256$. The answer is: $256$.
