Solve the following problem with a Python Script (positive numerical answer):
"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"

Approach:


The equation $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + (\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ implies that $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. This means that the points $(x, y)$ lie on the lines $x + y = 10$ and $x - y = 10$ or $x + y = -10$ and $x - y = -10$. These lines form a square with side length 10.

The equation $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + (\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ implies that $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$. This means that the points $(x, y)$ lie on the lines $x = 8$ and $x = -8$ or $y = 8$ and $y = -8$. These lines form a square with side length 16.

The intersection of the two squares is the convex polygon whose area we need to find. The side length of this square is the minimum of the side lengths of the two squares, which is 10. Therefore, the area of the convex polygon is the area of the square with side length 10, which is $10^2 = 100$.

The answer is: $100$

Approach:

 The equation $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ implies that $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. The equation $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ implies that $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$.
The solutions to $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$ are the lines $x + y = 10$, $x + y = -10$, $x - y = 10$, and $x - y = -10$.
The solutions to $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$ are the lines $x = 8$, $x = -8$, $y = 8$, and $y = -8$.
The intersection points of these lines are $(8,8)$, $(8,-8)$, $(-8,8)$, and $(-8,-8)$.
These points form a square with side length 16. The area of this square is $16^2 = 256$. The answer is: $256$

Solve the following problem with a Python Script (positive numerical answer):
"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"

Approach:



The equation $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ implies that $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. This is only possible when $x = \pm 10$ and $y = \pm 10$. This forms a square with side length 20, so its area is $20^2 = 400$.

Similarly, the equation $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ implies that $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$. This is only possible when $x = \pm 8$ and $y = \pm 8$. This forms a square with side length 16, so its area is $16^2 = 256$.

However, the intersection of the two sets of points is the set of points that satisfy both equations. From the equations, we can see that the only points that satisfy both equations are the four corners of the squares, i.e., $(8,8)$, $(-8,8)$, $(8,-8)$, and $(-8,-8)$. These four points form a square with side length 16, so its area is $16^2 = 256$.

Therefore, the area of the convex polygon enclosed by the points is the sum of the areas of the two squares, minus the area of the smaller square (since it is counted twice), which gives $400 + 256 - 256 = 400$.
The answer is: $400$

Solve the following problem with a Python Script (positive numerical answer):
"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"

Approach:


The equation given in the problem, $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$, is satisfied if either of the two factors is zero. This gives us two cases to consider:

1. $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$. This can only happen if both $(\vert x + y \vert - 10) = 0$ and $(\vert x - y \vert - 10) = 0$, which implies $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. Solving these absolute value equations gives us four lines: $x + y = 10$, $x + y = -10$, $x - y = 10$, and $x - y = -10$. These lines form a square with side length 10 and area $10^2 = 100$.

2. $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$. This can only happen if both $(\vert x \vert - 8) = 0$ and $(\vert y \vert - 8) = 0$, which implies $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$. Solving these absolute value equations gives us four lines: $x = 8$, $x = -8$, $y = 8$, and $y = -8$. These lines form a square with side length 16 and area $16^2 = 256$.

However, the intersection of the two cases is the square formed by the lines $x = \pm8$ and $y = \pm8$, which is entirely contained in the square formed by the lines $x + y = \pm10$ and $x - y = \pm10$. Therefore, the convex polygon formed by the points satisfying the given equation is the square with side length 10 and area $10^2 = 100$. The answer is: $100$

Solve the following problem with a Python Script (positive numerical answer):
"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"

Assistant:

Approach:



The equation given is a product of two expressions equal to zero, which means either of the expressions must be zero for the product to be zero. So we have two cases:

1. $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$
2. $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$

From case 1, we have $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. This means that $x + y = \pm 10$ and $x - y = \pm 10$. Solving these equations gives us the coordinates of the vertices of the polygon.

From case 2, we have $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$. This means that $x = \pm 8$ and $y = \pm 8$. Solving these equations gives us the coordinates of the vertices of the polygon.

The coordinates of the vertices are:

$(8, 8), (8, -8), (-8, 8), (-8, -8)$

These points form a square with side length $16$. The area of a square is given by the square of the length of its side. Therefore, the area of the square is $16^2 = 256$.
The answer is: $256$

Approach:

 The given equation is a product of two expressions equal to zero, so either one of the expressions must be zero for the product to be zero. This gives us two sets of equations to solve:

1. $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ and $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ and $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ and $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$.
2. Either $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$, and either $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$.

Solving the first set of equations gives us the vertices of the polygon: $(8,8), (8,-8), (-8,8), (-8,-8)$.

Solving the second set of equations gives us the midpoints of the sides of the polygon: $(0,0), (0,16), (16,0)$.

The polygon is a square with side length 16. The area of the square is therefore $16^2 = 256$.

So the area of the convex polygon is 256. The answer is: $\boxed{256}$

Solve the following problem with a Python Script (positive numerical answer):
"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"

Approach:


The equation $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ is satisfied if either of the two factors is zero. This gives us two cases to consider:

1. $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$
2. $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$

For the first case, we have $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. This implies that the points $(x, y)$ lie on a square with side length 20.

For the second case, we have $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$. This implies that the points $(x, y)$ lie on a square with side length 16.

The area of the convex polygon is the union of the areas of these two squares. The side length of the first square is 20, so its area is $20^2 = 400$. The side length of the second square is 16, so its area is $16^2 = 256$. The total area of the convex polygon is therefore $400 + 256 = 656$.
The answer is: $656$

Solve the following problem with a Python Script (positive numerical answer):

Approach:


The equation given in the problem, $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$, is true if either of the two terms inside the product is zero. This gives us two sets of equations to solve:

1. $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ and $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$.
2. $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ and $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$.

For the first set of equations, we have:

1.1. $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$.

This gives us four equations:

1.1.1. $x + y = 10$ and $x = 8$ and $y = 2$.
1.1.2. $x + y = -10$ and $x = 8$ and $y = -18$.
1.1.3. $-x - y = 10$ and $x = 8$ and $-y = 2$, which gives $y = -2$.
1.1.4. $-x - y = -10$ and $x = 8$ and $-y = -18$, which gives $y = 18$.

For the second set of equations, we have:

2.1. $\vert x - y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$.

This gives us four more equations:

2.1.1. $x - y = 10$ and $x = 8$ and $y = -2$.
2.1.2. $x - y = -10$ and $x = 8$ and $y = 18$.
2.1.3. $-x + y = 10$ and $x = 8$ and $y = 2$.
2.1.4. $-x + y = -10$ and $x = 8$ and $y = -18$.

So, the points that satisfy the equation are $(8, 2)$, $(8, -2)$, $(8, 18)$, $(8, -18)$, $(2, 8)$, $(-18, 8)$, $(2, -8)$, and $(-18, -8)$. These points form a square with side length 16. The area of this square is $16^2 = 256$.

The answer is: $256$
