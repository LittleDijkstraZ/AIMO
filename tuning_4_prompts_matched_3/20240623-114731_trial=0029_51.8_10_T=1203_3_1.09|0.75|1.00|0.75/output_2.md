Approach:


The equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has $4$ distinct solutions means that the right side of the equation is a number that splits the absolute value function $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert$ into $4$ distinct intervals. 

The function $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert$ has the following shape: a "V" shape with its tip at $(1,2)$. The value of the function decreases from $2$ to $0$ as $x$ increases from $1$ to $3$, then increases from $0$ back to $2$ as $x$ increases from $3$ to $5$. The function is symmetric with respect to the vertical line $x=3$.

For the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ to have $4$ distinct solutions, the value of $\frac{m}{100}$ must be a number that splits the graph of $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert$ into $4$ intervals. This means $\frac{m}{100}$ must be a number between $0$ and $2$ (inclusive). 

So we have $0 \leq \frac{m}{100} \leq 2$, which simplifies to $0 \leq m \leq 200$.

The number of positive integers $m$ in this range is $201$. However, $m$ cannot be $0$ because the equation would have only two solutions, not four. So we have $1 \leq m \leq 200$. The number of positive integers in this range is $199$.

Therefore, there are $199$ positive integers $m$ such that the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has $4$ distinct solutions. The answer is: $199$.

Approach:


We know that the equation $| |x-1| - 2 | = \frac{m}{100}$ has 4 distinct solutions. This equation represents a piecewise function with four segments. For each segment, we can solve the equation and find the number of integer solutions. The sum of these solutions for all segments will give us the total number of solutions for the equation.

1. When $|x-1| - 2 \geq 0$, the equation becomes $|x-1| - 2 = \frac{m}{100}$. This simplifies to $|x-1| = 2 + \frac{m}{100}$.
   For this case, the equation has two solutions: $x-1 = 2 + \frac{m}{100}$ and $x-1 = -2 - \frac{m}{100}$. Solving these gives $x = 3 + \frac{m}{100}$ and $x = -1 - \frac{m}{100}$.

2. When $|x-1| - 2 < 0$, the equation becomes $-(|x-1| - 2) = \frac{m}{100}$. This simplifies to $|x-1| - 2 = -\frac{m}{100}$.
   Again, this gives two solutions: $x-1 = 2 - \frac{m}{100}$ and $x-1 = -2 + \frac{m}{100}$. Solving these gives $x = 3 - \frac{m}{100}$ and $x = -1 + \frac{m}{100}$.

Now we need to find for how many positive integers $m$ the four solutions are distinct.

For the first segment, the solutions are $3 + \frac{m}{100}$ and $-1 - \frac{m}{100}$. For these to be distinct, $3 + \frac{m}{100} \neq -1 - \frac{m}{100}$. This simplifies to $m \neq -75$.

For the second segment, the solutions are $3 - \frac{m}{100}$ and $-1 + \frac{m}{100}$. For these to be distinct, $3 - \frac{m}{100} \neq -1 + \frac{m}{100}$. This simplifies to $m \neq 200$.

So, we need to find how many positive integers $m$ satisfy $0 < m < 200$ and $m \neq 75$. The number of such integers is $200 - 75 - 1 = 124$.

So, the number of positive integers $m$ for which the equation $| |x-1| - 2 | = \frac{m}{100}$ has 4 distinct solutions is 124. The answer is: $124$

Approach:


We want to find the number of positive integers $m$ for which the equation $| |x - 1| - 2| = \frac{m}{100}$ has 4 distinct solutions.
The right side of the equation, $\frac{m}{100}$, is always positive, so the left side, $| |x - 1| - 2|$, must also be positive.
This means that $|x - 1| - 2 > 0$, or $|x - 1| > 2$.
This gives us two cases:
Case 1: $x - 1 > 2$, so $x > 3$.
Case 2: $x - 1 < -2$, so $x < -1$.
For Case 1, we have $x - 1 > 2$, so $x > 3$.
The equation becomes $|x - 1 - 2| = \frac{m}{100}$, or $|x - 3| = \frac{m}{100}$.
This gives us two sub-cases:
Sub-case 1.1: $x - 3 > \frac{m}{100}$, so $x > 3 + \frac{m}{100}$.
Sub-case 1.2: $x - 3 < -\frac{m}{100}$, so $x < 3 - \frac{m}{100}$.
For Case 2, we have $x - 1 < -2$, so $x < -1$.
The equation becomes $| - (x - 1) - 2| = \frac{m}{100}$, or $|-x + 1 - 2| = \frac{m}{100}$, or $|-x - 1| = \frac{m}{100}$.
This gives us two sub-cases:
Sub-case 2.1: $-x - 1 > \frac{m}{100}$, so $-x > 1 + \frac{m}{100}$, or $x < -1 - \frac{m}{100}$.
Sub-case 2.2: $-x - 1 < -\frac{m}{100}$, so $-x < -1 + \frac{m}{100}$, or $x > -1 + \frac{m}{100}$.
We want the solutions to be distinct, so we need to find the values of $m$ for which there are 4 distinct solutions.
By analyzing the sub-cases, we find that for $100 < m < 200$, there are 4 distinct solutions.
Therefore, the number of positive integers $m$ for which the equation has 4 distinct solutions is the number of integers in the range $(100, 200)$.
This is equal to $100$.
The answer is: 100

Approach:


The equation $| |x-1|-2|=\frac{m}{100}$ has four distinct solutions, we can first set $\frac{m}{100}=2$, then we can find the number of solutions for $m$.

Step 1: Solve the equation $| |x-1|-2|=2$.
We can split this into two cases:
Case 1: $|x-1|-2=2$, so $|x-1|=4$. This gives us two equations: $x-1=4$ and $x-1=-4$. The solutions are $x=5$ and $x=-3$.
Case 2: $|x-1|-2=-2$, so $|x-1|=0$. This gives us only one equation: $x-1=0$, so $x=1$.
So, for $m=200$, the equation has four distinct solutions $x=5$, $x=-3$, $x=1$.

Step 2: Determine the number of values of $m$.
We need to find the number of values of $m$ such that $| |x-1|-2|=\frac{m}{100}$ has four distinct solutions. Since we have found that $m=200$ works, we need to check if there are any other values of $m$ that also give four distinct solutions.
However, as the absolute value function $| |x-1|-2|$ is always nonnegative and its maximum value is $4$, the right-hand side $\frac{m}{100}$ must be less than or equal to $4$. This means $m \leq 400$. And since $m$ must be positive, the possible values of $m$ are $1, 2, 3, ..., 400$.

Therefore, there are $400$ possible values of $m$ such that the equation $| |x-1|-2|=\frac{m}{100}$ has four distinct solutions.
The answer is: $400$

Approach:



The equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has 4 distinct solutions if and only if $\frac{m}{100} \in (0,2)$.
This is because the function $f(x) = \vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert$ has a graph that consists of four line segments, with the segment from $x=1-2$ to $x=1+2$ having a slope of $+1$, the segment from $x=1+2$ to $x=\infty$ having a slope of $-1$, the segment from $x=-\infty$ to $x=1-2$ having a slope of $+1$, and the segment from $x=1-2$ to $x=1+2$ having a slope of $-1$. Therefore, $f(x)$ is equal to a constant plus or minus $x$. Thus, the equation $f(x) = \frac{m}{100}$ has 4 solutions if and only if $0 < \frac{m}{100} < 2$.

Solving for $m$, we get $0 < m < 200$. The positive integers $m$ in this range are 1, 2, ..., 199, giving us a total of 199 positive integers.
The answer is: $199$

Approach:


We need to find the number of positive integers $m$ for which the equation $| |x - 1| - 2| = \frac{m}{100}$ has 4 distinct solutions. 

Step 1:
The expression $| |x - 1| - 2|$ represents the distance between $x$ and $1$ after subtracting $2$ and taking the absolute value. The equation $| |x - 1| - 2| = \frac{m}{100}$ asks for the values of $x$ that are a distance of $\frac{m}{100}$ away from $1$ after subtracting $2$ and taking the absolute value.

Step 2:
The equation $| |x - 1| - 2| = \frac{m}{100}$ has 4 distinct solutions when the distance $\frac{m}{100}$ is just right to "hit" the graph of $| |x - 1| - 2|$ at 4 different points.

Step 3:
The graph of $| |x - 1| - 2|$ consists of two "V"s that are vertically shifted and horizontally shifted relative to the graph of $|x|$. The "bottom" of each "V" is at $y = 1$, and the "top" of each "V" is at $y = 3$. The distance between the two "V"s is $2$.

Step 4:
The equation $| |x - 1| - 2| = \frac{m}{100}$ has 4 distinct solutions when $\frac{m}{100}$ is just right to "hit" the graph of $| |x - 1| - 2|$ at 4 different points. This occurs when $\frac{m}{100}$ is less than the distance of $1$ between the two "V"s but greater than the distance of $\frac{1}{2}$ at the tops of the "V"s. That is, when $\frac{1}{2} < \frac{m}{100} < 1$.

Step 5:
To satisfy this inequality, $m$ must be an integer in the range $50 < m < 100$. The number of such integers is $49$.
The answer is: $49$

The equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has 4 distinct solutions, which means that the right-hand side $\frac{m}{100}$ must be a number between 1 and 2 (since the absolute value of the left-hand side can take values from 1 to 3). Therefore, we have $1 \leq \frac{m}{100} < 2$, which gives $100 \leq m < 200$. The possible values of $m$ are the integers from 100 to 199, inclusive. Counting the number of these integers gives us the number of possible values of $m$.

The number of integers from 100 to 199, inclusive, is $199 - 100 + 1 = 100$.

Therefore, the number of positive integers $m$ for which the equation has 4 distinct solutions is 100.

The answer is: $100$

The number of distinct solutions to the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ is equal to 4 when $\frac{m}{100} = 2$.

To see why this is the case, consider the function $f(x) = \vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert$. The graph of $f(x)$ consists of four line segments, with $f(x) = 0$ when $x = -1, 3, 5, 7$. The function $f(x)$ is equal to $\frac{m}{100}$ at exactly 4 points when $\frac{m}{100} = 2$, because this is the height at which the graph of $f(x)$ intersects the line $y = \frac{m}{100}$ exactly 4 times.

Solving the equation $\frac{m}{100} = 2$ gives $m = 200$. So there is only one positive integer $m$ for which the equation has 4 distinct solutions, and that is $m = 200$. The answer is: $1$

Approach:



The equation $| |x-1|-2|=\frac{m}{100}$ has four distinct solutions if and only if $\frac{m}{100}$ is less than $2$ and greater than $0$. This is because the expression on the left side of the equation, $| |x-1|-2|$, can take on any value from $0$ to $2$ and only in this range does it have four distinct solutions. So, we have $0 < \frac{m}{100} < 2$.

Solving the inequalities gives $0 < m < 200$.

Now, we need to find how many positive integers $m$ satisfy this condition. The positive integers from $1$ to $199$ inclusive are the possible values of $m$. So, there are $199$ such integers.

Therefore, the number of positive integers $m$ for which the equation has four distinct solutions is $199$. The answer is: $199$

Approach:


To solve this problem, we need to find the number of positive integers $m$ such that the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has exactly four distinct solutions.

Step 1: Simplify the equation
The equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ can be simplified as follows:
$\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$
$\Rightarrow \vert x-1 \vert -2 = \pm \frac{m}{100}$
$\Rightarrow \vert x-1 \vert = 2 \pm \frac{m}{100}$

Step 2: Analyze the number of solutions
The equation $\vert x-1 \vert = 2 \pm \frac{m}{100}$ has four distinct solutions if and only if the right-hand side is strictly greater than 0 and strictly less than 4. That is, $0 < 2 \pm \frac{m}{100} < 4$.

Solving the inequalities:
$0 < 2 - \frac{m}{100} < 4 \Rightarrow -2 < -\frac{m}{100} < 2 \Rightarrow -200 < -m < 200 \Rightarrow 200 > m > -200$. This is always true since $m$ is a positive integer.

$0 < 2 + \frac{m}{100} < 4 \Rightarrow -2 < \frac{m}{100} < 2 \Rightarrow -200 < m < 200$. This is true if $0 < m < 200$.

So, the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has four distinct solutions if and only if $0 < m < 200$.

Step 3: Count the number of positive integers in the interval $(0, 200)$
The number of positive integers in the interval $(0, 200)$ is $200 - 1 = 199$.

Therefore, the number of positive integers $m$ such that the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has exactly four distinct solutions is 199. The answer is: $199$
