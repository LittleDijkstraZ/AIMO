Approach:


The given equation has 4 distinct solutions, which means the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has 4 distinct solutions. We know that the absolute value function splits into two cases: if $y = \vert x \vert$, then $y = x$ when $x \geq 0$ and $y = -x$ when $x < 0$. So, we have two cases for the given equation:

1. $\vert x-1 \vert -2 = \frac{m}{100}$.
2. $-\vert x-1 \vert +2 = \frac{m}{100}$.

For each case, we can solve the equation for $x$ and count the number of distinct solutions. Then, we sum up the number of solutions from both cases.

1. Solving the first equation $\vert x-1 \vert -2 = \frac{m}{100}$:
\[\vert x-1 \vert = 2 + \frac{m}{100}.\]
This gives us two cases:

- Case 1.1: $x-1 = 2 + \frac{m}{100}$, which simplifies to $x = 3 + \frac{m}{100}$.
- Case 1.2: $-(x-1) = 2 + \frac{m}{100}$, which simplifies to $x = -1 + \frac{m}{100}$.

For each of these cases, we need to check the number of distinct solutions.

2. Solving the second equation $-\vert x-1 \vert +2 = \frac{m}{100}$:
\[\vert x-1 \vert = 2 - \frac{m}{100}.\]
This gives us two cases:

- Case 2.1: $x-1 = 2 - \frac{m}{100}$, which simplifies to $x = 3 - \frac{m}{100}$.
- Case 2.2: $-(x-1) = 2 - \frac{m}{100}$, which simplifies to $x = -1 - \frac{m}{100}$.

Again, we need to check the number of distinct solutions for each of these cases.

By checking the solutions for each case, we find that only Case 1.2 and Case 2.1 give 4 distinct solutions. This means we need to find the values of $m$ such that the equations $x = -1 + \frac{m}{100}$ and $x = 3 - \frac{m}{100}$ have 4 distinct solutions.

The solutions for these two equations are $x = -1 + \frac{m}{100}$ and $x = 3 - \frac{m}{100}$, respectively. For these equations to have 4 distinct solutions, we need $-1 + \frac{m}{100} < 3 - \frac{m}{100}$ and $-1 + \frac{m}{100} < -1 - \frac{m}{100}$. Solving these inequalities, we get $m > 200$.

Therefore, the positive integer $m$ that satisfies the condition is 201. So, the number of positive integers $m$ that satisfy the condition is 1. The answer is: $1$

Approach:


The given equation has four distinct solutions, which means the right side of the equation $\frac{m}{100}$ should be equal to $2$. This is because the equation $| |x - 1| - 2 | = 2$ has four distinct solutions.

Now, we set $\frac{m}{100} = 2$ and solve for $m$:
\[m = 2 \times 100 = 200.\]

Therefore, the only positive integer value of $m$ that makes the equation $| |x - 1| - 2 | = \frac{m}{100}$ have four distinct solutions is $200$. So, the answer is $\boxed{1}$.

Note: The value of $m$ should be a positive integer. Therefore, the value of $m$ cannot be negative or a fraction. The value $\frac{m}{100} = 2$ implies that $m = 200$. The equation $| |x - 1| - 2 | = 2$ has four distinct solutions, so the value of $m$ is indeed $200$.
The answer is: $1$

We know that the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has $4$ distinct solutions.
Let's analyze the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ step by step.

First, we can rewrite the equation as $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$.
This equation will have $4$ distinct solutions if and only if $\frac{m}{100}$ is between $0$ and $2$.
So, we have $0 < \frac{m}{100} < 2$.

Multiplying all sides of the inequality by $100$, we get $0 < m < 200$.

So, the positive integers $m$ that satisfy the equation are the integers from $1$ to $199$.

Now, we need to count the number of these integers that make the equation have $4$ distinct solutions.

The number of positive integers from $1$ to $199$ is $199$.

So, the number of positive integers $m$ that make the equation have $4$ distinct solutions is $199$.

But we need to find the number of positive integers $m$ that make the equation have $4$ distinct solutions.

From our analysis, we know that $m$ must be between $1$ and $199$.

So, the number of positive integers $m$ that make the equation have $4$ distinct solutions is $199$.
The answer is: $199$

Approach:


We first note that the function $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert$ has a piecewise definition. We consider each piece separately and solve the equation for each piece. The number of distinct solutions will be the sum of the number of solutions from each piece, minus the number of "double solutions" (solutions that are counted twice because they are in the intersection of two pieces).

We then count the number of positive integers $m$ for which the equation has 4 distinct solutions.

```python


INTERMEDIATE OUT :

def count_m():
    count = 0
    for m in range(1, 101):
        num_solutions = 0
        # Case 1: x - 1 >= 2
        num_solutions += 2 * (m / 100) + 4 - 1
        # Case 2: 1 <= x - 1 < 2
        num_solutions += 2 * (m / 100) + 2 - 1
        # Case 3: 0 <= x - 1 < 1
        num_solutions += 2 * (m / 100)
        # Subtract the double solutions
        num_solutions -= 2
        if num_solutions == 4:
            count += 1
    return count

result = count_m()
print(result)
```

It seems that there are no positive integers $m$ for which the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has 4 distinct solutions. However, upon revisiting the problem, we realized that we have misunderstood the question. The question asks for the number of positive integers $m$ for which the equation has 4 distinct solutions.

We need to revise our approach. Instead of counting the number of distinct solutions for each $m$, we can count the number of $m$ for which the equation has 4 distinct solutions.

```python


INTERMEDIATE OUT :

def count_m():
    count = 0
    for m in range(1, 101):
        # The number of distinct solutions is 4 if and only if the following conditions are met:
        # Case 1: 0 < m/100 <= 1
        # Case 2: 1 < m/100 <= 2
        # Case 3: 2 < m/100
        if (1 < m/100) and (m/100 <= 2):
            count += 1
    return count

result = count_m()
print(result)
```

CODE RESULTS 0

INTERMEDIATE OUT :
```output
0
```

The revised code still gives the result of 0. However, upon revisiting the problem again, we realized that we have misunderstood the conditions for the number of distinct solutions. The number of distinct solutions should be 4 if and only if the following conditions are met:

- For Case 1: $0 < m/100 <= 1$, we have $1 <= 2 * (m/100) + 4 - 1 <= 5$. This gives $1 <= m <= 5$.
- For Case 2: $1 < m/100 <= 2$, we have $3 <= 2 * (m/100) + 2 - 1 <= 5$. This gives $3 <= m <= 5$.
- For Case 3: $2 < m/100$, we have $5 <= 2 * (m/100) <= 5$. This gives $5 <= m <= 5$.

Combining these conditions, we find that the number of distinct solutions is 4 if and only if $3 <= m <= 5$. Therefore, the number of positive integers $m$ for which the equation has 4 distinct solutions is 3.

```python


INTERMEDIATE OUT :

def count_m():
    count = 0
    for m in range(1, 101):
        # The number of distinct solutions is 4 if and only if 3 <= m <= 5
        if 3 <= m <= 5:
            count += 1
    return count

result = count_m()
print(result)

We start by analyzing the equation \[\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}.\]

This equation has 4 distinct solutions when the right-hand side $\frac{m}{100}$ is equal to the distance between two consecutive "breakpoints" of the absolute value function on the left-hand side.

The breakpoints of the function $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert$ are found by setting the inner absolute value equal to zero:

$\vert x-1 \vert = 2$, which gives $x = 3$ and $x = -1$.

So, the function $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert$ has three "pieces":

1. For $x < -1$, it is equal to $-(x+1) - 2 = -x - 3$.
2. For $-1 \leq x \leq 3$, it is equal to $-(x-1) - 2 = -x + 1$.
3. For $x > 3$, it is equal to $x - 1 - 2 = x - 3$.

The distance between the breakpoints $-1$ and $3$ is $4$. Therefore, the equation \[\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}\] has 4 distinct solutions when $\frac{m}{100} = 4$, which gives $m = 400$.

So, the only positive integer $m$ for which the equation has 4 distinct solutions is $400$.

The answer is: $1$

Approach:


To have 4 distinct solutions, the right-hand side $\frac{m}{100}$ must be between 0 and 2. Therefore, we have $0 < \frac{m}{100} < 2$, which implies $0 < m < 200$. The number of positive integers $m$ in this range is 199. However, we need to check which of these values of $m$ give us 4 distinct solutions.

To do this, we can set up the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ and solve it for each value of $m$ in the range $0 < m < 200$. The number of distinct solutions will be 4 for some values of $m$. We can count these values to find the number of positive integers $m$ that satisfy the condition.

This approach is computationally intensive and time-consuming. However, we can use the following observation: the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has 4 distinct solutions when $\frac{m}{100}$ is strictly between the values of $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert$ when the two absolute value expressions change their nature (from "minus to plus" or "plus to minus").

The values of $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert$ are 0, 1, and 2. Therefore, the equation has 4 distinct solutions when $\frac{m}{100}$ is strictly between 1 and 2. This happens when $100 < m < 200$. The number of positive integers in this range is 100.

So, the number of positive integers $m$ that satisfy the condition is 100. The answer is: 100

Approach:


The equation $| |x-1|-2|=\frac{m}{100}$ has four distinct solutions if and only if $\frac{m}{100}$ is strictly between $0$ and $2$. Thus, we have $0 < \frac{m}{100} < 2$, which simplifies to $0 < m < 200$.

Since $m$ is a positive integer, the possible values of $m$ are the integers from $1$ to $199$. We need to count the number of these integers that satisfy the equation.

We can see that $\frac{m}{100}$ can take on any value strictly between $0$ and $2$ for $m$ in the range $1$ to $199$. Since $\frac{m}{100}$ must be strictly between $0$ and $2$, the possible values of $\frac{m}{100}$ are the fractions strictly between $0$ and $2$ with denominator $100$.

The number of such fractions is equal to the number of positive integers less than $200$ and greater than $0$. This is simply $199$.

Therefore, the number of positive integers $m$ for which the equation $| |x-1|-2|=\frac{m}{100}$ has four distinct solutions is $199$.

The answer is: 199

Approach:


The number of distinct solutions of the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ is equal to 4 if and only if $\frac{m}{100}$ is equal to 2. This is because the function $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert$ is a piecewise linear function with 4 distinct segments, and each segment has a length of 1. Therefore, for the equation to have 4 distinct solutions, the right-hand side of the equation, which is $\frac{m}{100}$, must be equal to 2.

Now we can solve for $m$:
\[\frac{m}{100}=2 \Rightarrow m=200.\]
So the value of $m$ that makes the equation have 4 distinct solutions is 200.
The answer is: $200$

Approach:


The given equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has 4 distinct solutions. We know that $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert$ is a "V" shaped graph with the "vertex" at $(1,2)$. The value of $\frac{m}{100}$ must be equal to the distance from the vertex to the x-axis, which is 2. Therefore, we have $\frac{m}{100}=2$, and solving for $m$ gives $m=200$.

However, we need to check if this value of $m$ indeed gives 4 distinct solutions. Substituting $m=200$ into the equation, we get $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{200}{100}=2$.

This equation can be split into two cases: $\vert x-1 \vert -2 = 2$ and $\vert x-1 \vert -2 = -2$.

For the first case, $\vert x-1 \vert -2 = 2$ simplifies to $\vert x-1 \vert = 4$. This gives us two sub-cases: $x-1 = 4$ and $x-1 = -4$. Solving these gives us $x = 5$ and $x = -3$.

For the second case, $\vert x-1 \vert -2 = -2$ simplifies to $\vert x-1 \vert = 0$. This gives us only one sub-case: $x-1 = 0$, which gives us $x = 1$.

So the solutions to the equation are $x = 5$, $x = -3$, and $x = 1$. However, $x = 1$ is a repeated root because it makes both the original equation and its derivative equal to zero. So we only have 3 distinct solutions. This contradicts our initial assumption that the equation should have 4 distinct solutions.

Therefore, we must reconsider our approach. The value of $\frac{m}{100}$ should be less than 2, because otherwise we would only get 3 distinct solutions. Let's try $\frac{m}{100}=1$, which gives $m=100$.

Substituting $m=100$ into the equation, we get $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{100}{100}=1$.

This equation can be split into two cases: $\vert x-1 \vert -2 = 1$ and $\vert x-1 \vert -2 = -1$.

For the first case, $\vert x-1 \vert -2 = 1$ simplifies to $\vert x-1 \vert = 3$. This gives us two sub-cases: $x-1 = 3$ and $x-1 = -3$. Solving these gives us $x = 4$ and $x = -2$.

For the second case, $\vert x-1 \vert -2 = -1$ simplifies to $\vert x-1 \vert = 1$. This gives us two sub-cases: $x-1 = 1$ and $x-1 = -1$. Solving these gives us $x = 2$ and $x = 0$.

So the solutions to the equation are $x = 4$, $x = -2$, $x = 2$, and $x = 0$. All of these are distinct solutions.

Therefore, the value of $m$ that makes the equation have 4 distinct solutions is $m=100$. The answer is: $1$
