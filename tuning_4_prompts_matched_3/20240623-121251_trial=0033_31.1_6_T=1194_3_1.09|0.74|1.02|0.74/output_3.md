Approach:

 The equation $AB = 0$ implies that either $A = 0$ or $B = 0$. So, the given equation implies that either $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$.

The equation $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ implies that $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. This means that $x + y = \pm 10$ and $x - y = \pm 10$. Solving these equations, we get the vertices of the square as $(0, 10), (0, -10), (10, 0), (-10, 0)$.

The equation $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ implies that $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$. This means that $x = \pm 8$ and $y = \pm 8$. So, we get the vertices of the square as $(8, 0), (-8, 0), (0, 8), (0, -8)$.

So, the convex polygon is the union of the two squares, which is a rectangle with length 10 and width 16. The area of the rectangle is $10 \times 16 = 160$. The answer is: $160$

Solve the following problem with a Python Script (positive numerical answer):
"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"

Approach:


The given equation is a product of two terms, and it equals to zero. Therefore, either of the terms must be zero.
Let's consider each term separately:
1. $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$
2. $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$

From equation 1, we have $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. This means that the points $(x, y)$ must lie on the lines $x + y = 10$ and $x - y = 10$. These lines intersect at the point $(5, 5)$.

From equation 2, we have $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$. This means that the points $(x, y)$ must lie on the lines $x = 8$ and $y = 8$. These lines form a square with side length 8. The vertices of the square are $(8, 0)$, $(0, 8)$, $(-8, 0)$, and $(0, -8)$.

The intersection of the two sets of lines forms a square with side length 5. The area of this square is $5^2 = 25$. Therefore, the area of the convex polygon is 25.

The answer is: $25$

Approach:


The equation $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ implies that $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. This means that $x + y = \pm 10$ and $x - y = \pm 10$. Solving these four equations, we get the vertices of the polygon as $(0, 10), (0, -10), (10, 0)$ and $(-10, 0)$.

Similarly, the equation $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ implies that $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$. This means that $x = \pm 8$ and $y = \pm 8$. So the vertices of the polygon are also $(8, 8), (8, -8), (-8, 8)$ and $(-8, -8)$.

The polygon formed by these vertices is a square with side length 10 (the maximum distance between the points $(0, 10)$ and $(0, -10)$, or $(8, 8)$ and $(8, -8)$).

The area of a square is given by the square of the length of its side. So the area of the polygon is $10^2 = 100$.
The answer is: $100$

Solve the following problem with a Python Script (positive numerical answer):
"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"
Write comments to indicate the steps you take. Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Assistant:

Approach:

 The equation given is a product of two terms equal to zero, which means either of the terms has to be zero for the entire equation to be zero. So, we can solve each term separately.

For the first term, we have two absolute value expressions: $|x+y| - 10 = 0$ and $|x-y| - 10 = 0$. This implies $|x+y| = 10$ and $|x-y| = 10$.

The absolute value equations $|x+y| = 10$ and $|x-y| = 10$ represent two pairs of parallel lines, namely $x+y = 10$, $x+y = -10$, $x-y = 10$, and $x-y = -10$. These lines form a square with side length 10. The area of this square is $10^2 = 100$.

For the second term, we have two absolute value expressions: $|x| - 8 = 0$ and $|y| - 8 = 0$. This implies $|x| = 8$ and $|y| = 8$.

The absolute value equations $|x| = 8$ and $|y| = 8$ represent two pairs of parallel lines, namely $x = 8$, $x = -8$, $y = 8$, and $y = -8$. These lines form a square with side length 16. The area of this square is $16^2 = 256$.

However, the points that satisfy both terms are the points that lie on the boundary of the square formed by the first term, since the second term's square encloses the first term's square. Therefore, the area of the convex polygon formed by the points satisfying the equation is the area of the first square, which is 100.
The answer is: $100$

Assistant:

Approach:

 The given equation is equal to zero, which implies that either the first term or the second term is zero. This means that either $|x+y| = 10$ or $|x-y| = 10$, or $|x| = 8$ or $|y| = 8$. These equations represent four lines in the coordinate plane. The intersections of these lines form a rectangle. The vertices of the rectangle are $(8,8)$, $(8,-8)$, $(-8,8)$, and $(-8,-8)$.

To find the area of the rectangle, we simply multiply the length by the width. The length is $16$ and the width is $16$, so the area is $16 \times 16 = 256$.

The answer is: $256$

Solve the following problem with a Python Script (positive numerical answer):
"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"
Write comments to indicate the steps you take. Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Assistant:

Approach:


The given equation is $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$. This equation is equal to zero if either of the two terms is equal to zero. Therefore, we have two cases to consider:

1. $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$
2. $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$

For the first case, we have $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ and $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$. This implies that $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. The solutions to these equations are $x + y = \pm 10$ and $x - y = \pm 10$. These lines form a square with side length 10 and area $10^2 = 100$.

For the second case, we have $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ and $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$. This implies that $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$. The solutions to these equations are $x = \pm 8$ and $y = \pm 8$. These lines form a square with side length 16 (since the diagonals of the square formed by the first case are the sides of this square) and area $16^2 = 256$.

However, the area of the polygon formed by the intersection of the two squares is the sum of the areas of the two squares minus the area of the intersection. The intersection of the two squares is another square with side length 8 (since the diagonals of the smaller square are the sides of the larger square) and area $8^2 = 64$.

Therefore, the area of the convex polygon is $100 + 256 - 64 = 292$.

The answer is: $292$

Approach:


The equation $A \cdot B = 0$ is equivalent to $A = 0$ or $B = 0$. Therefore, the given equation is equivalent to either $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$.

The equation $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ implies that $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. This is the equation of a square with side length 20, and its area is $20^2 = 400$.

The equation $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ implies that $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$, which is the equation of a square with side length 16, and its area is $16^2 = 256$.

However, the area of the polygon formed by the intersection of these two squares is the sum of the areas of the two squares minus the area of the intersection. The intersection of the two squares is another square with side length 8, and its area is $8^2 = 64$.

Therefore, the area of the convex polygon is $400 + 256 - 64 = 592$. The answer is: $592$

Approach:


The given equation is a product of two expressions equal to zero. Therefore, either of the expressions must be zero for the product to be zero. This gives us two sets of equations to solve:

1. $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ and $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ and $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ and $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$.
2. One of the expressions $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2$, $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2$, $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2$, or $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2$ is equal to zero, but not all of them.

Solving the first set of equations gives us the vertices of the polygon.

For the second set of equations, we can see that if one of the expressions is zero, it means that either $|x+y|=10$, $|x-y|=10$, $|x|=8$, or $|y|=8$. This represents the lines where the sides of the polygon are formed.

Now, let's solve the equations:

For $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$, we have $|x+y|=10$. This is a square with side length 10 units, so its area is $10^2 = 100$ square units.

For $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$, we have $|x-y|=10$. This is a square with side length 10 units, so its area is also $10^2 = 100$ square units.

For $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$, we have $|x|=8$. This is a square with side length 8 units, so its area is $8^2 = 64$ square units.

For $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$, we have $|y|=8$. This is a square with side length 8 units, so its area is also $8^2 = 64$ square unit.

Now, let's add up the areas of the four squares to get the total area of the polygon: $100 + 100 + 64 + 64 = 332$ square units.

So, the area of the convex polygon is 332 square units. The answer is: $332$

From the second equation, we get $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$, which implies that the polygon is a square with side length 16. The area of the square is $16^2 = 256$.

Assistant:

Approach:


The given equation is a product of two terms, and for the product to be zero, one of the terms must be zero. Therefore, we can set each term equal to zero and solve for the corresponding conditions.

1. For the first term:
$$((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2) = 0.$$
This implies that $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. The only way this can happen is if $x = y = 5$ or $x = -y = -5$. This gives us two lines $x = y$ and $x = -y$.

2. For the second term:
$$(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0.$$
This implies that $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$. The only way this can happen is if $-8 \leq x \leq 8$ and $-8 \leq y \leq 8$. This gives us a square with side length 16.

The intersection of the two conditions gives us a square with side length 10, which is the convex polygon. The area of a square is given by the square of the side length, so the area of this square is $10^2 = 100$.
The answer is: $100$

 The equation $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + (\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ implies that $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. This means that $x + y = \pm 10$ and $x - y = \pm 10$. Solving these equations gives the vertices of the square as $(8, 2)$, $(8, -2)$, $(-8, -2)$, and $(-8, 2)$.

Similarly, the equation $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + (\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ implies that $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$, which means that $x = \pm 8$ and $y = \pm 8$. This gives the vertices of the square as $(8, 8)$, $(8, -8)$, $(-8, -8)$, and $(-8, 8)$.

 The equation $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ implies that $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. These two equations define a square with side length 20. Similarly, the equation $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ implies that $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$, which defines a square with side length 16. The intersection of these two squares is the convex polygon we are looking for. This intersection is a square with side length 8 (since the side length of the intersection is the smaller of the two side lengths of the two squares).

The area of a square is given by the square of its side length, so the area of the convex polygon is $8^2 = 64$.

So, the area of the convex polygon is 64. The answer is: $64$

The equation $AB = 0$ is satisfied if and only if $A = 0$ or $B = 0$. Therefore, the given equation is satisfied if and only if either of the following two equations is satisfied:
1. $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$
2. $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$

From equation 2., we have $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$, which implies that the points lie on a square with side length 16. The vertices of this square are $(8,8)$, $(8,-8)$, $(-8,8)$, and $(-8,-8)$.

From equation 1., we have $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. This implies that the points lie on a square with side length 20. The vertices of this square are $(10,0)$, $(0,10)$, $(-10,0)$, and $(0,-10)$.

The intersection of the two squares is a square with side length 8 (the smaller square). Therefore, the area of the convex polygon is $8^2 = 64$. The answer is: $64$

Approach:


The equation given is a product of two expressions equal to zero, which means that either of the expressions must be zero for the product to be zero. Therefore, we have two cases to consider:

1. $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$
2. $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$

For the first case, both $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2$ and $( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2$ must be zero. This means that $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. This implies that the points $(x, y)$ lie on a square with side length 10.

For the second case, both $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2$ and $( \vert y \vert - 8)^2$ must be zero. This means that $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$. This implies that the points $(x, y)$ lie on a square with side length 16.

The intersection of these two cases is the set of points that satisfy both conditions. This intersection is a square with side length 10, since the side length of the square formed by the first case is smaller than the side length of the square formed by the second case.

To find the area of this square, we simply square the side length: $10^2 = 100$. Therefore, the area of the convex polygon is 100 square units. The answer is: $100$
