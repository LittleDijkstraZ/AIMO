Interesting, let's analyze step by step:



From the problem, we have the equation: $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$

This equation is true only when either of the two expressions equals zero:
1. $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$
2. $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$

From the first equation, we can see that $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. This gives us four points in the coordinate plane: $(8, 2)$, $(8, -2)$, $(-8, 2)$, and $(-8, -2)$.

From the second equation, we can see that $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$. This gives us four more points: $(8, 8)$, $(8, -8)$, $(-8, 8)$, and $(-8, -8)$.

So, the eight points are: $(8, 2)$, $(8, -2)$, $(-8, 2)$, $(-8, -2)$, $(8, 8)$, $(8, -8)$, $(-8, 8)$, and $(-8, -8)$. These eight points enclose a square with side length 16. The area of the square is therefore $16^2 = 256$.
The answer is: $256$

Interesting, let's analyze step by step:



1. We have two equations: $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ and $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$.
2. If the first equation is zero, it implies that $\vert x + y \vert = 10$, which means $x + y = \pm 10$.
3. If the second equation is zero, it implies that $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$, so $x = \pm 8$ and $y = \pm 8$.

4. The points that satisfy both conditions are the vertices of the rectangle formed by the intersections of the lines $x + y = 10$, $x + y = -10$, $x = 8$, $x = -8$, $y = 8$, and $y = -8$.

5. To find the vertices, we can simply plot these lines and find the intersections.

The vertices of the rectangle are:
$(8, 2)$, $(8, -18)$, $(-8, 18)$, and $(-8, -2)$.

6. To find the area of the rectangle, we simply multiply the length by the width. The length is the difference between the maximum and minimum x-values, which is $8 - (-8) = 16$. The width is the difference between the maximum and minimum y-values, which is $18 - (-2) = 20$.

7. The area of the rectangle is then $16 \times 20 = 320$.

So, the area of the convex polygon is 320.
The answer is: $320$

Interesting, let's analyze step by step:



The condition given in the problem, $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$, can be satisfied only if at least one of the two conditions holds:

1. $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$. This can happen only if $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. This implies that $x = \pm 10$ and $y = \pm 10$. So, the four points that satisfy this condition are: $(10, 10)$, $(10, -10)$, $(-10, 10)$, $(-10, -10)$.
2. $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$. This can happen only if $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$. This implies that $x = \pm 8$ and $y = \pm 8$. So, the four points that satisfy this condition are: $(8, 8)$, $(8, -8)$, $(-8, 8)$, $(-8, -8)$.

Thus, the vertices of the polygon are $(10, 10)$, $(10, -10)$, $(-10, 10)$, $(-10, -10)$, $(8, 8)$, $(8, -8)$, $(-8, 8)$, $(-8, -8)$. These eight points form a square with side length $16$. 

The area of the square is then $16^2 = 256$. So, the area of the convex polygon is 256.

The solution is: $\boxed{256}$.
The answer is $\boxed{256}$.

Interesting, let's analyze step by step:



First, we notice that the product of two numbers is equal to zero if and only if at least one of the numbers is zero. So, we have two cases to consider:

1. $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ and $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ or
2. $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ and $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$.

For the first case, we have $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. This implies that $x + y = \pm 10$ and $x - y = \pm 10$, which give us the system of equations:

- $x + y = 10$ and $x - y = 10$ or
- $x + y = 10$ and $x - y = -10$ or
- $x + y = -10$ and $x - y = 10$ or
- $x + y = -10$ and $x - y = -10$.

Solving this system, we find the points $(5,5)$, $(5,-5)$, $(-5,5)$, and $(-5,-5)$.

For the second case, we have $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$, which implies that $x = \pm 8$ and $y = \pm 8$. This gives us the points $(8,8)$, $(8,-8)$, $(-8,8)$, and $(-8,-8)$.

So, the points satisfying the equation are $(5,5)$, $(5,-5)$, $(8,8)$, $(8,-8)$, $(-5,5)$, $(-5,-5)$, $(-8,8)$, and $(-8,-8)$. These points form a square with side length 10, hence the area of the square is $10^2 = 100$. Therefore, the area of the convex polygon is 100. The answer is: $100$.

Interesting, let's analyze step by step:



Step 1: List the variables and known values from the problem.

The problem involves absolute values and inequalities, which makes it complex. However, the expression equals 0 if either of the two factors equal zero. This means we can consider each factor separately. The area of the polygon formed by the points satisfying each factor separately can be calculated using geometry.

Step 2: Outline the steps using sympy to solve the problem.

1. For the factor $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2$:
   This factor equals zero if and only if $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. This forms a square with side length 10 and vertices at $(\pm 10, 0)$, $(0, \pm 10)$.

2. For the factor $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2$:
   This factor equals zero if and only if $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$. This forms a square with side length 16 and vertices at $(\pm 8, 0)$, $(0, \pm 8)$.

Step 3: Implement these functions step-by-step, commenting each line for clarity.

We calculate the area of each square:

Square 1: side length 10, area $10^2 = 100$.
Square 2: side length 16, area $16^2 = 256$.

Step 4: Calculate the final answer and verify it's a positive integer.

The total area of the polygon is the sum of the areas of the two squares, which is $100 + 256 = 356$.
The answer is: 356.

The product of two numbers is zero if and only if at least one of them is zero. Therefore, the given equation implies that either $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$.

If $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$, then $\vert x + y \vert = 10$. If $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$, then $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. If $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$, then $\vert x \vert = 8$, so $x = 8$ or $x = -8$. If $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$, then $\vert y \vert = 8$, so $y = 8$ or $y = -8$.

Now, if $x = 8$, then $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ implies that $y = -2$ or $y = 18$. If $x = -8$, then $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ implies that $y = 18$ or $y = -18$. Similarly, if $y = 8$, then $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ implies that $x = -2$ or $x = 18$. If $y = -8$, then $\vert x - y \vert = 10$ implies that $x = 18$ or $x = -18$.

Putting all these together, the polygon is a square with side length 16. The area of the square is $16^2 = 256$.
The answer is: $256$

Assistant:

Interesting, let's analyze step by step:



The expression is equal to zero if and only if both $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2$ and $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2$ are equal to zero, or both $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2$ and $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2$ are equal to zero.

This gives us four cases to consider:

1. $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. From this, we get $x + y = \pm 10$ and $x - y = \pm 10$. Solving these equations gives us $x = 0, y = \pm 10$ or $x = \pm 10, y = 0$.
2. $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$. From this, we get $x = \pm 8$ and $y = \pm 8$.

The intersections of these points give us a square with side length 10. The area of this square is $10^2 = 100$.

Therefore, the area of the convex polygon is 100. We'll output the result:
The answer is: $100$

Assistant:

Interesting, let's analyze step by step:



We have two functions: `abs(x + y) - 10` and `abs(x - y) - 10`. For both of these to equal zero, `abs(x + y)` and `abs(x - y)` must equal 10.

This means `x + y = 10` or `x + y = -10`, and `x - y = 10` or `x - y = -10`. Solving these systems of equations, we find the vertices of the polygon: `(0, 10), (0, -10), (10, 0), (-10, 0)`.

Similarly, the vertices from the second set of functions, `abs(x) - 8 = 0` and `abs(y) - 8 = 0`, are `(8, 8), (8, -8), (-8, 8), (-8, -8)`.

Now we can plot these points and find the convex polygon they enclose: a square with side length 10. The area of this square is `10 * 10 = 100`.

The positive integer area of the convex polygon is 100. The answer is: $100$.

Interesting, let's analyze step by step:



First, it is clear from the question that the points satisfying this equation is the set of points where either $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$.

If $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$, then $\vert x + y \vert = 10$. This is a square with side length 20, so the area is $20 \times 20 = 400$.

If $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$, then $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. This is also a square with side length 20, so the area is also 400.

If $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$, then $\vert x \vert = 8$. This is a square with side length 16, so the area is $16 \times 16 = 256$.

If $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$, then $\vert y \vert = 8$. This is a square with side length 16, so the area is also 256.

Therefore, the total area of the polygon is $400 + 400 + 256 + 256 = 1312$.

However, we are asked for the area of the convex polygon that is formed by the intersection of these squares. The intersection of these squares forms a smaller square with side length 8 (because the minimum distance between the edges of the two squares with side length 20 is 8), so the area is $8 \times 8 = 64$.

Hence, the area of the convex polygon is 64.
The answer is: $\boxed{64}$

We know that the product of two numbers is zero if and only if at least one of them is zero. So we have two equations to solve:
1) $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$
2) $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$
3) $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$
4) $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$

For equation 1) we get $\vert x + y \vert = 10$, for equation 2) we get $\vert x - y \vert = 10$, for equation 3) we get $\vert x \vert = 8$, and for equation 4) we get $\vert y \vert = 8$.

From $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$, we get $x = \pm8, y = \pm8$.
From $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$, we get $x = \pm8, y = \pm8$.

So the points are $(8,8)$, $(8,-8)$, $(-8,8)$, and $(-8,-8)$. These points form a square with side length 16. The area of this square is $16^2 = 256$. So the area of the convex polygon is 256. Since 256 is a positive integer, our solution is correct.

So the area of the convex polygon is 256.

The answer is: $\boxed{256}$.
