Approach:


We can solve this problem by using the inequality $|a| + |b| \geq |a+b|$ for all real numbers $a$ and $b$. Applying this inequality to the given equation $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$, we get:
$$|x-2y| + |y-2x| \geq |(x-2y) + (y-2x)| = |-x - y| = |-(x+y)| = |x+y|.$$
So, $|x+y| = 40$.
Now, let's consider the expression $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$. We can rewrite it as:
$$5x^2+5y^2-8xy = \frac{1}{2}((5x^2-8xy+8y^2) + (5y^2-8xy+8x^2)) = \frac{1}{2}((5x-4y)^2 + (4x-5y)^2).$$
Now, we know that $(5x-4y)^2 \geq 0$ and $(4x-5y)^2 \geq 0$, so
$$(5x-4y)^2 + (4x-5y)^2 \geq 0.$$
Hence, $\frac{1}{2}((5x-4y)^2 + (4x-5y)^2) \geq 0$.
So, the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ is 0.
However, we also know that $|x+y| = 40$. If we set $x = -y$, we get $|x-(-x)| = |2x| = 40$, so $2|x| = 40$ and $|x| = 20$. Then, $x^2 + y^2 = x^2 + (-x)^2 = 2x^2 = 2(20^2) = 800$.
Therefore, the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ when $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$ is 0. The answer is: $0$

Approach:


We first note that the given equation $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$ is equivalent to $|x-2y| + |2y-x| = 40$.
Since $|a| = |-a|$ for any real number $a$, we can simplify the equation to $|x-2y| - |2y-x| = 40$.
Now, we know that $|a| - |b| = |a+b|$ if $a$ and $b$ have the same sign, and $|a| - |b| = |a-b|$ if $a$ and $b$ have opposite signs.
In this case, $x-2y$ and $2y-x$ have opposite signs, so we can rewrite the equation as $|(x-2y) - (2y-x)| = 40$.
Simplifying the left side gives $|x-2y-2y+x| = 40$, which further simplifies to $|2x-4y| = 40$.
Dividing both sides by 2 gives $|x-2y| = 20$.
Now, we can rewrite the expression $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ as $(5x^2-8xy+5y^2)$.
We can complete the square to get $(5x^2-8xy+5y^2) = (x^2 - 2*2xy + 4y^2) + (y^2 - 6xy + 9x^2) = (x-2y)^2 + (y-3x)^2$.
Since we know that $|x-2y| = 20$, the minimum value of $(x-2y)^2$ is 0.
Similarly, since $|x-2y| = 20$, we can substitute $x = 2y + 10$ into the equation $|y-3x| = |y-3(2y+10)| = |-5y-30| = 5|y+6|$.
If $|y+6| = 8$, then $|y-3x| = 40$ and $(y-3x)^2 = 1600$.
If $|y+6| = 2$, then $|y-3x| = 4$ and $(y-3x)^2 = 16$.
Since we want to minimize the value of $(x-2y)^2 + (y-3x)^2$, we should choose the case where $|y+6| = 2$.
So, $|y+6| = 2$ gives $y = -8$ or $y = -4$.
If $y = -8$, then $x = 2(-8) + 10 = -6$.
If $y = -4$, then $x = 2(-4) + 10 = 2$.
We can check that both of these pairs satisfy the equation $|x-2y| = 20$.
Now, we substitute these values into the expression $(x-2y)^2 + (y-3x)^2$.
If $x = -6$ and $y = -8$, then $(x-2y)^2 + (y-3x)^2 = (0)^2 + (40)^2 = 1600$.
If $x = 2$ and $y = -4$, then $(x-2y)^2 + (y-3x)^2 = (20)^2 + (4)^2 = 416$.
Since we want to minimize the value of the expression, the minimum value is 416.
The answer is: $416$

Approach:


To solve this problem, we can use the method of completing the square and the inequality $|a| + |b| \geq |a + b|$.

First, let's rewrite the given expression $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ as $(5x^2 - 8xy + 5y^2)$. Now, we complete the square for the $x$ and $y$ terms:
\[(5x^2 - 8xy + 5y^2) = (5x^2 - 8xy + 4y^2) + y^2 = (5(x - y)^2 + y^2).\]

Now, let's consider the constraint $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$. By the inequality $|a| + |b| \geq |a + b|$, we have
\[|x-2y| + |y-2x| = |x-2y| + |2y-x| \geq |(x-2y) + (2y-x)| = 0.\]
Since $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$, we must have equality, which means $x-2y$ and $2y-x$ must have the same sign. This implies that $x = 2y$.

Substituting $x = 2y$ into the expression $(5(x - y)^2 + y^2)$, we get
\[(5(2y - y)^2 + y^2) = (5y^2 + y^2) = 6y^2.\]
Since $y$ can be any real number, the minimum value of $6y^2$ is 0, which occurs when $y = 0$. Substituting $y = 0$ into the equation $x = 2y$, we get $x = 0$.

Therefore, the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ subject to the constraint $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$ is achieved when $x = 0$ and $y = 0$, and the minimum value is $6 \cdot 0^2 = 0$. The answer is: $0$

Solve the following problem with a Python Script (positive numerical answer):
"What is the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ when $x$ and $y$ range over all real numbers such that $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$?"

Approach:


To solve this problem, we will use the fact that the expression $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ can be rewritten as $(5x^2-8xy+5y^2)$, which is the square of a binomial. We will then use the constraint $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$ to find the minimum value of the expression.

First, we rewrite the expression $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ as $(5x^2-8xy+5y^2) = ( \sqrt{5}x - \sqrt{5}y)^2$. This is a square of a binomial, so it is always nonnegative.

Next, we use the constraint $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$. By the triangle inequality, we know that $|x-2y| + |y-2x| \geq |(x-2y) - (y-2x)| = |x-2y - y+2x| = |3x-3y| = 3|x-y|$. So we have $3|x-y| = 40$, which implies $|x-y| = \frac{40}{3}$.

Now, let's consider the function $f(x, y) = ( \sqrt{5}x - \sqrt{5}y)^2$. Since this is a square of a binomial, its minimum value is achieved when the binomial is zero, i.e., when $\sqrt{5}x - \sqrt{5}y = 0$, or $x = y$.

Substituting $x = y$ into the constraint $|x-y| = \frac{40}{3}$, we get $|0| = \frac{40}{3}$, which is a contradiction. Therefore, we need to consider another possibility: $x = 2y$ or $y = 2x$.

If $x = 2y$, then the constraint becomes $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = |x-x| + |y-y| = 0 \neq 40$.

If $y = 2x$, then the constraint becomes $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = |x-4x| + |2x-x| = |-3x| + |x| = 4x$. Setting $4x = 40$, we find $x = 10$ and $y = 20$.

Substituting $x = 10$ and $y = 20$ into the expression $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$, we get $5(10)^2+5(20)^2-8(10)(20) = 500 + 2000 - 1600 = 1900$.

Therefore, the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ is $1900$. The answer is: $1900$

Approach:


To find the minimum value of the expression $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ under the condition $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$, we can use the Cauchy-Schwarz inequality. The Cauchy-Schwarz inequality states that for any real numbers $a_1, a_2, ..., a_n$ and $b_1, b_2, ..., b_n$, we have
\[(a_1^2 + a_2^2 + ... + a_n^2)(b_1^2 + b_2^2 + ... + b_n^2) \geq (a_1b_1 + a_2b_2 + ... + a_nb_n)^2.\]
In this case, we can let $a_1 = x$, $a_2 = y$, $b_1 = 1$, and $b_2 = -2$. Then we have
\[(x^2 + y^2)(1^2 + (-2)^2) \geq (x - 2y)^2.\]
Simplifying, we get
\[(x^2 + y^2)(1 + 4) \geq (x - 2y)^2,\]
\[5(x^2 + y^2) \geq (x - 2y)^2.\]
Similarly, we can let $a_1 = y$, $a_2 = x$, $b_1 = -2$, and $b_2 = 1$. Then we have
\[(y^2 + x^2)((-2)^2 + 1^2) \geq (y - 2x)^2.\]
Simplifying, we get
\[(y^2 + x^2)(4 + 1) \geq (y - 2x)^2,\]
\[5(y^2 + x^2) \geq (y - 2x)^2.\]
Adding the two inequalities, we get
\[10(x^2 + y^2) \geq (x - 2y)^2 + (y - 2x)^2.\]
By the condition $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$, we know that $(x - 2y)^2 + (y - 2x)^2 = 40^2 = 1600$. Substituting this into the inequality, we get
\[10(x^2 + y^2) \geq 1600,\]
\[x^2 + y^2 \geq \frac{1600}{10} = 160.\]
Now, we can substitute $x^2 + y^2 \geq 160$ into the expression $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ to find its minimum value. We have
\[5x^2+5y^2-8xy \geq 5(160) - 8xy = 800 - 8xy.\]
To minimize $800 - 8xy$, we need to maximize $xy$. By the AM-GM inequality, we have
\[xy \leq \frac{(x^2 + y^2)}{2} \leq \frac{160}{2} = 80.\]
Equality occurs when $x = y$, so the maximum value of $xy$ is 80. Therefore, the minimum value of $800 - 8xy$ is $800 - 8(80) = 800 - 640 = 160$.

Therefore, the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ is 160. The answer is: $160$

Approach:



We first note that the given equation $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$ is equivalent to $|x-2y| + |2y-x| = 40$, which simplifies to $|x-2y| - |x-2y| = 40$, or $0 = 40$, which is a contradiction. Therefore, we must have made an error in our simplification. Let's go back and check our work.

We see that we made an error in the simplification of $|y-2x|$. The correct simplification is $|y-2x| = |-(2x-y)| = |2x-y|$. So the correct equation is $|x-2y| + |2x-y| = 40$.

Now we can proceed to solve the problem.

Let $z = x - 2y$ and $w = 2x - y$. Then the equation becomes $|z| + |w| = 40$. We want to find the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy = 5(x^2+y^2) - 8xy$.

We can rewrite $5(x^2+y^2) - 8xy = \frac{1}{2}(10x^2+10y^2-16xy) = \frac{1}{2}((5x^2-8xy+4y^2) + (5y^2+8xy+4x^2)) = \frac{1}{2}((5x-4y)^2 + (5y+4x)^2)$.

Now we can use the equation $|z| + |w| = 40$ to find the minimum value of this expression. Since $|z| + |w| = 40$, we know that $|z|$ and $|w|$ must be both zero at the minimum point. This means that $z = 0$ and $w = 0$, or $x - 2y = 0$ and $2x - y = 0$. Solving these equations, we find that $x = \frac{4}{3}y$ and $y = \frac{2}{3}x$. Substituting these values into the expression, we get $\frac{1}{2}((5\cdot\frac{4}{3}y-4y)^2 + (5\cdot\frac{2}{3}x+4\cdot\frac{4}{3}y)^2) = \frac{1}{2}(0 + 0) = 0$.

Therefore, the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ is 0. The answer is: $0$

Approach:



The given equation $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$ can be simplified as $|x-2y| + |2y-x| = 40$. Since $|a| = |-a|$ for any real number $a$, we can rewrite the equation as $|x-2y| - |2y-x| = 40$.

Now, we know that $|a| - |b| = |a - b|$ if $a \geq b$. So, we can rewrite the equation as $|(x-2y) - (2y-x)| = 40$. Simplifying the left-hand side gives $|2x - 4y| = 40$, which can be further simplified as $2|x - 2y| = 40$. Dividing both sides by 2 gives $|x - 2y| = 20$.

Now, let's substitute $u = x - 2y$ and $v = y - 2x$. Then, we have $|u| = 20$ and $|v| = 40 - |u| = 20$. So, we have $u = \pm 20$ and $v = \pm 20$.

Now, let's substitute $x$ and $y$ in terms of $u$ and $v$: $x = \frac{u + 2v}{3}$ and $y = \frac{2u + v}{3}$.

Now, substitute $x$ and $y$ into the expression $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ to get $5\left(\frac{u + 2v}{3}\right)^2 + 5\left(\frac{2u + v}{3}\right)^2 - 8\left(\frac{u + 2v}{3}\right)\left(\frac{2u + v}{3}\right)$.

Simplify this expression to get $\frac{5u^2 + 20uv + 20v^2}{3} + \frac{20u^2 + 20uv + 5v^2}{3} - \frac{16u^2 + 32uv + 8v^2}{3}$.

Combining like terms gives $\frac{5u^2 + 20uv + 20v^2 + 20u^2 + 20uv + 5v^2 - 16u^2 - 32uv - 8v^2}{3}$.

Simplify this expression to get $\frac{19u^2 - 12uv + 7v^2}{3}$.

Now, we know that $u = \pm 20$ and $v = \pm 20$. Substitute these values into the expression $\frac{19u^2 - 12uv + 7v^2}{3}$ to get $\frac{19(20)^2 - 12(20)(20) + 7(20)^2}{3}$.

Calculate this expression to get $\frac{7600 - 4800 + 2800}{3} = \frac{5600}{3}$.

Therefore, the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ is $\frac{5600}{3}$. However, this is not an integer. Let's check our calculations.

We made a mistake in the simplification of the expression $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$. Let's correct it.

The correct expression is $5\left(\frac{u + 2v}{3}\right)^2 + 5\left(\frac{2u + v}{3}\right)^2 - 8\left(\frac{u + 2v}{3}\right)\left(\frac{2u + v}{3}\right)$.

Simplify this expression to get $\frac{5u^2 + 20uv + 20v^2}{9} + \frac{20u^2 + 20uv + 5v^2}{9} - \frac{16u^2 + 32uv + 8v^2}{9}$.

Combining like terms gives $\frac{5u^2 + 20uv + 20v^2 + 20u^2 + 20uv + 5v^2 - 16u^2 - 32uv - 8v^2}{9}$.

Simplify this expression to get $\frac{19u^2 - 12uv + 7v^2}{9}$.

Now, we know that $u = \pm 20$ and $v = \pm 20$. Substitute these values into the expression $\frac{19u^2 - 12uv + 7v^2}{9}$ to get $\frac{19(20)^2 - 12(20)(20) + 7(20)^2}{9}$.

Calculate this expression to get $\frac{7600 - 4800 + 2800}{9} = \frac{5600}{9}$.

Now, this is an integer. So, the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ is $\frac{5600}{9}$.

However, this is not an integer either. Let's check our calculations again.

We made another mistake in the simplification of the expression $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$. Let's correct it again.

The correct expression is $5\left(\frac{u + 2v}{3}\right)^2 + 5\left(\frac{2u + v}{3}\right)^2 - 8\left(\frac{u + 2v}{3}\right)\left(\frac{2u + v}{3}\right)$.

Simplify this expression to get $\frac{5(u^2 + 4uv + 4v^2)}{9} + \frac{5(4u^2 + 4uv + v^2)}{9} - \frac{8(u^2 + 3uv + 2v^2)}{9}$.

Combining like terms gives $\frac{5u^2 + 20uv + 20v^2 + 20u^2 + 20uv + 5v^2 - 8u^2 - 24uv - 16v^2}{9}$.

Simplify this expression to get $\frac{17u^2 - 4uv + 9v^2}{9}$.

Now, we know that $u = \pm 20$ and $v = \pm 20$. Substitute these values into the expression $\frac{17u^2 - 4uv + 9v^2}{9}$ to get $\frac{17(20)^2 - 4(20)(20) + 9(20)^2}{9}$.

Solve the following problem with a Python Script (positive numerical answer):
"What is the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ when $x$ and $y$ range over all real numbers such that $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$?"
Write comments to indicate the steps you take. Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Assistant:

Approach:


We can rewrite the given equation as $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$ as $|x-2y| = |2x-y|$.
Now, we know that $|a| = |b|$ implies $a^2 = b^2$ or $(a-b)(a+b) = 0$.
So, we have $(x-2y - (2x-y))(x-2y + (2x-y)) = 0$ or $(x-3y)(3x-3y) = 0$.
This gives us $x-3y = 0$ or $3x-3y = 0$.
Both these equations simplify to $x=3y$ and $x=y$ respectively.
We can substitute $x=3y$ into the expression $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ to get $5(3y)^2 + 5y^2 - 8(3y)(y) = 5*9y^2 + 5y^2 - 24y^2 = 20y^2$.
Similarly, we can substitute $x=y$ into the expression $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ to get $5y^2 + 5y^2 - 8y^2 = 2y^2$.
Now, we need to find the minimum value of $20y^2$ and $2y^2$.
Since $y$ can be any real number, the minimum value of $20y^2$ is 0 when $y=0$, and the minimum value of $2y^2$ is also 0 when $y=0$.
Therefore, the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ is 0.
The answer is: $0$
