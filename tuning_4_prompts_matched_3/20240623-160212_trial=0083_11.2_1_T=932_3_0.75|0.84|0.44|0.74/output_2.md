Solve the following problem with a Python Script (positive numerical answer):
"For how many positive integers $m$ does the equation \[\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}\] have $4$ distinct solutions?"
Write comments to indicate the steps you take. Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Approach:



The equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has $4$ distinct solutions means that the right side of the equation is a number between $1$ and $2$. This is because the left side of the equation, $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert$, can only take on values between $1$ and $2$.

So we have $1 \leq \frac{m}{100} < 2$.

Multiplying through by $100$ gives $100 \leq m < 200$.

The positive integers $m$ that satisfy this inequality are $101, 102, \ldots, 199$.

There are $199 - 101 + 1 = 99$ such integers.

Therefore, there are $99$ positive integers $m$ for which the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has $4$ distinct solutions. The answer is: $99$

Approach:


We know that the equation $| |x-1|-2|=\frac{m}{100}$ has four distinct solutions. 
This equation is equivalent to two cases:
Case 1: $|x-1|-2=\frac{m}{100}$
Case 2: $-(|x-1|-2)=\frac{m}{100}$, which simplifies to $|x-1|+2=\frac{m}{100}$.

For Case 1, we have $|x-1|=2+\frac{m}{100}$. This gives us two sub-cases:
Sub-case 1.1: $x-1=2+\frac{m}{100}$, which simplifies to $x=3+\frac{m}{100}$.
Sub-case 1.2: $x-1=-(2+\frac{m}{100})$, which simplifies to $x=-1-\frac{m}{100}$.

For Case 2, we have $|x-1|=2-\frac{m}{100}$. This gives us two sub-cases:
Sub-case 2.1: $x-1=2-\frac{m}{100}$, which simplifies to $x=3-\frac{m}{100}$.
Sub-case 2.2: $x-1=-(2-\frac{m}{100})$, which simplifies to $x=-1+\frac{m}{100}$.

For the four distinct solutions to exist, the expressions inside the absolute value in each sub-case must be different. This means that:
- $3+\frac{m}{100} \neq -1-\frac{m}{100}$, which simplifies to $m \neq -700$.
- $3+\frac{m}{100} \neq 3-\frac{m}{100}$, which simplifies to $m = 0$. But $m$ must be a positive integer, so $m=0$ is not a valid solution.
- $3+\frac{m}{100} \neq -1+\frac{m}{100}$, which simplifies to $m \neq 400$.
- $-1-\frac{m}{100} \neq -1+\frac{m}{100}$, which simplifies to $m \neq 0$. But we already ruled out $m=0$.
- $-1-\frac{m}{100} \neq 3-\frac{m}{100}$, which simplifies to $m \neq 400$.

Therefore, the only valid value for $m$ is $m=700$. So there is only one positive integer $m$ for which the equation $| |x-1|-2|=\frac{m}{100}$ has four distinct solutions. The answer is: $\boxed{1}$

Approach:


The equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has $4$ distinct solutions means that the expression inside the absolute value, $\vert x-1 \vert -2$, takes on the values $\frac{m}{100}$, $-\frac{m}{100}$, $\frac{m}{100} + 2$, and $-\frac{m}{100} + 2$ exactly once. This is because the absolute value function has the property that $|a|=b$ has two solutions if $b>0$, one solution if $b=0$, and no solutions if $b<0$.

So we need to find the number of positive integers $m$ such that the following four equations have integer solutions:
1. $\vert x-1 \vert -2 = \frac{m}{100}$
2. $\vert x-1 \vert -2 = -\frac{m}{100}$
3. $\vert x-1 \vert -2 = \frac{m}{100} + 2$
4. $\vert x-1 \vert -2 = -\frac{m}{100} + 2$

Simplify each equation:
1. $\vert x-1 \vert = \frac{m}{100} + 2$
2. $\vert x-1 \vert = 2 - \frac{m}{100}$
3. $\vert x-1 \vert = \frac{m}{100} + 4$
4. $\vert x-1 \vert = 4 - \frac{m}{100}$

For each equation, we need to find the number of positive integers $m$ such that the right-hand side is non-negative. This is equivalent to finding the number of positive integers $m$ such that:
1. $\frac{m}{100} + 2 \geq 0$, which simplifies to $m \geq -200$. But $m$ must be positive, so this inequality is always true.
2. $2 - \frac{m}{100} \geq 0$, which simplifies to $m \leq 200$. This is true for $0 < m \leq 200$.
3. $\frac{m}{100} + 4 \geq 0$, which simplifies to $m \geq -400$. But $m$ must be positive, so this inequality is always true.
4. $4 - \frac{m}{100} \geq 0$, which simplifies to $m \leq 400$. This is true for $0 < m \leq 400$.

The intersection of these intervals is $0 < m \leq 200$. So the number of positive integers $m$ that satisfy the original equation with 4 distinct solutions is the number of integers in the interval $(0, 200]$. This is 200. The answer is: $\boxed{200}$

Approach:



The equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has $4$ distinct solutions means that the right-hand side $\frac{m}{100}$ must be equal to $1$ or $3$.

If $\frac{m}{100}=1$, then $m=100$.
If $\frac{m}{100}=3$, then $m=300$.

So the possible values for $m$ are $100$ and $300$.

Therefore, there are $2$ positive integers $m$ for which the equation has $4$ distinct solutions.

The answer is: $2$

Approach:


The equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has 4 distinct solutions if and only if $\frac{m}{100}$ is strictly between 1 and 2. This is because the expression on the left side of the equation, $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert$, can take on any value from 0 to 3, and if $\frac{m}{100}$ is less than 1 or greater than 2, the equation will have either 2 or 0 solutions respectively. If $\frac{m}{100}$ is equal to 1 or 2, the equation will have 3 or 1 solutions respectively.

So we need to find the number of positive integers $m$ such that $1 < \frac{m}{100} < 2$. Multiplying all sides of the inequalities by 100 gives $100 < m < 200$. The number of positive integers in this range is $200 - 100 - 1 = 99$.

Therefore, there are 99 positive integers $m$ for which the equation has 4 distinct solutions.
The answer is: $99$

Approach:


The equation $| |x - 1| - 2| = \frac{m}{100}$ has 4 distinct solutions if and only if $\frac{m}{100} = 2$. This is because the expression $| |x - 1| - 2|$ can take on three values: 2, 0, and values between 0 and 2. If $\frac{m}{100} = 2$, then the equation has 4 distinct solutions.

Solution:
To find the value of $m$ that satisfies the equation $\frac{m}{100} = 2$, we can multiply both sides by 100 to get $m = 200$.

Therefore, the value of $m$ that makes the equation $| |x - 1| - 2| = \frac{m}{100}$ have 4 distinct solutions is $m = 200$.
The answer is: $1$

Approach:


The equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has $4$ distinct solutions, we need to find the number of positive integers $m$ such that the equation has $4$ solutions.

First, let's understand the behavior of the function $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert$.

The function $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert$ is a "V" shape with the vertex at $x=1$. The value of the function is $0$ at $x=1$, decreasing to $-2$ as $x$ decreases to $0$, and increasing to $2$ as $x$ increases to $2$. Then the value of the function is $2$ for $x>2$, decreasing to $0$ as $x$ increases to $3$, and increasing to $2$ as $x$ increases to $4$. The function repeats this pattern for $x$ in the intervals $(4n, 4n+1)$, $(4n+1, 4n+2)$, $(4n+2, 4n+3)$, $(4n+3, 4n+4)$, where $n$ is an integer.

Now, we want the right side of the equation, $\frac{m}{100}$, to "fit" into this "V" shape in such a way that it intersects the function at $4$ distinct points. This means that $\frac{m}{100}$ must be between $0$ and $2$, and should not be equal to $0$, $1$, or $2$. This gives us the inequality $0 < \frac{m}{100} < 2$, or $0 < m < 200$.

However, we also need to exclude the cases where $\frac{m}{100}$ equals $1$. This happens when $m=100$. So we have the inequality $0 < m < 200$, but $m \neq 100$.

The positive integers $m$ that satisfy these conditions are the integers from $1$ to $199$, excluding $100$. There are $199 - 1 - 99 = 99$ such integers.

Therefore, there are $99$ positive integers $m$ such that the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has $4$ distinct solutions.
The answer is: $99$

Approach:



The equation $| |x-1|-2|=\frac{m}{100}$ has 4 distinct solutions if and only if $\frac{m}{100}$ is between $0$ and $2$. This is because $| |x-1|-2|$ is a function that oscillates between $0$ and $2$, and $\frac{m}{100}$ must fall into this range for the equation to have 4 distinct solutions.

So, $0 < \frac{m}{100} < 2$. This can be rewritten as $0 < m < 200$.

The positive integers $m$ that satisfy this inequality are the integers from $1$ to $199$.

Counting these integers, we find that there are $199$ positive integers $m$ for which the equation has $4$ distinct solutions.
The answer is: $199$.

Approach:



The equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has 4 distinct solutions if and only if $\frac{m}{100}$ is strictly between 1 and 2. This is because the function $f(x) = \vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert$ has a graph that is a series of V's, with the "bottom" of each V occurring at integer values. So for the equation to have 4 distinct solutions, the right side of the equation, $\frac{m}{100}$, must be strictly between 1 and 2.

This gives us the inequality $1 < \frac{m}{100} < 2$. Multiplying all sides of the inequality by 100 gives $100 < m < 200$. The positive integers that satisfy this inequality are the integers from 101 to 199, inclusive. To find the number of these integers, we subtract the smallest integer from the largest and add 1 (since both endpoints are included). So the number of such integers is $199 - 101 + 1 = 99$.
The answer is: $99$
