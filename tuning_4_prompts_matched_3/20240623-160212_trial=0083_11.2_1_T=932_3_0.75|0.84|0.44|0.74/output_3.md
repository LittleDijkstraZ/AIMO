Solve the following problem with a Python Script (positive numerical answer):
"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"

Approach:



The equation $A \cdot B = 0$ is true if and only if either $A = 0$ or $B = 0$. So, the given equation is equivalent to either $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$.

If $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$, then $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. This implies that $x + y = \pm 10$ and $x - y = \pm 10$. Solving these equations, we get the vertices of the polygon as $(0, 10), (0, -10), (10, 0), (-10, 0)$.

If $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$, then $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$. This implies that $x = \pm 8$ and $y = \pm 8$. So, we get the vertices $(8, 8), (8, -8), (-8, 8), (-8, -8)$.

Now, we plot these points on a graph and connect them to form a square with side length $16$. The area of the square is $16^2 = 256$.

So, the area of the convex polygon is $256$. The answer is: $256$

Approach:

 The given equation is of the form $AB=0$, which implies that either $A=0$ or $B=0$. So we can break the problem into two cases:

1. $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$
2. $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$

For the first case, we have $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ and $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$, which implies $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. This forms a square with side length 10, and its area is $10^2 = 100$.

For the second case, we have $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ and $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$, which implies $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$. This forms a square with side length 8, and its area is $8^2 = 64$.

The area of the convex polygon is the sum of the areas of the two squares, which is $100 + 64 = 164$. The answer is: $164$

Assistant:

Approach:

 The equation $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + (\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ implies that $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. This means that the points $(x, y)$ lie on the lines $x + y = 10$ and $x - y = 10$ or their opposites. Similarly, the equation $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + (\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ implies that $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$, which means the points $(x, y)$ lie on the lines $x = 8$ and $y = 8$ or their opposites.

These lines form a square with side length 10 (since the distance between the lines $x + y = 10$ and $x - y = 10$ is 10). Therefore, the area of the square is $10^2 = 100$. The answer is: $100$

Approach:



The given equation is a product of two expressions equal to zero, which means that either the first expression is zero or the second expression is zero. Let's analyze each case separately.

Case 1: $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$

This equation implies that $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. The only way this can happen is if $x = y = 5$ or $x = -y = -5$. This gives us two points: $(5, 5)$ and $(-5, 5)$.

Case 2: $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$

This equation implies that $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$. The only way this can happen is if $x = 8$ or $x = -8$, and $y = 8$ or $y = -8$. This gives us four points: $(8, 8)$, $(8, -8)$, $(-8, 8)$, and $(-8, -8)$.

Now, let's plot these points on a coordinate plane. They form a square with side length $10$. To find the area of this square, we use the formula for the area of a square, which is the side length squared. So the area of the square is $10^2 = 100$.

Therefore, the area of the convex polygon is $100$.

The answer is: $100$

Approach:



The equation $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + (\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ implies that $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. These two equations represent two squares each with side length 10. The intersection of these two squares forms a square with side length 10.

Similarly, the equation $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + (\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ implies that $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$. These two equations represent two circles each with radius 8. The intersection of these two circles forms a square with side length 16 (since the square is inscribed in the circle).

Therefore, the area of the convex polygon is the area of the square formed by the intersection of the two squares, which is $10^2 = 100$. The answer is: $100$

Solve the following problem with a Python Script (positive numerical answer):
"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"

Approach:


The equation $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ is satisfied only when either of the two factors is zero. This gives us two sets of equations to solve:

1. $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ and $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$.
2. $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ and $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$.

For each set of equations, we solve the absolute value equations to get the coordinates of the vertices of the polygon. Then we can calculate the area of the polygon.

Here is a Python code to calculate the area:
```python


INTERMEDIATE OUT :

from sympy import symbols, Abs, solve, simplify

def calculate_area():
    x, y = symbols('x y')

    # Solve the equations for the first set
    solutions1 = solve([Abs(x + y) - 10, Abs(x) - 8], (x, y))

    # Solve the equations for the second set
    solutions2 = solve([Abs(x - y) - 10, Abs(y) - 8], (x, y))

    # Combine all solutions
    solutions = solutions1 + solutions2

    # Calculate the area of the polygon
    area = 0
    for i in range(len(solutions)):
        for j in range(i + 1, len(solutions)):
            area += abs(solutions[i][0] * solutions[j][1] - solutions[j][0] * solutions[i][1]) / 2

    return simplify(area)

result = calculate_area()
print(result)
```

CODE RESULTS 1664

INTERMEDIATE OUT :
```output
1664
```
The area of the convex polygon is $1664$ square units. The answer is: $1664$

Solve the following problem with a Python Script (positive numerical answer):
"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"

Approach:


The given equation is of the form $f(x,y) \cdot g(x,y) = 0$. This means that either $f(x,y) = 0$ or $g(x,y) = 0$. 

Let's solve each equation separately:

1. For $f(x,y) = ((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2) = 0$, we have $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. This implies that $x + y = \pm 10$ and $x - y = \pm 10$. Solving these equations gives us the vertices of the polygon as $(0, 10), (0, -10), (10, 0), (-10, 0)$.

2. For $g(x,y) = ((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$, we have $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$. This implies that $x = \pm 8$ and $y = \pm 8$. Solving these equations gives us the vertices of the polygon as $(8, 0), (-8, 0), (0, 8), (0, -8)$.

Combining the solutions from both equations, we find that the vertices of the polygon are $(0, 10), (0, -10), (10, 0), (-10, 0), (8, 0), (-8, 0), (0, 8), (0, -8)$.

The polygon is a square with side length 10 (from the vertices $(0, 10), (0, -10), (10, 0), (-10, 0)$).

The area of a square is given by side length squared. So the area of this square is $10^2 = 100$.

So the area of the convex polygon is 100.
The answer is: $100$
