 The problem asks for how many positive integers $m$ the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has $4$ distinct solutions.

This equation is a type of absolute value equation, and its solutions depend on the value of $\frac{m}{100}$. The number of solutions depends on the shape of the graph of the equation.

For $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ to have $4$ distinct solutions, the value of $\frac{m}{100}$ must be such that the graph of the equation consists of two "hills" that intersect the x-axis at four distinct points.

This occurs when $\frac{m}{100}$ is equal to the height of the "hills", which is $2$. Therefore, $m = 200$.

So, there is only one positive integer $m$ for which the equation has $4$ distinct solutions, and that is $m = 200$.
The answer is: $1$

Assistant:

 The equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has four distinct solutions if and only if $\frac{m}{100} = 2$.
This is because the function $f(x) = \vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert$ has a graph with a shape of a "hump" with the maximum value of 2.
So we solve the equation $\frac{m}{100} = 2$ to find the value of $m$.

```python


INTERMEDIATE OUT :

from sympy import symbols, Eq, solve

def find_m():
    m = symbols('m')
    equation = Eq(m / 100, 2)
    solution = solve(equation, m)
    return solution[0]

m = find_m()
print(m)
```

CODE RESULTS 200

INTERMEDIATE OUT :
```output
200
```
The value of $m$ is $200$. Therefore, there is only $1$ positive integer $m$ for which the equation has $4$ distinct solutions. The answer is: $1$

 The problem is asking for how many positive integers $m$ the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has $4$ distinct solutions.

The equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ can have $4$ distinct solutions only when $\frac{m}{100}=1$. This is because the function $f(x) = \vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert$ has a shape of a "V" with each "wing" having a width of $1$ unit. Therefore, for the function to cross the x-axis $4$ times, the "height" of the "V" must be $1$.

Solving the equation $\frac{m}{100}=1$ for $m$ gives $m=100$. So, there is only $1$ positive integer $m$ for which the equation has $4$ distinct solutions. The answer is: $1$

Below is a math problem you are to solve (positive numerical answer!):
"For how many positive integers $m$ does the equation \[\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}\] have $4$ distinct solutions?"

Assistant:

 The problem asks for the number of positive integers $m$ such that the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has exactly 4 distinct solutions.

This equation is a type of absolute value equation, and its solutions depend on the value of $m$. The number of solutions will change as $m$ varies.

We can solve this problem by analyzing the possible values of $m$. The value of $\frac{m}{100}$ must be between 0 and 2 for the equation to have 4 distinct solutions. This is because the expression inside the absolute value, $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert$, can vary between -2 and 2, and $\frac{m}{100}$ must cover this entire range.

So, $0 \leq \frac{m}{100} \leq 2$, which gives $0 \leq m \leq 200$. The positive integers $m$ in this range are the numbers from 1 to 200.

However, we need to find out how many of these values of $m$ actually result in 4 distinct solutions. This can be done by testing each value of $m$ in the equation and counting the number of distinct solutions.

It turns out that for $m=100$, the equation has exactly 4 distinct solutions. For all other values of $m$ in the range 1 to 99 and 101 to 200, the equation has either 2 or 0 distinct solutions.

Therefore, the number of positive integers $m$ that result in 4 distinct solutions is 1. The answer is: $1$
