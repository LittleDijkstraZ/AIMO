Below is a math problem you are to solve (positive numerical answer!):
"What is the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ when $x$ and $y$ range over all real numbers such that $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$?"

 To solve this problem, we can use the inequality $|a| + |b| \geq |a+b|$ for all real numbers $a$ and $b$.
Applying this inequality to the given equation $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$, we get:
\[|x-2y| + |y-2x| \geq |(x-2y) + (y-2x)| = |-x-y| = |-(x+y)| = |x+y|.\]
So we have $|x+y| = 40$.
Now let's express the given expression $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ in terms of $(x+y)$ and $(x-y)$:
\begin{align*}
5x^2+5y^2-8xy &= 5(x^2+y^2) - 8xy \\
&= 5[(x+y)^2 - 2xy] - 8xy \\
&= 5[(x+y)^2 - 2xy] - 8xy \\
&= 5(x+y)^2 - 18xy.
\end{align*}
We know that $|x+y| = 40$, so $(x+y)^2 = 1600$.
Now we need to find the minimum value of $-18xy$ given that $(x+y)^2 = 1600$.
By AM-GM inequality, we have:
\[-18xy \geq -2\sqrt{(18^2)(x^2y^2)} = -2\sqrt{(18^2)(\frac{(x+y)^2}{4})} = -2\sqrt{(18^2)(400)} = -2\cdot18\cdot20 = -720.\]
Equality occurs when $x=y$, so the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ is $5(1600) - 720 = 8000 - 720 = 7280$.
The answer is: $7280$.

 This problem requires the use of mathematical techniques such as completing the square and absolute value inequalities to solve it. However, as a language model AI, I am unable to directly perform these mathematical operations. Instead, I can guide you through the steps to solve the problem.

1. First, let's rewrite the given equation $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$ as $|2x-y| + |2y-x| = 40$.

2. Now, let's consider the expression $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$. We can rewrite this as $5(x^2-y^2)-4xy = 5(x-y)^2 - 4xy$.

3. Next, let's complete the square for the expression $-4xy$. We can rewrite $-4xy$ as $-4(x-y)(x+y)/2 = -2(x-y)(x+y)$.

4. Now, let's substitute $u = x-y$ and $v = x+y$. Then, the expression becomes $5u^2 - 2uv = 5u^2 - 2u(u+2y)$.

5. Now, let's minimize this expression under the constraint $|2u+v| = 40$.

6. By the triangle inequality, $|2u+v| \geq ||2u| - |v||$. Thus, $|2u| - |v| \leq 40$. Since $v = x+y$, we have $|2u| - |x+y| \leq 40$.

7. By the triangle inequality again, $|x+y| \leq |x| + |y|$. Thus, $|2u| - |x| - |y| \leq 40$.

8. Now, let's substitute back $u = x-y$. We have $|2(x-y)| - |x| - |y| \leq 40$. This inequality gives us a constraint on the values of $x$ and $y$.

9. Now, we can use the method of Lagrange multipliers to minimize the expression $5u^2 - 2uv$ under the constraint $|2u+v| = 40$.

10. By solving the system of equations, we find that the minimum value of the expression $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ is achieved when $x = y = 10$.

11. Substituting these values back into the expression, we find that the minimum value is $5(10)^2 + 5(10)^2 - 8(10)(10) = 1000 - 800 = 200$.

Therefore, the minimum value of the expression $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ is 200. The answer is: $200$

This problem involves the use of the Cauchy-Schwarz inequality and the AM-GM inequality.

The given expression is $5x^2+5y^2-8xy = (x^2 - 2xy + y^2) + 4(x^2 - 2xy + y^2) = (x-y)^2 + 4(x-y)^2 = 5(x-y)^2$.

The condition $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$ can be rewritten as $|x-2y| + |2x-y| = 40$. By the triangle inequality, $|x-2y| + |2x-y| \geq |x-2y + 2x-y| = |3x-3y| = 3|x-y|$. Therefore, $3|x-y| = 40$, or $|x-y| = \frac{40}{3}$.

Now, we apply the Cauchy-Schwarz inequality: $(1^2 + 1^2)(x^2 + y^2) \geq (x+y)^2$, which simplifies to $2(x^2 + y^2) \geq (x+y)^2$.

By the AM-GM inequality, $(x+y)^2 \geq 4xy$. Therefore, $2(x^2 + y^2) \geq 4xy$, or $x^2 + y^2 \geq 2xy$.

Substituting $x^2 + y^2 = (x-y)^2 + 2xy$ into the inequality above, we get $(x-y)^2 + 2xy \geq 2xy$, or $(x-y)^2 \geq 0$. This inequality is always true, so the equality condition must hold.

Therefore, the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ is achieved when $x-y = \frac{40}{3}$, and this minimum value is $5(x-y)^2 = 5\left(\frac{40}{3}\right)^2 = \frac{8000}{9}$.

So, the minimum value of the given expression is $\frac{8000}{9}$.

The answer is: $\frac{8000}{9}$

 To solve this problem, we can use the inequality $|a| + |b| \geq |a + b|$ for all real numbers $a$ and $b$. Applying this inequality to the given equation $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$, we get:

\[|x-2y| + |y-2x| \geq |(x-2y) + (y-2x)| = |-x - y| = |-(x+y)| = |x+y|.\]

So, we have $|x+y| = 40$. Now, let's rewrite the given expression $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ as:

\[5x^2+5y^2-8xy = \frac{1}{2}((5x^2-8xy+8y^2) + (5y^2-8xy+8x^2)) = \frac{1}{2}((5(x-y)^2 + 8(x^2+y^2))).\]

By AM-GM inequality, we have:

\[\frac{1}{2}((5(x-y)^2 + 8(x^2+y^2))) \geq \frac{1}{2}(2\sqrt{5(x-y)^2 \cdot 8(x^2+y^2)}) = \sqrt{40(x^2-2xy+y^2)(x^2+2xy+y^2)} = \sqrt{40(x^2+y^2)^2} = \sqrt{40(x+y)^2 + 80(x^2+y^2)}.\]

Since $|x+y| = 40$, we have $(x+y)^2 = 1600$. Substituting this into the above inequality, we get:

\[\sqrt{40(x+y)^2 + 80(x^2+y^2)} = \sqrt{40 \cdot 1600 + 80(x^2+y^2)} = \sqrt{64000 + 80(x^2+y^2)}.\]

Now, we need to minimize the expression $\sqrt{64000 + 80(x^2+y^2)}$. By the Cauchy-Schwarz inequality, we have:

\[(1^2 + 1^2)(x^2+y^2) \geq (x+y)^2,\]

which simplifies to $2(x^2+y^2) \geq 1600$, or $x^2+y^2 \geq 800$. Substituting this into the expression $\sqrt{64000 + 80(x^2+y^2)}$, we get:

\[\sqrt{64000 + 80(x^2+y^2)} \geq \sqrt{64000 + 80 \cdot 800} = \sqrt{64000 + 64000} = \sqrt{128000} = 40\sqrt{80} = 40 \cdot 4\sqrt{5} = 160\sqrt{5}.\]

Therefore, the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ is $160\sqrt{5}$. The answer is: $160\sqrt{5}$

 To solve this problem, we can use the method of Lagrange multipliers. First, we define a new function $F(x, y, \lambda) = 5x^2 + 5y^2 - 8xy + \lambda(|x - 2y| + |y - 2x - 40)$.

Then, we need to find the partial derivatives of $F$ with respect to $x$, $y$, and $\lambda$, and set them equal to zero:

$\frac{\partial F}{\partial x} = 10x - 8y + \lambda(-1 + 2\delta_1) = 0$,
$\frac{\partial F}{\partial y} = 10y - 8x + \lambda(2 - 1 + 2\delta_2) = 0$,
$\frac{\partial F}{\partial \lambda} = |x - 2y| + |y - 2x| - 40 = 0$,

where $\delta_1 = \frac{x - 2y}{|x - 2y|}$ and $\delta_2 = \frac{y - 2x}{|y - 2x|}$ are the signs of $x - 2y$ and $y - 2x$ respectively.

Solving these equations simultaneously is quite difficult. However, we can make some observations to simplify the problem. Notice that the function $f(x, y) = 5x^2 + 5y^2 - 8xy$ is symmetric with respect to the line $x = y$. This means that if $(x_0, y_0)$ is a minimum point, then so is $(y_0, x_0)$. Therefore, without loss of generality, we can assume that $x \geq y$.

Now, consider the constraint equation $|x - 2y| + |y - 2x| = 40$. Since $x \geq y$, we have $x - 2y \geq 0$ and $y - 2x \leq 0$, so the constraint equation simplifies to $x - 2y + 2x - y = 40$, or $3x - 3y = 40$. Thus, $x - y = \frac{40}{3}$.

Substituting this into the equation $x = y + \frac{40}{3}$, we can solve for $x$ and $y$:

$x = y + \frac{40}{3}$,
$y = x - \frac{40}{3}$.

Substituting these into the function $f(x, y)$, we get:

$f(x, y) = 5x^2 + 5\left(x - \frac{40}{3}\right)^2 - 8x\left(x - \frac{40}{3}\right)$.

Simplify this expression and find the minimum value by taking the derivative with respect to $x$ and setting it equal to zero. After that, we can find the corresponding $y$ value using $y = x - \frac{40}{3}$. Finally, substitute these values back into the function $f(x, y)$ to find the minimum value.

After performing these calculations, we find that the minimum value of $f(x, y)$ is $-400$, when $x = \frac{40}{3}$ and $y = \frac{40}{3} - \frac{40}{3} = 0$. Therefore, the minimum value of the function $5x^2 + 5y^2 - 8xy$ subject to the constraint $|x - 2y| + |y - 2x| = 40$ is $-400$.
The answer is: $-400$

 To solve this problem, we can use the method of completing the square. First, we rewrite the expression $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ as $5(x^2 - \frac{8}{5}xy + y^2) = 5[(x - \frac{4}{5}y)^2 + \frac{9}{5}y^2]$.

Now, let's analyze the constraint $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$. By the triangle inequality, $|x-2y| + |y-2x| \geq |(x-2y) - (y-2x)| = |x-2y - y + 2x| = |x - 3y + 2x| = |3x - 3y| = 3|x-y|$. So, we have $3|x-y| = 40$, which implies $|x-y| = \frac{40}{3}$.

Now, let's consider the expression $(x - \frac{4}{5}y)^2 + \frac{9}{5}y^2$. Since $|x-y| = \frac{40}{3}$, we can rewrite it as $(x - \frac{4}{5}y)^2 + \frac{9}{5}(y^2 - \frac{16}{9}(x-y)^2)$. By the Cauchy-Schwarz inequality, we have $(x - \frac{4}{5}y)^2 + \frac{9}{5}(y^2 - \frac{16}{9}(x-y)^2) \geq 0$.

Therefore, the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ is achieved when $(x - \frac{4}{5}y)^2 = 0$ and $y^2 - \frac{16}{9}(x-y)^2 = 0$. This happens when $x = \frac{4}{5}y$ and $y^2 = \frac{16}{9}(x-y)^2$. Substituting $x = \frac{4}{5}y$ into the second equation gives $y^2 = \frac{16}{9}(\frac{1}{5}y)^2$, which simplifies to $y^2 = \frac{16}{225}y^2$. This implies $y^2 = 0$, so $y = 0$. Then, $x = \frac{4}{5}y = 0$.

Substituting $x = y = 0$ into the expression $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$, we get $5(0)^2 + 5(0)^2 - 8(0)(0) = 0$.

So, the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ is 0. The answer is: $0$

 To solve this problem, we can use the method of completing the square.

First, let's rewrite the expression $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ as $5(x^2 - \frac{8}{5}xy) + 5(y^2 - \frac{8}{5}yx)$.

Then, we can complete the square for each term:
- For the $x$ term, we add and subtract $(\frac{8}{10}y)^2 = \frac{16}{25}y^2$ inside the parenthesis, so we get $5[(x - \frac{4}{5}y)^2 - \frac{16}{25}y^2]$.
- Similarly, for the $y$ term, we add and subtract $(\frac{8}{10}x)^2 = \frac{16}{25}x^2$ inside the parenthesis, so we get $5[(y - \frac{4}{5}x)^2 - \frac{16}{25}x^2]$.

So, $5x^2+5y^2-8xy = 5[(x - \frac{4}{5}y)^2 - \frac{16}{25}y^2] + 5[(y - \frac{4}{5}x)^2 - \frac{16}{25}x^2] = 5[(x - \frac{4}{5}y)^2 + (y - \frac{4}{5}x)^2 - \frac{32}{25}(x^2 + y^2)]$.

Now, let's consider the constraint $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$. By the triangle inequality, we know that $|x-2y| + |y-2x| \geq |(x-2y) - (y-2x)| = |x-y|$. So, $|x-y| = 40$. This means that $x^2 - 2xy + y^2 = 1600$, or $(x-y)^2 = 1600$.

Since $(x - \frac{4}{5}y)^2 + (y - \frac{4}{5}x)^2 = (x-y)^2 - \frac{8}{5}xy + \frac{8}{5}yx = 1600 - \frac{8}{5}xy + \frac{8}{5}yx = 1600$, we have $5[(x - \frac{4}{5}y)^2 + (y - \frac{4}{5}x)^2 - \frac{32}{25}(x^2 + y^2)] = 5[1600 - \frac{32}{25}(x^2 + y^2)]$.

Now, we want to minimize $5[1600 - \frac{32}{25}(x^2 + y^2)]$, which is equivalent to maximizing $\frac{32}{25}(x^2 + y^2)$. Since $x^2 + y^2 \geq 0$, the maximum value of $\frac{32}{25}(x^2 + y^2)$ is achieved when $x^2 + y^2 = 0$, which implies $x = y = 0$. In this case, $\frac{32}{25}(x^2 + y^2) = 0$.

Therefore, the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ is achieved when $x = y = 0$, and the minimum value is $5[1600 - \frac{32}{25}(0)] = 5*1600 = 8000$.

So, the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ when $x$ and $y$ range over all real numbers such that $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$ is $8000$. The answer is: $8000$.

 This problem requires the use of the Cauchy-Schwarz inequality and some algebraic manipulation.

The given condition is $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$. By the triangle inequality, we have $|x-2y| + |y-2x| \geq |(x-2y) - (y-2x)| = |x-2y - y + 2x| = |x-3y+2x| = |3x-3y| = 3|x-y|$. So, we have $3|x-y| = 40$, which implies $|x-y| = \frac{40}{3}$.

Now, we are given the expression $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$. We can rewrite this as $5(x^2+y^2) - 8xy = 5[(x-y)^2 + 2xy] - 8xy = 5(x-y)^2 + 3xy$.

By the Cauchy-Schwarz inequality, we have $(1+4)(x-y)^2 \geq (x-y)^2 + 4xy^2$, which implies $5(x-y)^2 \geq (x-y)^2 + 4xy^2$.

Substituting $|x-y| = \frac{40}{3}$, we get $5\left(\frac{40}{3}\right)^2 \geq (x-y)^2 + 4xy^2$, which simplifies to $\frac{8000}{9} \geq (x-y)^2 + 4xy^2$.

Now, we want to minimize $5(x-y)^2 + 3xy = \frac{8000}{9} + 3xy$. By the Cauchy-Schwarz inequality, we have $(1+4)(x^2+y^2) \geq (x+2y)^2$, which implies $5(x^2+y^2) \geq (x+2y)^2$.

Substituting $|x-2y| = \frac{40}{3}$, we get $5(x^2+y^2) \geq \left(\sqrt{x^2 + 4y^2}\right)^2$, which simplifies to $5(x^2+y^2) \geq x^2 + 4y^2$.

Combining the inequalities, we have $\frac{8000}{9} + 3xy \geq \frac{8000}{9} + 3\cdot \frac{-200}{3} = \frac{8000}{9} - 200 = \frac{7600}{9}$.

Therefore, the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ is $\frac{7600}{9}$. The answer is: $\frac{7600}{9}$

 The given condition $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$ is equivalent to $|x-2y| = |2x-y|$, which means $x-2y = 2x-y$ or $x-2y = -(2x-y)$.
Solving the first equation $x-2y = 2x-y$ gives $y = x$, and substituting this into the second equation $|x-2x| = |2x-x|$ gives $|x| = |x|$, which is true for all $x$.
Solving the second equation $x-2y = -(2x-y)$ gives $x = 2y$, and substituting this into the second equation $|2y-2(2y)| = |4y-y|$ gives $|-2y| = |3y|$, which implies $y = 0$ and $x = 0$.
Therefore, the only solution to the given condition is $x = 0$ and $y = 0$.
Substituting these values into the expression $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ gives $5(0)^2 + 5(0)^2 - 8(0)(0) = 0$.
So the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ is 0. The answer is: $0$

 To solve this problem, we can use the method of completing the square and the properties of absolute value.
First, let's rewrite the given equation $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$ as $|2y-x| + |2x-y| = 40$.
By the triangle inequality, we know that $|a| + |b| \geq |a+b|$, so $|2y-x| + |2x-y| \geq |(2y-x) + (2x-y)| = |y| = |2y/2| = |2y-0|$.
Therefore, we have $|2y-x| + |2x-y| \geq |y|$ and $|y| = 40/2 = 20$.
This implies that $|y| = 20$, so $y = \pm 20$.
Now let's substitute $y = 20$ into the equation $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$, we get $|x-40| + |20-2x| = 40$.
By the triangle inequality again, we know that $|a| + |b| \geq |a-b|$, so $|x-40| + |20-2x| \geq |(x-40) - (20-2x)| = |x-60|$.
Therefore, we have $|x-40| + |20-2x| \geq |x-60|$ and $|x-60| = 40$.
This implies that $|x-60| = 40$, so $x = 60 \pm 40 = 20$ or $x = 100$.
Similarly, if we substitute $y = -20$ into the equation $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$, we get $|x+40| + |-20-2x| = 40$.
Again by the triangle inequality, we know that $|a| + |b| \geq |a-b|$, so $|x+40| + |-20-2x| \geq |(x+40) - (-20-2x)| = |x+60|$.
Therefore, we have $|x+40| + |-20-2x| \geq |x+60|$ and $|x+60| = 40$.
This implies that $|x+60| = 40$, so $x = -60 \pm 40 = -20$ or $x = -100$.
Now let's substitute $x = 20$ and $y = 20$ into the expression $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$, we get $5(20)^2 + 5(20)^2 - 8(20)(20) = 2000$.
Similarly, if we substitute $x = 100$ and $y = 20$ into the expression $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$, we get $5(100)^2 + 5(20)^2 - 8(100)(20) = 5000$.
And if we substitute $x = -20$ and $y = 20$ into the expression $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$, we get $5(-20)^2 + 5(20)^2 - 8(-20)(20) = 2000$.
And if we substitute $x = -100$ and $y = 20$ into the expression $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$, we get $5(-100)^2 + 5(20)^2 - 8(-100)(20) = 5000$.
Therefore, the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ when $x$ and $y$ range over all real numbers such that $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$ is 2000. The answer is: $2000$
