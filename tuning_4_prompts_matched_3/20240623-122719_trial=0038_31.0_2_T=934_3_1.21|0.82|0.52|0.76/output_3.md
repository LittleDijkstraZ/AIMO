The equation given is $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$. For the product of two numbers to be zero, either one of them must be zero. Therefore, we have two cases:

1. $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$. This implies that both $\vert x + y \vert - 10 = 0$ and $\vert x - y \vert - 10 = 0$, which gives us $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. The absolute value equations can be split into two separate equations: $x + y = 10$ or $x + y = -10$ and $x - y = 10$ or $x - y = -10$. Solving these systems of equations, we get the vertices of the polygon as $(0,10)$, $(10,0)$, $(0,-10)$, and $(-10,0)$.

2. $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$. This implies that both $\vert x \vert - 8 = 0$ and $\vert y \vert - 8 = 0$, which gives us $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$. This gives us the vertices of the polygon as $(8,8)$, $(8,-8)$, $(-8,8)$, and $(-8,-8)$.

Now we have all the vertices of the polygon: $(0,10)$, $(10,0)$, $(0,-10)$, $(-10,0)$, $(8,8)$, $(8,-8)$, $(-8,8)$, and $(-8,-8)$. To find the area of the polygon, we can divide it into four right triangles each with base and height of 10 units. The area of each triangle is $\frac{1}{2} \times 10 \times 10 = 50$, and since there are four such triangles, the total area is $4 \times 50 = 200$ square units. The answer is: $200$

Solve the following problem with a Python Script (positive numerical answer):
"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"

Approach:

 The equation $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ implies that either of the two factors must be zero for the equation to hold. This means either $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$.

The first factor equals to zero when $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. These are the equations of two lines, $x + y = 10$ and $x - y = 10$, and their reflections across the x and y axes. These lines form a square with side length 10.

The second factor equals to zero when $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$. These are the equations of two lines, $x = 8$ and $y = 8$, and their reflections across the x and y axes. These lines form a square with side length 8.

The area of the convex polygon enclosed by the points that satisfy the equation is the combined area of the two squares, which is $(10^2 + 8^2) = 164$.

So, the area of the convex polygon is $164$. The answer is: $164$

Solve the following problem with a Python Script (positive numerical answer):
"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"

Approach:



The equation is satisfied when either $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$.

These conditions are equivalent to $\vert x + y \vert = 10$, $\vert x - y \vert = 10$, $\vert x \vert = 8$, and $\vert y \vert = 8$.

These equations represent 4 lines in the coordinate plane. The lines $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$ form a square with side length 10, while the lines $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$ form a square with side length 16.

The area of the convex polygon enclosed by these lines is the sum of the areas of the two squares, which is $10^2 + 8^2 = 100 + 64 = 164$. So the area of the convex polygon is 164 square units. The answer is: $164$

Approach:



The given equation is $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + (\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + (\vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$. In order for a product to be zero, one or both of the factors must be zero. So we have two cases to consider:

1) $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + (\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2) = 0$
2) $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + (\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$

For case 1, we have $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$, which gives us the lines $x + y = \pm 10$ and $x - y = \pm 10$.
For case 2, we have $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$, which gives us the lines $x = \pm 8$ and $y = \pm 8$.

The intersection of these lines form a square with side length 16. The area of the square is $16^2 = 256$. The answer is: $256$

Solve the following problem with a Python Script (positive numerical answer):
"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"

Approach:

 The equation implies that either $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$. We can solve these equations to find the points that satisfy the equation. Then, we can plot these points and form the polygon. Finally, we can calculate the area of the polygon.

Step 1: Solving the equations
- If $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$, then $\vert x + y \vert = 10$, which gives us $x + y = 10$ or $x + y = -10$.
- If $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$, then $\vert x - y \vert = 10$, which gives us $x - y = 10$ or $x - y = -10$.
- If $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$, then $\vert x \vert = 8$, which gives us $x = 8$ or $x = -8$.
- If $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$, then $\vert y \vert = 8$, which gives us $y = 8$ or $y = -8$.

Step 2: Plotting the points and forming the polygon
By solving the above equations, we find that the points that satisfy the equation are:
- $(8, 2)$, $(8, -2)$, $(-8, 2)$, $(-8, -2)$, $(2, 8)$, $(-2, 8)$, $(2, -8)$, $(-2, -8)$.
Plotting these points, we find that they form a square with side length 16.

Step 3: Calculating the area of the polygon
The area of a square with side length $s$ is given by $s^2$. So, the area of this square is $16^2 = 256$.

Therefore, the area of the convex polygon is 256. The answer is: $256$

Approach:


The equation given is a product of two terms being equal to zero. This means that either the first term is zero or the second term is zero. Let's consider each case:
1. $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0 \Rightarrow \vert x + y \vert = 10 \Rightarrow x + y = \pm 10$
2. $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0 \Rightarrow \vert x - y \vert = 10 \Rightarrow x - y = \pm 10$
3. $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0 \Rightarrow \vert x \vert = 8 \Rightarrow x = \pm 8$
4. $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0 \Rightarrow \vert y \vert = 8 \Rightarrow y = \pm 8$
The solutions from 1. and 2. give us the lines $x + y = 10$, $x + y = -10$, $x - y = 10$, and $x - y = -10$. The solutions from 3. and 4. give us the lines $x = 8$ and $x = -8$, $y = 8$ and $y = -8$. These lines enclose a square with side length 10 (from $x + y = \pm 10$ and $x - y = \pm 10$). The area of this square is $10^2 = 100$.
The answer is: $100$

Solve the following problem with a Python Script (positive numerical answer):
"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"

Approach:



The equation $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ is satisfied if either of the two factors is zero. 

Setting the first factor to zero, we get:

$(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$

This is only possible if both $(\vert x + y \vert - 10) = 0$ and $(\vert x - y \vert - 10) = 0$, which implies $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$.

This means $x + y = \pm 10$ and $x - y = \pm 10$, which gives us four lines: $x + y = 10$, $x + y = -10$, $x - y = 10$, and $x - y = -10$. The intersection points of these lines are the vertices of the polygon.

Similarly, setting the second factor to zero, we get:

$(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$

This is only possible if both $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$, which implies $x = \pm 8$ and $y = \pm 8$. This gives us four more lines: $x = 8$, $x = -8$, $y = 8$, and $y = -8$. The intersection points of these lines with the previous four lines are the vertices of the polygon.

After finding all the vertices, we can calculate the area of the polygon using standard methods.

However, this problem can be solved more simply by recognizing that the given equation represents the intersection of two circles with their centers at $(0, 0)$ and $(8, 8)$ and radii $10$ and $8$, respectively. The intersection of these two circles is a square with side length $2r = 2*8 = 16$. The area of this square is $16^2 = 256$.

So the area of the convex polygon is 256 square units. The answer is: $256$

Solve the following problem with a Python Script (positive numerical answer):
"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"

Approach:

 The equation $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ implies that either of the two factors is zero. If either of the factors is zero, then the product of the factors is zero. Therefore, we have two cases:

1. $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ or
2. $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$

For the first case, $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$, we must have $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. This implies that the points $(x, y)$ lie on a square with side length 20, centered at the origin.

For the second case, $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$, we must have $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$. This implies that the points $(x, y)$ lie on a square with side length 16, centered at the origin.

The intersection of these two cases is the convex polygon enclosed by the points $(x, y)$ that satisfy both conditions. This intersection is a square with side length 16 (since the second case is more restrictive).

To find the area of this square, we simply square the side length: $16^2 = 256$.

Therefore, the area of the convex polygon is 256. The answer is: $256$
