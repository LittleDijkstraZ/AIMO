Approach:


To find the minimum value of the expression $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ subject to the constraint $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$, we can use the method of Lagrange multipliers. First, we rewrite the constraint equation as $2|x-y|(x+y) = 40$. Next, we set up the Lagrangian function $L(x, y, \lambda) = 5x^2 + 5y^2 - 8xy + \lambda(2|x-y|(x+y) - 40)$. Then we take the partial derivatives of $L$ with respect to $x$, $y$, and $\lambda$, and set them equal to zero:

$\frac{\partial L}{\partial x} = 10x - 8y + 2\lambda|x-y| + 2\lambda y = 0$

$\frac{\partial L}{\partial y} = 10y - 8x + 2\lambda|x-y| + 2\lambda x = 0$

$\frac{\partial L}{\partial \lambda} = 2|x-y|(x+y) - 40 = 0$

Solving these equations simultaneously, we find that $x = 2y$. Substituting this into the constraint equation, we get $2|x-x/2|(3x/2) = 40 \Rightarrow |x/2|(3x/2) = 40 \Rightarrow (3/4)x^2 = 40 \Rightarrow x^2 = \frac{160}{3}$. Thus, $x = \pm\sqrt{\frac{160}{3}}$ and $y = \pm\sqrt{\frac{80}{3}}$. Substituting these values back into the expression $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$, we find that the minimum value is achieved at both positive and negative values of $x$ and $y$. Since the expression is symmetric with respect to $x$ and $y$, we only need to consider one of them, say the positive values. Thus, the minimum value is $5\left(\sqrt{\frac{160}{3}}\right)^2 + 5\left(\sqrt{\frac{80}{3}}\right)^2 - 8\left(\sqrt{\frac{160}{3}}\right)\left(\sqrt{\frac{80}{3}}\right) = -400/3$. Therefore, the minimum value of the expression $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ subject to the constraint is $-400/3$. The answer is: $\boxed{-\frac{400}{3}}$

To solve this problem, we first need to notice that the equation $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$ can be rewritten as $|x-2y| + |2y-x| = 40$. 
This equation is equivalent to $|x-2y| = |2y-x|$ which simplifies to $x-2y = 2y-x$ or $x-2y = -(2y-x)$. 
Solving these two equations, we find that $x=2y$ or $y=x$. 
Let's substitute $y=x$ into the expression $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ to simplify it:
$5x^2+5x^2-8x^2 = 2x^2$. 

Now we need to find the minimum value of $2x^2$ when $x$ ranges over all real numbers. 
Since $2x^2$ is always non-negative (because it's the product of 2 and $x^2$), its minimum value is 0, which occurs when $x=0$. 

Now we substitute $x=0$ back into the equation $y=x$ to find the corresponding value of $y$: $y=0$. 

So the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ occurs when $x=0$ and $y=0$. Substituting these values into the expression, we get:
$5(0)^2+5(0)^2-8(0)(0) = 0$. 

Therefore, the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ is 0. The answer is: $0$

This problem involves finding the minimum value of a function subject to a constraint. We can use the method of Lagrange multipliers to solve this problem.

First, we set up the function $F(x, y, \lambda) = 5x^2 + 5y^2 - 8xy + \lambda(|x - 2y| + |y - 2x| - 40)$.

Next, we need to find the gradient of F and set it equal to the zero vector:

$\nabla F = \begin{bmatrix} \frac{\partial F}{\partial x} \\ \frac{\partial F}{\partial y} \\ \frac{\partial F}{\partial \lambda} \end{bmatrix} = \begin{bmatrix} 10x - 8y + \lambda(-1 - 2) \\ 10y - 8x + \lambda(-2 - 1) \\ |x - 2y| + |y - 2x| - 40 \end{bmatrix} = \begin{bmatrix} 0 \\ 0 \\ 0 \end{bmatrix}$.

From the first two components of the gradient, we have:

$10x - 8y - 3\lambda = 0$ and $10y - 8x - 3\lambda = 0$.

Solving these equations simultaneously, we find $x = y$.

Substituting $x = y$ into the constraint equation $|x - 2x| + |x - 2x| = 40$, we get $|x| + |-x| = 40$, which simplifies to $2|x| = 40$. Thus, $|x| = 20$, and $x = \pm 20$.

Substituting $x = y = 20$ into the function $5x^2 + 5y^2 - 8xy$, we get $5(20)^2 + 5(20)^2 - 8(20)(20) = 2000$.

Substituting $x = y = -20$ into the function $5x^2 + 5y^2 - 8xy$, we also get $2000$.

Therefore, the minimum value of $5x^2 + 5y^2 - 8xy$ subject to the constraint is $2000$. The answer is: $2000$.

This is a problem involving calculus and optimization. First, we need to find the relationship between $x$ and $y$ from the given equation $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$. This is a bit tricky, but we can simplify it to $x = y$ or $x = -y$.

Now, we substitute $x = y$ or $x = -y$ into the expression $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$, and we get two functions: $10x^2 - 8x^2 = 2x^2$ for $x = y$, and $10x^2 + 8x^2 = 18x^2$ for $x = -y$.

To find the minimum value of these functions, we take their derivatives and set them equal to zero. For $2x^2$, the derivative is $4x$, and setting it to zero gives $x = 0$. For $18x^2$, the derivative is $36x$, and setting it to zero also gives $x = 0$.

Substituting $x = 0$ into the original equations $x = y$ or $x = -y$, we get $y = 0$ as well. Therefore, the minimum value occurs at $(x, y) = (0, 0)$.

Finally, we substitute $(x, y) = (0, 0)$ into the expression $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$, we get $0$. So, the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ is $0$. The answer is: $0$

Approach:


This problem involves finding the minimum value of a function under a constraint. One way to approach this is to use the method of Lagrange multipliers. However, this method is quite involved and requires a deep understanding of calculus. Another way to approach this problem is to recognize that the function we are trying to minimize is a quadratic function in two variables. The graph of such a function is a paraboloid opening upwards. The minimum value of this function occurs at its vertex.

To find the vertex of the paraboloid, we can complete the square for the given function. The function is:

$$F(x, y) = 5x^2 + 5y^2 - 8xy$$

First, we can rewrite the function as:

$$F(x, y) = 5(x^2 - \frac{8}{5}xy) + 5(y^2)$$

Now, to complete the square, we need to add and subtract the square of half of the coefficient of $x$ in the parenthesis:

$$F(x, y) = 5[(x^2 - \frac{8}{5}xy + (\frac{4}{5}y)^2) - (\frac{4}{5}y)^2] + 5(y^2)$$

$$F(x, y) = 5[(x - \frac{4}{5}y)^2 - (\frac{4}{5}y)^2] + 5y^2$$

$$F(x, y) = 5(x - \frac{4}{5}y)^2 - 5(\frac{4}{5}y)^2 + 5y^2$$

$$F(x, y) = 5(x - \frac{4}{5}y)^2 - 3y^2$$

Now, we can see that the vertex of the paraboloid occurs at the point $(x, y) = (\frac{4}{5}y, y)$. Substituting these values into the constraint equation:

$$|x - 2y| + |y - 2x| = 40$$

$$|\frac{4}{5}y - 2y| + |y - 2(\frac{4}{5}y)| = 40$$

$$|\frac{-6}{5}y| + |\frac{-3}{5}y| = 40$$

$$\frac{9}{5}|y| = 40$$

$$|y| = \frac{200}{9}$$

Since $y$ cannot be zero (otherwise, $x$ would also be zero), we know that $y = \pm \frac{200}{9}$. Let's choose $y = \frac{200}{9}$ (the negative case gives the same result). Now, we can find the corresponding value of $x$:

$$x = \frac{4}{5}y = \frac{4}{5} \cdot \frac{200}{9} = \frac{160}{9}$$

Now, we can substitute these values back into the function $F(x, y)$:

$$F(x, y) = 5(x - \frac{4}{5}y)^2 - 3y^2 = 5(\frac{160}{9} - \frac{4}{5} \cdot \frac{200}{9})^2 - 3(\frac{200}{9})^2$$

$$F(x, y) = - \frac{8000}{9}$$

Therefore, the minimum value of the function $5x^2 + 5y^2 - 8xy$ subject to the constraint $|x - 2y| + |y - 2x| = 40$ is $-\frac{8000}{9}$. The answer is: $-\frac{8000}{9}$

Assistant:

Approach:

 To find the minimum value of the function $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ under the condition $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$, we can use the fact that the square of a real number is always non-negative. This gives us the inequality $(x-2y)^2 + (y-2x)^2 \geq 0$.

Expanding and simplifying, we get $5x^2+5y^2-8xy = 5(x^2+y^2-2xy) = 5((x-y)^2) \geq 0$. Therefore, the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ is 0, which is achieved when $x = y$.

Now, we need to find the relationship between $x$ and $y$ from the condition $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$. When $x = y$, we have $|x-2x| + |x-2x| = 40$, which simplifies to $2|x-2x| = 40$, or $2|x-x| = 40$. Since $|x-x| = 0$, this condition does not restrict $x$ and $y$ when they are equal.

Therefore, we can conclude that the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ is 0, when $x = y$.
The answer is: $\boxed{0}$
