Approach:



We can start by finding the value of $f(1)$ using the second equation: $f(2) = 2f(1) + 1$.

Then, we can substitute $f(1)$ into the first equation: $f(f(f(1))) = 8*1 - 7 = -1$.

Since $f(f(f(1))) = -1$, we have $f(f(1)) = f^{-1}(-1)$.

Now, substitute $f(1)$ into the second equation: $f(2) = 2f(1) + 1$.

So, $f(f(1)) = f(2) = 2f(1) + 1$.

Now we have $f(2f(1) + 1) = -1$.

Let $2f(1) + 1 = m$, then $f(m) = -1$.

From the first equation, we have $f(f(f(1))) = 8*1 - 7 = -1$.

So, $f(f(1)) = -1$.

Then, we have $f(-1) = f(f(1)) = -1$.

From the second equation, we have $f(2) = 2f(1) + 1$.

Since $f(2) = -1$, we have $-1 = 2f(1) + 1$.

Solving this equation, we get $f(1) = -1$.

Now, we substitute $f(1) = -1$ into the second equation: $f(2) = 2*(-1) + 1 = -1$.

This means that $f(n) = -1$ for all positive integers $n$.

However, this solution does not satisfy the first equation $f(f(f(n))) = 8n - 7$.

Therefore, we must have made a mistake in our reasoning.

Let's go back and check our work.

After examining our steps, we realize that we made an error in the step where we substituted $f(1)$ into the first equation: $f(f(f(1))) = 8*1 - 7 = -1$.

The correct equation should be $f(f(f(1))) = f(8*1 - 7) = f(-1)$.

Since $f(n) = -1$ for all positive integers $n$, we have $f(-1) = -1$.

So, $f(f(f(1))) = -1$.

Now, we can continue with our steps and find the value of $f(100)$.

Since $f(n) = -1$ for all positive integers $n$, we have $f(100) = -1$.

The answer is: $\boxed{-1}$

We can start by substituting $n = 100$ into the second equation to find $f(200)$.
Then, substitute $f(200)$ into the second equation to find $f(400)$, and so on.
We continue this process until we reach a value that we can easily find using the first equation.

```python

        # If n = 100, then f(n) = f(100)
        n = 100
        # Calculate f(f(f(n))) = f(f(f(100)))
        f_f_f_n = 8 * n - 7
        # From the first equation, f(f(f(n))) = f(f(f(100))) = f(f(100))

Solve the following problem with a Python Script (positive numerical answer):
"A function $f: \mathbb N \to \mathbb N$ satisfies the following two conditions for all positive integers $n$:$f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$ and $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$. Calculate $f(100)$."

Approach:


We can start by calculating $f(100)$ using the second condition $f(2n) = 2f(n) + 1$.
We know that $100 = 2 \times 50$, so we can substitute $n = 50$ into the second condition to get $f(100) = 2f(50) + 1$.
We still need to find $f(50)$, so we can use the second condition again. We know that $50 = 2 \times 25$, so we can substitute $n = 25$ into the second condition to get $f(50) = 2f(25) + 1$.
We continue this process until we reach a value that we can find directly using the first condition.

Let's start calculating:

$f(1) = ?$ (we can't find this value directly using the given conditions)

$f(2) = 2f(1) + 1$

$f(3) = ?$

$f(4) = 2f(2) + 1 = 2(2f(1) + 1) + 1 = 4f(1) + 3$

$f(5) = ?$

$f(6) = 2f(3) + 1$

$f(7) = ?$

$f(8) = 2f(4) + 1 = 2(4f(1) + 3) + 1 = 8f(1) + 7$

Now we see that $f(8) = 8n - 7$, which matches the first condition $f(f(f(n))) = 8n - 7$. So we can conclude that $f(1) = 1$.

Now we can continue calculating:

$f(2) = 2f(1) + 1 = 2(1) + 1 = 3$

$f(3) = ?$

$f(4) = 4f(1) + 3 = 4(1) + 3 = 7$

$f(5) = ?$

$f(6) = 2f(3) + 1$

$f(7) = ?$

$f(8) = 8f(1) + 7 = 8(1) + 7 = 15$

We can see that $f(8) = 15$, and according to the first condition, $f(f(f(n))) = 8n - 7$, we can find that $f(f(1)) = 1$ and $f(f(2)) = 3$.

Since $f(1) = 1$, we have $f(f(2)) = f(3) = 3$.

So, $f(6) = 2f(3) + 1 = 2(3) + 1 = 7$.

Continuing the calculations:

$f(7) = ?$

$f(8) = 15$ (already calculated)

Now we can find $f(50)$:

$f(50) = 2f(25) + 1 = 2(2f(12) + 1) + 1 = 4(2f(6) + 1) + 1 = 4(7) + 1 = 29$

Finally, we can find $f(100)$:

$f(100) = 2f(50) + 1 = 2(29) + 1 = 59$.

So, $f(100) = 59$.
The answer is: $59$

Approach:



We are given two functional equations and asked to find the value of $f(100)$. The first equation, $f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$, gives us a way to find the value of $f(n)$ for a given $n$. The second equation, $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$, gives us a way to find the value of $f(n)$ for even $n$.

We can start by applying the second equation to $f(100)$ to get $f(200)=2f(100)+1$. Then we can apply the first equation to $f(200)$ to get $f(f(f(200)))=8(200)-7=1593$.

Now we need to find the value of $f(f(f(200)))$ in terms of $f(100)$. Using the second equation, we can write $f(f(f(200)))=f(2f(f(100))+1)$.

Setting this equal to 1593, we have $f(2f(f(100))+1)=1593$.

Now we need to find the value of $f(100)$. To do this, we can try to find a value of $n$ such that $f(n)=100$. From the second equation, we know that $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$, so if $f(n)=100$, then $f(2n)=2(100)+1=201$.

Now we can use the first equation, $f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$, to find the value of $n$ such that $f(n)=100$. Setting $f(n)=100$, we have $f(f(f(n)))=f(f(100))=8n-7$.

From the second equation, we know that $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$, so if $f(n)=100$, then $f(2n)=2(100)+1=201$. Therefore, we have $f(f(100))=201$.

Setting this equal to $8n-7$, we have $201=8n-7$, so $8n=208$ and $n=26$.

Now we know that $f(26)=100$. Therefore, we can substitute $n=26$ into the second equation to find $f(100)$: $f(100)=2f(26)+1=2(100)+1=201$.

So $f(100)=201$. The answer is: $201$

Approach:


We can start by applying the second equation to find $f(100)$. Since $100 = 2 \cdot 50$, we have $f(100) = 2f(50) + 1$. We don't know $f(50)$ yet, but we can continue applying the second equation to find it. We have $50 = 2 \cdot 25$, so $f(50) = 2f(25) + 1$. Continuing this process, we eventually reach $f(1)$, for which we can use the first equation.

We can now work backwards to find $f(100)$.

Here is the Python code to compute $f(100)$:

```python


INTERMEDIATE OUT :

def f(n):
    if n == 1:
        return 1
    elif n % 2 == 0:
        return 2 * f(n // 2) + 1
    else:
        return 8 * n - 7

result = f(100)
print(result)
```

Approach:


We can start by applying the second equation to the first equation, $f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$. This gives us $f(f(2f(n)+1))=8n-7$.

Now, we can substitute $n=f(n)$ into the second equation to get $f(2f(n)+1)=2f(f(n))+1$. So, we have $f(2f(n)+1)=2f(f(n))+1$.

Now, we can substitute this into the equation $f(f(2f(n)+1))=8n-7$ to get $f(2f(f(n))+1)=8n-7$.

Now, we can substitute $n=f(n)$ again to get $f(2f(n)+1)=8f(n)-7$.

Comparing this with the second equation $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$, we can see that they are the same. So, we have found that $f(8n-6)=8n-7$.

Now, we can substitute $n=100$ into the equation $f(8n-6)=8n-7$ to get $f(794)=793$. So, $f(100)=793$. The answer is: $\boxed{793}$

Approach:


We can start by finding the value of $f(1)$ using the second condition $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$. By setting $n=1$, we get $f(2)=2f(1)+1$. Since $f(2)$ is also equal to $f(f(f(1))) = 8(1) - 7 = -1$ from the first condition, we can substitute this into the equation to get $-1 = 2f(1) + 1$. Solving for $f(1)$ gives us $f(1) = -1$.

Now we can use the second condition to find $f(2)$: $f(2) = 2f(1) + 1 = 2(-1) + 1 = -1$.

Similarly, we can find $f(3)$: $f(3) = f(f(f(2))) = f(-1) = 8(2) - 7 = 9$.

And $f(4) = f(f(f(3))) = f(9) = 8(3) - 7 = 17$.

Continuing in this way, we can find that $f(5) = 27$, $f(6) = 45$, and so on.

By examining these values, we can see a pattern: $f(n) = (n-1)^2$ for all positive integers $n$.

Now we can calculate $f(100) = (100-1)^2 = 99^2 = 9801$.

So, the value of $f(100)$ is 9801.
The answer is: $9801$

We are given two equations:
1. $f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$
2. $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$

We are asked to find $f(100)$.

Let's try to simplify the problem using the second equation. If we plug in $n=50$, we get $f(100) = 2f(50) + 1$. We still don't know $f(50)$, so let's try to find it using the second equation again. If we plug in $n=25$, we get $f(50) = 2f(25) + 1$. Now we need to find $f(25)$.

If we plug in $n=12.5$ into the second equation, we get $f(25) = 2f(12.5) + 1$. But $12.5$ is not a natural number, so we need to look for another way.

Let's go back to the first equation. If we plug in $n=1$, we get $f(f(f(1)))=8*1-7=1$. Since $f(f(f(1)))=1$, and $f(1)$ must be a natural number, we can conclude that $f(1)=1$.

Now we can use the second equation to find $f(2)$, $f(4)$, $f(8)$, and so on, until we find $f(25)$.

For example, $f(2) = 2f(1) + 1 = 2*1 + 1 = 3$, $f(4) = 2f(2) + 1 = 2*3 + 1 = 7$, $f(8) = 2f(4) + 1 = 2*7 + 1 = 15$, and so on.

After calculating $f(25)$, we can use the second equation again to find $f(50)$ and finally $f(100)$.

By following this process, we find that $f(100) = 191$.

The answer is: $191$

We will try to find the value of $f(100)$ using the given conditions. We start by applying the second condition $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$ to $n=50$, we get $f(100)=2f(50)+1$. Now we need to find the value of $f(50)$.

Applying the second condition again to $n=25$, we get $f(50)=2f(25)+1$. Now we need to find the value of $f(25)$.

Applying the second condition again to $n=12.5$, we get a non-integer value, so we need to use the first condition $f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$. Setting $n=13$, we get $f(f(f(13)))=8*13-7=99$. Since $f(f(f(13)))=99$, we have $f(13)=31$ (solving for this we get $f(n) = 3n + 2$).

Now we can find $f(25)$, $f(50)$ and finally $f(100)$.

Calculations:

1. For $n=13$, we have $f(f(f(13)))=99$, so $f(f(13))=33$ and $f(13)=31$. Thus, $f(n) = 3n + 2$.

2. For $n=25$, we have $f(50)=2f(25)+1$. Using $f(n) = 3n + 2$, we get $f(25)=3*25+2=77$, so $f(50)=2*77+1=155$.

3. For $n=50$, we have $f(100)=2f(50)+1$. Using $f(50)=155$, we get $f(100)=2*155+1=311$.

So, $f(100)=311$. The answer is: $\boxed{311}$

We will try to find a value for $f(1)$ first, and then use the given equations to find $f(100)$.

Given that $f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$, we can set $n=1$ to get $f(f(f(1)))=8(1)-7=1$. Since $f(f(f(1)))=1$, we have $f(f(1))=f^{-1}(1)$.

Also, given that $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$, we can set $n=1$ to get $f(2)=2f(1)+1$. Since $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$, we can substitute $n=\frac{1}{2}$ to get $f(1)=2f(\frac{1}{2})+1$.

Now, we can substitute $f(f(1))=f^{-1}(1)$ into the equation $f(1)=2f(\frac{1}{2})+1$ to get $f(1)=2f(\frac{1}{2})+1$.

By solving the system of equations $f(f(f(1)))=1$ and $f(1)=2f(\frac{1}{2})+1$, we can find that $f(1)=3$.

Now, we can use the equation $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$ to find $f(100)$.

We have $f(100)=2f(50)+1$, $f(50)=2f(25)+1$, $f(25)=2f(12.5)+1$, $f(12.5)=2f(6.25)+1$, $f(6.25)=2f(3.125)+1$, and $f(3.125)=2f(1.5625)+1$.

We can continue this process until we reach $f(1)$, which we have found to be 3.

So, $f(3.125)=2f(1.5625)+1=2(2f(0.78125)+1)+1=...=2^5f(1)+2^4+2^3+2^2+2^1+2^0=31$.

Similarly, we can find that $f(6.25)=2(31)+1=63$, $f(12.5)=2(63)+1=127$, $f(25)=2(127)+1=255$, $f(50)=2(255)+1=511$, and $f(100)=2(511)+1=1023$.

Therefore, $f(100)=1023$. The answer is: $1023$

To solve this problem, we will use the second equation to simplify the first equation.

Given $f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$, we can substitute $f(n)$ with $2f(n/2)+1$ from the second equation.

So, $f(f(f(n)))=f(2(2f(n/2)+1))=f(4f(n/2)+2)$.

Now, we substitute $f(n/2)$ with $2f(n/4)+1$ from the second equation.

So, $f(4f(n/2)+2)=f(4(2f(n/4)+1)+2)=f(8f(n/4)+4)$.

Again, we substitute $f(n/4)$ with $2f(n/8)+1$ from the second equation.

So, $f(8f(n/4)+4)=f(8(2f(n/8)+1)+4)=f(16f(n/8)+8)$.

Now, we notice a pattern: $f(2^kf(n/2^k)+2^k)=f(2^{k+2}f(n/2^{k+2})+2^{k+1})$.

By induction, we can prove that $f(f(f(n)))=f(2^3f(n/2^3)+2^3)=8n-7$.

So, we have $f(2^3f(n/2^3)+2^3)=8n-7$.

Now, we want to find $f(100)$. We can set $n=100$ in the equation $f(2^3f(n/2^3)+2^3)=8n-7$.

So, $f(2^3f(100/2^3)+2^3)=8*100-7=793$.

We know that $2^3=8$, so we have $f(8f(100/8)+8)=793$.

And $100/8=12.5$, which is not an integer. But we can use the second equation $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$ to find $f(12.5)$.

We can express $12.5$ as $2*6.25$. Then, $f(12.5)=2f(6.25)+1$.

Again, we can express $6.25$ as $2*3.125$. Then, $f(6.25)=2f(3.125)+1$.

Continuing this process, we eventually find that $f(12.5)=19$.

Now, we can substitute this back into the equation $f(8f(100/8)+8)=793$.

So, $f(8*19+8)=793$.

And $8*19+8=160$, so we have $f(160)=793$.

But we know that $f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$, so we can set $n=160$ in this equation to find $f(160)$.

So, $f(f(f(160)))=8*160-7=1273$.

But we have $f(160)=793$, so we can substitute this into the equation to find $f(f(160))$.

So, $f(f(160))=1273$.

Again, we substitute $f(160)=793$ into this equation to find $f(160)$.

So, $f(793)=1273$.

Finally, we want to find $f(100)$. We can set $n=793$ in the equation $f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$.

So, $f(f(f(793)))=8*793-7=6341$.

But we have $f(793)=1273$, so we can substitute this into the equation to find $f(100)$.

So, $f(100)=6341/8$.

But we know that $f(100)$ must be an integer, so this solution is not possible.

Let's try another approach. We know that $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$, so we can express $100$ as $2*50$. Then, $f(100)=2f(50)+1$.

Again, we can express $50$ as $2*25$. Then, $f(50)=2f(25)+1$.

Continuing this process, we eventually find that $f(100)=127$.

But we know that $f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$, so we can set $n=100$ in this equation to find $f(100)$.

So, $f(f(f(100)))=8*100-7=793$.

But we have $f(100)=127$, so we can substitute this into the equation to find $f(f(100))$.

So, $f(f(127))=793$.

Again, we substitute $f(127)=127$ into this equation to find $f(127)$.

So, $f(127)=793$.

But we know that $f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$, so we can set $n=127$ in this equation to find $f(127)$.

So, $f(f(f(127)))=8*127-7=1011$.

But we have $f(127)=793$, so we can substitute this into the equation to find $f(f(127))$.

So, $f(f(793))=1011$.

Again, we substitute $f(793)=1273$ into this equation to find $f(793)$.

So, $f(1273)=1011$.

But we know that $f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$, so we can set $n=793$ in this equation to find $f(793)$.

So, $f(f(f(793)))=8*793-7=6341$.

But we have $f(793)=1273$, so we can substitute this into the equation to find $f(f(793))$.

We will use the second equation to simplify the first equation. If we substitute $f(n)$ with $n$ in the second equation, we get $f(2n) = 2f(n) + 1$. Thus, we can substitute $f(f(n))$ with $2f(n) + 1$ in the first equation. The first equation then becomes $f(2f(n) + 1) = 8n - 7$.

Now, let's substitute $n = 1$ in the second equation, we get $f(2) = 2f(1) + 1$. Since $f(2)$ is a natural number, $f(1)$ must be either $0$ or $1$. If $f(1) = 0$, then $f(2) = 1$, which contradicts with the first equation because $f(f(f(1))) = f(1) = 0$ but $8*1 - 7 = 1$. Therefore, $f(1) = 1$.

Then, $f(2) = 2*1 + 1 = 3$. Now we substitute $n = 2$ into the second equation, we get $f(4) = 2f(2) + 1 = 2*3 + 1 = 7$. Then we substitute $n = 4$ into the second equation, we get $f(8) = 2f(4) + 1 = 2*7 + 1 = 15$. We continue this process until we find a pattern.

After a few iterations, we find that $f(n) = 2n - 1$. We can check that this solution satisfies both given equations. Therefore, $f(100) = 2*100 - 1 = 199$.

So, the value of $f(100)$ is $199$. The answer is: $199$

Approach:


We are given two equations for the function $f$. We will try to find a pattern or a general form for the function $f$. Let's start by applying the second equation to the first equation.

For the first equation $f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$, if we substitute $f(n)$ with $2f\left(\frac{n}{2}\right)+1$ (from the second equation with $n$ replaced by $\frac{n}{2}$), we get
$$f(f(2f\left(\frac{n}{2}\right)+1)) = 8n - 7.$$

Now, apply the second equation again with $n$ replaced by $f\left(\frac{n}{2}\right)$, we get
$$f(2f(f\left(\frac{n}{2}\right))+1) = 8n - 7.$$

Now, let's try to simplify the left-hand side of the equation. Using the second equation again, we have
$$f(2f(f\left(\frac{n}{2}\right))+1) = 2f(f(f\left(\frac{n}{2}\right))+1) + 1.$$

So we have
$$2f(f(f\left(\frac{n}{2}\right))+1) + 1 = 8n - 7.$$

Solving for $f(f(f\left(\frac{n}{2}\right))+1)$, we get
$$f(f(f\left(\frac{n}{2}\right))+1) = \frac{8n - 8}{2} = 4n - 4.$$

Now, we want to find $f(100)$. We can use the second equation to simplify this. Since $100 = 2 \cdot 50$, we have
$$f(100) = 2f(50) + 1.$$

But we also know that $50 = 2 \cdot 25$, so
$$f(50) = 2f(25) + 1.$$

Continuing this process, we find that
$$f(25) = 2f(12.5) + 1,$$
$$f(12.5) = 2f(6.25) + 1,$$
$$f(6.25) = 2f(3.125) + 1,$$
$$f(3.125) = 2f(1.5625) + 1,$$
$$f(1.5625) = 2f(0.78125) + 1,$$
$$f(0.78125) = 2f(0.390625) + 1,$$
$$f(0.390625) = 2f(0.1953125) + 1,$$
$$f(0.1953125) = 2f(0.09765625) + 1.$$

At this point, we notice that $0.09765625 = \frac{1}{10}$, and $f\left(\frac{1}{10}\right)$ must be equal to $1$ according to the first equation, since $f(f(f(1/10)))=8(1/10)-7=-6.2$, but $f(1)$ must be a non-negative integer, so $f(1) = 1$.

Now we can work our way back up:
$$f(0.09765625) = 1,$$
$$f(0.1953125) = 2(1) + 1 = 3,$$
$$f(0.390625) = 2(3) + 1 = 7,$$
$$f(0.78125) = 2(7) + 1 = 15,$$
$$f(1.5625) = 2(15) + 1 = 31,$$
$$f(3.125) = 2(31) + 1 = 63,$$
$$f(6.25) = 2(63) + 1 = 127,$$
$$f(12.5) = 2(127) + 1 = 255,$$
$$f(25) = 2(255) + 1 = 511,$$
$$f(50) = 2(511) + 1 = 1023,$$
$$f(100) = 2(1023) + 1 = 2047.$$

So, $f(100) = 2047$. The answer is: $2047$

We are given two functional equations and we want to find the value of $f(100)$. We can start by trying to simplify the equations and see if we can find a pattern or a way to relate $f(100)$ to a simpler expression.

From the second equation, we have $f(2n) = 2f(n) + 1$. Let's set $n = f(n)$, then we get $f(2f(n)) = 2f(f(n)) + 1$.

From the first equation, we have $f(f(f(n))) = 8n - 7$. Let's set $f(n) = n$, then we get $f(f(f(n))) = 8f(n) - 7$, or $f(f(n)) = 8n - 7$.

Now, substitute $f(n) = n$ into the equation $f(2f(n)) = 2f(f(n)) + 1$, we get $f(2n) = 2f(n) + 1$.

Comparing this equation with the second equation given in the problem, we can see that they are the same. This means that the second equation holds for all positive integers $n$.

Now, let's try to find $f(100)$. We know that $f(2n) = 2f(n) + 1$, so we can repeatedly apply this equation to get $f(100) = 2f(50) + 1$, $f(50) = 2f(25) + 1$, $f(25) = 2f(12.5)$, and so on.

However, we notice that we can't continue this process because we are dealing with half numbers. But we can use the first equation given in the problem to find $f(100)$.

We know that $f(f(f(n))) = 8n - 7$. Let's set $n = 50$, then we get $f(f(f(50))) = 8*50 - 7 = 393$.

We also know that $f(f(f(50))) = f(f(25)) = f(12.5)$, so we have $f(f(25)) = 393$.

Again, using the second equation given in the problem, we have $f(25) = 2f(12.5) + 1$.

Substituting $f(25) = 393$ into this equation, we get $393 = 2f(12.5) + 1$, so $f(12.5) = (393 - 1)/2 = 196$.

Similarly, we can find $f(6.25) = (196 - 1)/2 = 97.5$, but this is not a valid function value since it's not an integer.

This indicates that we have made a mistake in our previous steps. Let's go back and check our work.

We found that $f(25) = 2f(12.5) + 1$, but we used this equation to find $f(12.5)$. We should have used the first equation given in the problem to find $f(12.5)$ instead.

Let's try that. We know that $f(f(f(n))) = 8n - 7$. Let's set $n = 25$, then we get $f(f(f(25))) = 8*25 - 7 = 193$.

We also know that $f(f(f(25))) = f(f(12.5)) = f(6.25)$, so we have $f(f(12.5)) = 193$.

Using the second equation given in the problem, we have $f(12.5) = 2f(6.25) + 1$.

Substituting $f(12.5) = 193$ into this equation, we get $193 = 2f(6.25) + 1$, so $f(6.25) = (193 - 1)/2 = 96$.

Now, using the second equation given in the problem again, we have $f(25) = 2f(12.5) + 1 = 2*96 + 1 = 193$.

This value matches the one we found earlier using the first equation given in the problem.

Now, we can continue to find $f(12.5)$, $f(6.25)$, and so on, until we reach $f(100)$.

We have $f(12.5) = 96$, $f(6.25) = 47.5$, $f(3.125) = 23.75$, $f(1.5625) = 11.875$, and so on.

We can see that the function values are getting smaller and smaller, and it seems that we will never reach $f(100)$.

However, we can notice that the function values are always half integers. This suggests that the function may be doubling the input value and subtracting 1.

Let's test this hypothesis. If $f(n) = 2n - 1$, then $f(f(n)) = f(2n - 1) = 2(2n - 1) - 1 = 4n - 3$.

Then $f(f(f(n))) = f(4n - 3) = 2(4n - 3) - 1 = 8n - 7$. This matches the first equation given in the problem.

So, we can conclude that $f(n) = 2n - 1$ is the correct function. Now, we can find $f(100)$ by substituting $n = 100$ into this equation: $f(100) = 2*100 - 1 = 199$.

So, $f(100) = 199$. The answer is: $199$

Approach:



To find the value of $f(100)$, we can start by using the second condition $f(2n) = 2f(n) + 1$. By setting $n = 50$, we get $f(100) = 2f(50) + 1$. We can keep using this second condition to simplify the expression of $f(100)$ in terms of $f(n)$ until we reach a value that can be found using the first condition $f(f(f(n))) = 8n - 7$.

Let's start by finding $f(50)$:

$$f(100) = 2f(50) + 1.$$

Using the second condition again with $n = 25$, we get:

$$f(50) = 2f(25) + 1.$$

Now, substituting this into the equation for $f(100)$:

$$f(100) = 2(2f(25) + 1) + 1 = 4f(25) + 3.$$

Now, let's find $f(25)$:

$$f(50) = 2f(25) + 1.$$

Using the second condition again with $n = 12.5$ (note that $25 = 2 \times 12.5$), we get:

$$f(25) = 2f(12.5) + 1.$$

However, $12.5$ is not a positive integer, so we cannot directly use the first condition $f(f(f(n))) = 8n - 7$. Instead, we can observe that $25 = f(12)$, because:

$$f(f(f(12))) = f(f(2f(6) + 1)) = f(f(2(2f(3) + 1) + 1)) = f(f(2(2(2f(1.5) + 1) + 1) + 1)) = f(f(2(2(2(2f(0.75) + 1) + 1) + 1) + 1)) = f(f(2(2(2(2 \cdot 1 + 1) + 1) + 1) + 1)) = f(f(2(2(2(3) + 1) + 1) + 1)) = f(f(2(2(7) + 1) + 1)) = f(f(2(15) + 1)) = f(f(31)) = 8 \cdot 12 - 7 = 96 - 7 = 89.$$

Since $f(25) = f(f(f(12))) = 89$, we can substitute this into the equation for $f(25)$:

$$f(25) = 2 \cdot 89 + 1 = 179.$$

Now, substitute this into the equation for $f(50)$:

$$f(50) = 2 \cdot 179 + 1 = 359.$$

Finally, substitute this into the equation for $f(100)$:

$$f(100) = 4 \cdot 179 + 3 = 719.$$

So, $f(100) = 719$. The answer is: $719$

We will use the second equation to simplify the first equation.

Let's start with $f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$.

By substituting $f(n)$ with $2f\left(\frac{n}{2}\right)+1$ (from the second equation), we get:
\[f(f(2f\left(\frac{n}{2}\right)+1))=8n-7.\]

Then, we can apply the second equation again to simplify the left side:
\[f(2f(f\left(\frac{n}{2}\right))+1)=8n-7.\]

And again:
\[2f(f(f\left(\frac{n}{2}\right)))+1=8n-7.\]

Now, we know that $f(f(f\left(\frac{n}{2}\right)))=8\left(\frac{n}{2}\right)-7=4n-7$.

Substituting this into the equation above, we get:
\[2(4n-7)+1=8n-7.\]

Simplifying, we get:
\[8n-14+1=8n-7.\]
\[8n-13=8n-7.\]

This implies that $13=7$, which is a contradiction. Therefore, our initial assumption that $f(n)$ has a simple form like $2n+1$ must be incorrect.

However, we can still use the second equation to find $f(100)$.

From the second equation, we know that $f(200)=2f(100)+1$.

We also know that $f(f(f(100)))=8*100-7=793$.

But we also know that $f(f(f(100)))=f(2f(f(50))+1)$.

By applying the second equation repeatedly, we can simplify this to:
\[f(2f(f(50))+1)=f(2f(2f(25)+1)+1)=f(2f(2*50+1)+1)=f(2f(101)+1)=793.\]

So, we have the system of equations:
\[f(200)=2f(100)+1,\]
\[f(2f(101)+1)=793.\]

From the first equation, we can express $f(100)$ in terms of $f(200)$:
\[f(100)=\frac{f(200)-1}{2}.\]

Substituting this into the second equation, we get:
\[f(2f\left(\frac{f(200)-1}{2}\right)+1)=793.\]

Simplifying, we get:
\[f(f(200)-1+1)=793.\]
\[f(200)=793.\]

Substituting this back into the equation for $f(100)$, we get:
\[f(100)=\frac{793-1}{2}=396.\]

So, $f(100)=396$. The answer is: $\boxed{396}$
