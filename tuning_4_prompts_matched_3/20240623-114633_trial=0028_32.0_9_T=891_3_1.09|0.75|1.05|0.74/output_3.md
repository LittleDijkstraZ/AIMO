"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"

Approach:


The given equation is a product of two expressions, and for the product to be zero, either one of the expressions must be zero. This gives us two equations:
1. $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$
2. $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$

For the first equation to be zero, both terms must be zero, which means $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. This implies that $x + y = \pm 10$ and $x - y = \pm 10$. Solving these equations gives us the vertices of the polygon.

For the second equation to be zero, both terms must be zero, which means $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$. This implies that $x = \pm 8$ and $y = \pm 8$. Solving these equations gives us the vertices of the polygon.

By plotting these points on a coordinate plane and connecting them, we can see that the points enclose a square with side length 16. The area of a square is given by the square of its side length, so the area of this square is $16^2 = 256$.

So, the area of the convex polygon is 256 square units. The answer is: $256$

Approach:


The given equation is a product of two expressions equal to zero. Therefore, either the first expression is zero or the second expression is zero. We will solve each case separately.

Case 1: $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$
For the sum of two squares to be zero, both squares must be zero. Therefore, we have:
$\vert x + y \vert - 10 = 0$ and $\vert x - y \vert - 10 = 0$
This implies $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$

Case 2: $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$
Similarly, for the sum of two squares to be zero, both squares must be zero. Therefore, we have:
$\vert x \vert - 8 = 0$ and $\vert y \vert - 8 = 0$
This implies $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$

From Case 1, we have $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. This implies that the points $(x, y)$ lie on a square with side length 10. The vertices of this square are $(8, 2)$, $(8, -2)$, $(-8, -2)$, and $(-8, 2)$.

From Case 2, we have $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$. This implies that the points $(x, y)$ lie on a square with side length 16. The vertices of this square are $(8, 8)$, $(8, -8)$, $(-8, -8)$, and $(-8, 8)$.

The intersection of the two squares is the convex polygon whose area we want to find. This intersection is also a square, and its side length is the smaller of the two side lengths, which is 10.

The area of a square with side length $s$ is $s^2$. Therefore, the area of the convex polygon is $10^2 = 100$.
The answer is: $100$

Solve the following problem with a Python Script (positive numerical answer):
"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"

Approach:



The equation $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + (\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ implies that $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. This means that $x + y = \pm 10$ and $x - y = \pm 10$. Solving these equations we get four lines: $x + y = 10$, $x + y = -10$, $x - y = 10$, and $x - y = -10$.

Similarly, the equation $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + (\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ implies that $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$. This means that $x = \pm 8$ and $y = \pm 8$. This gives us four lines: $x = 8$, $x = -8$, $y = 8$, and $y = -8$.

The intersection of these lines form a square with side length $10$ (since the distance between the lines $x + y = 10$ and $x + y = -10$ is $10$, and similarly for the other two pairs of lines). The area of this square is $10^2 = 100$. So the area of the convex polygon is $100$. The answer is: $100$

Solve the following problem with a Python Script (positive numerical answer):
"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"

Assistant:

Approach:


The given equation is $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$.
This equation equals zero if either of the two terms equals zero.

For the first term to be zero, we have $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$.
For the second term to be zero, we have $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$.

These conditions describe a square with side length 16. The vertices of the square are $(8,8)$, $(8,-8)$, $(-8,8)$, and $(-8,-8)$.

To find the area of the square, we simply square the length of one of its sides. The side length is 16, so the area is $16^2 = 256$.
The answer is: 256

Solve the following problem with a Python Script (positive numerical answer):
"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"

Assistant:

Approach:

 The equation $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ is satisfied if either of the two factors is zero. This means that either $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$.

If $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$, then both $\vert x + y \vert - 10 = 0$ and $\vert x - y \vert - 10 = 0$, which implies $x + y = \pm 10$ and $x - y = \pm 10$. These four equations give us the vertices of the square: $(8, 2)$, $(8, -2)$, $(-8, 2)$, and $(-8, -2)$.

If $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$, then both $\vert x \vert - 8 = 0$ and $\vert y \vert - 8 = 0$, which implies $x = \pm 8$ and $y = \pm 8$. These four points are the vertices of the square formed by the previous condition.

So, the points that satisfy the equation are the vertices of a square with side length $16$. The area of a square is given by the square of its side length, so the area of this square is $16^2 = 256$.

The answer is: $256$.

Solve the following problem with a Python Script (positive numerical answer):
"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"

Approach:


The equation given is a product of two terms equal to zero, which means either the first term is zero or the second term is zero.
Let's consider each term separately:
1. $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ implies $\vert x + y \vert = 10$, which gives $x + y = 10$ or $x + y = -10$.
2. $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ implies $\vert x - y \vert = 10$, which gives $x - y = 10$ or $x - y = -10$.
3. $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ implies $\vert x \vert = 8$, which gives $x = 8$ or $x = -8$.
4. $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ implies $\vert y \vert = 8$, which gives $y = 8$ or $y = -8$.

By solving these equations, we find the vertices of the polygon:
(8,8), (8,-8), (-8,8), (-8,-8), (10,0), (-10,0), (0,10), (0,-10).

The polygon is a square with side length 16. The area of a square is side length squared, so the area of this polygon is $16^2 = 256$.
The answer is: $256$
