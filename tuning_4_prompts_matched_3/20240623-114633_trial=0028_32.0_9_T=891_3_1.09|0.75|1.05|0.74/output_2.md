Approach:


We need to find the number of positive integers $m$ for which the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has 4 distinct solutions. 

Let's consider the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$. The right side of the equation, $\frac{m}{100}$, is a positive number, and the left side of the equation, $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert$, is a positive number as well. 

The number of solutions to the equation will be 4 if and only if $\frac{m}{100}$ is strictly between 2 and 3. This is because the function $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert$ has a graph that "steps" from 0 to 1 at $x=1$, from 1 to 2 at $x=3$, from 2 to 1 at $x=5$, and from 1 to 0 at $x=7$. The value of $\frac{m}{100}$ determines the number of solutions. If $\frac{m}{100}$ is less than 1, there are no solutions. If it's 1, there is one solution. If it's between 1 and 2, there are two solutions. If it's between 2 and 3, there are four solutions. If it's greater than 3, there are no solutions again.

Therefore, we need to find the number of positive integers $m$ such that $2 \cdot 100 < m < 3 \cdot 100$, or $200 < m < 300$. The number of such integers is $300 - 200 - 1 = 99$.

However, this is the number of integers in the open interval $(200, 300)$. We need to exclude the endpoints 200 and 300 because the equation has no solutions when $\frac{m}{100}$ is equal to 2 or 3. Therefore, the number of positive integers $m$ for which the equation has 4 distinct solutions is $99 - 2 = 97$.

The answer is: $97$

Approach:


We first need to analyze the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$.
This equation has 4 distinct solutions when $\frac{m}{100}$ is between 1 and 2.
This is because the expression inside the absolute value, $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert$, oscillates between 2 and -2 as $x$ varies.
So, we need to find the value of $m$ such that $\frac{m}{100}$ is between 1 and 2.
This means $1<\frac{m}{100}<2$.
Multiplying all sides by 100, we get $100<m<200$.
The positive integers $m$ that satisfy this inequality are the integers from 101 to 199.
Counting these integers, we find that there are $199-101+1=100$ such integers.
So, the number of positive integers $m$ for which the equation has 4 distinct solutions is 100. The answer is: 100

We need to find the number of positive integers $m$ for which the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has $4$ distinct solutions.

Let's analyze the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$.

The right side of the equation, $\frac{m}{100}$, is a positive value.

The left side of the equation, $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert$, is a positive value as well.

For the left side to be equal to a positive value, the expression inside the absolute value, $\vert x-1 \vert -2$, must be equal to $0$ or a negative value.

So, we have two cases:

1. $\vert x-1 \vert -2 = 0$. Solving this gives $\vert x-1 \vert = 2$, which means $x-1 = 2$ or $x-1 = -2$. This gives us $x = 3$ or $x = -1$.

2. $\vert x-1 \vert -2 < 0$. Solving this gives $\vert x-1 \vert < 2$, which means $-2 < x-1 < 2$. This gives us $-1 < x < 3$.

Now, let's consider the right side of the equation, $\frac{m}{100}$. For the equation to have 4 distinct solutions, the right side must be a value that splits the 4 regions formed by the solutions of the left side.

From the analysis above, we know that the solutions of the left side are $-1$, $1$, and $3$. This forms 4 regions: $x < -1$, $-1 < x < 1$, $1 < x < 3$, and $x > 3$.

The right side, $\frac{m}{100}$, must be a value that falls into the region $1 < x < 3$. This means $1 < \frac{m}{100} < 3$, or $100 < m < 300$.

The positive integers $m$ that satisfy this condition are the integers from $101$ to $299$, inclusive.

To find the number of these integers, we can subtract the smallest integer from the largest integer and add $1$: $299 - 101 + 1 = 199$.

So, there are $199$ positive integers $m$ for which the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has $4$ distinct solutions.

The answer is: $199$

Approach:



We start by analyzing the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$.

The equation has four distinct solutions when the right side $\frac{m}{100}$ is equal to $2$. This gives us the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=2$.

The equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=2$ can be solved as follows:

1. Split the absolute value: $\vert x-1 \vert -2 = 2$ or $\vert x-1 \vert -2 = -2$.

2. For the first equation, $\vert x-1 \vert = 4$, we get two cases: $x-1 = 4$ or $x-1 = -4$. This gives us $x = 5$ or $x = -3$.

3. For the second equation, $\vert x-1 \vert = 0$, we get $x = 1$.

So the four distinct solutions are $x = -3, 1, 5$.

This means that $m = 200$ since $\frac{m}{100} = 2$.

So, the only positive integer $m$ for which the equation has four distinct solutions is $200$.

Therefore, the number of positive integers $m$ for which the equation has four distinct solutions is $1$. The answer is: $1$

Approach:


The number of distinct solutions to the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ is equal to $4$ if and only if $\frac{m}{100}$ is strictly between $1$ and $2$, i.e., $1 < \frac{m}{100} < 2$. Multiplying all sides of the inequalities by $100$, we get $100 < m < 200$. The positive integers $m$ that satisfy this inequality are precisely the integers from $101$ to $199$, inclusive. To find the number of these integers, we can subtract the smallest integer from the largest and add $1$. Thus, the number of positive integers $m$ for which the equation has $4$ distinct solutions is $199 - 101 + 1 = 99$. The answer is: $99$

Approach:


We start by considering the equation \[\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}.\]
The right side of the equation is a positive number, so the number of distinct solutions will depend on the value of the right side.
For the left side of the equation, we know that the absolute value function $\vert \cdot \vert$ is always non-negative, and the expression inside the absolute value, $\vert x-1 \vert -2$, can be either positive or negative.
This gives us four possible cases to consider:
1. $\vert x-1 \vert -2 = \frac{m}{100}$
2. $\vert x-1 \vert -2 = -\frac{m}{100}$
3. $-\vert x-1 \vert +2 = \frac{m}{100}$
4. $-\vert x-1 \vert +2 = -\frac{m}{100}$

We will solve each case and count the number of distinct solutions for each case.
After solving the equations, we will sum up the number of distinct solutions from each case.

For each case, we need to find the values of $m$ that give us exactly 4 distinct solutions.
Finally, we will count the number of such values of $m$.

```python

from sympy import symbols, Abs, solveset, S

def count_solutions():
    x, m = symbols('x m')
    count = 0

    # Case 1: |x - 1| - 2 = m/100
    equation1 = Abs(x - 1) - 2 - m/100
    solutions1 = solveset(equation1, x, domain=S.Reals)

    # Case 2: |x - 1| - 2 = -m/100
    equation2 = Abs(x - 1) - 2 + m/100
    solutions2 = solveset(equation2, x, domain=S.Reals)

    # Case 3: -|x - 1| + 2 = m/100
    equation3 = -Abs(x - 1) + 2 - m/100
    solutions3 = solveset(equation3, x, domain=S.Reals)

    # Case 4: -|x - 1| + 2 = -m/100

    solutions4 = solveset(equation4, x, domain=S.Reals)

    # Count the number of distinct solutions for each case
    count += len(solutions1)
    count += len(solutions2)
    count += len(solutions3)
    count += len(solutions4)

    return count

result = count_solutions()
print(result)

It seems we made a mistake in our approach. The `len()` function is not applicable to sets of solutions from `solveset()` function. Instead, we need to count the number of distinct solutions manually for each case and sum them up.

Let's try again:

```python


INTERMEDIATE OUT :

from sympy import symbols, Abs, solveset, S, Eq

def count_solutions():
    x, m = symbols('x m')
    count = 0

    # Case 1: |x - 1| - 2 = m/100
    equation1 = Eq(Abs(x - 1) - 2, m/100)
    solutions1 = solveset(equation1, x, domain=S.Reals)
    count += len(solutions1)

    # Case 2: |x - 1| - 2 = -m/100
    equation2 = Eq(Abs(x - 1) - 2, -m/100)
    solutions2 = solveset(equation2, x, domain=S.Reals)
    count += len(solutions2)

    # Case 3: -|x - 1| + 2 = m/100
    equation3 = Eq(-Abs(x - 1) + 2, m/100)
    solutions3 = solveset(equation3, x, domain=S.Reals)
    count += len(solutions3)

    # Case 4: -|x - 1| + 2 = -m/100
    equation4 = Eq(-Abs(x - 1) + 2, -m/100)
    solutions4 = solveset(equation4, x, domain=S.Reals)
    count += len(solutions4)

    return count

result = count_solutions()
print(result)
```

CODE RESULTS Traceback: line 14, in count_solutions
    count += len(solutions1)
TypeError: object of type 'ConditionSet' has no len()

FAIL


INTERMEDIATE OUT :
```output

```

Again, we encounter the same error. The `len()` function is not applicable to sets of solutions from `solveset()` function. Instead, we need to count the number of distinct solutions manually for each case and sum them up.

Let's try a different approach:

For each case, we will find the values of $m$ that give us exactly 4 distinct solutions.

1. For Case 1, the equation $\vert x-1 \vert -2 = \frac{m}{100}$ has 4 distinct solutions when $0 \le m \le 200$.
2. For Case 2, the equation $\vert x-1 \vert -2 = -\frac{m}{100}$ has 4 distinct solutions when $0 \le m \le 200$.
3. For Case 3, the equation $-\vert x-1 \vert +2 = \frac{m}{100}$ has 4 distinct solutions when $0 \le m \le 200$.
4. For Case 4, the equation $-\vert x-1 \vert +2 = -\frac{m}{100}$ has 4 distinct solutions when $0 \le m \le 200$.

So, for each case, the number of values of $m$ that give us exactly 4 distinct solutions is $201$.

Since there are 4 cases, the total number of values of $m$ that give us exactly 4 distinct solutions is $4 \times 201 = 804$.

However, we need to find the number of positive integers $m$ that satisfy this condition. Since $m$ is a positive integer, the possible values of $m$ are from 1 to 200. Therefore, the number of positive integers $m$ that give us exactly 4 distinct solutions is $200$.

First, let's rewrite the equation \[\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}\] as \[\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=0.01m.\]

The equation \[\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=0\] has three solutions: $x=3$, $x=-1$.

The equation \[\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=0.01\] has five solutions.

Therefore, for the equation \[\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=0.01m\] to have four distinct solutions, $0.01m$ must be between $0$ and $0.01$. This means $m$ must be between $0$ and $100$.

The only positive integer value of $m$ in this range is $1$.

So, the equation \[\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}\] has $4$ distinct solutions only when $m=1$.

The answer is: $1$

We first observe that the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has $4$ distinct solutions if and only if $\frac{m}{100} = 2$. This is because the expression on the left side of the equation, $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert$, oscillates between $0$ and $4$ as $x$ varies over the real numbers, and it equals $2$ exactly twice. Therefore, we set $\frac{m}{100}$ equal to $2$ and solve for $m$.

First, we need to find the range of $m$ such that the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has 4 distinct solutions.

We know that the absolute value function $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert$ is a "V" shaped graph with the vertex at $x=1$. The value of the function at $x=1$ is $2$.

The equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ will have 4 distinct solutions when $\frac{m}{100}$ is less than $2$ but greater than $0$. This is because the "V" shaped graph will have 4 distinct solutions when the height of the "V" is greater than $\frac{m}{100}$ but less than or equal to $2$.

So, we have $0 < \frac{m}{100} \leq 2$.

Multiplying all sides of the inequalities by $100$, we get $0 < m \leq 200$.

Therefore, the positive integers $m$ that satisfy the condition are the integers from $1$ to $200$. To find the number of such integers, we simply subtract the smallest possible value of $m$ from the largest possible value of $m$ and then add $1$.

So, the number of positive integers $m$ that satisfy the condition is $200 - 1 + 1 = 200$.
The answer is: $200$

We start by noting that the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has $4$ distinct solutions if and only if $\frac{m}{100}$ is a positive number less than $2$ but greater than or equal to $0$. This is because the expression on the left side of the equation is always nonnegative and is at most $2$.

Therefore, we need to find the number of positive integers $m$ such that $0 \leq \frac{m}{100} < 2$.

Multiplying all sides of the inequalities by $100$, we get $0 \leq m < 200$.

The positive integers $m$ that satisfy this inequality are $1, 2, 3, \ldots, 199$.

We know that the equation $| |x-1|-2|=\frac{m}{100}$ has four distinct solutions. Let's consider the equation $|u-2|=\frac{m}{100}$, where $u = |x-1|$. This equation has two cases:

1. $u-2=\frac{m}{100}$ when $u \geq 2$, or
2. $2-u=\frac{m}{100}$ when $u < 2$.

In the first case, we have $u=2+\frac{m}{100}$. Substituting $u = |x-1|$, we get $|x-1|=2+\frac{m}{100}$. This equation has two sub-cases:

1.1. $x-1=2+\frac{m}{100}$ when $x \geq 1$, or
1.2. $1-x=2+\frac{m}{100}$ when $x < 1$.

For 1.1, we have $x=3+\frac{m}{100}$, and for 1.2, we have $x=-1+\frac{m}{100}$. These are the four solutions.

In the second case, we have $u=2-\frac{m}{100}$. Substituting $u = |x-1|$, we get $|x-1|=2-\frac{m}{100}$. This equation has two sub-cases:

2.1. $x-1=2-\frac{m}{100}$ when $x \geq 1$, or
2.2. $1-x=2-\frac{m}{100}$ when $x < 1$.

For 2.1, we have $x=1+\frac{m}{100}$, and for 2.2, we have $x=-1+\frac{2m}{100}$. These are the four solutions.

To have four distinct solutions, we must have $0 < \frac{m}{100} < 2$ and $0 < \frac{2m}{100} < 1$, which gives $0 < m < 200$. The positive integers $m$ that satisfy this condition are 1, 2, ..., 199. So the number of such $m$ is 199.
The answer is: $199$

Approach:


To have 4 distinct solutions, the right-hand side of the equation must be positive and less than 2.
So we have $0 < \frac{m}{100} < 2$, which simplifies to $0 < m < 200$.
The number of positive integers $m$ in this range is 199.

However, we must also ensure that the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has 4 distinct solutions.
We can analyze this by considering the number of changes in the sign of the expression inside the absolute value.
For $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$, there are 3 changes in the sign:
- When $x < 1$, the expression inside the absolute value is negative, so the absolute value makes it positive.
- When $1 \le x < 3$, the expression inside the absolute value is positive, so the absolute value does not change its value.
- When $x \ge 3$, the expression inside the absolute value is positive, so the absolute value makes it negative.

For the equation to have 4 distinct solutions, we need the right-hand side to be positive in the interval $1 < x < 3$.
This means that $2 - \frac{m}{100} > 0$, or $\frac{m}{100} < 2$. Combining this with the earlier condition $0 < \frac{m}{100} < 2$, we get $0 < \frac{m}{100} < 2$.

The number of positive integers $m$ that satisfy this condition is 199.

Therefore, the number of positive integers $m$ for which the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has 4 distinct solutions is 199.
The answer is: 199
