Approach:

 The equation $| |x-1| -2 | = \frac{m}{100}$ has 4 distinct solutions if and only if $\frac{m}{100} = 2$ or $\frac{m}{100} = 1$. This is because the expression $| |x-1| -2 |$ is a piecewise function that equals 2 or 1 (or 0 but that case is already covered by $\frac{m}{100} = 0$), and it equals 2 or 1 exactly 4 times. 

Now we can solve for $m$ in each case:
1. If $\frac{m}{100} = 2$, then $m = 200$.
2. If $\frac{m}{100} = 1$, then $m = 100$.

So, the only values of $m$ that give 4 distinct solutions are $100$ and $200$. Therefore, there are $2$ possible values of $m$. The answer is: $2$

Approach:


We can start by considering the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$. The right-hand side of the equation is a positive number, which implies that $m$ must be a positive integer. The number of distinct solutions to the equation depends on the value of $\frac{m}{100}$.

We can solve this problem by trying different values of $m$ and checking the number of distinct solutions for each case.

Case 1: $m=100$
In this case, we have $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=1$. This equation has 4 distinct solutions: $x=-1$, $x=3$, $x=5$, and $x=7$.

Case 2: $m=200$
In this case, we have $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=2$. This equation also has 4 distinct solutions: $x=-3$, $x=1$, $x=5$, and $x=9$.

Case 3: $m=300$
In this case, we have $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=3$. However, this equation does not have 4 distinct solutions. Instead, it has 2 distinct solutions: $x=-1$ and $x=7$.

Case 4: $m=400$
In this case, we have $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=4$. This equation also does not have 4 distinct solutions. Instead, it has 2 distinct solutions: $x=-3$ and $x=9$.

From these cases, we can see that the value of $m$ must be either $100$ or $200$ for the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ to have 4 distinct solutions.

Therefore, the number of positive integers $m$ that satisfy this condition is 2.

The answer is: $2$

Approach:



For the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ to have $4$ distinct solutions, $\frac{m}{100}$ must be $2$ (so that there will be cases of $x-1$ being positive and negative).

This gives us $m = 200$.

We need to check if this value of $m$ satisfies the conditions of the problem.

Python Script:

```python


INTERMEDIATE OUT :

def count_solutions():
    m = 200
    # Equation: | |x - 1| - 2 | = m / 100
    # For 4 distinct solutions, m / 100 must be 2
    if m / 100 == 2:
        return 1
    else:
        return 0

result = count_solutions()
print(result)
```

CODE RESULTS 1

INTERMEDIATE OUT :
```output

```
Since the value of $m$ that we found satisfies the conditions of the problem, the number of positive integers $m$ that the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has $4$ distinct solutions is $1$. The answer is: $1$

Approach:

 To find the number of positive integers $m$ for which the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has four distinct solutions, we need to understand the behavior of the equation. The expression on the left side of the equation, $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert$, is a piecewise function with four cases. The right side of the equation, $\frac{m}{100}$, is a positive number. The equation will have four distinct solutions when the right side of the equation equals the height of the piecewise function, which is 2. This happens when $\frac{m}{100}=2$, so $m=200$.

Therefore, the only positive integer $m$ for which the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has four distinct solutions is $200$. The answer is: $1$

Solve the following problem with a Python Script (positive numerical answer):

Approach:


We need to find the number of positive integers $m$ such that the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has $4$ distinct solutions.

First, let's consider the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$.

The expression $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert$ can take on a value of $\frac{m}{100}$ four times. That is, we want to find the number of positive integers $m$ for which the equation has $4$ distinct solutions.

We know that the absolute value function $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert$ has a graph that is V-shaped, with two "valleys" or minimum points, one at $x=3$ and the other at $x=-1$. The distance between the two minimum points is $4$, and the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ will have $4$ distinct solutions when $\frac{m}{100} \leq 2$.

This means that $m \leq 200$.

Now we need to find the number of positive integers $m$ less than or equal to $200$ such that $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has $4$ distinct solutions.

From the analysis above, we know that $m$ must be less than or equal to $200$ and also less than or equal to $200$ times the value of the absolute value function at the midpoint between the two minimum points, which is at $x=1$.

The value of $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert$ at $x=1$ is $2$. So $m$ must also be less than or equal to $200 \times 2 = 400$.

However, we are only interested in positive integers $m$, so we discard negative values. Therefore, the range of $m$ we are interested in is $1 \leq m \leq 200$.

Now we just need to count the number of positive integers in this range. The number of positive integers from $1$ to $200$ is simply $200$.

Therefore, the number of positive integers $m$ such that the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has $4$ distinct solutions is $200$. The answer is: $200$

Approach:


We will use a graphing approach to visualize the problem and find the value of $m$ that makes the equation have 4 distinct solutions.

The equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ can be thought of as two separate absolute value equations: $\vert x-1 \vert -2=\frac{m}{100}$ and $\vert x-1 \vert -2=-\frac{m}{100}$. 

For the first equation, $\vert x-1 \vert = 2+\frac{m}{100}$, the graph of $y = \vert x-1 \vert$ is a V-shape with the vertex at $(1, 0)$, and the graph of $y = 2+\frac{m}{100}$ is a horizontal line. The number of intersection points of the two graphs is equal to the number of solutions of the equation. The line $y = 2+\frac{m}{100}$ moves upwards as $m$ increases, and it will intersect the V-shape at four points when $2+\frac{m}{100}=2$, or $m=0$.

For the second equation, $\vert x-1 \vert = 2-\frac{m}{100}$, the graph of $y = \vert x-1 \vert$ is still a V-shape with the vertex at $(1, 0)$, and the graph of $y = 2-\frac{m}{100}$ is another horizontal line. This line moves downwards as $m$ increases, and it will intersect the V-shape at four points when $2-\frac{m}{100}=0$, or $m=200$.

Therefore, the only value of $m$ that makes the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ have 4 distinct solutions is $m=0$ or $m=200$. However, since the problem asks for positive integers $m$, the value of $m$ is 200. The answer is: $200$

Approach:



The equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has 4 distinct solutions when $\frac{m}{100} = 2$. This simplifies to $m = 200$. So, we need to find the number of positive integers $m$ that satisfy this equation.

Python Script:

Since $m = 200$ is the only value that makes the equation have 4 distinct solutions, there is only 1 such positive integer $m$.

The answer is: $1$.
