Solve the following problem with a Python Script (positive numerical answer):
"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"

Approach:

 The equation given is a product of two expressions equal to zero. This means that either one of the expressions is zero or both are zero. We can split this into two cases and solve them separately.

Case 1: $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$
This implies that $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. This means that $x + y = \pm 10$ and $x - y = \pm 10$. Solving these equations, we get four lines: $x + y = 10$, $x + y = -10$, $x - y = 10$, and $x - y = -10$. These lines form a square with side length 10. The area of this square is $10^2 = 100$.

Case 2: $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$
This implies that $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$. This means that $x = \pm 8$ and $y = \pm 8$. These lines form a square with side length 16. The area of this square is $16^2 = 256$.

However, the area of the convex polygon formed by the intersection of the two cases is the intersection of the two squares, which is a smaller square with side length 10 (since the side length of the first square is 10 and it's entirely contained within the second square with side length 16). The area of this square is indeed $10^2 = 100$.

So, the area of the convex polygon is 100. The answer is: $100$.

Solve the following problem with a Python Script (positive numerical answer):
"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"

Approach:


The equation $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ is satisfied when either of the factors is zero. This gives us two sets of equations to solve:

1. $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ and $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$.
2. $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ and $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$.

Solving these sets of equations gives us the vertices of the polygon:

For the first set:
$(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0 \Rightarrow \vert x + y \vert = 10 \Rightarrow x + y = \pm 10$.
$(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0 \Rightarrow \vert x \vert = 8 \Rightarrow x = \pm 8$.
From these, we have four vertices: $(8, 2), (8, -18), (-8, 2), (-8, -18)$.

For the second set:
$(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0 \Rightarrow \vert x - y \vert = 10 \Rightarrow x - y = \pm 10$.
$(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0 \Rightarrow \vert y \vert = 8 \Rightarrow y = \pm 8$.
From these, we have four vertices: $(2, 8), (-18, 8), (2, -8), (-18, -8)$.

The polygon is a square with side length 16 (the distance between any two adjacent vertices). The area of a square is side length squared, so the area of this square is $16^2 = 256$. The answer is: $\boxed{256}$.

Solve the following problem with a Python Script (positive numerical answer):
"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"

Approach:


The equation given is $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$.
This equation equals to zero when either of the two factors equals zero.
For the first factor to be zero, we have $\vert x + y \vert - 10 = 0$ and $\vert x - y \vert - 10 = 0$.
These equations simplify to $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$.
These are the equations of the lines $x + y = 10$, $x + y = -10$, $x - y = 10$, and $x - y = -10$.
For the second factor to be zero, we have $\vert x \vert - 8 = 0$ and $\vert y \vert - 8 = 0$.
These equations simplify to $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$.
These are the equations of the lines $x = 8$, $x = -8$, $y = 8$, and $y = -8$.
The lines form a square with side length 10, so the area of the square is $10^2 = 100$. The answer is: 100

Solve the following problem with a Python Script (positive numerical answer):
"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"

Assistant:

Approach:


The expression $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ is true if and only if either $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$. 
The first equation can only be true if $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$, which means that $x$ and $y$ are both either $5$ or $-5$. 
The second equation can only be true if $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$, which means that $x$ is in the interval $[-8, 8]$ and $y$ is in the interval $[-8, 8]$. 
Therefore, the points that satisfy the equation are either on the lines $x = 5$, $x = -5$, $y = 5$, or $y = -5$ (which form a square), or on the circle with radius $8$ centered at the origin (which forms a quarter of a circle).
To find the area of the convex polygon enclosed by these points, we can calculate the area of the square and add it to the area of the quarter of a circle.

The square has side length $10$, so its area is $10^2 = 100$.
The quarter of a circle has radius $8$, so its area is $(1/4) \pi (8^2) = 16\pi$.
Adding these two areas together, the area of the convex polygon is $100 + 16\pi$.
The answer is: $100+16\pi$

Solve the following problem with a Python Script (positive numerical answer):
"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"

Assistant:

Approach:



The given equation is $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$. The product of two numbers is zero if and only if at least one of the numbers is zero. This implies that either $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2) = 0$ or $((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$.

If $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2) = 0$, then $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$, which implies that $x + y = \pm 10$ and $x - y = \pm 10$. Solving these equations, we get the vertices of the square as $(5, 5), (5, -5), (-5, -5), (-5, 5)$.

If $((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$, then $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$, which implies that $x = \pm 8$ and $y = \pm 8$. Solving these equations, we get the vertices of the square as $(8, 8), (8, -8), (-8, -8), (-8, 8)$.

The combined set of vertices of the convex polygon is $(5, 5), (5, -5), (-5, -5), (-5, 5), (8, 8), (8, -8), (-8, -8), (-8, 8)$. This forms a square with side length $10$. The area of a square is given by the square of the length of its side, so the area of the square is $10^2 = 100$.
The answer is: 100

Solve the following problem with a Python Script (positive numerical answer):
"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"

Approach:


The expression $A \cdot B = 0$ means that either $A = 0$ or $B = 0$. In this case, the equation $ ((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ implies that either $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$.

The equation $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ implies that $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. This is only possible when $x = y = 5$ or $x = -y = -5$. So, we have two lines $x = y$ and $x = -y$.

The equation $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ implies that $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$. This is only possible when $x = 8$ or $x = -8$ and $y = 8$ or $y = -8$. So, we have four lines $x = 8$, $x = -8$, $y = 8$, and $y = -8$.

The area of the convex polygon formed by these lines can be calculated as follows:

- The polygon is a square with side length 10 units (from the points $(5, 5)$, $(5, -5)$, $(-5, -5)$, and $(-5, 5)$).
- The area of the square is $10^2 = 100$ square units.

The answer is: $\boxed{100}$
