Approach:

 To solve this problem, we need to find the number of positive integers $m$ such that the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has four distinct solutions.

Firstly, we notice that the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ involves absolute values, which makes it a bit complicated to solve directly. However, by setting $\frac{m}{100}=k$ (where $k$ is a positive constant), we can rewrite the equation as $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=k$. The solutions to this equation are the intersections of the graph of $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=k$ with the x-axis.

We know that the graph of $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=k$ consists of a "triangular wave" function. The number of intersections with the x-axis is equal to the number of "ups and downs" of the wave.

We can see that the wave has four ups and downs if and only if $k=1$, because for $k<1$, the wave does not touch the x-axis, and for $k>1$, the wave touches the x-axis at 5 points instead of 4.

So we need to find the value of $m$ such that $\frac{m}{100}=1$. We solve for $m$ by multiplying both sides of the equation $\frac{m}{100}=1$ by $100$, and we find $m=100$.

Since we are looking for the number of positive integers $m$ that satisfy the condition, there is only one positive integer $m$ that works, which is $100$. Therefore, there is only one such positive integer $m$.
The answer is: 1

Approach:

 For the equation to have 4 distinct solutions, the right hand side of the equation must fall between the two “bends” of the absolute value function on the left hand side. So we want $\frac{m}{100}$ to fall strictly between $1$ and $3$. This gives us the inequality $1 < \frac{m}{100} < 3$. We can rewrite this inequality as $100 < m < 300$.
Now we need to count the positive integers from $100$ to $300$ (exclusive). We can find this by subtracting the smallest integer (exclusive) from the largest integer (exclusive) and adding 1.
This gives us $300 - 100 - 1 = 199$. Therefore there are $199$ positive integers $m$ for which the equation has four distinct solutions.
```python


INTERMEDIATE OUT :

def count_positive_integers():
    lower_bound = 100
    upper_bound = 300
    count = upper_bound - lower_bound - 1
    return count

count = count_positive_integers()
print(count)
```

CODE RESULTS 199

INTERMEDIATE OUT :
```output
199
```

The number of positive integers $m$ for which the equation has four distinct solutions is $199$.
The answer is: $199$.

Approach:

 To find the number of positive integers m for which the equation $| |x - 1| - 2| = \frac{m}{100}$ has 4 distinct solutions,
we first analyze the conditions that make the absolute value equation have 4 distinct solutions.
We know that the expression $|x - 1| - 2 = y$ with $-y \leq \frac{m}{100} \leq y$ can have 4 distinct solutions if and only if:
\[ y - \frac{m}{100} < 2 \quad \text{and} \quad 2 - y < \frac{m}{100}.\]This gives $y < 2 + \frac{m}{100}$ and $y > 2 - \frac{m}{100}$. Since $|x - 1| - 2 = y$ has solutions, $|x - 1| = y + 2$. This has four distinct solutions if and only if $0 < y + 2 < 4$,
or $-2 < y < 2$.

Putting all these conditions together, we have $-2 < \frac{m}{100} < 2 - \frac{m}{100}$.
Multiplying all parts of the inequalities by $100$, we get $-200 < m < 200 - m$, or $m < 100$. So the possible values for $m$ are the positive integers from 1 to 99,
which is a total of 99 integers.The answer is: 99

Approach:

 For this problem, we need to find the number of positive integers $m$ such that the equation $| |x-1| - 2 | = \frac{m}{100}$ has 4 distinct solutions.

Step 1: Analyze the equation $| |x-1| - 2 | = \frac{m}{100}$.
This equation represents a piecewise function with four different cases based on the absolute value:
1. For $x - 1 \geq 2$, we have $|x - 1 - 2| = |x - 3| = \frac{m}{100}$, which simplifies to $x - 3 = \pm \frac{m}{100}$. The two solutions are $x = 3 \pm \frac{m}{100}$.
2. For $1 < x - 1 < 2$, we have $|x - 1 - 2| = |-x + 3| = \frac{m}{100}$, which simplifies to $-x + 3 = \pm \frac{m}{100}$. The two solutions are $x = 3 \mp \frac{m}{100}$.
3. For $x - 1 \leq 1$, we have $| - (x - 1) - 2 | = |-x - 1| = \frac{m}{100}$, which simplifies to $-x - 1 = \pm \frac{m}{100}$. The two solutions are $x = -1 \mp \frac{m}{100}$.

Step 2: Consider the number of solutions.
We want the equation to have 4 distinct solutions. This occurs when the "distance" between the two positive solutions (from the first case) and the two negative solutions (from the third case) is $\frac{m}{100}$.
That is, we want $3 + \frac{m}{100} - ( - 1 + \frac{m}{100}) = 4$, which simplifies to $\frac{2m}{100} = 4$, or $m = 200$.

Therefore, there is only one value of $m$, namely $200$, such that the equation $| |x-1| - 2 | = \frac{m}{100}$ has 4 distinct solutions.
The answer is: $\boxed{1}$.

Assistant:

Approach:


We start by trying to understand the number of distinct solutions of the given equation. We notice that the equation is a piecewise linear function, which can take on the form of "V" or "∨" depending on the value of $m$. Specifically, the graph of the function $| |x - 1| - 2 |$ consists of a "V" shape composed of two line segments, with the top of the "V" located at $x = 1$. Each vertical line of the "V" has a height of 2, and the "V" is centered around $x = 1$. The equation $| |x - 1| - 2 | = \frac{m}{100}$ therefore has four distinct solutions when $\frac{m}{100}$ is equal to the height of one of the "V"s. That height is 2, so we must have $\frac{m}{100} = 2$, from which we can solve for $m$.


Solution:
From $\frac{m}{100} = 2$, we multiply both sides by 100 to find that $m = 200$. However, we must check that this value indeed results in 4 distinct solutions. To do this, we substitute $\frac{m}{100}$ with 2 in the equation and solve for $x$. The equation then becomes:

$$| |x - 1| - 2 | = 2$$

This can be further simplified into two cases:
Case 1: $|x - 1| - 2 = 2 \Rightarrow |x - 1| = 4$
Case 2: $|x - 1| - 2 = -2 \Rightarrow |x - 1| = 0$

Solving the two cases gives us the four distinct solutions:
For Case 1, $|x - 1| = 4$ has two solutions: $x - 1 = 4 \Rightarrow x = 5$ and $x - 1 = -4 \Rightarrow x = -3$.
For Case 2, $|x - 1| = 0$ has one solution: $x - 1 = 0 \Rightarrow x = 1$.

So indeed, $m = 200$ is the value that gives us 4 distinct solutions, and the answer is $\boxed{200}$.

Approach:



1. First, we notice that the absolute value expression on the left hand side makes the equation piecewise linear. The graph of the function $|\vert x-1 \vert -2|$ will be a "V" shape with the bottoms of the "V"s at $x=1 \pm 2$, and the "V" opens upwards.
2. The right hand side of the equation is $\frac{m}{100}$, a straight line parallel to the x-axis. As $m$ increases, this line moves upwards.
3. We can visualize that the equation has 4 distinct solutions when the line just touches the second "V" but doesn't intersect the first one. This occurs when $\frac{m}{100} = 2$, so $m=200$.

The value of $m$ for which the equation has 4 distinct solutions is $200$.
The answer is: $1$

Solve the following problem with a Python Script (positive numerical answer):

Approach:

 The absolute value equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ having 4 distinct solutions, suggests that the equation inside the absolute value, i.e., $\vert x-1 \vert -2=\pm\frac{m}{100}$. Now, let's analyze the two cases separately:

Case 1: $\vert x-1 \vert -2=\frac{m}{100}$ 
This gives $\vert x-1 \vert = 2+\frac{m}{100}$. 
As the LHS is absolute value, it implies two possibilities:
$x-1 = 2+\frac{m}{100}$ or $x-1 = -(2+\frac{m}{100})$.
So, we get two branches of solutions for this case.

Case 2: $\vert x-1 \vert -2=-\frac{m}{100}$
This gives $\vert x-1 \vert = 2-\frac{m}{100}$. 
Similar to case 1, we have two branches of solutions for this case as well.

Combining all the branches, we have 4 distinct solutions, if the absolute value equations within each branch have solutions. The solutions exist only if the right hand side is non-negative.

So, for case 1: $2+\frac{m}{100} \ge 0$ which gives $m \ge -200$ and for case 2: $2-\frac{m}{100} \ge 0$ which gives $m \le 200$.

Taking the intersection of the two, we get the valid range for $m$ to provide 4 distinct solutions: $-200 \le m \le 200$.

However, the question asks for positive integers $m$, so our solution space is reduced to $1 \le m \le 200$. 

The integer values of $m$ in this range for which the given absolute value equation has 4 distinct real solutions are: 100, 200. 

So, the positive integer values of $m$ for which the given equation has 4 distinct solutions are 1 and 2, and the answer is: $\boxed{2}$.

The answer is: 2.

Approach:

 We are tasked with finding the number of positive integer solutions $m$ for which the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has $4$ distinct solutions.

First, let's understand the equation. The equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ can be thought of as a piecewise function where the right-hand side is a vertical shift of the graph of $y = |x-1|$ two units downwards. The absolute values in the equation makes the function piecewise; its value inside any of the pieces changes only at the points where the expression inside the absolute value is zero or undefined.

Second, consider that the equation has $4$ distinct solutions. This means that the right-hand side of the equation, $\frac{m}{100}$, must equal to $2$ four times in the graph.

Let's look at each case:

If $\frac{m}{100}=2$, then $m=200$. In this case, the graph of $y = | |x-1| -2|$ intersects the graph of $y=\frac{m}{100}=2$ at $4$ distinct points, which satisfy the requirement. 

Thus, there is $1$ solution for $m$, and the answer is: $1$.
The answer is: $1$
