Approach:

 The given equation is in the form of a product of two expressions equals zero. Therefore, either one of the expressions must be zero for the entire equation to be true. This gives us two sets of equations to solve. 

Firstly, we have:
\[(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0\]
\[(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0\]
\[(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0\]
\[(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0\]

From the first two equations, we have $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. This implies that $x + y = \pm 10$ and $x - y = \pm 10$. 
From the last two equations, we have $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$. This implies that $x = \pm 8$ and $y = \pm 8$. 

Combining the results, we have the following four points which satisfy the given equation: $(8,8)$, $(-8,8)$, $(-8,-8)$, and $(8,-8)$. 

Plotting these points on a coordinate plane, we can see that they form a square with side length 16. The area of this square is $16^2 = 256$.

Therefore, the area of the convex polygon is 256. The answer is: $256$

Solve the following problem with a Python Script (positive numerical answer):
"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"

Approach:



The equation given is $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + (\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + (\vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$. 

This equation is satisfied if either of the two factors is zero. The first factor is zero if $\vert x + y \vert - 10 = 0$ and $\vert x - y \vert - 10 = 0$, which simplifies to $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. The second factor is zero if $\vert x \vert - 8 = 0$ and $\vert y \vert - 8 = 0$, which simplifies to $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$.

From $\vert x + y \vert = 10$, we get $x + y = \pm 10$ or $x + y = -\left(\pm 10\right) = \mp 10$. Similarly, from $\vert x - y \vert = 10$, we get $x - y = \pm 10$ or $x - y = -\left(\pm 10\right) = \mp 10$.

So the four lines are $x + y = \pm 10$ and $x - y = \pm 10$. These lines form a square with side length $20$. So the area of the square is $20^2 = 400$. Therefore, the area of the convex polygon is $400$.
The answer is: $400$

Approach:



The equation is equal to zero when either of the factors inside the parentheses are equal to zero. Let's consider each of them separately.

1. $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$: This means that $\vert x + y \vert = 10$. This represents a square with side length 20. The vertices are at $(0, 10), (10, 0), (0, -10),$ and $(-10, 0)$.

2. $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$: This means that $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. This represents another square with side length 20. The vertices are at $(10, 0), (0, 10), (0, -10),$ and $(-10, 0)$.

3. $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$: This means that $\vert x \vert = 8$, which gives $x = 8$ or $x = -8$. This represents a rectangle with length 16 and width 16. The vertices are at $(8, 0), (8, 16), (-8, 0),$ and $(-8, -16)$.

4. $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$: This means that $\vert y \vert = 8$, which gives $y = 8$ or $y = -8$. This also represents a rectangle with length 16 and width 16. The vertices are at $(0, 8), (16, 8), (0, -8),$ and $(-16, -8)$.

By observing the coordinates of the vertices, we can see that the two squares overlap, and the convex polygon formed by the vertices of the rectangle is a square with side length 16. Therefore, the area of this square is $16^2 = 256$. The answer is: 256.

Approach:

 The given equation is a product of two terms equals zero. This means that either the first term equals zero or the second term equals zero.

1. The first term equals zero when $|x + y| - 10 = 0$ or $|x - y| - 10 = 0$. These two equations can be rewritten as $|x + y| = 10$ and $|x - y| = 10$. These are the equations of two lines passing through the origin with slopes $+1$ and $-1$.
2. The second term equals zero when $|x| - 8 = 0$ or $|y| - 8 = 0$. These two equations can be rewritten as $|x| = 8$ and $|y| = 8$. These are the equations of two lines parallel to the x and y axes respectively, passing through $8$ and $-8$ on the x and y axes.

Thus, the points that satisfy the given equation are the intersection points of these lines. These lines form a square with side length $16$ (since the distance from $-8$ to $8$ is $16$ on both the x and y axes).

The area of this square is $side^2 = 16^2 = 256$. The answer is: $256$

Approach:


The equation is satisfied only when either of the factors is equal to zero. This translates to four conditions:
1. $|x + y| - 10 = 0$ or $|x - y| - 10 = 0$
2. $|x| - 8 = 0$ or $|y| - 8 = 0$

Solving these, we find the vertices of the polygon:
1. For the first condition:
   - $|x + y| = 10$ gives vertices (0, 10), (0, -10), (10, 0) and (-10, 0)
   - $|x - y| = 10$ gives the same vertices
2. For the second condition:
   - $|x| = 8$ gives vertices (8, 0) and (-8, 0)
   - $|y| = 8$ gives vertices (0, 8) and (0, -8)

Combining all the vertices, we get a rectangle with length 16 and width 20. Area of a rectangle is simply the product of its length and width, so Area = 16 * 20 = 320 square units. The answer is: $320$

Approach:



The given equation is the product of two functions equal to zero, so each function must be zero for the product to be zero. This means we have two cases to consider:
1. $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$
2. $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$

For the first case, both $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2$ and $( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2$ must be zero, which implies that $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. This is satisfied by the lines $x + y = 10$ and $x - y = 10$, as well as their opposites $x + y = -10$ and $x - y = -10$. 

For the second case, both $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2$ and $( \vert y \vert - 8)^2$ must be zero, which implies that $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$. This is satisfied by the lines $x = 8$ and $x = -8$ as well as $y = 8$ and $y = -8$.

The intersection of these lines form a square with side length of 10 units. The area of this square is $10^2 = 100$. So the area of the convex polygon is 100.
The answer is: $100$

Solve the following problem with a Python Script (positive numerical answer):
"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"

Approach:

 The equation gives us a product of two expressions equal to zero, this implies that at least one of the expressions should be zero. This means that either $ ((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2) = 0 $ or $ ((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$.

For the first equation to be zero, we must have $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. This gives us a square with side length 10, because the four lines defined by $x + y = \pm 10$ and $x - y = \pm 10$ intersect at four points, forming a square. The side of the square is 10 because the difference between the absolute values gives a distance of 10.

For the second equation to be zero, we must have $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$. This gives us a square with side length 8 because the four lines defined by $x = \pm 8$ and $y = \pm 8$ intersect at four points, forming a square. The side of the square is 8 because the absolute value gives a distance of 8.

The area of a square is given by the square of the length of its side. Therefore, the area of the first square is $10^2 = 100$, and the area of the second square is $8^2 = 64$.

To find the area of the convex polygon formed by the intersection of these two squares, we simply take the sum of their areas. Hence the area is $100 + 64 = 164$.

So the area of the convex polygon is 164. The answer is: $164$

Approach:

 The equation $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ is satisfied only when either of the two factors is zero. This translates to one of the following two cases:

1. $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$.

2. Both $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ and $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$.

For case 1, both expressions equaling zero implies that $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$ which imply that $x + y = \pm 10$ and $x - y = \pm 10$. Solving these equations, we get the vertices of the polygon as $(0, 10)$, $(0, -10)$, $(10, 0)$, $(-10, 0)$, $(8, 8)$, $(8, -8)$, $(-8, 8)$, and $(-8, -8)$.

For case 2, both expressions equaling zero implies that $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$. But this is not possible as $\vert x + y \vert \leq \vert x \vert + \vert y \vert = 16$, not 10.

So, we are left with the vertices of the polygon as $(0, 10)$, $(0, -10)$, $(10, 0)$, $(-10, 0)$, $(8, 8)$, $(8, -8)$, $(-8, 8)$, and $(-8, -8)$.

The polygon is an octagon with sides of length 8 and 10. To find its area, we can divide it into two rectangles and a square, as shown below:

[asy]
import graph;
size(4cm);
defaultpen(linewidth(0.5));
dot((0,10)--(0,-10)--(10,0)--(-10,0)--(8,8)--(8,-8)--(-8,8)--(-8,-8)--cycle);
draw((0,10)--(0,-10)--(10,0)--(-10,0)--cycle);
draw((8,8)--(8,-8)--(-8,8)--(-8,-8)--cycle);
draw((0,0)--(8,0)--(8,8),dashed);
draw((0,0)--(0,-10)--(0,-8)--(8,-8),dashed);
[/asy]

The square has side length 8 and area $8^2 = 64$. The rectangles have dimensions 10 by 8 and area $10 \times 8 = 80$. So, the total area of the octagon is $2 \times 80 + 64 = 224$.

Therefore, the area of the convex polygon is 224 square units.

The answer is: $224$

Approach:


The equality holds if and only if both terms are equal to zero. Therefore, we have two cases to consider:
1. $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ and $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$, which gives us $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$.
2. $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ and $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$, which gives us $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$.
From the first case, we have $x + y = \pm 10$ and $x - y = \pm 10$. Solving these four equations, we get four vertices of the polygon: $(8, 2)$, $(8, -2)$, $(-8, 2)$, and $(-8, -2)$.
From the second case, we have $x = \pm 8$ and $y = \pm 8$. This gives us another four vertices of the polygon: $(8, 8)$, $(-8, 8)$, $(8, -8)$, and $(-8, -8)$.
The convex polygon formed by these eight vertices is a square with side length $16$.

To find the area of the square, we simply square the length of its side:
Area = $16^2 = 256$.

So, the area of the convex polygon is 256 square units. The answer is: $\boxed{256}$
