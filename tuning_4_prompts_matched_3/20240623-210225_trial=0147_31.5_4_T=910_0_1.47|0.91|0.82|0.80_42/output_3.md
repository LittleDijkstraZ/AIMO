Below is a math problem you are to solve (positive numerical answer!):
"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"
Analyze this problem and think step by step to come to a solution with programs. After solving the problem, output the final numerical answer within \boxed{}.

 The given equation is equal to zero if and only if both of the factors are zero. That means either $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$.

If $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$, then both $\vert x + y \vert - 10 = 0$ and $\vert x - y \vert - 10 = 0$. So, $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. This means $x + y = \pm 10$ and $x - y = \pm 10$. Solving these equations gives us the vertices of the polygon: $(0,10)$, $(0,-10)$, $(10,0)$, and $(-10,0)$.

Similarly, if $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$, then both $\vert x \vert - 8 = 0$ and $\vert y \vert - 8 = 0$, which gives us $x = \pm 8$ and $y = \pm 8$. This gives us the vertices: $(8,8)$, $(8,-8)$, $(-8,8)$, and $(-8,-8)$.

Combining all these vertices, we can plot the polygon on a graph, which is a square with side length 10. The area of the square is $10 \times 10 = 100$. So, the area of the convex polygon is 100 square units. Therefore, the final numerical answer is $\boxed{100}$. The python code to calculate the area of the convex polygon is not needed because the problem is a theoretical one where we don't need computational power or software for calculation.

"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"

Assistant:

 The given equation is $0$, which is only possible when the terms inside the parentheses are zero. Therefore, we have:
- $|x + y| - 10 = 0 \implies |x + y| = 10$,
- $|x - y| - 10 = 0 \implies |x - y| = 10$,
- $|x| - 8 = 0 \implies |x| = 8$, and
- $|y| - 8 = 0 \implies |y| = 8$.

From $|x + y| = 10$ and $|x - y| = 10$, we can deduce that $x$ and $y$ must each be between $-8$ and $8$. This is because if either $|x|$ or $|y|$ is greater than $8$, at least one of the above conditions will be violated. Similarly, for the absolute values of $x$ and $y$ individually to be exactly $8$, the corresponding absolute value of the other variable must be $0$, which would also lead to a violation of the corresponding condition.

Therefore, the points that satisfy the conditions are all the points inside a square with side length $16$, i.e., the points $(x, y)$ such that $-8 \leq x, y \leq 8$. The area of this square is $16^2 = 256$. The answer is: $256$.

Below is a math problem you are to solve (positive numerical answer!):
"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"
Analyze this problem and think step by step to come to a solution with programs. After solving the problem, output the final numerical answer within \boxed{}.

Assistant:

 The given equation is:
\[((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0.\]
A product is zero if and only if one or both of its factors are zero. So this equation is satisfied if either of the following two conditions holds:
\[(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0, \text{ or }\]
\[(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0.\]
The first condition implies that $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. For this to be true, the four points are $(8, 8)$, $(8, -8)$, $(-8, 8)$, and $(-8, -8)$. These points form a square with side length $16$, so its area is $16^2 = 256$.
The second condition implies that $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$, which means the four points are $(8, 8)$, $(8, -8)$, $(-8, 8)$, and $(-8, -8)$, the same points as in the first condition.
So the only possible points satisfying the equation are the four points mentioned above, which form a square with side length $16$. Therefore, the area of this square is $256$. So the numerical answer is $256$.

Assistant:

 The equation $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ implies that either $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$. The first equation implies that $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$, which are four lines in the coordinate plane: $x + y = 10$, $x + y = -10$, $x - y = 10$, and $x - y = -10$. The second equation implies that $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$, which are four lines: $x = 8$, $x = -8$, $y = 8$, and $y = -8$.
The solution set of this system of equations is the intersection of these eight lines, which forms a square with side length 16. Thus, the area of the square is $16^2 = \boxed{256}$.

def square_area():

The area of the convex polygon is $256$ square units.
The answer is $\boxed{256}$.
