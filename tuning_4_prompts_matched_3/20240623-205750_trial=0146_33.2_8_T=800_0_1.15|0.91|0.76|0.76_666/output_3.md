Below is a math problem you are to solve (positive numerical answer!):
"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"
Analyze this problem and think step by step to come to a solution with programs. After solving the problem, output the final numerical answer within \boxed{}.

 The equation $ab=0$ is equivalent to $a=0$ or $b=0$. Therefore, the given equation is equivalent to
$$((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2) = 0$$
or
$$((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0.$$
The first equation implies $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$, which gives us the lines $x + y = \pm 10$ and $x - y = \pm 10$. These lines form a square with side length 20. The second equation implies $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$, which gives us the lines $x = \pm 8$ and $y = \pm 8$. These lines form a square with side length 16. However, the points that satisfy both equations are those that lie on the intersection of these two squares, which is the square with side length 16. The area of this square is $16^2 = 256$. The answer is: $256$

Below is a math problem you are to solve (positive numerical answer!):
"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"

First, let's examine the given equation:
$$((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$$

If the product of two numbers is zero, then either one of the numbers is zero. So, we have two cases:
1. $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$.
2. $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$.

For the first case, we have $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ or $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. These equations represent two pairs of parallel lines, each pair with a distance of 10 units from the origin.

For the second case, we have $\vert x \vert = 8$ or $\vert y \vert = 8$. These equations represent four lines, two parallel to the x-axis (at y = 8 and y = -8) and two parallel to the y-axis (at x = 8 and x = -8).

The intersection of these lines form a square with side length of 16 units. Therefore, the area of this square is $16^2 = 256$ square units.

So, the area of the convex polygon formed by the points satisfying the given equation is 256 square units. The answer is: $\boxed{256}$.

Analyze this problem and think step by step to come to a solution with programs. After solving the problem, output the final numerical answer within \boxed{}.

Assistant:

 The equation given is $0$, which means that either the first term or the second term is $0$. If the first term is $0$, then either $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ or $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. This represents two lines parallel to the x-axis and y-axis respectively, which are 10 units away from the origin. If the second term is $0$, then either $\vert x \vert = 8$ or $\vert y \vert = 8$, which represent two lines parallel to the y-axis and x-axis respectively, which are 8 units away from the origin. These lines enclose a square with side length of 16 units. Therefore, the area of the convex polygon is the area of this square, which is $16^2 = 256$.
