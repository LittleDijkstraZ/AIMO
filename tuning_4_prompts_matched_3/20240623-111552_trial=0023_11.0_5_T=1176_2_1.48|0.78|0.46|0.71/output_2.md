Question (hint: positive numerical answer):
"For how many positive integers $m$ does the equation \[\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}\] have $4$ distinct solutions?"
Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:


To find the number of positive integers $m$ for which the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has 4 distinct solutions,
we need to understand the behavior of the function $f(x) = \vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert$.
The function $f(x)$ has four distinct "steps" in its graph, each of which is a horizontal line segment with a height of $\frac{1}{100}$.
To have four distinct solutions, the height of the "steps" must be equal to $\frac{m}{100}$.
So, we need to find the number of positive integers $m$ such that $0 < m \leq 100$ and $m$ is a multiple of $1$.
Since there are 100 positive integers between 0 and 100, and all of them are multiples of 1,
the number of positive integers $m$ for which the equation has 4 distinct solutions is 100.
Therefore, the number of positive integers $m$ that satisfy the given condition is 100.
The value of $m$ is therefore any integer from 1 to 100, inclusive. The answer is: 100

Question (hint: positive numerical answer):
"For how many positive integers $m$ does the equation \[\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}\] have $4$ distinct solutions?"
Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:


The equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has 4 distinct solutions if and only if $\frac{m}{100}$ is between 1 and 2 (exclusive). This is because the function $f(x) = \vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert$ has a graph that is a V-shape with two "teeth", each of width 1 unit, with the "bottom" of the V being at $y=1$. Thus, for the equation $f(x) = \frac{m}{100}$ to have 4 distinct solutions, $\frac{m}{100}$ must be strictly greater than 0 and strictly less than 2.

This can be written as the inequality $0 < \frac{m}{100} < 2$. To solve this inequality for $m$, we can first multiply all sides by 100 to get rid of the fraction: $0 < m < 200$. This inequality tells us that $m$ must be a positive integer that is less than 200.

But we also know that $m$ must be a divisor of 200. This is because if we consider the original equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$, the right side is a positive constant, so the left side, which is a function of $x$, must also be a constant. That is, the equation is essentially asking how many times the function $f(x)$ takes on the constant value $\frac{m}{100}$. This can only happen if $\frac{m}{100}$ is a value that the function takes on, and the function takes on every value between 1 and 2 exactly once, as it's a V-shaped function with a width of 1 unit.

Therefore, the positive integers $m$ that are divisors of 200 but less than 200 are the solutions to the problem. The divisors of 200 are 1, 2, 4, 5, 8, 10, 20, 25, 40, 50, 100, and 200. Among these, the ones that are less than 200 are 1, 2, 4, 5, 8, 10, 20, 25, 40, 50, 100. There are 11 such numbers. So the number of positive integers $m$ that satisfy the given conditions is 11. The answer is: $11$

Question (hint: positive numerical answer):
"For how many positive integers $m$ does the equation \[\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}\] have $4$ distinct solutions?"
Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:


The equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has $4$ distinct solutions means that the expression inside the absolute value, $\vert x-1 \vert -2$, must be equal to either $\frac{m}{100}$ or $-\frac{m}{100}$.
So we have two equations: $\vert x-1 \vert -2 = \frac{m}{100}$ and $\vert x-1 \vert -2 = -\frac{m}{100}$.
Solving each equation separately:
1) $\vert x-1 \vert -2 = \frac{m}{100}$:
$\vert x-1 \vert = \frac{m}{100} + 2$,
$x-1 = \frac{m}{100} + 2$ or $x-1 = -(\frac{m}{100} + 2)$,
$x = \frac{m}{100} + 3$ or $x = 1 - \frac{m}{100} - 2 = 1 - \frac{m}{100} - 2 = - \frac{m}{100} - 1$.
2) $\vert x-1 \vert -2 = -\frac{m}{100}$:
$\vert x-1 \vert = 2 - \frac{m}{100}$,
$x-1 = 2 - \frac{m}{100}$ or $x-1 = -(2 - \frac{m}{100})$,
$x = 3 - \frac{m}{100}$ or $x = \frac{m}{100} - 1$.
For the equation $\vert x-1 \vert -2 = \frac{m}{100}$ to have $2$ distinct solutions, the value of $\frac{m}{100} + 2$ must be positive, which implies $\frac{m}{100} > -2$, so $m > -200$ (but we are only interested in positive integers $m$, so we ignore this condition). The value of $- \frac{m}{100} - 1$ must be negative, which implies $- \frac{m}{100} < -1$, so $m > 100$.
For the equation $\vert x-1 \vert -2 = -\frac{m}{100}$ to have $2$ distinct solutions, the value of $2 - \frac{m}{100}$ must be positive, which implies $2 - \frac{m}{100} > 0$, so $m < 200$. The value of $\frac{m}{100} - 1$ must be negative, which implies $\frac{m}{100} < 1$, so $m < 100$.
Therefore, the values of $m$ that satisfy both equations are those in the range $100 < m < 200$. The number of positive integers in this range is $100$. So the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has $4$ distinct solutions for $100$ values of $m$.
The value of $m$ for which the equation has $4$ distinct solutions is $100$. The answer is: $1$

Question (hint: positive numerical answer):
"For how many positive integers $m$ does the equation \[\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}\] have $4$ distinct solutions?"
Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:


The equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has 4 distinct solutions,
which means the expression inside the absolute value, $\vert x-1 \vert -2$, must switch from positive to negative exactly 3 times as $x$ varies over the real numbers.
This means the expression $\vert x-1 \vert -2$ must cross the x-axis 3 times.
The expression $\vert x-1 \vert -2$ is equal to 0 when $\vert x-1 \vert =2$.
This occurs when $x-1=2$ or $x-1=-2$, so $x=3$ or $x=-1$.
Between $-1$ and $3$, the expression $\vert x-1 \vert -2$ changes sign.
Therefore, the value of $\frac{m}{100}$ must be the difference between the values of the expression at $x=-1$ and $x=3$.
Evaluating the expression at $x=-1$, we have $\vert -1-1 \vert -2 = \vert -2 \vert -2 = 2-2=0$.
Evaluating the expression at $x=3$, we have $\vert 3-1 \vert -2 = \vert 2 \vert -2 = 2-2=0$.
So the value of $\frac{m}{100}$ must be the difference between these two values, which is 0.
However, we know that the value of $\frac{m}{100}$ must be positive, so this cannot be the case.
We must have made an error in our reasoning.
Let's reconsider the number of times the expression $\vert x-1 \vert -2$ changes sign.
It changes sign twice at $x=-1$ and $x=3$, but between these points the expression does not change sign.
To get 4 distinct solutions, the expression $\vert x-1 \vert -2$ must cross the x-axis twice more.
This can happen if the expression $\vert x-1 \vert -2$ is equal to 0 at two other points where it is changing from positive to negative.
The expression $\vert x-1 \vert -2$ is equal to 0 when $\vert x-1 \vert =2$.
Solving this equation, we find $x=3$ or $x=-1$.
To get two more points where the expression changes from positive to negative, we need to choose values of $x$ that are between $-1$ and $3$ and not equal to 0.
We can choose $x=0$, which gives $\vert 0-1 \vert -2 = \vert -1 \vert -2 = 1-2=-1$.
Therefore, the value of $\frac{m}{100}$ must be the difference between the values of the expression at $x=0$ and any of the other two points.
Evaluating the expression at $x=0$, we have $\vert 0-1 \vert -2 = \vert -1 \vert -2 = 1-2=-1$.
Evaluating the expression at one of the other two points, we have $\vert x-1 \vert -2$.
Since $\vert x-1 \vert -2$ changes sign at $x=-1$ and $x=3$, let's choose $x=2$, which gives $\vert 2-1 \vert -2 = \vert 1 \vert -2 = 1-2=-1$.
Therefore, the value of $\frac{m}{100}$ must be the difference between $-1$ and $-1$, which is 0.
However, we know that the value of $\frac{m}{100}$ must be positive, so this cannot be the case.
We must have made another error in our reasoning.
Let's reconsider the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$.
The left side of the equation changes sign at $x=-1$, $x=1$, and $x=3$.
To get 4 distinct solutions, the right side of the equation, $\frac{m}{100}$, must be equal to the difference between the values of the left side at these points.
Evaluating the left side at $x=-1$, we have $\vert \vert -1-1 \vert -2 \vert = \vert \vert -2 \vert -2 \vert = \vert 2-2 \vert = 0$.
Evaluating the left side at $x=1$, we have $\vert \vert 1-1 \vert -2 \vert = \vert \vert 0 \vert -2 \vert = \vert 0-2 \vert = 2$.
Evaluating the left side at $x=3$, we have $\vert \vert 3-1 \vert -2 \vert = \vert \vert 2 \vert -2 \vert = \vert 2-2 \vert = 0$.
Therefore, the value of $\frac{m}{100}$ must be the difference between 2 and 0, which is 2.
To find the value of $m$, we multiply $\frac{m}{100}$ by 100 to get $m=200$.
Therefore, there is only 1 positive integer value of $m$ that makes the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ have 4 distinct solutions.
The value of $m$ is 200.
The answer is: 1

Question (hint: positive numerical answer):
"For how many positive integers $m$ does the equation \[\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}\] have $4$ distinct solutions?"
Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:


To find the number of positive integers $m$ for which the equation \[\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}\] has $4$ distinct solutions, we first need to understand the graph of the function $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert$.
The function $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert$ is a "V" shape graph with the "bottom" of the "V" at $x=1$.
The value of the function is $2$ when $x<1$, $0$ when $1\leq x \leq 3$, and $2$ again when $x>3$.
So the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has $4$ distinct solutions when $\frac{m}{100}$ is equal to $0$, $2$, or any value between $0$ and $2$.
When $\frac{m}{100}=0$, we have $m=0$, but $m$ must be a positive integer, so we disregard this case.
When $\frac{m}{100}=2$, we have $m=200$.
For any value of $m$ such that $0<\frac{m}{100}<2$, we have $0<m<200$. Since $m$ is an integer, the number of possible values of $m$ in this range is $199$.
So the number of positive integers $m$ for which the equation has $4$ distinct solutions is $199+1=200$. The answer is: $200$

Question (hint: positive numerical answer):
"For how many positive integers $m$ does the equation \[\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}\] have $4$ distinct solutions?"
Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:


The equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has $4$ distinct solutions.
The right-hand side of the equation is always positive, so the left-hand side must also be positive.
This means that $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert > 0$.
The absolute value function $\vert x \vert$ is equal to $x$ if $x \ge 0$ and $-x$ if $x < 0$.
So, we have $\vert x-1 \vert -2 > 0$ or $\vert x-1 \vert -2 < 0$.
For the first case, $\vert x-1 \vert > 2$.
This means that $x-1 > 2$ or $x-1 < -2$.
Simplifying these inequalities, we get $x > 3$ or $x < -1$.
For the second case, $\vert x-1 \vert < 2$.
This means that $-2 < x-1 < 2$.
Adding $1$ to all sides of the inequalities, we get $-1 < x < 3$.
So, the solutions to the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ with $4$ distinct solutions are $x < -1$, $-1 < x < 1$, $1 < x < 3$, and $x > 3$.
To count the number of positive integers $m$ for which the equation has $4$ distinct solutions, we need to find the possible values of $\frac{m}{100}$.
Since the absolute value of the left-hand side is equal to $\frac{m}{100}$, the possible values of $\frac{m}{100}$ must be between $0$ and $2$.
This means that $0 < \frac{m}{100} < 2$.
Multiplying all sides of the inequalities by $100$, we get $0 < m < 200$.
The positive integers $m$ in this range are $1, 2, 3, \dots, 199$.
However, we are only interested in the number of these integers that are less than or equal to $200$.
This number is $199$.
Therefore, the number of positive integers $m$ for which the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has $4$ distinct solutions is $199$. The answer is: $199$

Question (hint: positive numerical answer):
"For how many positive integers $m$ does the equation \[\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}\] have $4$ distinct solutions?"
Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:


To solve the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ having $4$ distinct solutions,
we first need to analyze the expression $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert$.
The absolute value function $\vert x-1 \vert$ makes the expression inside positive, so we have two cases:
Case 1: If $\vert x-1 \vert -2 > 0$, then $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert = \vert x-1 \vert -2$.
Case 2: If $\vert x-1 \vert -2 < 0$, then $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert = -( \vert x-1 \vert -2) = 2 - \vert x-1 \vert$.
So we need to solve the two equations separately:
Case 1: $\vert x-1 \vert -2 = \frac{m}{100}$. Adding $2$ to both sides, we get $\vert x-1 \vert = 2 + \frac{m}{100}$.
This implies that $x-1 = 2 + \frac{m}{100}$ or $x-1 = -(2 + \frac{m}{100})$.
Solving these two equations gives us $x = 3 + \frac{m}{100}$ or $x = -1 - \frac{m}{100}$.
Case 2: $2 - \vert x-1 \vert = \frac{m}{100}$. Subtracting $2$ from both sides, we get $-\vert x-1 \vert = -\frac{m}{100} + 2$.
Multiplying by $-1$ gives us $\vert x-1 \vert = \frac{m}{100} - 2$. This implies that $x-1 = \frac{m}{100} - 2$ or $x-1 = -( \frac{m}{100} - 2)$.
Solving these two equations gives us $x = 1 + \frac{m}{100} - 2 = \frac{m}{100} - 1$ or $x = 1 - (\frac{m}{100} - 2) = 3 - \frac{m}{100}$.
So the four distinct solutions are $3 + \frac{m}{100}$, $-1 - \frac{m}{100}$, $\frac{m}{100} - 1$, and $3 - \frac{m}{100}$.
These solutions are distinct if and only if the expressions $\frac{m}{100}$, $-1 - \frac{m}{100}$, and $\frac{m}{100} - 1$ are all different.
Simplifying, we get $-1 - \frac{m}{100} = -1 + \frac{m}{100}$, which is not possible, and $\frac{m}{100} - 1 = - \frac{m}{100}$ implies that $m=50$.
So the only value of $m$ that gives distinct solutions is $m=50$.
Therefore, there is only $1$ positive integer $m$ for which the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has $4$ distinct solutions.
The answer is: 1

Question (hint: positive numerical answer):
"For how many positive integers $m$ does the equation \[\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}\] have $4$ distinct solutions?"
Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:


The number of distinct solutions to the equation $| |x - 1| - 2 | = \frac{m}{100}$ is equal to 4 when $0 < \frac{m}{100} < 2$. This is because the function $| |x - 1| - 2 |$ has a graph that looks like a "V" shape, with its minimum value at $y = 0$ and its maximum value at $y = 2$. So for the equation to have 4 distinct solutions, the right hand side of the equation, $\frac{m}{100}$, must be strictly between 0 and 2. 
To find the values of $m$ that satisfy this inequality, we can multiply all sides of the inequality by $100$ to get $0 < m < 200$. 
The positive integers $m$ that satisfy this inequality are the integers from 1 to 199. 
So the number of such integers is $199$.
The answer is: 199
