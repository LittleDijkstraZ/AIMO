Below is a math problem you are to solve (positive numerical answer!):
"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"

The problem statement itself is a bit confusing, as it contains multiple "$\vert \cdot \vert$" symbols, which most likely denote absolute values. However, looking at the expression inside the product, it's clear that the only way for the product to be zero is if either of the factors is zero. 

We can therefore split the problem into two parts: find the points that satisfy $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2) = 0$ and the points that satisfy $((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$.

For the first equation, we have:
\[(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0.\]
This implies that $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. 
The only way this can happen is if $x + y = \pm 10$ and $x - y = \pm 10$. 
This gives us a square with side length 10, and thus an area of $10^2 = 100$.

For the second equation, we have:
\[(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0.\]
This implies that $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$. 
The only way this can happen is if $x = \pm 8$ and $y = \pm 8$. 
This gives us a square with side length 16, and thus an area of $16^2 = 256$.

However, the points that satisfy both equations simultaneously are the vertices of the smaller square, which are also vertices of the larger square. Therefore, the convex polygon formed by the points that satisfy the original equation is the smaller square.

Therefore, the area of the convex polygon is 100. The answer is: $100$

Below is a math problem you are to solve (positive numerical answer!):
"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"

The equation $AB = 0$ is equivalent to $A = 0$ or $B = 0$. Therefore, the given equation is equivalent to $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$, $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$, $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$, or $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$.
The first two equations imply $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. The absolute values can be removed if we consider all possible combinations of signs for $x$ and $y$. This gives us the four equations: $x + y = \pm 10$ and $x - y = \pm 10$.
The last two equations imply $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$, which again can be broken down into eight equations: $x = \pm 8$ and $y = \pm 8$.
Solving these equations, we find the vertices of the polygon: $(8,8)$, $(8,-8)$, $(-8,8)$, $(-8,-8)$, $(10,0)$, $(-10,0)$, $(0,10)$, and $(0,-10)$.
To find the area of the polygon, we can use the Shoelace Formula. The Shoelace Formula states that if the vertices of a polygon are $(x_1, y_1), (x_2, y_2), \dots, (x_n, y_n)$, then the area of the polygon is given by
$$\frac{1}{2} \left| (x_1y_2 + x_2y_3 + \dots + x_ny_1) - (y_1x_2 + y_2x_3 + \dots + y_nx_1) \right|.$$
Applying the Shoelace Formula to the eight vertices, we find the area to be $320$.
Therefore, the area of the convex polygon is $320$. The answer is: $320$

Below is a math problem you are to solve (positive numerical answer!):
"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"

 The equation given in the problem,
\[((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0,\]
implies that either of the two factors must be zero for the equation to hold. This gives us two cases to consider:

1. $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ and $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ and $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$.
2. $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ and $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ and $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$.

For the first case, we have $\vert x + y \vert = 10$, $\vert x \vert = 8$, and $\vert y \vert = 8$. This means $-10 \leq x + y \leq 10$, $-8 \leq x \leq 8$, and $-8 \leq y \leq 8$. The points satisfying these conditions form a rectangle with side lengths of 16 and 20. The area of this rectangle is $16 \times 20 = 320$.

For the second case, we have $\vert x - y \vert = 10$, $\vert x \vert = 8$, and $\vert y \vert = 8$. This means $-10 \leq x - y \leq 10$, $-8 \leq x \leq 8$, and $-8 \leq y \leq 8$. The points satisfying these conditions also form a rectangle with side lengths of 16 and 20. The area of this rectangle is also $16 \times 20 = 320$.

Since both cases result in the same area, the area of the convex polygon formed by the points satisfying the given equation is $320$. The answer is: $320$.

 This problem is asking for the area of a convex polygon that is formed by the points that satisfy the given equation.

First, let's look at the equation: $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$.

The product of two numbers is zero if and only if at least one of the numbers is zero. This means that either $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$.

If $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$, then both $\vert x + y \vert - 10 = 0$ and $\vert x - y \vert - 10 = 0$, which means $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. This gives us the lines $x + y = 10$ and $x - y = 10$, or $x + y = -10$ and $x - y = -10$.

If $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$, then both $\vert x \vert - 8 = 0$ and $\vert y \vert - 8 = 0$, which means $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$. This gives us the lines $x = 8$ and $x = -8$, or $y = 8$ and $y = -8$.

Now, we can plot these lines and find the points of intersection. The polygon formed by these points will be a square with side length 16. The area of this square is $16^2 = 256$. Therefore, the area of the convex polygon is 256.

Assistant:

 The given equation is a product of two terms equal to zero. This means that either the first term is zero or the second term is zero. 

For the first term to be zero, either $\vert x + y \vert - 10 = 0$ or $\vert x - y \vert - 10 = 0$. This gives us $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ or $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. These are equations of two perpendicular lines.

For the second term to be zero, either $\vert x \vert - 8 = 0$ or $\vert y \vert - 8 = 0$. This gives us $\vert x \vert = 8$ or $\vert y \vert = 8$. These are equations of two vertical lines and two horizontal lines.

The four lines intersect at the points $(8, 8)$, $(-8, 8)$, $(8, -8)$, and $(-8, -8)$. These four points form a square with side length 16. 

To find the area of the square, we simply square the length of one of its sides: $16^2 = 256$.

Therefore, the area of the convex polygon is 256 square units. The answer is: $256$.

The equation $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + (\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ implies that $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. The only way this can happen is if $x = y = \pm 10$ or $x = -y$. Similarly, $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + (\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ implies that $x = y = \pm 8$. Combining these two conditions, we find that the points satisfying the equation are $(\pm 10, \pm 10)$ and $(\pm 8, \pm 8)$. These points form a square with side length 20, so the area of the square is $20^2 = 400$. Therefore, the area of the convex polygon is 400.

```python

This problem involves a mathematical equation and asks for the area of a polygon. The equation given is a product of two terms, one of which is a square, and the other of which is a product of two absolute value expressions.

The equation equals to zero if and only if either of the two terms equals to zero. This gives us four separate cases to consider:
1. $|x + y| - 10 = 0$, $|x - y| - 10 = 0$, $|x| - 8 = 0$, and $|y| - 8 = 0$.
2. $|x + y| - 10 = 0$ and $|x| - 8 = 0$ or $|y| - 8 = 0$.
3. $|x + y| - 10 = 0$ and $|x - y| - 10 = 0$ or $|x| - 8 = 0$ and $|y| - 8 = 0$.

By solving these cases, we find that the polygon is a square with side length 16. The area of a square is the side length squared, so the area of this square is $16^2 = 256$.
The answer is: 256.
