Interesting, let's analyze step by step:



1. We are given the function $f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$ and $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$. The goal is to find the value of $f(100)$.
2. We can start by plugging $n=1$ into the second equation to find a base case. We have $f(2)=2f(1)+1$.
3. Since this is a function from $\mathbb{N}$ to $\mathbb{N}$, we know that $f(1)$ is a positive integer. Let's assume $f(1) = k$. Then $f(2) = 2k + 1$.
4. We can substitute this into the first equation to get $f(f(f(1)))=f(f(k))=f(2k+1)=8*1-7=1$.
5. From the second equation, we have $f(2k+1)=2f(k)+1$. So $2f(k)+1=1$. This implies $f(k)=0$. But this contradicts our assumption that $f(1) = k$ is a positive integer.
6. Therefore, we must have made an error in our reasoning. Let's try a different approach.

We know that $f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$, and $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$.

Let's set $n=1$ in the second equation, we have $f(2)=2f(1)+1$. Let's set $f(1)=k$, so we have $f(2)=2k+1$.

Now, substitute $n=2$ into the second equation, we have $f(4)=2f(2)+1=2(2k+1)+1=4k+3$.

Substitute $n=4$ into the first equation, we have $f(f(f(4)))=8*4-7=25$. We know that $f(f(f(4)))=f(f(2k+3))=f(4k+3)$.

But from the second equation, $f(4k+3)=2f(2k+1)+1=2(2f(k)+1)+1=4f(k)+4=4k+4$.

Equating the two expressions for $f(f(f(4)))$, we get $4k+4=25$, so $k=\frac{21}{4}$, which is not an integer.

So let's try a different approach. Let's start by plugging $n=1$ into the second equation to get $f(2)=2f(1)+1=2k+1$.

Now, plug $n=2$ into the first equation to get $f(f(f(2)))=8*2-7=9$. We know that $f(f(f(2)))=f(f(2k+1))=f(4k+2)$.

But from the second equation, $f(4k+2)=2f(2k)+1=2(2k+1)+1=4k+3$.

So we have $4k+3=9$, and solving for $k$ gives $k=1$. So we have found that $f(1)=1$, and consequently, $f(2)=3$.

Now we can continue this process to find $f(4)=7$, $f(8)=15$, and so on.

After some trial and error, we find that $f(100)=199$.

The value of $f(100)$ is $199$, which is a positive integer. The answer is:

$$199$$

Interesting, let's analyze step by step:



Step 1: We need to solve the equation $f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$. We don't have a direct formula for $f(n)$, but we can try to find some values for specific $n$. For example, we know that $f(f(f(1)))=f(0)=8*1-7=1$. From the equation $f(f(f(1)))=1$, we can find that $f(0)=1$. Similarly, we can find that $f(f(f(2)))=f(1)=8*2-7=9$. From the equation $f(f(f(2)))=9$, we can find that $f(1)=9$. 

Step 2: Now we know that $f(0)=1$ and $f(1)=9$. We can use these values to find $f(f(n))$ for some small $n$. For example, $f(f(2))=f(1)=9$. Similarly, we can find that $f(f(3))=f(27)=f(27)=8*3-7=19$. 

Step 3: Now we know that $f(2)=9$ and $f(3)=19$. We can use these values to find $f(n)$ for some small $n$. For example, $f(4)=f(2*2)=2f(2)+1=2*9+1=19$. Similarly, we can find that $f(5)=f(2*2+1)=2f(2)+1=2*9+1=19$. 

Step 4: Based on the above steps, we can find that $f(n)=19$ for all $n \geq 3$. 

Step 5: Now we can use this result to find $f(100)=19$. 

Step 6: Finally, we verify that $f(100)=19$ is a positive integer, which is true.

The value of $f(100)$ is $19$. 
The answer is: $19$.

Interesting, let's analyze step by step:



1. We have two conditions given: $f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$ and $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$.
2. To find $f(100)$, we need to compute the function $f$ iteratively. Since we don't have a simple closed form for $f(n)$, we need to compute it step by step.

Now, let's use Python and sympy library to compute $f(100)$:

```python


INTERMEDIATE OUT :

from sympy import symbols, Eq, solve

def find_f_of_100():
    n, f_n = symbols('n f_n')

    # Given f(f(f(n)))=8n-7
    f_of_f_of_f_n = 8*n - 7
    f_n = symbols('f_n')
    f_of_f_n = f_n
    f_of_f_of_f_n = f_of_f_n.subs(n, f_of_f_n)
    eq1 = Eq(f_of_f_of_f_n, f_n)

    # Given f(2n)=2f(n)+1
    f_of_2n = 2*f_n + 1
    f_of_f_n = f_of_2n.subs(n, f_n)
    eq2 = Eq(f_of_f_n, f_n)

    # Solve the system of equations
    solution = solve((eq1, eq2), (f_n, n))

    # Compute f(100)
    f_100 = solution[0][0].subs(n, 100)

    return f_100

result = find_f_of_100()
print(result)
```

    f_100 = solution[0][0].subs(n, 100)

```

Apparently, we made an error in the calculation. Let's correct it.

The function $f$ satisfies the conditions $f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$ and $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$. Let's rewrite these conditions in a way that helps us calculate $f(100)$.

From the first condition, $f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$, we have $f(f(n)) = \sqrt[3]{8n-7}$. This implies that $f(n) = \sqrt[3]{8\cdot \sqrt[3]{8n-7} - 7}$.

Now, we can calculate $f(100)$:

```python


INTERMEDIATE OUT :

from sympy import cbrt

def find_f_of_100():
    n = 100
    f_n = cbrt(8 * cbrt(8 * n - 7) - 7)
    return f_n

result = find_f_of_100()
print(result)
```

CODE RESULTS (-7 + 8*793**(1/3))**(1/3)

INTERMEDIATE OUT :
```output
(-7 + 8*793**(1/3))**(1/3)
```

This doesn't look like a positive integer. Let's try another way.

From the second condition, $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$, we can express $f(n)$ in terms of $f(2n)$: $f(n) = \frac{f(2n) - 1}{2}$.

We can use this formula to calculate $f(100)$ in terms of $f(200)$: $f(100) = \frac{f(200) - 1}{2}$.

Then, we can use the first condition $f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$ to find $f(200)$: $f(200) = 8 \cdot 100 - 7 = 793$.

Now we can substitute $f(200) = 793$ into the equation $f(100) = \frac{f(200) - 1}{2}$:

```python


INTERMEDIATE OUT :

def find_f_of_100():
    f_200 = 793
    f_100 = (f_200 - 1) / 2
    return f_100

result = find_f_of_100()
print(result)
``````output

CODE RESULTS 396.0

INTERMEDIATE OUT :

396.0
```

This is a positive integer. So, the value of $f(100)$ is 396.

Finally, we can output the result:

```python


INTERMEDIATE OUT :

print(result)
```

CODE RESULTS 396.0

INTERMEDIATE OUT :
```output
396.0
```
The value of $f(100)$ is 396.
The answer is: $396$

Interesting, let's analyze step by step:



1. First, we know that $f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$. Let's substitute $n=1$, then we have $f(f(f(1)))=8*1-7=1$. That is, $f(f(1))=1$.

2. We also know that $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$. Let's substitute $n=1$, then we have $f(2)=2f(1)+1$. Since $f(f(1))=1$, we have $f(2)=2*1+1=3$.

3. Now, let's substitute $n=2$ into the equation $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$, we have $f(4)=2f(2)+1=2*3+1=7$.

4. We continue this process until we find a pattern. After several steps, we find that $f(n)=2n-1$ for all positive integer $n$.

5. Finally, we calculate $f(100)$ using the function we found: $f(100)=2*100-1=199$.

The final answer is $199$, which is a positive integer. Thus, the solution is $f(100) = 199$. The answer is: $199$

Interesting, let's analyze step by step:



Given the function $f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$ and $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$. We want to find $f(100)$.

To find $f(100)$, we will use the second equation iteratively.

First, we have $f(2 \cdot 50) = 2f(50) + 1$.
Then, we have $f(100) = 2f(50) + 1$.

But we don't know $f(50)$ yet. So let's apply the second equation again: $f(2 \cdot 25) = 2f(25) + 1$. This means $f(50) = 2f(25) + 1$.

Substitute $f(50)$ into the equation of $f(100)$: $f(100) = 2(2f(25) + 1) + 1 = 4f(25) + 3$.

Now we need to find $f(25)$. Again using the second equation: $f(2 \cdot 12.5) = 2f(12.5) + 1$. But $12.5$ is not an integer, so we cannot directly apply the second equation.

However, we can use the first equation now. If we let $n = 12.5$, then $f(f(f(12.5))) = 8 \cdot 12.5 - 7 = 97$. And we know that $f(f(f(12.5))) = f(f(25))$, because $f(2 \cdot 12.5) = 25$. So we have $f(f(25)) = 97$.

Again apply the second equation: $f(2 \cdot 12.5) = 2f(12.5) + 1$, we get $f(25) = 2f(12.5) + 1$.

Substitute $f(25)$ into the equation of $f(100)$: $f(100) = 4(2f(12.5) + 1) + 3 = 8f(12.5) + 7$.

Now we have $f(100) = 8f(12.5) + 7$ and $f(f(f(12.5))) = 97$. Since $f(f(f(12.5))) = f(f(25)) = f(100)$, we have $97 = f(100)$.

So $f(100) = 97$.

To make sure this is a positive integer, we can substitute $n=100$ into the first equation $f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$ to check if it holds:

$f(f(f(100))) = 8 \cdot 100 - 7 = 793$.

But we know $f(100) = 97$, so $f(f(f(100))) = f(f(97)) = 793$. This doesn't match our previous result, which means there might be an error in our calculation.

Let's try again.

We know $f(100) = 97$, so $f(f(f(100))) = f(f(97)) = 793$.
But we also know $f(f(f(100))) = 8 \cdot 100 - 7 = 793$.
Therefore, our previous result $f(100) = 97$ is correct.

So the value of $f(100)$ is $97$.
The answer is: $97$

Interesting, let's analyze step by step:



As we don't have any information about the function $f$, it's hard to find an explicit formula for $f(n)$. However, we can guess and check to find the value of $f(100)$.

From the first condition, we can try substituting $n=1$ to find $f(f(f(1))) = 8*1 - 7 = -1$. Since $f(f(f(1)))$ is a natural number, we can assume that $f(1)$ is 1. Now we can use the second condition $f(2n) = 2f(n) + 1$.

Let's try to find $f(2)$:
$$f(2) = 2f(1) + 1 = 2*1 + 1 = 3.$$

Now let's find $f(4)$:
$$f(4) = 2f(2) + 1 = 2*3 + 1 = 7.$$

And $f(8)$:
$$f(8) = 2f(4) + 1 = 2*7 + 1 = 15.$$

And $f(16)$:
$$f(16) = 2f(8) + 1 = 2*15 + 1 = 31.$$

And $f(32)$:
$$f(32) = 2f(16) + 1 = 2*31 + 1 = 63.$$

And $f(64)$:
$$f(64) = 2f(32) + 1 = 2*63 + 1 = 127.$$

And $f(128)$:
$$f(128) = 2f(64) + 1 = 2*127 + 1 = 255.$$

We see a pattern here, and we can guess that $f(n) = 2^n - 1$. To verify our guess, let's substitute $n=100$ into our guessed formula:
$$f(100) = 2^{100} - 1.$$

The result is a positive integer.

So, our answer is $f(100) = 2^{100} - 1$. However, this is not the final answer, as we need to verify that this function satisfies both conditions in the problem.

Let's verify the first condition:
$$f(f(f(n))) = f(f(2^n - 1)) = f(2^{2^n - 1} - 1) = 2^{2^{2^n - 1} - 1} - 1.$$
And
$$8n - 7 = 8*100 - 7 = 793.$$
Clearly, $2^{2^{2^n - 1} - 1} - 1 \neq 793$, so our guess doesn't satisfy the first condition.

We made an error in our guess. Let's go back and re-examine our work. From the second condition, we have $f(2) = 3$, and $f(4) = 7$. If we try $f(n) = 2n - 1$, we get:
$$f(2) = 2*2 - 1 = 3,$$
$$f(4) = 2*4 - 1 = 7.$$
This function satisfies the second condition. Let's check if it also satisfies the first condition:
$$f(f(f(n))) = f(f(2n - 1)) = f(2(2n - 1) - 1) = f(4n - 3) = 2(4n - 3) - 1 = 8n - 7.$$
So this function does satisfy the first condition.

Therefore, we have found the correct function: $f(n) = 2n - 1$. Now we can find $f(100)$:
$$f(100) = 2*100 - 1 = 199.$$

The answer is $199$. It's a positive integer, so it's valid. The correct function is $f(n) = 2n - 1$, and $f(100) = 199$. Now we can output the result:

```python


INTERMEDIATE OUT :

def f(n):
    return 2*n - 1

result = f(100)
print(result)
```

The answer is $\boxed{199}$.
