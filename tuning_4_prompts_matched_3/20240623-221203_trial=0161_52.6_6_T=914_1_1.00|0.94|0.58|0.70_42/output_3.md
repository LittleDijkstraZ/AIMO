Interesting, let's analyze step by step:



The only way the product of two numbers is zero is if one or both of the numbers is zero. That is, either $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$.

For the first equation to be zero, it requires $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. This implies $x + y = \pm 10$ and $x - y = \pm 10$, which gives us four lines: $x + y = 10$, $x + y = -10$, $x - y = 10$, and $x - y = -10$. These lines form a rectangle with vertices at $(10, 0)$, $(-10, 0)$, $(0, 10)$, and $(0, -10)$.

For the second equation to be zero, it requires $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$. This implies $x = \pm 8$ and $y = \pm 8$, which gives us four lines: $x = 8$, $x = -8$, $y = 8$, and $y = -8$. These lines form a square with vertices at $(8, 8)$, $(8, -8)$, $(-8, 8)$, and $(-8, -8)$.

The intersection of the rectangle and the square gives us a smaller square with side length 10 (since the square's side length cannot be greater than the rectangle's side length of 10). The area of this square is $10^2 = 100$. Thus, the area of the convex polygon is 100 square units. The answer is: $100$

Interesting, let's analyze step by step:



The expression is defined as: $F(x, y) = ((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2)$.

We know that the product of two numbers is 0 if and only if at least one of the numbers is 0. Therefore, $F(x, y) = 0$ if and only if either:

1. $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$, which gives $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ or $\vert x - y \vert = 10$.

2. $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$, which gives $\vert x \vert = 8$ or $\vert y \vert = 8$.

These conditions define a square with side length 16. So, the area of the square is $16^2 = 256$. To make sure this area is a positive integer, we just need to convert it into an integer. The Python code to calculate the area is as follows:

```python


INTERMEDIATE OUT :

def area_of_square():
    side_length = 16
    area = side_length ** 2
    return area

result = area_of_square()
print(result)
```

CODE RESULTS 256

INTERMEDIATE OUT :
```output
256
```
The area of the square is 256, which is a positive integer. Thus, the area of the convex polygon is 256. The answer is: $256$.

Interesting, let's analyze step by step:



The problem equation is $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$. It's easy to see that this equation equals zero if either of the two terms equals zero. Thus, we have two groups of equations:

1. $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0 \Rightarrow \vert x + y \vert = 10 \Rightarrow x + y = \pm10$.
2. $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0 \Rightarrow \vert x \vert = 8 \Rightarrow x = \pm8$.
3. $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0 \Rightarrow \vert y \vert = 8 \Rightarrow y = \pm8$.
4. $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0 \Rightarrow \vert x - y \vert = 10 \Rightarrow x - y = \pm10$.

Now let's plot these points on the coordinate plane and connect them.

When $x = 8$, from $x + y = \pm10$ we have $y = -2$ or $y = 18$. When $x = -8$, we have $y = 18$ or $y = -2$. When $y = 8$, from $x - y = \pm10$ we have $x = 18$ or $x = -2$. When $y = -8$, we have $x = 18$ or $x = -2$.

So the polygon is a square with side length 16. The area is $16^2 = 256$. The answer is: $256$

Interesting, let's analyze step by step:



The equation is $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$.

This equation equals zero if and only if either one of the two factors equals zero. 

So either $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$.

The only way the first factor can equal zero is if both $(\vert x + y \vert - 10) = 0$ and $(\vert x - y \vert - 10) = 0$. This gives us $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. 

The only way the second factor can equal zero is if both $(\vert x \vert - 8) = 0$ and $(\vert y \vert - 8) = 0$. This gives us $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$.

So we have four cases to consider:

1) $x + y = 10$ and $x - y = 10$. This gives $x = 10$ and $y = 0$.

2) $x + y = 10$ and $x - y = -10$. This gives $x = 0$ and $y = 10$.

3) $x + y = -10$ and $x - y = 10$. This gives $x = 0$ and $y = -10$.

4) $x + y = -10$ and $x - y = -10$. This gives $x = -10$ and $y = 0$.

And the four points are $(10, 0)$, $(0, 10)$, $(0, -10)$, and $(-10, 0)$.

These four points form a square with side length 10. The area of the square is $10^2 = 100$.

So the area of the convex polygon is 100 square units. Since we derived this area based on mathematical reasoning, we can be confident that it's a positive integer.

The answer is: $100$

Interesting, let's analyze step by step:



The equation is a bit complicated. However, it's actually a multiplication of two terms set to zero. Therefore, either of the terms has to be zero for the entire equation to hold. 

This means we have two sets of equations to solve:

1. $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ and $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ and $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ and $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$

2. The other possibility is that one of the terms is non-zero, but their multiplication with another term which is zero makes the whole equation zero. However, the absolute value function $\vert x \vert$ results in a non-negative number, and the square of a real number is always non-negative. Therefore, the only way for the multiplication to be zero is if both terms are zero.

Therefore, we only need to solve the first set of equations:

1. $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ implies $\vert x + y \vert = 10$. This gives us two cases: $x + y = 10$ and $x + y = -10$.
2. $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ implies $\vert x \vert = 8$. This gives us two cases: $x = 8$ and $x = -8$.
3. $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ implies $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. This gives us two cases: $x - y = 10$ and $x - y = -10$.
4. $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ implies $\vert y \vert = 8$. This gives us two cases: $y = 8$ and $y = -8$.

Now we can draw the possible combinations of solutions:

1. $(x, y) = (8, 0)$, $(0, 8)$, $(-8, 0)$, $(0, -8)$ from $x = \pm 8$ and $y = \pm 8$.
2. $(x, y) = (5, 5)$, $(-5, -5)$, $(5, -5)$, $(-5, 5)$ from $x + y = \pm 10$ and $x - y = \pm 10$.

These eight points form a square with side length 10. The area of this square is $10^2 = 100$.

So the area of the convex polygon is 100 square units. The answer is: $100$

Interesting, let's analyze step by step:



We are asked to find the area of the polygon enclosed by the set of points satisfying the equation
\[((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0.\]

This equation is satisfied if either of the two factors is zero. The first factor equals to zero if either $\vert x + y \vert - 10 = 0$ or $\vert x - y \vert - 10 = 0$. The second factor equals to zero if either $\vert x \vert - 8 = 0$ or $\vert y \vert - 8 = 0$.

These equations simplify to $\vert x + y \vert = 10$, $\vert x - y \vert = 10$, $\vert x \vert = 8$, and $\vert y \vert = 8$. The solutions to these equations are well known and form a square with side length $16$. So, the area of the polygon is $16^2 = 256$.

Let's verify that this is a positive integer:

```python


INTERMEDIATE OUT :

from sympy import symbols, Rational, simplify

def calculate_area():
    # Side length of the square
    side_length = 16

    # Area of the square
    area = side_length**2

    return area

result = calculate_area()
print(result)
```

CODE RESULTS 256

INTERMEDIATE OUT :
```output
256
```
The area of the convex polygon is 256, which is a positive integer. The answer is: $\boxed{256}$.
