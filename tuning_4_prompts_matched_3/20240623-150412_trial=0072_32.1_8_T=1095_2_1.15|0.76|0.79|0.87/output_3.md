Question (hint: positive numerical answer):
"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"
Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:


The expression $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ is true if and only if at least one of the factors is zero.
For the first factor to be zero, we must have either $\vert x + y \vert - 10 = 0$ or $\vert x - y \vert - 10 = 0$, which means $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ or $\vert x - y \vert = 10$.
For the second factor to be zero, we must have either $\vert x \vert - 8 = 0$ or $\vert y \vert - 8 = 0$, which means $\vert x \vert = 8$ or $\vert y \vert = 8$.
The solutions to $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ are the lines $x + y = 10$ and $x + y = -10$, and the solutions to $\vert x - y \vert = 10$ are the lines $x - y = 10$ and $x - y = -10$.
The solutions to $\vert x \vert = 8$ are the lines $x = 8$ and $x = -8$, and the solutions to $\vert y \vert = 8$ are the lines $y = 8$ and $y = -8$.
The intersection points of these lines are $(8, 2)$, $(8, -2)$, $(-8, 2)$, and $(-8, -2)$.
The polygon formed by these points is a square with side length $10$, so its area is $10^2 = 100$.
The answer is: $100$

Question (hint: positive numerical answer):
"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"
Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:


The expression $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2)$ is equal to zero if and only if either $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$.

This means that either $\vert x + y \vert = 10$, $\vert x - y \vert = 10$, $\vert x \vert = 8$, or $\vert y \vert = 8$.

The equations $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$ represent two pairs of lines in the coordinate plane, forming a square with side length 10. The equations $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$ represent two pairs of lines in the coordinate plane, forming a square with side length 16.

The intersection of these two squares is the convex polygon whose area we want to find. This polygon is a square with side length 10, so its area is $10^2 = 100$. The answer is: $100$

Question (hint: positive numerical answer):
"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"
Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:


The equation $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + (\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ implies that $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$.
This means that $x + y = \pm 10$ and $x - y = \pm 10$.
Solving these equations, we find that the points $(x, y)$ that satisfy the first equation are $(5, 5)$, $(5, -5)$, $(-5, 5)$, and $(-5, -5)$.
Similarly, the points $(x, y)$ that satisfy the second equation are $(10, 0)$, $(0, 10)$, $(-10, 0)$, and $(0, -10)$.
Therefore, the points that satisfy the given equation are the intersection points of these two sets of points, which are $(5, 5)$, $(5, -5)$, $(-5, 5)$, $(-5, -5)$, $(10, 0)$, $(0, 10)$, $(-10, 0)$, and $(0, -10)$.
These points form a square with side length $10\sqrt{2}$.
The area of this square is $(10\sqrt{2})^2 = 200$.
Therefore, the area of the convex polygon is $200$. The answer is: $200$

Question (hint: positive numerical answer):
"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"
Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:


The expression $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2)$ equals zero if and only if at least one of the factors equals zero.
This means that either $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$.
The first equation can only be satisfied if $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. This implies that $x = \pm 10$ and $y = \pm 10$. So these are the vertices of the square.
The second equation can only be satisfied if $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$. This implies that $x = \pm 8$ and $y = \pm 8$. So these are the vertices of the square.
Therefore, the points that satisfy the given equation are the vertices of a square with side length 10.
The area of a square is given by the square of the length of its side, so the area of this square is $10^2 = 100$. The answer is: $100$

Question (hint: positive numerical answer):
"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"
Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:


The equation given is a product of two expressions equal to zero. This means that either the first expression is zero or the second expression is zero.
The first expression is $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)$, and this equals zero if and only if $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$.
The second expression is $((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2)$, and this equals zero if and only if $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$.
The solutions to $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$ are the lines $x + y = 10$, $x + y = -10$, $x - y = 10$, and $x - y = -10$.
The solutions to $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$ are the lines $x = 8$, $x = -8$, $y = 8$, and $y = -8$.
The lines $x + y = 10$, $x + y = -10$, $x - y = 10$, and $x - y = -10$ form a square with side length 10. The lines $x = 8$, $x = -8$, $y = 8$, and $y = -8$ form a square with side length 16.
The intersection of these two squares is a smaller square with side length 6 (since the side length of the smaller square is the difference between the side lengths of the larger and smaller squares).
The area of the smaller square is $6^2 = 36$. So, the area of the convex polygon is 36.
The answer is: $36$

Question (hint: positive numerical answer):
"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"
Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:


The expression $A \cdot B = 0$ means that either $A = 0$ or $B = 0$. So, the given equation is equivalent to either $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$.

The equation $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ implies that $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. These are the equations of two lines in the plane, so they do not enclose a region.

The equation $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ implies that $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$, which are the equations of four lines in the plane. These lines form a square with side length 16, so the area of the square is $16^2 = 256$.

Therefore, the area of the convex polygon is 256. The answer is: $256$

Question (hint: positive numerical answer):
"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"
Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:


The product of two numbers is zero if and only if at least one of the numbers is zero. So we have two cases to consider:

Case 1: $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$. This can only happen if $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. The only way this can happen is if $x = 0$ and $y = 0$.

Case 2: $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$. This can only happen if $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$. This means $-8 \leq x \leq 8$ and $-8 \leq y \leq 8$.

Combining these two cases, we see that the points $(x, y)$ that satisfy the equation are all the points in the square with vertices at $(8, 8), (8, -8), (-8, 8),$ and $(-8, -8)$. The side length of this square is $16$, so its area is $16^2 = 256$. The answer is: $256$

Question (hint: positive numerical answer):
"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"
Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:


The expression $A \cdot B = 0$ means that at least one of the expressions $A$ or $B$ is zero. So, the given equation is equivalent to either $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$.
For the first equation to be zero, we must have $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. This means that $x + y = \pm 10$ and $x - y = \pm 10$. Solving these four equations, we get the vertices of the square: $(8, 2)$, $(8, -2)$, $(-8, -2)$, and $(-8, 2)$.
For the second equation to be zero, we must have $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$, which means that $x = \pm 8$ and $y = \pm 8$. This gives us four more vertices: $(8, 8)$, $(8, -8)$, $(-8, -8)$, and $(-8, 8)$.
So, the polygon is a square with side length 16. The area of a square is the square of its side length, so the area of this square is $16^2 = 256$.
The answer is: $256$

"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"
Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:


The expression $AB=0$ is equivalent to $A=0$ or $B=0$. Therefore, the given equation is equivalent to either $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2=0$ or $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2=0$.
The first equation is satisfied if and only if $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$, which implies that $x + y = \pm 10$ and $x - y = \pm 10$. Solving these equations gives us the vertices of the square: $(8,2)$, $(8,-2)$, $(-8,2)$, and $(-8,-2)$.
The second equation is satisfied if and only if $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$, which implies that $x = \pm 8$ and $y = \pm 8$. This gives us the vertices of the square: $(8,8)$, $(8,-8)$, $(-8,8)$, and $(-8,-8)$.
Combining these two squares, we obtain a rectangle with side lengths $16$ and $16$, so its area is $16^2 = 256$. The answer is: $256$
