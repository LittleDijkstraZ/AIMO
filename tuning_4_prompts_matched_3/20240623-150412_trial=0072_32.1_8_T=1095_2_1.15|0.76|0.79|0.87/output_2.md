Question (hint: positive numerical answer):
"For how many positive integers $m$ does the equation \[\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}\] have $4$ distinct solutions?"
Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:



The equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has 4 distinct solutions.
We know that the absolute value function $\vert x \vert$ splits into two cases: $x$ if $x \geq 0$ and $-x$ if $x < 0$. So, we have four cases to consider:

1. $\vert x-1 -2 \vert = \frac{m}{100}$, when $x-1 \geq 0$. This simplifies to $\vert x-3 \vert = \frac{m}{100}$.
2. $\vert x-1 +2 \vert = \frac{m}{100}$, when $x-1 \geq 0$. This simplifies to $\vert x+1 \vert = \frac{m}{100}$.
3. $\vert -x+1 -2 \vert = \frac{m}{100}$, when $x-1 < 0$. This simplifies to $\vert -x-1 \vert = \frac{m}{100}$, or $\vert x+1 \vert = \frac{m}{100}$.
4. $\vert -x+1 +2 \vert = \frac{m}{100}$, when $x-1 < 0$. This simplifies to $\vert -x+3 \vert = \frac{m}{100}$, or $\vert x-3 \vert = \frac{m}{100}$.

From the above four cases, we see that the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ is equivalent to $\vert x-3 \vert = \frac{m}{100}$ or $\vert x+1 \vert = \frac{m}{100}$.

The equation $\vert x-3 \vert = \frac{m}{100}$ has two solutions: $x = 3 + \frac{m}{100}$ and $x = 3 - \frac{m}{100}$.
The equation $\vert x+1 \vert = \frac{m}{100}$ has two solutions: $x = -1 + \frac{m}{100}$ and $x = -1 - \frac{m}{100}$.

For the four solutions to be distinct, we require that the fractions $\frac{m}{100}$ are different from each other and from the numbers 1. This gives us the following conditions:

1. $\frac{m}{100} \neq 1$, so $m \neq 100$.
2. $\frac{m}{100} \neq -1 + 1 = 0$, so $m \neq 0$.
3. $\frac{m}{100} \neq -1 - 1 = -2$, so $m \neq -200$.

Since $m$ is a positive integer, the only possible values for $m$ are the positive integers from 1 to 99, excluding 0 and 100. There are thus 97 possible values for $m$.
The answer is: $97$.

Question (hint: positive numerical answer):
"For how many positive integers $m$ does the equation \[\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}\] have $4$ distinct solutions?"
Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:


The equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has $4$ distinct solutions.
This means that the expression inside the absolute value, $\vert x-1 \vert -2$, must be equal to $\frac{m}{100}$ or $-\frac{m}{100}$.
We can split this into two cases:
Case 1: $\vert x-1 \vert -2 = \frac{m}{100}$.
Adding $2$ to both sides gives $\vert x-1 \vert = 2 + \frac{m}{100}$.
This means that $x-1 = 2 + \frac{m}{100}$ or $x-1 = -2 - \frac{m}{100}$.
Simplifying these gives $x = 3 + \frac{m}{100}$ or $x = -1 - \frac{m}{100}$.
Case 2: $\vert x-1 \vert -2 = -\frac{m}{100}$.
Adding $2$ to both sides gives $\vert x-1 \vert = 2 - \frac{m}{100}$.
This means that $x-1 = 2 - \frac{m}{100}$ or $x-1 = -2 + \frac{m}{100}$.
Simplifying these gives $x = 3 - \frac{m}{100}$ or $x = -1 + \frac{m}{100}$.
So, the four distinct solutions are $x = 3 + \frac{m}{100}$, $x = -1 - \frac{m}{100}$, $x = 3 - \frac{m}{100}$, and $x = -1 + \frac{m}{100}$.
For these solutions to be distinct, the fractions $\frac{m}{100}$ must be different.
This means that $m$ must be a positive integer less than $100$.
So, we need to count the number of positive integers $m$ such that $1 \leq m \leq 100$.
There are $\boxed{100}$ such integers. The answer is: 100

Question (hint: positive numerical answer):
"For how many positive integers $m$ does the equation \[\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}\] have $4$ distinct solutions?"
Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:



The equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has 4 distinct solutions.
We know that $\frac{m}{100}$ must be positive because the absolute value of a quantity cannot be negative.
So $m$ must be positive.

The equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ can be rewritten as two separate equations:
$\vert x-1 \vert -2 = \frac{m}{100}$ and $\vert x-1 \vert -2 = -\frac{m}{100}$.

Let's solve the first equation $\vert x-1 \vert -2 = \frac{m}{100}$:
$\vert x-1 \vert = \frac{m}{100} + 2$.

The expression on the right side $\frac{m}{100} + 2$ must be positive, so $m > -200$.

The absolute value equation $\vert x-1 \vert = \frac{m}{100} + 2$ has two solutions:
$x-1 = \frac{m}{100} + 2$ and $x-1 = -(\frac{m}{100} + 2)$.

Solving these gives us $x = \frac{m}{100} + 3$ and $x = 1 - \frac{m}{100} - 2 = 1 - \frac{m+200}{100}$.

For the second equation $\vert x-1 \vert -2 = -\frac{m}{100}$, we have $\vert x-1 \vert = 2 - \frac{m}{100}$.

The expression on the right side $2 - \frac{m}{100}$ must be positive, so $m < 200$.

The absolute value equation $\vert x-1 \vert = 2 - \frac{m}{100}$ has two solutions:
$x-1 = 2 - \frac{m}{100}$ and $x-1 = - (2 - \frac{m}{100}) = \frac{m}{100} - 2$.

Solving these gives us $x = 3 - \frac{m}{100}$ and $x = \frac{m}{100} - 1$.

For the equation to have 4 distinct solutions, the four expressions for $x$ must be distinct.

We can see that the expressions for $x$ from the first and second equations are different, so we just need to make sure that the expressions for $x$ from the first set are different from those from the second set.

Comparing the four expressions for $x$:
$\frac{m}{100} + 3$, $1 - \frac{m+200}{100}$, $3 - \frac{m}{100}$, and $\frac{m}{100} - 1$.

We can see that $\frac{m}{100} + 3$ and $1 - \frac{m+200}{100}$ are different from $3 - \frac{m}{100}$ and $\frac{m}{100} - 1$.

So we just need to make sure that $\frac{m}{100} + 3$ is not equal to $3 - \frac{m}{100}$, and $1 - \frac{m+200}{100}$ is not equal to $\frac{m}{100} - 1$.

Simplifying these gives us $\frac{2m}{100} = 0$ and $\frac{m+100}{100} = 1$.

The first equation gives us $m = 0$, but $m$ must be positive, so this is not a valid solution.

The second equation gives us $m = 100$.

So the only positive integer $m$ that satisfies the conditions is $m = 100$.
The value of $m$ is 100.
The answer is: $1$

Question (hint: positive numerical answer):
"For how many positive integers $m$ does the equation \[\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}\] have $4$ distinct solutions?"
Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:


The equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has 4 distinct solutions if and only if $\frac{m}{100}$ is strictly between 1 and 2. This is because the expression on the left side of the equation, $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert$, can take on any value from 0 to 3, and it takes on the value of $\frac{m}{100}$ exactly 4 times if $\frac{m}{100}$ is strictly between 1 and 2. Therefore, we have $1 < \frac{m}{100} < 2$, which implies $100 < m < 200$. The positive integers $m$ that satisfy this inequality are the integers from 101 to 199, inclusive. The number of these integers is $199 - 101 + 1 = 99$. The answer is: $99$

"For how many positive integers $m$ does the equation \[\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}\] have $4$ distinct solutions?"
Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:



The equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has 4 distinct solutions if and only if $\frac{m}{100} = 2$. This is because the expression on the left side of the equation, $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert$, can take on values from 0 to 2, and it takes on the value of 2 exactly 4 times. Therefore, we set $\frac{m}{100} = 2$ and solve for $m$:
\[m = 2 \times 100 = 200.\]
So, there is only one positive integer $m$ that satisfies the condition, namely $m = 200$. The answer is: $1$

Question (hint: positive numerical answer):
"For how many positive integers $m$ does the equation \[\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}\] have $4$ distinct solutions?"
Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:



The equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has 4 distinct solutions.
We know that the absolute value function $|x|$ is equal to $x$ when $x \geq 0$ and $-x$ when $x < 0$. Therefore, the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ can be split into two cases:

Case 1: $\vert x-1 \vert -2 = \frac{m}{100}$.
In this case, we add 2 to both sides to get $\vert x-1 \vert = 2 + \frac{m}{100}$. Then we split this into two sub-cases:

Sub-case 1.1: $x-1 = 2 + \frac{m}{100}$. Solving for $x$ gives $x = 3 + \frac{m}{100}$.

Sub-case 1.2: $x-1 = -(2 + \frac{m}{100})$. Solving for $x$ gives $x = -1 - \frac{m}{100}$.

So in case 1, we have two solutions: $x = 3 + \frac{m}{100}$ and $x = -1 - \frac{m}{100}$.

Case 2: $\vert x-1 \vert -2 = -\frac{m}{100}$.
In this case, we add 2 to both sides to get $\vert x-1 \vert = 2 - \frac{m}{100}$. Then we split this into two sub-cases:

Sub-case 2.1: $x-1 = 2 - \frac{m}{100}$. Solving for $x$ gives $x = 3 - \frac{m}{100}$.

Sub-case 2.2: $x-1 = -(2 - \frac{m}{100})$. Solving for $x$ gives $x = -1 + \frac{m}{100}$.

So in case 2, we have two more solutions: $x = 3 - \frac{m}{100}$ and $x = -1 + \frac{m}{100}$.

In total, we have four distinct solutions: $x = 3 + \frac{m}{100}$, $x = -1 - \frac{m}{100}$, $x = 3 - \frac{m}{100}$, and $x = -1 + \frac{m}{100}$.

For these solutions to be distinct, the fractions $\frac{m}{100}$ must be different. Therefore, $m$ must be a positive integer such that $0 < \frac{m}{100} < 2$. This implies $0 < m < 200$.

The positive integers $m$ in this range are 1 through 199. However, we need to find the values of $m$ for which the equation has exactly 4 distinct solutions.

By analyzing the four solutions, we see that the solutions are distinct if and only if the fractions $\frac{m}{100}$ are different from each other and from 1 and -1. This happens if and only if $m$ is an integer such that $1 < \frac{m}{100} < 2$. This implies $100 < m < 200$.

The positive integers $m$ in this range are 101 through 199. However, we are asked for the number of such integers, so we simply count the number of integers in this range. The number of integers from 101 to 199 is $199 - 101 + 1 = 99$.

Therefore, the number of positive integers $m$ for which the equation has 4 distinct solutions is 99. The answer is: $99$

"For how many positive integers $m$ does the equation \[\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}\] have $4$ distinct solutions?"
Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:


The equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has $4$ distinct solutions.
This means that the expression inside the absolute value, $\vert x-1 \vert -2$, must be equal to $\frac{m}{100}$, $-\frac{m}{100}$, $2+\frac{m}{100}$, or $-2-\frac{m}{100}$.
Let's solve each case separately:
1. $\vert x-1 \vert -2 = \frac{m}{100}$: Adding $2$ to both sides gives $\vert x-1 \vert = 2+\frac{m}{100}$.
Taking the absolute value of $x-1$ gives two possible equations: $x-1 = 2+\frac{m}{100}$ or $x-1 = -(2+\frac{m}{100})$.
Simplifying these gives $x = 3+\frac{m}{100}$ or $x = -1-\frac{m}{100}$.
2. $\vert x-1 \vert -2 = -\frac{m}{100}$: Adding $2$ to both sides gives $\vert x-1 \vert = 2-\frac{m}{100}$.
Again, taking the absolute value of $x-1$ gives two possible equations: $x-1 = 2-\frac{m}{100}$ or $x-1 = -(2-\frac{m}{100})$.
Simplifying these gives $x = 3-\frac{m}{100}$ or $x = -1+\frac{m}{100}$.
3. $\vert x-1 \vert -2 = 2+\frac{m}{100}$: Adding $2$ to both sides gives $\vert x-1 \vert = 4+\frac{m}{100}$.
This equation has no solutions because the absolute value of a real number cannot be negative.
4. $\vert x-1 \vert -2 = -2-\frac{m}{100}$: Adding $2$ to both sides gives $\vert x-1 \vert = -\frac{m}{100}$.
This equation also has no solutions because the absolute value of a real number cannot be negative.

Therefore, the four distinct solutions are $x = 3+\frac{m}{100}$, $x = -1-\frac{m}{100}$, $x = 3-\frac{m}{100}$, and $x = -1+\frac{m}{100}$.
For these solutions to be distinct, the fractions $\frac{m}{100}$ must be different.
This means that $m$ must be one of the first $100$ positive integers.
Therefore, there are $100$ possible values of $m$ that satisfy the given condition.
The answer is: $100$

"For how many positive integers $m$ does the equation \[\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}\] have $4$ distinct solutions?"
Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:



The equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has $4$ distinct solutions.

We know that the absolute value function $\vert x \vert$ splits into two cases: $x$ if $x \geq 0$ and $-x$ if $x < 0$. So we can rewrite the given equation as two cases:

Case 1: $\vert x-1 -2 \vert = \frac{m}{100}$, which simplifies to $\vert x-3 \vert = \frac{m}{100}$. This further splits into two sub-cases:

Sub-case 1.1: $x-3 = \frac{m}{100}$, which gives $x = 3 + \frac{m}{100}$.

Sub-case 1.2: $-(x-3) = \frac{m}{100}$, which gives $x = 3 - \frac{m}{100}$.

Case 2: $\vert x-1 +2 \vert = \frac{m}{100}$, which simplifies to $\vert x+1 \vert = \frac{m}{100}$. This further splits into two sub-cases:

Sub-case 2.1: $x+1 = \frac{m}{100}$, which gives $x = -1 + \frac{m}{100}$.

Sub-case 2.2: $-(x+1) = \frac{m}{100}$, which gives $x = -1 - \frac{m}{100}$.

For the equation to have $4$ distinct solutions, the $x$-values from the sub-cases must be distinct. This gives us the following system of inequalities:

1. $3 + \frac{m}{100} \neq 3 - \frac{m}{100}$, which simplifies to $\frac{m}{100} \neq -\frac{m}{100}$, which holds true.

2. $3 + \frac{m}{100} \neq -1 + \frac{m}{100}$, which simplifies to $4 \neq 0$, which holds true.

3. $3 + \frac{m}{100} \neq -1 - \frac{m}{100}$, which simplifies to $4 \neq -2$, which holds true.

4. $3 - \frac{m}{100} \neq -1 + \frac{m}{100}$, which simplifies to $4 \neq 2$, which holds true.

5. $3 - \frac{m}{100} \neq -1 - \frac{m}{100}$, which simplifies to $4 \neq -4$, which holds true.

6. $-1 + \frac{m}{100} \neq -1 - \frac{m}{100}$, which simplifies to $\frac{m}{100} \neq -\frac{m}{100}$, which holds true.

So all the inequalities hold true, and we can conclude that the positive integer $m$ can be any positive integer from $1$ to $100$, inclusive. The number of such positive integers is $100$.
The answer is: $100$

Question (hint: positive numerical answer):
"For how many positive integers $m$ does the equation \[\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}\] have $4$ distinct solutions?"
Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:


The equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has $4$ distinct solutions.
The expression inside the absolute value, $\vert x-1 \vert -2$, can be positive or negative.
If it's positive, we have $\vert x-1 \vert -2 = \frac{m}{100}$.
If it's negative, we have $-\left(\vert x-1 \vert -2\right) = \frac{m}{100}$, or $\vert x-1 \vert -2 = -\frac{m}{100}$.
Solving the first equation, we get $\vert x-1 \vert = 2 + \frac{m}{100}$.
This implies two cases: $x-1 = 2 + \frac{m}{100}$ or $x-1 = -(2 + \frac{m}{100})$.
Solving the second equation, we get $\vert x-1 \vert = 2 - \frac{m}{100}$.
This implies two more cases: $x-1 = 2 - \frac{m}{100}$ or $x-1 = -(2 - \frac{m}{100})$.
Simplifying these equations, we have:
For the first equation, we have $x = 3 + \frac{m}{100}$ and $x = -1 - \frac{m}{100}$.
For the second equation, we have $x = 3 - \frac{m}{100}$ and $x = -1 + \frac{m}{100}$.
The solutions must be distinct, so we require that $3 + \frac{m}{100} \neq -1 - \frac{m}{100}$, $3 + \frac{m}{100} \neq 3 - \frac{m}{100}$, $-1 - \frac{m}{100} \neq -1 + \frac{m}{100}$, and $3 - \frac{m}{100} \neq -1 + \frac{m}{100}$.
Simplifying these conditions, we find that $m$ must be positive and less than $100$.
Therefore, the number of positive integers $m$ that satisfy the conditions is $99$. The answer is: $99$

Question (hint: positive numerical answer):
"For how many positive integers $m$ does the equation \[\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}\] have $4$ distinct solutions?"
Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:


The equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has 4 distinct solutions if and only if $\frac{m}{100}$ is equal to the value of $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert$ at 4 different points.

The function $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert$ is a "V" shape with vertices at $x=1-2= -1$, $x=1$, and $x=1+2=3$. Between $-1$ and $1$, the function is equal to $-(x-1) - 2 = -x + 1 - 2 = -x - 1$. Between $1$ and $3$, the function is equal to $x-1 - 2 = x - 3$.

For $x$ less than $-1$, the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ becomes $\vert -x - 1 - 2 \vert = \vert -x - 3 \vert = -(-x - 3) = x + 3$. So we want to find $m$ such that $x + 3 = \frac{m}{100}$ has one solution less than $-1$. This gives $x = -3 - \frac{m}{100}$. For this to be less than $-1$, we need $-3 - \frac{m}{100} < -1$, or $\frac{m}{100} > 2$, or $m > 200$.

For $-1 \le x \le 1$, the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ becomes $\vert -x - 1 - 2 \vert = \vert -x - 3 \vert = -(-x - 3) = x + 3$, which we have already considered.

For $1 \le x \le 3$, the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ becomes $\vert x - 1 - 2 \vert = \vert x - 3 \vert = -(x - 3) = -x + 3$. So we want to find $m$ such that $-x + 3 = \frac{m}{100}$ has two solutions in the interval $[1,3]$. This gives $x = 3 - \frac{m}{100}$. For $x$ to be in the interval $[1,3]$, we need $1 \le 3 - \frac{m}{100} \le 3$, or $0 \le \frac{m}{100} \le 2$, or $0 \le m \le 200$.

For $x \ge 3$, the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ becomes $\vert x - 1 - 2 \vert = \vert x - 3 \vert = x - 3$. So we want to find $m$ such that $x - 3 = \frac{m}{100}$ has one solution greater than $3$. This gives $x = 3 + \frac{m}{100}$. For this to be greater than $3$, we need $3 + \frac{m}{100} > 3$, or $\frac{m}{100} > 0$, or $m > 0$.

Therefore, the values of $m$ that work are those in the range $0 < m \le 200$. The positive integers in this range are 1 through 200, but not including 0. The number of positive integers in this range is 200.
The value of $m$ that works are those in the range $0 < m \le 200$. The number of positive integers in this range is 200.
The value of $m$ that works are those in the range $0 < m \le 200$. The number of positive integers in this range is 200. The answer is: $200$

Question (hint: positive numerical answer):
"For how many positive integers $m$ does the equation \[\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}\] have $4$ distinct solutions?"
Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:


The equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has 4 distinct solutions if and only if $\frac{m}{100} = 2$.

To see why this is true, let's first understand the graph of the function $y = \vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert$.

The function is composed of four line segments. It starts at $(1-2,0)=( -1,0)$, then goes up to $(1,2)$, then down to $(1+2,2) = (3,2)$, and finally back down to $(1+3,0) = (4,0)$.

The equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has 4 distinct solutions when the right side of the equation, $\frac{m}{100}$, is equal to the height of the graph, which is 2.

Setting $\frac{m}{100} = 2$, we get $m = 200$. Therefore, the only positive integer $m$ for which the equation has 4 distinct solutions is 200. The answer is: $\boxed{1}$

Question (hint: positive numerical answer):
"For how many positive integers $m$ does the equation \[\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}\] have $4$ distinct solutions?"
Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:



The equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has 4 distinct solutions.
The expression $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert$ is equal to 0 when $\vert x-1 \vert = 2$, which gives us $x = 3$ or $x = -1$.
When $\vert x-1 \vert > 2$, the expression $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert$ is equal to $\vert x-1 \vert - 2$.
When $\vert x-1 \vert < 2$, the expression $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert$ is equal to $2 - \vert x-1 \vert$.
So, the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ can be rewritten as two separate equations:
1. $\vert x-1 \vert - 2 = \frac{m}{100}$, when $x > 3$ or $x < -1$.
2. $2 - \vert x-1 \vert = \frac{m}{100}$, when $-1 < x < 3$.
For the first equation, we have $\vert x-1 \vert = 2 + \frac{m}{100}$.
This gives us two more equations: $x - 1 = 2 + \frac{m}{100}$ and $-(x - 1) = 2 + \frac{m}{100}$.
Solving these equations gives us $x = 3 + \frac{m}{100}$ and $x = -1 - \frac{m}{100}$.
For the second equation, we have $\vert x-1 \vert = 2 - \frac{m}{100}$.
This gives us two more equations: $x - 1 = 2 - \frac{m}{100}$ and $-(x - 1) = 2 - \frac{m}{100}$.
Solving these equations gives us $x = 3 - \frac{m}{100}$ and $x = -1 + \frac{m}{100}$.
So, the four distinct solutions are $x = 3 + \frac{m}{100}$, $x = -1 - \frac{m}{100}$, $x = 3 - \frac{m}{100}$, and $x = -1 + \frac{m}{100}$.
For these solutions to be distinct, we require that $\frac{m}{100} \neq 2$.
Therefore, the value of $m$ must be less than 200.
The positive integers $m$ for which the equation has 4 distinct solutions are 1, 2, 3, ..., 199.
There are 199 such positive integers. The answer is: $199$

Question (hint: positive numerical answer):
"For how many positive integers $m$ does the equation \[\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}\] have $4$ distinct solutions?"
Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:


The equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has $4$ distinct solutions.
For the expression inside the absolute value, $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert$, to be equal to a positive number $\frac{m}{100}$, the expression inside the absolute value must be less than $- \frac{m}{100}$ or greater than $\frac{m}{100}$. This is because the absolute value of a number is either positive or zero, and thus cannot be negative.
So we have two cases to consider:
1. $\vert x-1 \vert -2 < - \frac{m}{100}$, which simplifies to $\vert x-1 \vert < 2 - \frac{m}{100}$. This further simplifies to $- (2 - \frac{m}{100}) < x-1 < 2 - \frac{m}{100}$, which simplifies to $1 - 2 + \frac{m}{100} < x < 1 + 2 - \frac{m}{100}$, or $\frac{m}{100} < x < 3 - \frac{m}{100}$.
2. $\vert x-1 \vert -2 > \frac{m}{100}$, which simplifies to $\vert x-1 \vert > 2 + \frac{m}{100}$. This further simplifies to $x-1 < - (2 + \frac{m}{100})$ or $x-1 > 2 + \frac{m}{100}$, which simplifies to $x < 1 - 2 - \frac{m}{100}$ or $x > 1 + 2 + \frac{m}{100}$, or $x < -1 - \frac{m}{100}$ or $x > 3 + \frac{m}{100}$.
To have $4$ distinct solutions, the distance between the two outer bounds ($-1 - \frac{m}{100}$ and $3 + \frac{m}{100}$) must be greater than the distance between the two inner bounds ($\frac{m}{100}$ and $3 - \frac{m}{100}$). This gives us the inequality $3 + \frac{m}{100} - (-1 - \frac{m}{100}) > 3 - \frac{m}{100} - \frac{m}{100}$, which simplifies to $4 + \frac{2m}{100} > 3 - \frac{2m}{100}$.
Solving this inequality gives $4 + \frac{2m}{100} > 3 - \frac{2m}{100}$, or $\frac{4m}{100} > 1$, or $m > 25$. The smallest integer $m$ that satisfies this inequality is $26$.
Therefore, there is only one positive integer $m$ for which the equation has $4$ distinct solutions, and that is $m=26$. The answer is: $1$
