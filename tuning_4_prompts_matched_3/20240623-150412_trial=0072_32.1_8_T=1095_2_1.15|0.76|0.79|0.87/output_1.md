Question (hint: positive numerical answer):
"What is the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ when $x$ and $y$ range over all real numbers such that $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$?"
Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:



First, we notice that the expression $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ can be written as $\frac{1}{2}((5x-4y)^2 + (4x-5y)^2)$.
This is because $(5x-4y)^2 + (4x-5y)^2 = 25x^2 - 40xy + 16y^2 + 16x^2 - 40xy + 25y^2 = 41x^2 - 80xy + 41y^2 = 2 \cdot (20.5x^2 - 40xy + 20.5y^2) = 2 \cdot ((5x-4y)^2)$.

Now, we know that $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$. By the triangle inequality, we have $|x-2y| + |y-2x| \geq |(x-2y) - (y-2x)| = |x-2y-y+2x| = |3x-3y| = 3|x-y|$.
So, we have $3|x-y| = 40$, which implies $|x-y| = \frac{40}{3}$.

Now, we know that $(5x-4y)^2 + (4x-5y)^2 \geq 0$, because it's a sum of squares.
Therefore, the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ is $0$.

However, we need to check if there are values of $x$ and $y$ that satisfy the condition $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$ and make $(5x-4y)^2 + (4x-5y)^2 = 0$.

If $(5x-4y)^2 + (4x-5y)^2 = 0$, then we must have $5x-4y = 0$ and $4x-5y = 0$.
Solving this system of equations, we get $x = y$.

Now, we substitute $x = y$ into the equation $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$, we get $|x-2x| + |x-2x| = 40$, which simplifies to $|-x| + |-x| = 40$, or $2|-x| = 40$.
This gives us $|-x| = 20$, so $x = \pm 20$.

Since we want the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$, we should choose the negative value $x = -20$.

When $x = -20$, we have $y = -20$, and substituting these values into the expression $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$, we get $5(-20)^2 + 5(-20)^2 - 8(-20)(-20) = 2000 + 2000 - 3200 = 800$.

Therefore, the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ when $x$ and $y$ range over all real numbers such that $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$ is $800$. The answer is: $800$

Question (hint: positive numerical answer):
"What is the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ when $x$ and $y$ range over all real numbers such that $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$?"
Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:



First, we note that $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$ is equivalent to $|x-2y| = 20$ and $|y-2x| = 20$ or $|x-2y| = 20$ and $|y-2x| = -20$.
If $|x-2y| = 20$ and $|y-2x| = 20$, then $x-2y = \pm 20$ and $y-2x = \pm 20$.
If we add these two equations, we get $-3x = 0$ and $x = 0$.
Substituting this into $x-2y = 20$, we get $-2y = 20$ and $y = -10$.
Similarly, if $|x-2y| = 20$ and $|y-2x| = -20$, we get $x-2y = \pm 20$ and $2x-y = \pm 20$.
Adding these two equations, we get $3x = 0$ and $x = 0$.
Substituting this into $x-2y = -20$, we get $-2y = -20$ and $y = 10$.
So the possible values of $(x, y)$ are $(0, -10)$ and $(0, 10)$.
Now we evaluate $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ for these values:
For $(x, y) = (0, -10)$, we get $5(0)^2 + 5(-10)^2 - 8(0)(-10) = 500$.
For $(x, y) = (0, 10)$, we get $5(0)^2 + 5(10)^2 - 8(0)(10) = 500$.
So the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ is $500$. The answer is: $500$

Question (hint: positive numerical answer):
"What is the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ when $x$ and $y$ range over all real numbers such that $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$?"
Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:


First, we observe that the expression $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ can be rewritten as $(5x^2-8xy+5y^2)$. This is a perfect square trinomial, which can be factored as $(3x-5y)^2$.
Now, let's consider the equation $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$. By the triangle inequality, we have $|x-2y| + |y-2x| \geq |(x-2y) - (y-2x)| = |x-2y-y+2x| = |x-3y+2x| = |3x-3y| = 3|x-y|$. So, we have $3|x-y| = 40$, or $|x-y| = \frac{40}{3}$.
Now, let's consider the expression $(3x-5y)^2$. Since $(3x-5y)^2 \geq 0$ for all real numbers $x$ and $y$, the minimum value of $(3x-5y)^2$ is 0. This occurs when $3x-5y = 0$, or $3x = 5y$.
From $|x-y| = \frac{40}{3}$, we can substitute $3x = 5y$ into this equation to get $|3x-5x| = \frac{40}{3}$, or $|-2x| = \frac{40}{3}$. This gives us $2x = \frac{40}{3}$, or $x = \frac{20}{3}$. Then, $3x = 5y$ gives us $y = \frac{12}{3} = 4$.
Substituting $x = \frac{20}{3}$ and $y = 4$ into $(3x-5y)^2$, we get $\left(3\cdot\frac{20}{3}-5\cdot4\right)^2 = (20-20)^2 = 0$.
So, the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ is 0.
The answer is: $\boxed{0}$

Question (hint: positive numerical answer):
"What is the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ when $x$ and $y$ range over all real numbers such that $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$?"
Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:


To find the minimum value of the expression $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ given the constraint $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$, we can use the Cauchy-Schwarz inequality. The Cauchy-Schwarz inequality states that for any real numbers $a_1, a_2, ..., a_n$ and $b_1, b_2, ..., b_n$, we have
\[(a_1^2 + a_2^2 + ... + a_n^2)(b_1^2 + b_2^2 + ... + b_n^2) \geq (a_1b_1 + a_2b_2 + ... + a_nb_n)^2.\]
In this case, we can set $a_1 = x - 2y$, $a_2 = y - 2x$, $b_1 = 1$, and $b_2 = 1$. Then, we have
\[((x - 2y)^2 + (y - 2x)^2)(1^2 + 1^2) \geq ( (x - 2y)(1) + (y - 2x)(1) )^2.\]
Simplifying the left side gives
\[((x - 2y)^2 + (y - 2x)^2)(2) \geq ((x - 2y) + (y - 2x))^2.\]
Simplifying the right side gives
\[((x - 2y)^2 + (y - 2x)^2)(2) \geq (x - 2y + y - 2x)^2 = (-x + y)^2 = (y - x)^2.\]
So, we have
\[((x - 2y)^2 + (y - 2x)^2)(2) \geq (y - x)^2.\]
Expanding the left side gives
\[(x^2 - 4xy + 4y^2 + y^2 - 4xy + 4x^2)(2) \geq (y - x)^2.\]
Simplifying the left side gives
\[(5x^2 + 5y^2 - 8xy)(2) \geq (y - x)^2.\]
We are given that $|x - 2y| + |y - 2x| = 40$, which simplifies to $|y - x| = 20$. Thus, we have
\[(5x^2 + 5y^2 - 8xy)(2) \geq 20^2.\]
Dividing both sides by 2 gives
\[5x^2 + 5y^2 - 8xy \geq \frac{20^2}{2} = 200.\]
So, the minimum value of $5x^2 + 5y^2 - 8xy$ is 200. The answer is: $200$

Question (hint: positive numerical answer):
"What is the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ when $x$ and $y$ range over all real numbers such that $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$?"
Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:


To find the minimum value of the expression $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ subject to the constraint $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$, we can use the Cauchy-Schwarz inequality.
The Cauchy-Schwarz inequality states that for any real numbers $a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n$ and $b_1, b_2, \dots, b_n$, we have
\[(a_1^2 + a_2^2 + \dots + a_n^2)(b_1^2 + b_2^2 + \dots + b_n^2) \ge (a_1b_1 + a_2b_2 + \dots + a_nb_n)^2.\]

In our case, we can let $a_1 = x - 2y$, $a_2 = y - 2x$, $b_1 = 1$, and $b_2 = 1$. Then we have
\[(a_1^2 + a_2^2)(b_1^2 + b_2^2) \ge (a_1b_1 + a_2b_2)^2.\]
Substituting the values of $a_1$, $a_2$, $b_1$, and $b_2$, we get
\[((x - 2y)^2 + (y - 2x)^2)(1^2 + 1^2) \ge ((x - 2y)(1) + (y - 2x)(1))^2.\]
Simplifying, we have
\[((x - 2y)^2 + (y - 2x)^2)(2) \ge (x - 2y + y - 2x)^2.\]
Since $|x - 2y| + |y - 2x| = 40$, we know that $x - 2y + y - 2x = \pm 40$. Thus, we have
\[((x - 2y)^2 + (y - 2x)^2)(2) \ge 40^2.\]
Simplifying further, we get
\[(x - 2y)^2 + (y - 2x)^2 \ge \frac{40^2}{2} = 800.\]
Now, we can rewrite the expression $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ as
\[5(x^2 + y^2) - 8xy = 5\left[\left(\frac{x - 2y + y - 2x}{2}\right)^2 + \left(\frac{y - 2x - (x - 2y)}{2}\right)^2\right] - 8xy.\]
Substituting $x - 2y + y - 2x = \pm 40$, we have
\[5\left[\left(\frac{\pm 40}{2}\right)^2 + \left(\frac{\mp 40}{2}\right)^2\right] - 8xy = 5(400 + 400) - 8xy = 4000 - 8xy.\]
Therefore, the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ subject to the constraint $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$ is $4000 - 8xy$. Since the minimum value of $8xy$ is $0$ (when $x = y = 0$), the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ is $4000$. The answer is: $4000$

## QUESTION 1 - 5

Question (hint: positive numerical answer):
"What is the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ when $x$ and $y$ range over all real numbers such that $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$?"
Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:


First, let's consider the condition $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$.
We can rewrite this as $|x-2y| + |2y-x| = 40$.
By the triangle inequality, we know that $|a| + |b| \geq |a+b|$, so
$|x-2y| + |2y-x| \geq |(x-2y) + (2y-x)| = |0| = 0$.
But we are given that $|x-2y| + |2y-x| = 40$, so it must be the case that equality holds.
This means that the signs of $x-2y$ and $2y-x$ must be the same.
If $x-2y$ and $2y-x$ are both positive, then $x-2y = 2y-x$, which simplifies to $x=2y$.
If $x-2y$ and $2y-x$ are both negative, then $-(x-2y) = -(2y-x)$, which also simplifies to $x=2y$.
Therefore, we must have $x=2y$.
Substituting $x=2y$ into the equation $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$, we get
$|2y-2y| + |y-4y| = 40$, which simplifies to $0 + |-3y| = 40$, or $3|y| = 40$.
Therefore, $|y| = \frac{40}{3}$.
Since $y$ can be positive or negative, we have $y = \pm \frac{40}{3}$.
Substituting $y = \frac{40}{3}$ into $x=2y$, we get $x = \frac{80}{3}$.
Substituting $y = -\frac{40}{3}$ into $x=2y$, we get $x = -\frac{80}{3}$.
Therefore, the only solution that works is $(x, y) = \left(\frac{80}{3}, \frac{40}{3}\right)$ or $(x, y) = \left(-\frac{80}{3}, -\frac{40}{3}\right)$.
Now, let's substitute these values into the expression $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$:
For $(x, y) = \left(\frac{80}{3}, \frac{40}{3}\right)$, we have
\[5\left(\frac{80}{3}\right)^2 + 5\left(\frac{40}{3}\right)^2 - 8\left(\frac{80}{3}\right)\left(\frac{40}{3}\right) = \frac{6400}{9} + \frac{6400}{9} - \frac{6400}{3} = -\frac{6400}{9}.\]
For $(x, y) = \left(-\frac{80}{3}, -\frac{40}{3}\right)$, we have
\[5\left(-\frac{80}{3}\right)^2 + 5\left(-\frac{40}{3}\right)^2 - 8\left(-\frac{80}{3}\right)\left(-\frac{40}{3}\right) = \frac{6400}{9} + \frac{6400}{9} - \frac{6400}{3} = -\frac{6400}{9}.\]
Therefore, the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ is $-\frac{6400}{9}$. The answer is: $-\frac{6400}{9}$

"What is the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ when $x$ and $y$ range over all real numbers such that $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$?"
Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:


First, let's rewrite the given equation $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$ as $|2y-x| + |2x-y| = 40$.
Now, let's consider the expression $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$. We can rewrite it as $(5x^2-8xy+4y^2) + (y^2-8xy+4x^2) = (5x^2-8xy+4y^2) + (y^2-4xy+4x^2-4xy) = (3x-2y)^2 + (y-2x)^2$.
Since $(3x-2y)^2 \ge 0$ and $(y-2x)^2 \ge 0$, we have $(3x-2y)^2 + (y-2x)^2 \ge 0$.
Equality occurs when $3x-2y=0$ and $y-2x=0$, which gives $x=y=0$.
So, the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ is 0 when $x=y=0$.
Therefore, the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ is 0. The answer is: $0$

Question (hint: positive numerical answer):
"What is the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ when $x$ and $y$ range over all real numbers such that $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$?"
Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:


We start by using the hint given by the question and rewrite the equation $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$ as $|2y-x| + |2x-y| = 40$.
This can be rewritten as $|2y-x| + |x-2y| = 40$.
By the triangle inequality, we know that $|a| + |b| \geq |a+b|$, so we have $|2y-x| + |x-2y| \geq |(2y-x) + (x-2y)| = 0$.
Therefore, we must have $|2y-x| + |x-2y| = 0$ if and only if $2y-x = 0$ and $x-2y = 0$, which implies $x=y$.
Substituting $x=y$ into the equation $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$, we get $|x-2x| + |x-2x| = 40$, or $| -x | + | -x | = 40$, or $2|x| = 40$.
Therefore, $|x| = 20$, so $x = \pm 20$.

Now we substitute $x=y$ into the expression $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ to get $5x^2+5x^2-8x^2 = 2x^2$.
Since $x = \pm 20$, the minimum value of $2x^2$ is achieved when $x = -20$, and the minimum value is $2(-20)^2 = 800$.
Therefore, the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ is 800.
The answer is: $800$

Question (hint: positive numerical answer):
"What is the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ when $x$ and $y$ range over all real numbers such that $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$?"
Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:


We start by noting that $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$ can be rewritten as $|2y-x| + |2x-y| = 40$.
By the triangle inequality, $|a| + |b| \ge |a+b|$, so $|2y-x| + |2x-y| \ge |(2y-x) + (2x-y)| = |y| = 40$.
This implies that $|y| = 20$, and without loss of generality, we can assume $y = 20$ or $y = -20$.
Case 1: $y = 20$. Substituting into the equation $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$, we get $|x-40| + |20-2x| = 40$.
By the triangle inequality again, we have $|x-40| + |20-2x| \ge |(x-40) + (20-2x)| = |20-x| = 40$.
This implies that $|20-x| = 40$, so $x = -20$ or $x = 60$.
Case 2: $y = -20$. Substituting into the equation $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$, we get $|x+40| + |-20-2x| = 40$.
By the triangle inequality again, we have $|x+40| + |-20-2x| \ge |(x+40) + (-20-2x)| = |-20-x| = 40$.
This implies that $|-20-x| = 40$, so $x = -60$ or $x = 20$.
Now we substitute the possible values of $x$ and $y$ into the expression $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$:
When $x = -20$ and $y = 20$, we get $5(-20)^2 + 5(20)^2 - 8(-20)(20) = 2000 + 2000 + 3200 = 7200$.
When $x = 60$ and $y = 20$, we get $5(60)^2 + 5(20)^2 - 8(60)(20) = 18000 + 2000 - 9600 = 9400$.
When $x = -60$ and $y = -20$, we get $5(-60)^2 + 5(-20)^2 - 8(-60)(-20) = 18000 + 2000 - 9600 = 9400$.
When $x = 20$ and $y = -20$, we get $5(20)^2 + 5(-20)^2 - 8(20)(-20) = 2000 + 2000 + 3200 = 7200$.
Therefore, the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ is 7200. The answer is: $7200$

Question (hint: positive numerical answer):
"What is the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ when $x$ and $y$ range over all real numbers such that $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$?"
Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:


First, let's rewrite the expression $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ as $(5x^2-8xy+5y^2)$.
Now, we can complete the square for the expression inside the parentheses:
\[(5x^2-8xy+5y^2) = (x^2-2xy+y^2) + 4(x^2-2xy+y^2) = (x-y)^2 + 4(x-y)^2 = 5(x-y)^2.\]
So, the expression $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ is always non-negative (since it's equal to $5(x-y)^2$) and its minimum value is 0 when $x=y$.

Next, we need to find the values of $x$ and $y$ that satisfy the equation $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$.
If $x=y$, then $|x-2x| + |x-2x| = 0$, which does not equal 40.
However, if we let $x=2y$, then $|2y-2y| + |y-4y| = |0| + |-3y| = 3|y|$, and we want this to equal 40.
So, $3|y| = 40$, which means $|y| = \frac{40}{3}$.
Since $y$ can be either positive or negative, we have two cases to consider:
If $y > 0$, then $y = \frac{40}{3}$, and $x = 2y = \frac{80}{3}$.
If $y < 0$, then $y = -\frac{40}{3}$, and $x = 2y = -\frac{80}{3}$.

Now, we can substitute these values of $x$ and $y$ into the expression $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$:
If $x=\frac{80}{3}$ and $y=\frac{40}{3}$, then $5x^2+5y^2-8xy = 5\left(\frac{80}{3}\right)^2+5\left(\frac{40}{3}\right)^2-8\left(\frac{80}{3}\right)\left(\frac{40}{3}\right) = 0$.
If $x=-\frac{80}{3}$ and $y=-\frac{40}{3}$, then $5x^2+5y^2-8xy = 5\left(-\frac{80}{3}\right)^2+5\left(-\frac{40}{3}\right)^2-8\left(-\frac{80}{3}\right)\left(-\frac{40}{3}\right) = 0$.

In both cases, the value of the expression is 0. Therefore, the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ when $x$ and $y$ range over all real numbers such that $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$ is 0. The answer is: $0$
