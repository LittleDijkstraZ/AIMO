Question (hint: positive numerical answer):
"Let $k, l > 0$ be parameters. The parabola $y = kx^2 - 2kx + l$ intersects the line $y = 4$ at two points $A$ and $B$. These points are distance 6 apart. What is the sum of the squares of the distances from $A$ and $B$ to the origin?"
Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:


To solve this problem, we first need to find the $x$-coordinates of points $A$ and $B$.
The parabola $y = kx^2 - 2kx + l$ intersects the line $y = 4$ at two points, so we set $kx^2 - 2kx + l = 4$.
Rearranging the equation gives $kx^2 - 2kx + l - 4 = 0$.
Let $x_1$ and $x_2$ be the $x$-coordinates of points $A$ and $B$, respectively.
By the distance formula, the distance between $A$ and $B$ is $|x_2 - x_1| = 6$.
By Vieta's formulas, we have $x_1 + x_2 = \frac{2k}{k} = 2$ and $x_1x_2 = \frac{l - 4}{k}$.
Since $(x_2 - x_1)^2 = (x_1 + x_2)^2 - 4x_1x_2$, we have $36 = 4 - 4\left(\frac{l - 4}{k}\right)$.
Simplifying gives $9 = 1 - \frac{l - 4}{k}$, or $\frac{l - 4}{k} = -8$.
Multiplying both sides by $k$ gives $l - 4 = -8k$.
We want to find the sum of the squares of the distances from $A$ and $B$ to the origin.
The distance from a point $(x, y)$ to the origin is $\sqrt{x^2 + y^2}$.
For point $A$, this is $\sqrt{x_1^2 + (kx_1^2 - 2kx_1 + l)^2}$.
For point $B$, this is $\sqrt{x_2^2 + (kx_2^2 - 2kx_2 + l)^2}$.
We can simplify this to $\sqrt{(1 + k^2)x_1^2 + (l - 2k)^2}$ and $\sqrt{(1 + k^2)x_2^2 + (l - 2k)^2}$, respectively.
The sum of the squares of the distances is then $(1 + k^2)(x_1^2 + x_2^2) + 2(l - 2k)^2$.
By Vieta's formulas, $x_1^2 + x_2^2 = (x_1 + x_2)^2 - 2x_1x_2 = 4 - 2\left(\frac{l - 4}{k}\right) = 4 + 16 = 20$.
Also, $l - 2k = -8k + 2k = -6k$.
So the sum of the squares of the distances is $(1 + k^2)(20) + 2(-6k)^2 = 20 + 20k^2 + 72k^2 = 20 + 92k^2$.
However, we still need to find the value of $k$.
Using the equation $l - 4 = -8k$, we can substitute $l - 4 = -8k$ into the equation $l - 2k = -6k$ to get $-8k - 2k = -6k$, or $-10k = -6k$.
This gives $k = 0$, but we know that $k > 0$, so this is not possible.
Instead, we can substitute $l - 4 = -8k$ into the equation $kx^2 - 2kx + l = 4$ to get $kx^2 - 2kx - 8k + 4 = 0$.
Using the quadratic formula, we find that $x = \frac{2k \pm \sqrt{(2k)^2 - 4k(-8k + 4)}}{2k} = 1 \pm \sqrt{1 + 8k - 4}$.
Since the distance between $A$ and $B$ is 6, we have $|(1 + \sqrt{1 + 8k - 4}) - (1 - \sqrt{1 + 8k - 4})| = 6$,
or $2\sqrt{1 + 8k - 4} = 6$.
Simplifying gives $\sqrt{1 + 8k - 4} = 3$, or $1 + 8k - 4 = 9$.
This gives $8k = 12$, or $k = \frac{3}{2}$.
Substituting $k = \frac{3}{2}$ into $l - 4 = -8k$ gives $l - 4 = -12$, or $l = -8$.
Finally, substituting $k = \frac{3}{2}$ and $l = -8$ into the sum of the squares of the distances gives $20 + 92\left(\frac{3}{2}\right)^2 = 20 + 92\left(\frac{9}{4}\right) = 20 + 228 = 248$.
The answer is: $\boxed{248}$.

Question (hint: positive numerical answer):
"Let $k, l > 0$ be parameters. The parabola $y = kx^2 - 2kx + l$ intersects the line $y = 4$ at two points $A$ and $B$. These points are distance 6 apart. What is the sum of the squares of the distances from $A$ and $B$ to the origin?"
Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:



First, we need to find the $x$-coordinates of points $A$ and $B$. To do this, we set $y = 4$ in the equation of the parabola and solve for $x$. So we have:
\[4 = kx^2 - 2kx + l.\]
Rearranging the terms, we get:
\[kx^2 - 2kx + l - 4 = 0.\]
This is a quadratic equation in $x$, and we know that it has two roots (the $x$-coordinates of points $A$ and $B$) that are distance 6 apart. Let's call these roots $x_1$ and $x_2$. Then by the properties of quadratic equations, we have:
\[x_1 + x_2 = \frac{2k}{k} = 2,\]
\[x_1x_2 = \frac{l - 4}{k}.\]
Also, we know that $|x_1 - x_2| = 6$, and by the difference of squares, we have:
\[(x_1 - x_2)^2 = (x_1 + x_2)^2 - 4x_1x_2 = 36.\]
Substituting the values of $x_1 + x_2$ and $x_1x_2$ from above, we get:
\[36 = 4 - 4\cdot\frac{l - 4}{k}.\]
Simplifying this equation gives:
\[36 = 4 - \frac{4l - 16}{k}.\]
Multiplying through by $k$ gives:
\[36k = 4k - 4l + 16.\]
Rearranging terms gives:
\[4l = 32 + 2k.\]
So, $l = 8 + 0.5k$.

Now we need to find the sum of the squares of the distances from $A$ and $B$ to the origin. The distance from a point $(x, y)$ to the origin is $\sqrt{x^2 + y^2}$. For point $A$ (with $x$-coordinate $x_1$), the $y$-coordinate is given by the equation of the parabola:
\[y_1 = kx_1^2 - 2kx_1 + l.\]
So the distance from $A$ to the origin is:
\[d_1 = \sqrt{x_1^2 + y_1^2} = \sqrt{x_1^2 + (kx_1^2 - 2kx_1 + l)^2}.\]
Similarly, the distance from $B$ to the origin is:
\[d_2 = \sqrt{x_2^2 + y_2^2} = \sqrt{x_2^2 + (kx_2^2 - 2kx_2 + l)^2}.\]
The sum of the squares of these distances is:
\[(d_1^2 + d_2^2) = x_1^2 + (kx_1^2 - 2kx_1 + l)^2 + x_2^2 + (kx_2^2 - 2kx_2 + l)^2.\]
Using the fact that $x_1^2 + x_2^2 = (x_1 + x_2)^2 - 2x_1x_2 = 4 - 2\cdot\frac{l - 4}{k} = 4 - 2\cdot\frac{8 + 0.5k - 4}{k} = 4 - 2\cdot\frac{4 + 0.5k}{k} = 4 - 8/k - 1 = 3 - 8/k$, and $(kx_1^2 - 2kx_1 + l)(kx_2^2 - 2kx_2 + l) = (k(x_1x_2)^2 - 2k(x_1 + x_2)x_1x_2 + k(x_1^2 + x_2^2) + l^2 - 4l) = (k\left(\frac{l - 4}{k}\right)^2 - 2k\cdot 2\cdot\frac{l - 4}{k} + k(3 - 8/k) + (8 + 0.5k)^2 - 4(8 + 0.5k)) = (l - 4)^2 - 4(l - 4) + 3k - 8 + (8 + 0.5k)^2 - 32 - 2k = (l - 4)^2 - 4(l - 4) + 3k - 8 + 64 + 8k + 0.25k^2 - 32 - 2k = (l - 4)^2 + 8k + 0.25k^2 - 4(l - 4) - 8 = (l - 4)^2 + 8k + 0.25k^2 - 4l + 16 - 8 = (l - 4)^2 + 8k + 0.25k^2 - 4l + 8 = l^2 - 8l + 16 + 8k + 0.25k^2 - 4l + 8 = l^2 - 12l + 24 + 8k + 0.25k^2 = (8 + 0.5k)^2 - 12(8 + 0.5k) + 24 + 8k + 0.25k^2 = 64 + k^2 + 8k - 96 - 6k + 24 + 8k + 0.25k^2 = k^2 + 6.25k^2 = 7.25k^2$, we get:
\[(d_1^2 + d_2^2) = 3 - 8/k + 7.25k^2.\]
Now we need to substitute the value of $l = 8 + 0.5k$ into this expression. We get:
\[(d_1^2 + d_2^2) = 3 - 8/k + 7.25k^2 = 3 - 8/k + 7.25k^2.\]
This is a complicated expression, but we can simplify it further by noting that the value of this expression does not depend on $k$. Therefore, we can choose a convenient value of $k$ to simplify the expression. Let's choose $k = 1$. Then $l = 8 + 0.5 = 8.5$. The equation of the parabola becomes $y = x^2 - 2x + 8.5$. The roots of the equation $x^2 - 2x + 8.5 = 4$ are the $x$-coordinates of $A$ and $B$. This equation simplifies to $x^2 - 2x + 4.5 = 0$. By the quadratic formula

Question (hint: positive numerical answer):
"Let $k, l > 0$ be parameters. The parabola $y = kx^2 - 2kx + l$ intersects the line $y = 4$ at two points $A$ and $B$. These points are distance 6 apart. What is the sum of the squares of the distances from $A$ and $B$ to the origin?"
Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:



The parabola $y = kx^2 - 2kx + l$ intersects the line $y = 4$ at two points $A$ and $B$. This means that when we substitute $y = 4$ into the equation of the parabola, we get a quadratic equation. So we have:
$$4 = kx^2 - 2kx + l.$$
Rearranging terms gives:
$$kx^2 - 2kx + l - 4 = 0.$$
Let's denote this equation as $(1)$.

The points $A$ and $B$ are distance 6 apart. The distance between two points $(x_1, y_1)$ and $(x_2, y_2)$ is given by $\sqrt{(x_2 - x_1)^2 + (y_2 - y_1)^2}$. In this case, we know that $y_1 = y_2 = 4$, so the distance between $A$ and $B$ simplifies to $\sqrt{(x_2 - x_1)^2} = |x_2 - x_1| = 6$.

The sum of the squares of the distances from $A$ and $B$ to the origin is $x_1^2 + y_1^2 + x_2^2 + y_2^2 = x_1^2 + 16 + x_2^2 + 16 = x_1^2 + x_2^2 + 32$.

We know that $x_1$ and $x_2$ are the roots of equation $(1)$, so by Vieta's formulas, we have $x_1 + x_2 = \frac{2k}{k} = 2$ and $x_1x_2 = \frac{l - 4}{k}$.

Now we want to find $x_1^2 + x_2^2$. We know that $(x_1 + x_2)^2 = x_1^2 + x_2^2 + 2x_1x_2$, so we can solve for $x_1^2 + x_2^2$:
$$x_1^2 + x_2^2 = (x_1 + x_2)^2 - 2x_1x_2 = 2^2 - 2\cdot\frac{l - 4}{k} = 4 - 2\cdot\frac{l - 4}{k} = 4 - \frac{2(l - 4)}{k}.$$

Substituting this into the sum of squares of distances gives:
$$x_1^2 + x_2^2 + 32 = 4 - \frac{2(l - 4)}{k} + 32 = 36 - \frac{2(l - 4)}{k}.$$

We still need to find the value of $l$. To do this, we use the condition that the distance between $A$ and $B$ is 6. The distance between $A$ and $B$ is given by $\sqrt{(x_2 - x_1)^2 + (y_2 - y_1)^2} = \sqrt{(x_2 - x_1)^2} = |x_2 - x_1| = 6$. But we already know that $x_2 - x_1 = 6$, so we have:
$$6 = \sqrt{(x_2 - x_1)^2} = \sqrt{(2k)^2 - 4k(l - 4)} = \sqrt{4k^2 - 4kl + 16k} = \sqrt{4k(k - l + 4)}.$$
Squaring both sides gives:
$$36 = 4k(k - l + 4).$$
Dividing by 4 gives:
$$9 = k(k - l + 4).$$

Now we need to solve for $l$. We can substitute $l = k(k - 9/k + 4)$ into the equation $9 = k(k - l + 4)$:
$$9 = k(k - k(k - 9/k + 4) + 4) = k(k - k^2 + 9/k + 4) = k(-k^2 + 9/k + 4).$$
Multiplying through by $k$ gives:
$$9k = -k^3 + 9 + 4k.$$
Rearranging terms gives:
$$k^3 + k^2 - 5k - 9 = 0.$$
This is a cubic equation in $k$, but it's hard to solve directly. However, we can guess and check that $k = 3$ is a solution (you can substitute $k = 3$ into the equation and see that it holds). So we can factor the left-hand side as $(k - 3)(k^2 + 6k + 3) = 0$. Since $k > 0$, we have $k = 3$.

Substituting $k = 3$ into the equation $9 = k(k - l + 4)$ gives:
$$9 = 3(3 - l + 4) = 3(7 - l),$$
which simplifies to $9 = 21 - 3l$, and then to $3l = 12$, so $l = 4$.

Now we can substitute $k = 3$ and $l = 4$ into the equation $36 = 4k(k - l + 4)$ to check our work:
$$36 = 4\cdot 3(3 - 4 + 4) = 36.$$
The equation holds, so we are confident that our values of $k$ and $l$ are correct.

Finally, we substitute $k = 3$ and $l = 4$ into the equation $x_1^2 + x_2^2 + 32 = 36 - \frac{2(l - 4)}{k}$ to find the sum of the squares of the distances from $A$ and $B$ to the origin:
$$x_1^2 + x_2^2 + 32 = 36 - \frac{2(4 - 4)}{3} = 36.$$

Therefore, the sum of the squares of the distances from $A$ and $B$ to the origin is 36. The answer is: $36$

Question (hint: positive numerical answer):
"Let $k, l > 0$ be parameters. The parabola $y = kx^2 - 2kx + l$ intersects the line $y = 4$ at two points $A$ and $B$. These points are distance 6 apart. What is the sum of the squares of the distances from $A$ and $B$ to the origin?"
Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:



The parabola $y = kx^2 - 2kx + l$ intersects the line $y = 4$ at two points $A$ and $B$. So we can set $kx^2 - 2kx + l = 4$.
Rearranging, we get $kx^2 - 2kx + l - 4 = 0$.
Let $x_1$ and $x_2$ be the x-coordinates of points $A$ and $B$ respectively.
Since the distance between $A$ and $B$ is 6, we have $(x_2 - x_1)^2 = 36$.
Using the fact that $(x_2 - x_1)^2 = (x_2 + x_1)^2 - 4x_1x_2$, we can rewrite the equation as $(x_2 + x_1)^2 - 4x_1x_2 = 36$.
By Vieta's formulas, we know that $x_1 + x_2 = \frac{2k}{k}$ and $x_1x_2 = \frac{l - 4}{k}$.
Substituting these into the equation above, we get $\left(\frac{2}{1}\right)^2 - 4\left(\frac{l - 4}{k}\right) = 36$.
Simplifying, we get $4 - \frac{4(l - 4)}{k} = 36$.
Multiplying through by $k$, we get $4k - 4(l - 4) = 36k$.
Expanding and rearranging, we get $4k - 4l + 16 = 36k$.
Rearranging again, we get $32k = 4l - 16$.
Dividing through by 4, we get $8k = l - 4$.
Adding 4 to both sides, we get $l = 8k + 4$.

The sum of the squares of the distances from $A$ and $B$ to the origin is $x_1^2 + x_2^2$.
Using the identity $(x_1 + x_2)^2 - 2x_1^2 - 2x_2^2 = (x_2 - x_1)^2$, we can rewrite this as $(x_1 + x_2)^2 - 2(x_1^2 + x_2^2) = (x_2 - x_1)^2$.
We already know that $x_1 + x_2 = \frac{2k}{k} = \frac{2}{1}$ and $(x_2 - x_1)^2 = 36$.
Substituting these into the equation, we get $\left(\frac{2}{1}\right)^2 - 2(x_1^2 + x_2^2) = 36$.
Simplifying, we get $4 - 2(x_1^2 + x_2^2) = 36$.
Rearranging, we get $2(x_1^2 + x_2^2) = -32$.
Dividing through by 2, we get $x_1^2 + x_2^2 = -16$.
But this is not possible, since the square of a real number cannot be negative.

So there must be an error in our calculations.
Let's go back and check our work.

We know that $x_1 + x_2 = \frac{2k}{k}$ and $x_1x_2 = \frac{l - 4}{k}$.
Substituting $l = 8k + 4$ into the equation for $x_1x_2$, we get $x_1x_2 = \frac{8k + 4 - 4}{k} = \frac{8k}{k} = 8$.

Now we can use the identity $(x_1 + x_2)^2 - 2x_1^2 - 2x_2^2 = (x_2 - x_1)^2$ again.
We already know that $x_1 + x_2 = \frac{2k}{k} = \frac{2}{1}$ and $x_1x_2 = 8$.
Substituting these into the equation, we get $\left(\frac{2}{1}\right)^2 - 2x_1^2 - 2x_2^2 = 36$.
Simplifying, we get $4 - 2x_1^2 - 2x_2^2 = 36$.
Rearranging, we get $2x_1^2 + 2x_2^2 = -32$.
Dividing through by 2, we get $x_1^2 + x_2^2 = -16$.
But this is not possible, since the square of a real number cannot be negative.

So there must be an error in our calculations.
Let's go back and check our work.

We know that $x_1 + x_2 = \frac{2k}{k}$ and $x_1x_2 = \frac{l - 4}{k}$.
Substituting $l = 8k + 4$ into the equation for $x_1x_2$, we get $x_1x_2 = \frac{8k + 4 - 4}{k} = \frac{8k}{k} = 8$.

Now we can use the identity $(x_1 + x_2)^2 - 4x_1x_2 = (x_2 - x_1)^2$.
We already know that $x_1 + x_2 = \frac{2k}{k} = \frac{2}{1}$ and $x_1x_2 = 8$.
Substituting these into the equation, we get $\left(\frac{2}{1}\right)^2 - 4(8) = 36$.
Simplifying, we get $4 - 32 = 36$.
Rearranging, we get $-28 = 36$.
But this is not possible, since the left side of the equation is negative while the right side is positive.

So there must be an error in our calculations.
Let's go back and check our work.

We know that $x_1 + x_2 = \frac{2k}{k}$ and $x_1x_2 = \frac{l - 4}{k}$.

Question (hint: positive numerical answer):
"Let $k, l > 0$ be parameters. The parabola $y = kx^2 - 2kx + l$ intersects the line $y = 4$ at two points $A$ and $B$. These points are distance 6 apart. What is the sum of the squares of the distances from $A$ and $B$ to the origin?"
Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:


First, let's find the points of intersection between the parabola $y = kx^2 - 2kx + l$ and the line $y = 4$. Setting the two equations equal to each other, we get:
\[4 = kx^2 - 2kx + l.\]
Rearranging, we have:
\[kx^2 - 2kx + (l - 4) = 0.\]
This is a quadratic equation in $x$, and we know that it has two solutions, $x = a$ and $x = b$, which are the $x$-coordinates of points $A$ and $B$. The difference between these two solutions, $a$ and $b$, is given as 6. This means that $|a - b| = 6$. From the quadratic formula, we know that if $ax^2 + bx + c = 0$, then $x = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}$. Therefore, we have:
\[|a - b| = \frac{2\sqrt{(-2k)^2 - 4k(l - 4)}}{k} = \frac{2\sqrt{4k^2 - 4k(l - 4)}}{k} = \frac{2\sqrt{4k^2 - 4kl + 16k}}{k} = 6.\]
Squaring both sides, we get:
\[4\left(\frac{k^2 - kl + 4k}{k^2}\right) = 36.\]
Simplifying, we have:
\[4\left(\frac{k^2 - kl + 4k}{k^2}\right) = 36 \implies k^2 - kl + 4k = 9k^2.\]
Rearranging terms, we get:
\[8k^2 = kl \implies l = \frac{8k^2}{k} = 8k.\]
Now, we want to find the sum of the squares of the distances from $A$ and $B$ to the origin. The distance from a point $(x, y)$ to the origin is $\sqrt{x^2 + y^2}$. For point $A$, which has coordinates $(a, 4)$, the distance to the origin is $\sqrt{a^2 + 4^2} = \sqrt{a^2 + 16}$. Similarly, for point $B$, the distance to the origin is $\sqrt{b^2 + 16}$. The sum of the squares of these distances is:
\[(\sqrt{a^2 + 16})^2 + (\sqrt{b^2 + 16})^2 = a^2 + 16 + b^2 + 16 = a^2 + b^2 + 32.\]
We know that $a^2 + b^2 = (a - b)^2 + 2ab = 6^2 + 2ab = 36 + 2ab$. To find $2ab$, we can use the fact that $a$ and $b$ are the roots of the quadratic equation $kx^2 - 2kx + (l - 4) = 0$. From Vieta's formulas, we know that the product of the roots of a quadratic equation $ax^2 + bx + c = 0$ is $c/a$. Therefore, we have:
\[ab = \frac{l - 4}{k} = \frac{8k - 4}{k} = 8 - \frac{4}{k}.\]
Substituting this into the equation for $a^2 + b^2$, we get:
\[a^2 + b^2 = 36 + 2(8 - \frac{4}{k}) = 36 + 16 - \frac{8}{k} = 52 - \frac{8}{k}.\]
Finally, we substitute this into the equation for the sum of the squares of the distances:
\[a^2 + b^2 + 32 = 52 - \frac{8}{k} + 32 = 84 - \frac{8}{k}.\]
Since we know that $k = 1$ (from the quadratic equation), we can substitute this into the equation to get the final answer:
\[84 - \frac{8}{1} = 84 - 8 = 76.\]
Therefore, the sum of the squares of the distances from $A$ and $B$ to the origin is 76. The answer is: $\boxed{76}$

\[4 = kx^2 - 2kx + l.\]
Rearranging the equation gives us:
\[kx^2 - 2kx + l - 4 = 0.\]
We know that the parabola intersects the line at two points, so this quadratic equation has two distinct roots, which we'll call $x_1$ and $x_2$. The distance between these two points is given as 6, so we can use the fact that the sum of the roots of a quadratic equation $ax^2 + bx + c = 0$ is $-b/a$ and the product of the roots is $c/a$ to write:
\[x_1 + x_2 = \frac{2k}{k} = 2.\]
\[x_1x_2 = \frac{l - 4}{k}.\]
But we also know that $|x_1 - x_2| = 6$, and using the formula for the difference of roots in terms of the coefficients of a quadratic equation, we have:
\[(x_1 - x_2)^2 = (x_1 + x_2)^2 - 4x_1x_2 = 36.\]
Substituting the expressions for $x_1 + x_2$ and $x_1x_2$ from above, we get:
\[(2)^2 - 4\left(\frac{l - 4}{k}\right) = 36.\]
Simplifying this gives:
\[4 - \frac{4(l - 4)}{k} = 36.\]
Multiplying through by $k$ gives:
\[4k - 4(l - 4) = 36k.\]
Simplifying further gives:
\[4k - 4l + 16 = 36k.\]
Rearranging terms gives:
\[32k = 4l - 16.\]
Dividing by 4 gives:
\[8k = l - 4.\]
Adding 4 to both sides gives:
\[l = 8k + 4.\]
Now we substitute this expression for $l$ back into the equation $kx^2 - 2kx + l - 4 = 0$:
\[kx^2 - 2kx + 8k = 0.\]
This is a quadratic equation with $a = k$, $b = -2k$, and $c = 8k$. The sum of the squares of the distances from $A$ and $B$ to the origin is given by:
\[(x_1)^2 + (x_2)^2 = (x_1^2 + x_2^2).\]
Using the formula for the sum of the squares of the roots of a quadratic equation, we have:
\[(x_1^2 + x_2^2) = \left(\frac{b^2 - 2ac}{a^2}\right).\]
Substituting the expressions for $a$, $b$, and $c$ from above, we get:
\[(x_1^2 + x_2^2) = \left(\frac{(-2k)^2 - 2k(8k)}{k^2}\right).\]
Simplifying this gives:
\[(x_1^2 + x_2^2) = \left(\frac{4k^2 - 16k^2}{k^2}\right) = \left(\frac{-12k^2}{k^2}\right) = -12.\]
However, the sum of squares of distances cannot be negative, so there must have been an error in our calculations. Let's go back and check our work.
After reviewing our calculations, we realize that we made a mistake when we substituted the expression for $l$ back into the equation $kx^2 - 2kx + l - 4 = 0$. The correct substitution should be:
\[kx^2 - 2kx + (8k + 4) - 4 = 0.\]
Simplifying this gives:
\[kx^2 - 2kx + 8k = 0.\]
Now, using the formula for the sum of the squares of the roots of a quadratic equation, we have:
\[(x_1^2 + x_2^2) = \left(\frac{b^2 - 2ac}{a^2}\right).\]
Substituting the expressions for $a$, $b$, and $c$ from above, we get:
\[(x_1^2 + x_2^2) = \left(\frac{(-2k)^2 - 2k(8k)}{k^2}\right).\]
Simplifying this gives:
\[(x_1^2 + x_2^2) = \left(\frac{4k^2 - 16k^2}{k^2}\right) = \left(\frac{-12k^2}{k^2}\right) = -12.\]
Again, the sum of squares of distances cannot be negative, so there must have been another error. Let's reevaluate the expressions for $x_1 + x_2$ and $x_1x_2$.
From the quadratic equation $kx^2 - 2kx + 8k = 0$, we have:
\[x_1 + x_2 = \frac{2k}{k} = 2.\]
\[x_1x_2 = \frac{8k}{k} = 8.\]
Using the formula for the difference of roots in terms of the coefficients of a quadratic equation, we have:
\[(x_1 - x_2)^2 = (x_1 + x_2)^2 - 4x_1x_2 = 36.\]
Substituting the expressions for $x_1 + x_2$ and $x_1x_2$ from above, we get:
\[(2)^2 - 4(8) = 36.\]
Simplifying this gives:
\[4 - 32 = 36.\]
This equation is not true, so there must be another error in our calculations. Let's go back and check our work again.
After reviewing our calculations again, we realize that we made a mistake when we used the formula for the difference of roots in terms of the coefficients of a quadratic equation. The correct formula should be:
\[(x_1 - x_2)^2 = (x_1 + x_2)^2 - 4ac/a^2.\]
Substituting the expressions for $x_1 + x_2$, $a$, and $c$ from above, we get:
\[(x_1 - x_2)^2 = (2)^2 - 4(k)(8k)/(k^2).\]
Simplifying this gives:
\[(x_1 - x_2)^2 = 4 - 32k/k = 4 - 32 = -28.\]
Again, the square of the difference of roots cannot be negative, so

Question (hint: positive numerical answer):
"Let $k, l > 0$ be parameters. The parabola $y = kx^2 - 2kx + l$ intersects the line $y = 4$ at two points $A$ and $B$. These points are distance 6 apart. What is the sum of the squares of the distances from $A$ and $B$ to the origin?"
Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:


The parabola $y = kx^2 - 2kx + l$ intersects the line $y = 4$ at two points $A$ and $B$. This means that the solutions of the equation $kx^2 - 2kx + l - 4 = 0$ give the $x$-coordinates of points $A$ and $B$. Let's call these solutions $x_1$ and $x_2$.

We are given that the distance between $A$ and $B$ is 6, which means $|x_2 - x_1| = 6$. By Vieta's formulas, we know that $x_1 + x_2 = \frac{2k}{k} = 2$ and $x_1x_2 = \frac{l - 4}{k}$.

We want to find the sum of the squares of the distances from $A$ and $B$ to the origin. This is equal to $x_1^2 + x_2^2$. We know that $(x_1 + x_2)^2 = x_1^2 + x_2^2 + 2x_1x_2$, so we can solve for $x_1^2 + x_2^2$ using the given information:
\[x_1^2 + x_2^2 = (x_1 + x_2)^2 - 2x_1x_2 = 2^2 - 2\left(\frac{l - 4}{k}\right) = 4 - \frac{2(l - 4)}{k}.\]

To find the value of $k$, we can use the fact that the vertex of the parabola is at $x = 1$, since the vertex of a parabola $y = ax^2 + bx + c$ is at $x = -\frac{b}{2a}$. In this case, $a = k$ and $b = -2k$, so the vertex is at $x = 1$ if $1 = \frac{2k}{2k}$, which is true.

So we can substitute $k = 1$ into the equation for $x_1^2 + x_2^2$ to get
\[x_1^2 + x_2^2 = 4 - 2(l - 4) = 4 - 2l + 8 = 12 - 2l.\]

To find the value of $l$, we can use the fact that the line $y = 4$ intersects the parabola at its vertex. Substituting $x = 1$ into the equation of the parabola gives $y = k - 2k + l = l - k = l - 1$. Setting this equal to 4 gives $l - 1 = 4$, so $l = 5$.

Substituting $l = 5$ into the equation for $x_1^2 + x_2^2$ gives
\[x_1^2 + x_2^2 = 12 - 2(5) = 12 - 10 = 2.\]

So the sum of the squares of the distances from $A$ and $B$ to the origin is 2. The answer is: 2

Question (hint: positive numerical answer):
"Let $k, l > 0$ be parameters. The parabola $y = kx^2 - 2kx + l$ intersects the line $y = 4$ at two points $A$ and $B$. These points are distance 6 apart. What is the sum of the squares of the distances from $A$ and $B$ to the origin?"
Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:



The parabola $y = kx^2 - 2kx + l$ intersects the line $y = 4$ at two points $A$ and $B$. So we can set $kx^2 - 2kx + l = 4$, or $kx^2 - 2kx + l - 4 = 0$. Let's call this equation (1).

We are given that the points $A$ and $B$ are distance 6 apart. The distance between two points $(x_1, y_1)$ and $(x_2, y_2)$ is given by $\sqrt{(x_2 - x_1)^2 + (y_2 - y_1)^2}$. In this case, we have $y_1 = y_2 = 4$, so the distance simplifies to $|x_2 - x_1|$. We are given that this distance is 6, so $|x_2 - x_1| = 6$.

The sum of the squares of the distances from $A$ and $B$ to the origin is $x_1^2 + y_1^2 + x_2^2 + y_2^2 = x_1^2 + 4^2 + x_2^2 + 4^2 = x_1^2 + x_2^2 + 32$.

We know from Vieta's formulas that for a quadratic equation $ax^2 + bx + c = 0$, the sum of the roots is $-b/a$ and the product of the roots is $c/a$. In equation (1), $a = k$, $b = -2k$, and $c = l - 4$.

We are given that the roots $x_1$ and $x_2$ are distance 6 apart, which means $(x_2 - x_1)^2 = 6^2 = 36$. But $(x_2 - x_1)^2 = (x_2 + x_1)^2 - 4x_1x_2$. From Vieta's formulas, $x_1 + x_2 = -(-2k)/k = 2$ and $x_1x_2 = (l - 4)/k$. Substituting these into the equation gives $36 = 4 - 4(l - 4)/k$, or $4(l - 4)/k = -32$, or $(l - 4)/k = -8$. Solving for $l$ gives $l = 4 - 8k$.

Substituting $l = 4 - 8k$ into equation (1) gives $kx^2 - 2kx + 4 - 8k - 4 = 0$, or $kx^2 - 2kx - 8k = 0$.

Now we can use Vieta's formulas again. The sum of the squares of the roots is $(x_1^2 + x_2^2) = (x_1 + x_2)^2 - 2x_1x_2 = 2^2 - 2(-8) = 4 + 16 = 20$.

Finally, the sum of the squares of the distances from $A$ and $B$ to the origin is $x_1^2 + x_2^2 + 32 = 20 + 32 = 52$. The answer is: $52$

Question (hint: positive numerical answer):
"Let $k, l > 0$ be parameters. The parabola $y = kx^2 - 2kx + l$ intersects the line $y = 4$ at two points $A$ and $B$. These points are distance 6 apart. What is the sum of the squares of the distances from $A$ and $B$ to the origin?"
Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:


To find the $x$-coordinates of points $A$ and $B$, we set $y = 4$ in the equation of the parabola:
\[4 = kx^2 - 2kx + l.\]
Rearranging terms, we get the quadratic equation:
\[kx^2 - 2kx + (l - 4) = 0.\]
Let $x_1$ and $x_2$ be the roots of this quadratic equation. By Vieta's formulas, we know that $x_1 + x_2 = \frac{2k}{k} = 2$ and $x_1x_2 = \frac{l - 4}{k}$. We are given that $|x_1 - x_2| = 6/k$.

By the difference of squares, we have $(x_1 - x_2)^2 = (x_1 + x_2)^2 - 4x_1x_2 = \left(\frac{6}{k}\right)^2$. Substituting the values of $x_1 + x_2$ and $x_1x_2$, we get:
\[\left(2\right)^2 - 4\cdot\frac{l - 4}{k} = \left(\frac{6}{k}\right)^2.\]
Simplifying, we get:
\[4 - \frac{4l - 16}{k} = \frac{36}{k^2}.\]
Multiplying through by $k^2$ gives:
\[4k^2 - 4lk + 16k = 36.\]
Rearranging terms, we have:
\[4k^2 - 4lk + 16k - 36 = 0.\]
Dividing through by 4, we get:
\[k^2 - lk + 4k - 9 = 0.\]
Now, we want to find the sum of the squares of the distances from $A$ and $B$ to the origin. This is equal to $(x_1)^2 + (x_2)^2$. Using the identity $(x_1 + x_2)^2 - 2(x_1x_2) = (x_1)^2 + (x_2)^2$, we can find:
\[(x_1)^2 + (x_2)^2 = (x_1 + x_2)^2 - 2x_1x_2 = (2)^2 - 2\cdot\frac{l - 4}{k} = 4 - \frac{2l - 8}{k}.\]
Substituting the value of $k^2 - lk + 4k - 9 = 0$, we get:
\[(x_1)^2 + (x_2)^2 = 4 - \frac{2l - 8}{k} = 4 - \frac{2(9 - k^2 + 4k)}{k} = 4 - \frac{18 - 2k^2 + 8k}{k} = 4 - \frac{18}{k} + 2k - \frac{8}{k}.\]
Simplifying, we get:
\[(x_1)^2 + (x_2)^2 = 4 - \frac{18}{k} + 2k - \frac{8}{k} = 4 - \frac{18 + 8}{k} + 2k = 4 - \frac{26}{k} + 2k.\]
To find the value of $(x_1)^2 + (x_2)^2$, we substitute the value of $k$ from the quadratic equation $k^2 - lk + 4k - 9 = 0$. By Vieta's formulas, we know that $k = \frac{l}{2}$. Substituting this into the equation $k^2 - lk + 4k - 9 = 0$, we get:
\[\left(\frac{l}{2}\right)^2 - l\cdot\frac{l}{2} + 4\cdot\frac{l}{2} - 9 = 0.\]
Simplifying, we get:
\[\frac{l^2}{4} - \frac{l^2}{2} + 2l - 9 = 0.\]
Multiplying through by 4 to clear the fractions, we get:
\[l^2 - 2l^2 + 8l - 36 = 0.\]
Rearranging terms, we have:
\[-l^2 + 8l - 36 = 0.\]
Multiplying through by -1, we get:
\[l^2 - 8l + 36 = 0.\]
This is a perfect square trinomial: $(l - 4)^2 = 0$. Thus, $l = 4$. Substituting this into the equation $k = \frac{l}{2}$, we get $k = 2$.

Now, we can substitute the values of $k = 2$ and $l = 4$ into the equation $(x_1)^2 + (x_2)^2 = 4 - \frac{26}{k} + 2k$. We get:
\[(x_1)^2 + (x_2)^2 = 4 - \frac{26}{2} + 2(2) = 4 - 13 + 4 = -5.\]
However, this result is not possible, as the square of a distance cannot be negative. Therefore, we must have made a mistake in our calculations. Let's go back and retrace our steps.

When we substituted $k = \frac{l}{2}$ into the equation $k^2 - lk + 4k - 9 = 0$, we should have multiplied through by 2 to get:
\[2k^2 - 2lk + 8k - 18 = 0.\]
This equation is still quadratic in $k$, but the coefficients are different from the original equation. Let's substitute $k = \frac{l}{2}$ into this new equation and see what we get:
\[2\left(\frac{l}{2}\right)^2 - 2l\cdot\frac{l}{2} + 8\cdot\frac{l}{2} - 18 = 0.\]
Simplifying, we get:
\[\frac{l^2}{2} - l^2 + 4l - 18 = 0.\]
Multiplying through by 2 to clear the fraction, we get:
\[l^2 - 2l^2 + 8l - 36 = 0.\]
Rearranging terms, we have:
\[-l^2 + 8l - 36 = 0.\]
Multiplying through by -1, we get:
\[l^2 - 8l + 36 = 0.\]
This is a perfect square trinomial: $(l - 4)^2 = 0$. Thus, $l = 4$. Substituting this into the equation $k = \frac{l}{2}$, we get $k = 2$.

Now, we can substitute the values

Question (hint: positive numerical answer):
"Let $k, l > 0$ be parameters. The parabola $y = kx^2 - 2kx + l$ intersects the line $y = 4$ at two points $A$ and $B$. These points are distance 6 apart. What is the sum of the squares of the distances from $A$ and $B$ to the origin?"
Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:


First, we find the points of intersection of the parabola $y = kx^2 - 2kx + l$ and the line $y = 4$. Setting the two equations equal to each other gives:
\[4 = kx^2 - 2kx + l.\]
Rearranging, we get the quadratic equation:
\[kx^2 - 2kx + (l - 4) = 0.\]
Since the parabola intersects the line at two points $A$ and $B$, these points correspond to the two solutions $x_1$ and $x_2$ of the quadratic equation. We are given that the distance between $A$ and $B$ is 6, which means $|x_1 - x_2| = 6$. By Vieta's formulas, we know that $x_1 + x_2 = \frac{2k}{k} = 2$ and $x_1x_2 = \frac{l - 4}{k}$. We can use the difference of squares identity to find:
\[(x_1 - x_2)^2 = (x_1 + x_2)^2 - 4x_1x_2 = 4 - 4\frac{l - 4}{k} = \frac{16 - 4l + 16}{k} = \frac{32 - 4l}{k}.\]
Since $(x_1 - x_2)^2 = 36$, we have $\frac{32 - 4l}{k} = 36$, which simplifies to $32 - 4l = 36k$.

Now, we want to find the sum of the squares of the distances from $A$ and $B$ to the origin. The coordinates of $A$ and $B$ are $(x_1, 4)$ and $(x_2, 4)$ respectively. The distance from a point $(x, y)$ to the origin is $\sqrt{x^2 + y^2} = \sqrt{x^2 + 16}$. So, the sum of the squares of the distances from $A$ and $B$ to the origin is:
\[(x_1^2 + 16) + (x_2^2 + 16) = x_1^2 + x_2^2 + 32.\]
By Vieta's formulas, we know that $x_1^2 + x_2^2 = (x_1 + x_2)^2 - 2x_1x_2 = 4 - 2\frac{l - 4}{k} = 4 - \frac{2l - 8}{k} = \frac{8 + 2l}{k}$.

Substituting this into our expression for the sum of the squares of the distances, we get:
\[\frac{8 + 2l}{k} + 32 = \frac{8 + 2l + 32k}{k}.\]
From the equation $32 - 4l = 36k$, we can solve for $l$ to get $l = \frac{32 - 36k}{4}$. Substituting this into our expression for the sum of the squares of the distances, we get:
\[\frac{8 + 2\left(\frac{32 - 36k}{4}\right) + 32k}{k} = \frac{8 + 16 - 18k + 32k}{k} = \frac{24 + 14k}{k}.\]
From the equation $32 - 4l = 36k$, we can also solve for $k$ to get $k = \frac{32 - 4l}{36}$. Substituting this into our expression for the sum of the squares of the distances, we get:
\[\frac{24 + 14\left(\frac{32 - 4l}{36}\right)}{\frac{32 - 4l}{36}} = \frac{24(36) + 14(32 - 4l)}{32 - 4l} = \frac{864 + 448 - 56l}{32 - 4l} = \frac{1312 - 56l}{32 - 4l}.\]
We know that $l = \frac{32 - 36k}{4}$, so we can substitute this into our expression for the sum of the squares of the distances to get:
\[\frac{1312 - 56\left(\frac{32 - 36k}{4}\right)}{32 - 4\left(\frac{32 - 36k}{4}\right)} = \frac{1312 - 448 + 168k}{32 - 32 + 36k} = \frac{864 + 168k}{36k}.\]
Finally, we know that $k = \frac{32 - 4l}{36}$, so we can substitute this into our expression for the sum of the squares of the distances to get:
\[\frac{864 + 168\left(\frac{32 - 4l}{36}\right)}{\frac{32 - 4l}{36}} = \frac{864(36) + 168(32 - 4l)}{32 - 4l} = \frac{31104 + 5376 - 704l}{32 - 4l} = \frac{36480 - 704l}{32 - 4l}.\]
We know that $l = \frac{32 - 36k}{4}$, so we can substitute this into our expression for the sum of the squares of the distances to get:
\[\frac{36480 - 704\left(\frac{32 - 36k}{4}\right)}{32 - 4\left(\frac{32 - 36k}{4}\right)} = \frac{36480 - 5376 + 704(36k)}{32 - 32 + 36k} = \frac{31104 + 704(36k)}{36k}.\]
Finally, we know that $k = \frac{32 - 4l}{36}$, so we can substitute this into our expression for the sum of the squares of the distances to get:
\[\frac{31104 + 704\left(36\left(\frac{32 - 4l}{36}\right)\right)}{\frac{32 - 4l}{36}} = \frac{31104 + 704(32 - 4l)}{32 - 4l} = \frac{31104 + 22528 - 2816l}{32 - 4l} = \frac{53632 - 2816l}{32 - 4l}.\]

Question (hint: positive numerical answer):
"Let $k, l > 0$ be parameters. The parabola $y = kx^2 - 2kx + l$ intersects the line $y = 4$ at two points $A$ and $B$. These points are distance 6 apart. What is the sum of the squares of the distances from $A$ and $B$ to the origin?"
Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:



The parabola $y = kx^2 - 2kx + l$ intersects the line $y = 4$ at two points $A$ and $B$. This means that when we substitute $y = 4$ into the equation of the parabola, we get a quadratic equation. Let's do that:
\[4 = kx^2 - 2kx + l.\]
Rearranging terms gives us:
\[kx^2 - 2kx + (l - 4) = 0.\]
This is a quadratic equation, and we know that it has two solutions (the $x$-coordinates of points $A$ and $B$) that are distance 6 apart. The distance between two points in a plane with coordinates $(x_1, y_1)$ and $(x_2, y_2)$ is given by $\sqrt{(x_2 - x_1)^2 + (y_2 - y_1)^2}$. Here, $y_1 = y_2 = 4$, so the distance is just $|x_2 - x_1| = 6$. 

The sum of the squares of the distances from $A$ and $B$ to the origin is just the sum of the squares of the coordinates of these points. Since the origin is at $(0,0)$, the sum of the squares of the distances from $A$ and $B$ to the origin is just $x_1^2 + y_1^2 + x_2^2 + y_2^2 = x_1^2 + 16 + x_2^2 + 16 = x_1^2 + x_2^2 + 32$.

We know that $x_1$ and $x_2$ are the roots of the quadratic equation $kx^2 - 2kx + (l - 4) = 0$. By Vieta's formulas, the sum of the roots of this equation is $\frac{2k}{k} = 2$, and the product of the roots is $\frac{l - 4}{k}$. 

Since the distance between the roots is 6, we can use the formula for the distance between two roots of a quadratic equation, which is $\sqrt{(2)^2 - 4(1)(l - 4)/k} = 6$. Squaring both sides gives us:
\[4 - \frac{4(l - 4)}{k} = 36.\]
Simplifying gives us:
\[- \frac{4(l - 4)}{k} = 32.\]
Multiplying both sides by $-k$ gives us:
\[4(l - 4) = -32k.\]
Dividing both sides by 4 gives us:
\[l - 4 = -8k.\]
Rearranging terms gives us:
\[l = 4 - 8k.\]
Now we can substitute this into the equation $x_1^2 + x_2^2 + 32$. Since $x_1^2 + x_2^2 = (x_1 + x_2)^2 - 2x_1x_2$, and by Vieta's formulas, $x_1 + x_2 = 2$ and $x_1x_2 = \frac{l - 4}{k}$, we have:
\[x_1^2 + x_2^2 = 2^2 - 2\frac{l - 4}{k} = 4 - 2\frac{4 - 8k - 4}{k} = 4 - 2\frac{-8k}{k} = 4 + 16 = 20.\]
So the sum of the squares of the distances from $A$ and $B$ to the origin is $x_1^2 + x_2^2 + 32 = 20 + 32 = 52$.
The answer is: $52$.

Question (hint: positive numerical answer):
"Let $k, l > 0$ be parameters. The parabola $y = kx^2 - 2kx + l$ intersects the line $y = 4$ at two points $A$ and $B$. These points are distance 6 apart. What is the sum of the squares of the distances from $A$ and $B$ to the origin?"
Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:


First, we set the equation of the parabola equal to the equation of the line $y=4$:
\[4 = kx^2 - 2kx + l.\]
Rearranging, we get
\[kx^2 - 2kx + (l - 4) = 0.\]
This is a quadratic equation, and we know that the line intersects the parabola at two points $A$ and $B$ which are distance 6 apart. Therefore, the difference of the roots of the quadratic equation is 6. The difference of the roots of a quadratic equation $ax^2 + bx + c = 0$ is given by $\frac{\sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{a}$. In this case, $a = k$, $b = -2k$, and $c = l - 4$. So we have
\[6 = \frac{\sqrt{(-2k)^2 - 4k(l - 4)}}{k} = \frac{\sqrt{4k^2 - 4kl + 16k}}{k} = \sqrt{4k^2 - 4kl + 16k}.\]
Squaring both sides, we get
\[36 = 4k^2 - 4kl + 16k.\]
Rearranging, we get
\[4k^2 - 4kl + 16k - 36 = 0.\]
Dividing by 4, we get
\[k^2 - kl + 4k - 9 = 0.\]
This is a quadratic equation in $k$. Let's solve it for $k$. We can use the quadratic formula:
\[k = \frac{l \pm \sqrt{l^2 - 4(1)(-9)}}{2} = \frac{l \pm \sqrt{l^2 + 36}}{2}.\]
Since $k > 0$, we take the positive root:
\[k = \frac{l + \sqrt{l^2 + 36}}{2}.\]
Now, we need to find the sum of the squares of the distances from $A$ and $B$ to the origin. The distance from a point $(x, y)$ to the origin is $\sqrt{x^2 + y^2}$. For points on the parabola $y = kx^2 - 2kx + l$, we have $y = kx^2 - 2kx + l$, so the distance from a point $(x, kx^2 - 2kx + l)$ to the origin is $\sqrt{x^2 + (kx^2 - 2kx + l)^2}$. The sum of the squares of the distances from $A$ and $B$ to the origin is
\[\left(\sqrt{x_A^2 + (kx_A^2 - 2kx_A + l)^2}\right)^2 + \left(\sqrt{x_B^2 + (kx_B^2 - 2kx_B + l)^2}\right)^2.\]
Since $A$ and $B$ are symmetric with respect to the $y$-axis (because the line $y=4$ is symmetric with respect to the $y$-axis and the parabola $y=kx^2 - 2kx + l$ is also symmetric with respect to the $y$-axis), the $x$-coordinates of $A$ and $B$ are negatives of each other. Let's say $x_A = a$ and $x_B = -a$. Then the sum of the squares of the distances from $A$ and $B$ to the origin is
\[\left(\sqrt{a^2 + (ka^2 - 2ka + l)^2}\right)^2 + \left(\sqrt{(-a)^2 + (k(-a)^2 - 2k(-a) + l)^2}\right)^2.\]
This simplifies to
\[\left(\sqrt{a^2 + (ka^2 - 2ka + l)^2}\right)^2 + \left(\sqrt{a^2 + (ka^2 + 2ka + l)^2}\right)^2.\]
This expression is difficult to simplify further, but we can use the fact that the sum of the squares of the distances from $A$ and $B$ to the origin is twice the square of the distance from the midpoint of $A$ and $B$ to the origin. The midpoint of $A$ and $B$ is the point $(0, \frac{l}{2})$, so the distance from the midpoint to the origin is $\sqrt{0^2 + \left(\frac{l}{2}\right)^2} = \frac{l}{2}$. Therefore, the sum of the squares of the distances from $A$ and $B$ to the origin is $2\left(\frac{l}{2}\right)^2 = \frac{l^2}{2}$.

Now, we substitute the value of $k$ we found earlier:
\[k = \frac{l + \sqrt{l^2 + 36}}{2}.\]
We can simplify this expression:
\[2k = l + \sqrt{l^2 + 36}.\]
Squaring both sides, we get
\[4k^2 = l^2 + 2l\sqrt{l^2 + 36} + l^2 + 36.\]
Rearranging, we get
\[4k^2 - 2l^2 = 2l\sqrt{l^2 + 36} + 36.\]
Subtracting $2l^2$ from both sides, we get
\[4k^2 - 2l^2 - 36 = 2l\sqrt{l^2 + 36}.\]
Dividing by 2, we get
\[2k^2 - l^2 - 18 = l\sqrt{l^2 + 36}.\]
Squaring both sides, we get
\[4k^4 - 4l^2k^2 + l^4 + 36l^2 - l^2(l^2 + 36) = 0.\]
Expanding, we get
\[4k^4 - 4l^2k^2 + l^4 + 36l^2 - l^4 - 36l^2 = 0.\]
Simplifying, we get
\[4k^4 - 4l^2k^2 = 0.\]
Dividing by 4, we get
\[k^4 - l^2k^2 = 0.\]
Factoring, we get
\[k^2(k^2 - l^2) = 0.\]
Since $k > 0$, we have $k^2 - l^2 = 0$, or $k^2 = l^2$. Taking the square root of both sides, we get $k = l$.

Now, we substitute this into the equation $2k = l + \sqrt{l^2 + 36}$:
\[2l = l + \sqrt{l^2 + 36}.\]
Subtracting $l$ from both sides, we get
\[l = \sqrt{l^2 + 36}.\]
Squaring both sides, we get
\[l^2 = l^2 +

Question (hint: positive numerical answer):
"Let $k, l > 0$ be parameters. The parabola $y = kx^2 - 2kx + l$ intersects the line $y = 4$ at two points $A$ and $B$. These points are distance 6 apart. What is the sum of the squares of the distances from $A$ and $B$ to the origin?"
Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:


To find the points $A$ and $B$, we set $y = 4$ in the equation of the parabola:
\[4 = kx^2 - 2kx + l.\]
Rearranging terms, we have $kx^2 - 2kx + (l - 4) = 0$.

Since the parabola intersects the line $y = 4$ at two points, this quadratic equation has two distinct real roots, say $x_1$ and $x_2$, which represent the x-coordinates of points $A$ and $B$.

Given that the distance between $A$ and $B$ is 6, we have $|x_2 - x_1| = 6$. Using the fact that for a quadratic equation $ax^2 + bx + c = 0$, the roots $x_1$ and $x_2$ satisfy $x_1 + x_2 = -\frac{b}{a}$ and $x_1x_2 = \frac{c}{a}$, we can express the distance between $A$ and $B$ in terms of the coefficients of the quadratic equation:
\[(x_2 - x_1)^2 = (x_2 + x_1)^2 - 4x_1x_2 = \left(\frac{2k}{k}\right)^2 - 4\cdot\frac{l - 4}{k} = 4 - \frac{4(l - 4)}{k}.\]
Setting this equal to 36, we get
\[4 - \frac{4(l - 4)}{k} = 36 \Rightarrow \frac{4(l - 4)}{k} = -32 \Rightarrow 4(l - 4) = -32k \Rightarrow l - 4 = -8k \Rightarrow l = 4 - 8k.\]
Now we want to find the sum of the squares of the distances from $A$ and $B$ to the origin. The distance from a point $(x, y)$ to the origin is $\sqrt{x^2 + y^2}$. For point $A$ with coordinates $(x_1, 4)$, this distance is $\sqrt{x_1^2 + 4^2} = \sqrt{x_1^2 + 16}$. Similarly, for point $B$ with coordinates $(x_2, 4)$, the distance is $\sqrt{x_2^2 + 16}$.

The sum of the squares of the distances is then
\[(\sqrt{x_1^2 + 16})^2 + (\sqrt{x_2^2 + 16})^2 = x_1^2 + 16 + x_2^2 + 16 = x_1^2 + x_2^2 + 32.\]
We know that $x_1^2 + x_2^2 = (x_1 + x_2)^2 - 2x_1x_2 = \left(\frac{2k}{k}\right)^2 - 2\cdot\frac{l - 4}{k} = 4 - \frac{2(l - 4)}{k}$.

Substituting $l = 4 - 8k$ into this expression, we get
\[x_1^2 + x_2^2 = 4 - \frac{2((4 - 8k) - 4)}{k} = 4 - \frac{-16k}{k} = 4 + 16 = 20.\]
Therefore, the sum of the squares of the distances from $A$ and $B$ to the origin is $20 + 32 = 52$.
The answer is: $52$

Question (hint: positive numerical answer):
"Let $k, l > 0$ be parameters. The parabola $y = kx^2 - 2kx + l$ intersects the line $y = 4$ at two points $A$ and $B$. These points are distance 6 apart. What is the sum of the squares of the distances from $A$ and $B$ to the origin?"
Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:



First, we need to find the $x$-coordinates of points $A$ and $B$. Since the parabola $y = kx^2 - 2kx + l$ intersects the line $y = 4$, we can set these two equations equal to each other to get $kx^2 - 2kx + l = 4$. Rearranging, we have $kx^2 - 2kx + l - 4 = 0$. This is a quadratic equation, and we know that the solutions to this equation are the $x$-coordinates of points $A$ and $B$. Let's call these solutions $x_1$ and $x_2$. We are given that $|x_2 - x_1| = 6/k$.

Now, we want to find the sum of the squares of the distances from $A$ and $B$ to the origin. The distance from a point $(x, y)$ to the origin is $\sqrt{x^2 + y^2}$. So, the square of the distance from a point on the parabola to the origin is $x^2 + (kx^2 - 2kx + l)^2$. We want to find the sum of these squares for points $A$ and $B$, which means we want to find $x_1^2 + (kx_1^2 - 2kx_1 + l)^2 + x_2^2 + (kx_2^2 - 2kx_2 + l)^2$.

By Vieta's formulas, we know that $x_1 + x_2 = \frac{2k}{k} = 2$ and $x_1x_2 = \frac{l - 4}{k}$. We can use these formulas to express the desired sum in terms of $k$, $l$, $x_1$, and $x_2$.

We have $x_1^2 + x_2^2 = (x_1 + x_2)^2 - 2x_1x_2 = 2^2 - 2\cdot\frac{l - 4}{k} = 4 - \frac{2l - 8}{k} = \frac{4k - 2l + 8}{k}$.

Also, we have $(kx_1^2 - 2kx_1 + l)^2 + (kx_2^2 - 2kx_2 + l)^2 = k^2(x_1^2 + x_2^2) - 4k(kx_1x_2) + 2l(kx_1x_2) + l^2$.

Substituting the expressions for $x_1^2 + x_2^2$ and $x_1x_2$, we get
\begin{align*}
(kx_1^2 - 2kx_1 + l)^2 + (kx_2^2 - 2kx_2 + l)^2 &= k^2\left(\frac{4k - 2l + 8}{k}\right) - 4k\left(\frac{l - 4}{k}\right) + 2l\left(\frac{l - 4}{k}\right) + l^2 \\
&= 4k^2 - 2kl + 8k - 4l + 16 + 4l - 16 + 2l^2 - 8l + l^2 \\
&= 6l^2 - 10kl + 4k^2 + 8k.
\end{align*}

So the sum of the squares of the distances from $A$ and $B$ to the origin is $\frac{4k - 2l + 8}{k} + 6l^2 - 10kl + 4k^2 + 8k$.

To find the numerical value of this expression, we need to substitute the values of $k$ and $l$. However, we don't have enough information to do this yet. But we can express the final answer in terms of $k$ and $l$.

The sum of the squares of the distances from $A$ and $B$ to the origin is $\frac{4k - 2l + 8}{k} + 6l^2 - 10kl + 4k^2 + 8k$.

The value of this expression depends on the specific values of $k$ and $l$, which are not given in the problem. Therefore, we cannot find the numerical value of the sum of the squares of the distances from $A$ and $B$ to the origin without more information. The answer is: The sum of the squares of the distances from $A$ and $B$ to the origin is $\frac{4k - 2l + 8}{k} + 6l^2 - 10kl + 4k^2 + 8k$. However, we cannot find the numerical value without more information. So, we leave the expression as is. The answer is: $\frac{4k - 2l + 8}{k} + 6l^2 - 10kl + 4k^2 + 8k$.

Question (hint: positive numerical answer):
"Let $k, l > 0$ be parameters. The parabola $y = kx^2 - 2kx + l$ intersects the line $y = 4$ at two points $A$ and $B$. These points are distance 6 apart. What is the sum of the squares of the distances from $A$ and $B$ to the origin?"
Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:


The equation of the parabola is $y = kx^2 - 2kx + l$. The equation of the line is $y = 4$.
To find the points of intersection, we set the two equations equal to each other:
\[kx^2 - 2kx + l = 4.\]
Rearranging, we have $kx^2 - 2kx + l - 4 = 0$.
Let $x_1$ and $x_2$ be the x-coordinates of points $A$ and $B$, respectively. By Vieta's formulas, we have $x_1 + x_2 = \frac{2k}{k} = 2$ and $x_1x_2 = \frac{l - 4}{k}$.
Given that the distance between $A$ and $B$ is 6, we can use the distance formula to get
\[(x_2 - x_1)^2 = 6^2 = 36.\]
Expanding, we have $(x_2 - x_1)^2 = (x_2 + x_1)^2 - 4x_1x_2 = 4^2 - 4\left(\frac{l - 4}{k}\right) = 16 - \frac{4(l - 4)}{k}$.
Substituting the value of $x_1 + x_2$, we get
\[36 = 16 - \frac{4(l - 4)}{k}.\]
Simplifying, we have $\frac{4(l - 4)}{k} = 20$, or $l - 4 = 5k$.
Substituting this into the equation of the parabola at the point $(x_1, 4)$, we get
\[4 = kx_1^2 - 2kx_1 + l = kx_1^2 - 2kx_1 + 4 + 5k.\]
Rearranging, we have $kx_1^2 - 2kx_1 + 5k = 0$.
Using Vieta's formulas again, we have $x_1^2 + \left(\frac{2k}{k}\right)^2 - 2\cdot\frac{5k}{k} = 0$, or $x_1^2 + 4 - 10 = 0$.
Simplifying, we get $x_1^2 = 6$.
Similarly, we can find that $x_2^2 = 6$.
The sum of the squares of the distances from $A$ and $B$ to the origin is $x_1^2 + x_2^2 = 6 + 6 = 12$. The answer is: 12

Question (hint: positive numerical answer):
"Let $k, l > 0$ be parameters. The parabola $y = kx^2 - 2kx + l$ intersects the line $y = 4$ at two points $A$ and $B$. These points are distance 6 apart. What is the sum of the squares of the distances from $A$ and $B$ to the origin?"
Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:


To solve this problem, we first need to find the x-coordinates of points A and B.
The parabola $y = kx^2 - 2kx + l$ intersects the line $y = 4$, so we can set $kx^2 - 2kx + l = 4$.
Rearranging the equation gives $kx^2 - 2kx + l - 4 = 0$.
This is a quadratic equation in x, and we know that the distance between A and B is 6.
The quadratic formula gives us the x-coordinates of A and B as $\frac{2k \pm \sqrt{4k^2 - 4k(l - 4)}}{2k} = 1 \pm \frac{\sqrt{4k^2 - 4k(l - 4)}}{2k}$.
Let's denote these x-coordinates as $x_1$ and $x_2$, where $x_1 = 1 + \frac{\sqrt{4k^2 - 4k(l - 4)}}{2k}$ and $x_2 = 1 - \frac{\sqrt{4k^2 - 4k(l - 4)}}{2k}$.
The distance from A and B to the origin can be calculated as $\sqrt{x_1^2 + y_1^2}$ and $\sqrt{x_2^2 + y_2^2}$, respectively, where $y_1 = 4$ and $y_2 = 4$.
Therefore, the sum of the squares of the distances from A and B to the origin is $(x_1^2 + y_1^2) + (x_2^2 + y_2^2) = (x_1^2 + 16) + (x_2^2 + 16) = x_1^2 + x_2^2 + 32$.
We know that the distance between A and B is 6, so $|x_1 - x_2| = 6$.
Expanding $(x_1 - x_2)^2 = 36$ gives $x_1^2 - 2x_1x_2 + x_2^2 = 36$.
We can substitute $x_1x_2 = (1 + \frac{\sqrt{4k^2 - 4k(l - 4)}}{2k})(1 - \frac{\sqrt{4k^2 - 4k(l - 4)}}{2k}) = 1 - \frac{4k^2 - 4k(l - 4)}{4k^2} = 1 - (1 - \frac{l - 4}{k}) = \frac{l - 4}{k}$.
Thus, $x_1^2 + x_2^2 = 36 + 2\frac{l - 4}{k}$.
Finally, we substitute this into the sum of the squares of the distances: $(x_1^2 + x_2^2 + 32) = 36 + 2\frac{l - 4}{k} + 32 = 68 + 2\frac{l - 4}{k}$.
However, we know that the line $y = 4$ is tangent to the parabola $y = kx^2 - 2kx + l$ at the point of tangency, which is the midpoint of A and B.
The derivative of the parabola is $2kx - 2k$, and at the point of tangency, this is equal to the slope of the line $y = 4$, which is 0.
Therefore, $2kx - 2k = 0$ at the point of tangency, which gives $x = 1$.
Substituting $x = 1$ into the equation of the parabola gives $y = k - 2k + l = l - k$.
Since the point of tangency lies on the line $y = 4$, we have $l - k = 4$.
Substituting this into the sum of the squares of the distances gives $(68 + 2\frac{l - 4}{k}) = 68 + 2\frac{4}{k} = 68 + \frac{8}{k}$.
However, we also know that the line $y = 4$ is tangent to the parabola $y = kx^2 - 2kx + l$, so the discriminant of the quadratic equation must be zero.
The discriminant is $4k^2 - 4k(l - 4) = 0$.
Substituting $l - k = 4$ gives $4k^2 - 4k(4 - k + 4) = 0$, which simplifies to $4k^2 - 4k(8 - k) = 0$, or $4k^2 - 32k + 4k^2 = 0$, or $8k^2 - 32k = 0$.
Factoring out $8k$ gives $8k(k - 4) = 0$, so $k = 0$ or $k = 4$.
Since $k > 0$, we have $k = 4$.
Substituting this into the sum of the squares of the distances gives $68 + \frac{8}{4} = 68 + 2 = 70$.
Therefore, the sum of the squares of the distances from A and B to the origin is 70. The answer is: $70$

Question (hint: positive numerical answer):
"What is the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ when $x$ and $y$ range over all real numbers such that $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$?"
Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:



First, we notice that the expression $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ can be written as $\frac{1}{2}((5x-4y)^2 + (4x-5y)^2)$.
This is because $(5x-4y)^2 + (4x-5y)^2 = 25x^2 - 40xy + 16y^2 + 16x^2 - 40xy + 25y^2 = 41x^2 - 80xy + 41y^2 = 2 \cdot (20.5x^2 - 40xy + 20.5y^2) = 2 \cdot ((5x-4y)^2)$.

Now, we know that $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$. By the triangle inequality, we have $|x-2y| + |y-2x| \geq |(x-2y) - (y-2x)| = |x-2y-y+2x| = |3x-3y| = 3|x-y|$.
So, we have $3|x-y| = 40$, which implies $|x-y| = \frac{40}{3}$.

Now, we know that $(5x-4y)^2 + (4x-5y)^2 \geq 0$, because it's a sum of squares.
Therefore, the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ is $0$.

However, we need to check if there are values of $x$ and $y$ that satisfy the condition $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$ and make $(5x-4y)^2 + (4x-5y)^2 = 0$.

If $(5x-4y)^2 + (4x-5y)^2 = 0$, then we must have $5x-4y = 0$ and $4x-5y = 0$.
Solving this system of equations, we get $x = y$.

Now, we substitute $x = y$ into the equation $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$, we get $|x-2x| + |x-2x| = 40$, which simplifies to $|-x| + |-x| = 40$, or $2|-x| = 40$.
This gives us $|-x| = 20$, so $x = \pm 20$.

Since we want the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$, we should choose the negative value $x = -20$.

When $x = -20$, we have $y = -20$, and substituting these values into the expression $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$, we get $5(-20)^2 + 5(-20)^2 - 8(-20)(-20) = 2000 + 2000 - 3200 = 800$.

Therefore, the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ when $x$ and $y$ range over all real numbers such that $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$ is $800$. The answer is: $800$

Question (hint: positive numerical answer):
"What is the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ when $x$ and $y$ range over all real numbers such that $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$?"
Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:



First, we note that $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$ is equivalent to $|x-2y| = 20$ and $|y-2x| = 20$ or $|x-2y| = 20$ and $|y-2x| = -20$.
If $|x-2y| = 20$ and $|y-2x| = 20$, then $x-2y = \pm 20$ and $y-2x = \pm 20$.
If we add these two equations, we get $-3x = 0$ and $x = 0$.
Substituting this into $x-2y = 20$, we get $-2y = 20$ and $y = -10$.
Similarly, if $|x-2y| = 20$ and $|y-2x| = -20$, we get $x-2y = \pm 20$ and $2x-y = \pm 20$.
Adding these two equations, we get $3x = 0$ and $x = 0$.
Substituting this into $x-2y = -20$, we get $-2y = -20$ and $y = 10$.
So the possible values of $(x, y)$ are $(0, -10)$ and $(0, 10)$.
Now we evaluate $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ for these values:
For $(x, y) = (0, -10)$, we get $5(0)^2 + 5(-10)^2 - 8(0)(-10) = 500$.
For $(x, y) = (0, 10)$, we get $5(0)^2 + 5(10)^2 - 8(0)(10) = 500$.
So the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ is $500$. The answer is: $500$

Question (hint: positive numerical answer):
"What is the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ when $x$ and $y$ range over all real numbers such that $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$?"
Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:


First, we observe that the expression $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ can be rewritten as $(5x^2-8xy+5y^2)$. This is a perfect square trinomial, which can be factored as $(3x-5y)^2$.
Now, let's consider the equation $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$. By the triangle inequality, we have $|x-2y| + |y-2x| \geq |(x-2y) - (y-2x)| = |x-2y-y+2x| = |x-3y+2x| = |3x-3y| = 3|x-y|$. So, we have $3|x-y| = 40$, or $|x-y| = \frac{40}{3}$.
Now, let's consider the expression $(3x-5y)^2$. Since $(3x-5y)^2 \geq 0$ for all real numbers $x$ and $y$, the minimum value of $(3x-5y)^2$ is 0. This occurs when $3x-5y = 0$, or $3x = 5y$.
From $|x-y| = \frac{40}{3}$, we can substitute $3x = 5y$ into this equation to get $|3x-5x| = \frac{40}{3}$, or $|-2x| = \frac{40}{3}$. This gives us $2x = \frac{40}{3}$, or $x = \frac{20}{3}$. Then, $3x = 5y$ gives us $y = \frac{12}{3} = 4$.
Substituting $x = \frac{20}{3}$ and $y = 4$ into $(3x-5y)^2$, we get $\left(3\cdot\frac{20}{3}-5\cdot4\right)^2 = (20-20)^2 = 0$.
So, the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ is 0.
The answer is: $\boxed{0}$

Question (hint: positive numerical answer):
"What is the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ when $x$ and $y$ range over all real numbers such that $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$?"
Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:


To find the minimum value of the expression $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ given the constraint $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$, we can use the Cauchy-Schwarz inequality. The Cauchy-Schwarz inequality states that for any real numbers $a_1, a_2, ..., a_n$ and $b_1, b_2, ..., b_n$, we have
\[(a_1^2 + a_2^2 + ... + a_n^2)(b_1^2 + b_2^2 + ... + b_n^2) \geq (a_1b_1 + a_2b_2 + ... + a_nb_n)^2.\]
In this case, we can set $a_1 = x - 2y$, $a_2 = y - 2x$, $b_1 = 1$, and $b_2 = 1$. Then, we have
\[((x - 2y)^2 + (y - 2x)^2)(1^2 + 1^2) \geq ( (x - 2y)(1) + (y - 2x)(1) )^2.\]
Simplifying the left side gives
\[((x - 2y)^2 + (y - 2x)^2)(2) \geq ((x - 2y) + (y - 2x))^2.\]
Simplifying the right side gives
\[((x - 2y)^2 + (y - 2x)^2)(2) \geq (x - 2y + y - 2x)^2 = (-x + y)^2 = (y - x)^2.\]
So, we have
\[((x - 2y)^2 + (y - 2x)^2)(2) \geq (y - x)^2.\]
Expanding the left side gives
\[(x^2 - 4xy + 4y^2 + y^2 - 4xy + 4x^2)(2) \geq (y - x)^2.\]
Simplifying the left side gives
\[(5x^2 + 5y^2 - 8xy)(2) \geq (y - x)^2.\]
We are given that $|x - 2y| + |y - 2x| = 40$, which simplifies to $|y - x| = 20$. Thus, we have
\[(5x^2 + 5y^2 - 8xy)(2) \geq 20^2.\]
Dividing both sides by 2 gives
\[5x^2 + 5y^2 - 8xy \geq \frac{20^2}{2} = 200.\]
So, the minimum value of $5x^2 + 5y^2 - 8xy$ is 200. The answer is: $200$

Question (hint: positive numerical answer):
"What is the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ when $x$ and $y$ range over all real numbers such that $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$?"
Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:


To find the minimum value of the expression $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ subject to the constraint $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$, we can use the Cauchy-Schwarz inequality.
The Cauchy-Schwarz inequality states that for any real numbers $a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n$ and $b_1, b_2, \dots, b_n$, we have
\[(a_1^2 + a_2^2 + \dots + a_n^2)(b_1^2 + b_2^2 + \dots + b_n^2) \ge (a_1b_1 + a_2b_2 + \dots + a_nb_n)^2.\]

In our case, we can let $a_1 = x - 2y$, $a_2 = y - 2x$, $b_1 = 1$, and $b_2 = 1$. Then we have
\[(a_1^2 + a_2^2)(b_1^2 + b_2^2) \ge (a_1b_1 + a_2b_2)^2.\]
Substituting the values of $a_1$, $a_2$, $b_1$, and $b_2$, we get
\[((x - 2y)^2 + (y - 2x)^2)(1^2 + 1^2) \ge ((x - 2y)(1) + (y - 2x)(1))^2.\]
Simplifying, we have
\[((x - 2y)^2 + (y - 2x)^2)(2) \ge (x - 2y + y - 2x)^2.\]
Since $|x - 2y| + |y - 2x| = 40$, we know that $x - 2y + y - 2x = \pm 40$. Thus, we have
\[((x - 2y)^2 + (y - 2x)^2)(2) \ge 40^2.\]
Simplifying further, we get
\[(x - 2y)^2 + (y - 2x)^2 \ge \frac{40^2}{2} = 800.\]
Now, we can rewrite the expression $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ as
\[5(x^2 + y^2) - 8xy = 5\left[\left(\frac{x - 2y + y - 2x}{2}\right)^2 + \left(\frac{y - 2x - (x - 2y)}{2}\right)^2\right] - 8xy.\]
Substituting $x - 2y + y - 2x = \pm 40$, we have
\[5\left[\left(\frac{\pm 40}{2}\right)^2 + \left(\frac{\mp 40}{2}\right)^2\right] - 8xy = 5(400 + 400) - 8xy = 4000 - 8xy.\]
Therefore, the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ subject to the constraint $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$ is $4000 - 8xy$. Since the minimum value of $8xy$ is $0$ (when $x = y = 0$), the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ is $4000$. The answer is: $4000$

## QUESTION 1 - 5

Question (hint: positive numerical answer):
"What is the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ when $x$ and $y$ range over all real numbers such that $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$?"
Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:


First, let's consider the condition $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$.
We can rewrite this as $|x-2y| + |2y-x| = 40$.
By the triangle inequality, we know that $|a| + |b| \geq |a+b|$, so
$|x-2y| + |2y-x| \geq |(x-2y) + (2y-x)| = |0| = 0$.
But we are given that $|x-2y| + |2y-x| = 40$, so it must be the case that equality holds.
This means that the signs of $x-2y$ and $2y-x$ must be the same.
If $x-2y$ and $2y-x$ are both positive, then $x-2y = 2y-x$, which simplifies to $x=2y$.
If $x-2y$ and $2y-x$ are both negative, then $-(x-2y) = -(2y-x)$, which also simplifies to $x=2y$.
Therefore, we must have $x=2y$.
Substituting $x=2y$ into the equation $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$, we get
$|2y-2y| + |y-4y| = 40$, which simplifies to $0 + |-3y| = 40$, or $3|y| = 40$.
Therefore, $|y| = \frac{40}{3}$.
Since $y$ can be positive or negative, we have $y = \pm \frac{40}{3}$.
Substituting $y = \frac{40}{3}$ into $x=2y$, we get $x = \frac{80}{3}$.
Substituting $y = -\frac{40}{3}$ into $x=2y$, we get $x = -\frac{80}{3}$.
Therefore, the only solution that works is $(x, y) = \left(\frac{80}{3}, \frac{40}{3}\right)$ or $(x, y) = \left(-\frac{80}{3}, -\frac{40}{3}\right)$.
Now, let's substitute these values into the expression $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$:
For $(x, y) = \left(\frac{80}{3}, \frac{40}{3}\right)$, we have
\[5\left(\frac{80}{3}\right)^2 + 5\left(\frac{40}{3}\right)^2 - 8\left(\frac{80}{3}\right)\left(\frac{40}{3}\right) = \frac{6400}{9} + \frac{6400}{9} - \frac{6400}{3} = -\frac{6400}{9}.\]
For $(x, y) = \left(-\frac{80}{3}, -\frac{40}{3}\right)$, we have
\[5\left(-\frac{80}{3}\right)^2 + 5\left(-\frac{40}{3}\right)^2 - 8\left(-\frac{80}{3}\right)\left(-\frac{40}{3}\right) = \frac{6400}{9} + \frac{6400}{9} - \frac{6400}{3} = -\frac{6400}{9}.\]
Therefore, the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ is $-\frac{6400}{9}$. The answer is: $-\frac{6400}{9}$

"What is the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ when $x$ and $y$ range over all real numbers such that $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$?"
Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:


First, let's rewrite the given equation $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$ as $|2y-x| + |2x-y| = 40$.
Now, let's consider the expression $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$. We can rewrite it as $(5x^2-8xy+4y^2) + (y^2-8xy+4x^2) = (5x^2-8xy+4y^2) + (y^2-4xy+4x^2-4xy) = (3x-2y)^2 + (y-2x)^2$.
Since $(3x-2y)^2 \ge 0$ and $(y-2x)^2 \ge 0$, we have $(3x-2y)^2 + (y-2x)^2 \ge 0$.
Equality occurs when $3x-2y=0$ and $y-2x=0$, which gives $x=y=0$.
So, the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ is 0 when $x=y=0$.
Therefore, the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ is 0. The answer is: $0$

Question (hint: positive numerical answer):
"What is the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ when $x$ and $y$ range over all real numbers such that $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$?"
Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:


We start by using the hint given by the question and rewrite the equation $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$ as $|2y-x| + |2x-y| = 40$.
This can be rewritten as $|2y-x| + |x-2y| = 40$.
By the triangle inequality, we know that $|a| + |b| \geq |a+b|$, so we have $|2y-x| + |x-2y| \geq |(2y-x) + (x-2y)| = 0$.
Therefore, we must have $|2y-x| + |x-2y| = 0$ if and only if $2y-x = 0$ and $x-2y = 0$, which implies $x=y$.
Substituting $x=y$ into the equation $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$, we get $|x-2x| + |x-2x| = 40$, or $| -x | + | -x | = 40$, or $2|x| = 40$.
Therefore, $|x| = 20$, so $x = \pm 20$.

Now we substitute $x=y$ into the expression $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ to get $5x^2+5x^2-8x^2 = 2x^2$.
Since $x = \pm 20$, the minimum value of $2x^2$ is achieved when $x = -20$, and the minimum value is $2(-20)^2 = 800$.
Therefore, the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ is 800.
The answer is: $800$

Question (hint: positive numerical answer):
"What is the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ when $x$ and $y$ range over all real numbers such that $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$?"
Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:


We start by noting that $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$ can be rewritten as $|2y-x| + |2x-y| = 40$.
By the triangle inequality, $|a| + |b| \ge |a+b|$, so $|2y-x| + |2x-y| \ge |(2y-x) + (2x-y)| = |y| = 40$.
This implies that $|y| = 20$, and without loss of generality, we can assume $y = 20$ or $y = -20$.
Case 1: $y = 20$. Substituting into the equation $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$, we get $|x-40| + |20-2x| = 40$.
By the triangle inequality again, we have $|x-40| + |20-2x| \ge |(x-40) + (20-2x)| = |20-x| = 40$.
This implies that $|20-x| = 40$, so $x = -20$ or $x = 60$.
Case 2: $y = -20$. Substituting into the equation $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$, we get $|x+40| + |-20-2x| = 40$.
By the triangle inequality again, we have $|x+40| + |-20-2x| \ge |(x+40) + (-20-2x)| = |-20-x| = 40$.
This implies that $|-20-x| = 40$, so $x = -60$ or $x = 20$.
Now we substitute the possible values of $x$ and $y$ into the expression $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$:
When $x = -20$ and $y = 20$, we get $5(-20)^2 + 5(20)^2 - 8(-20)(20) = 2000 + 2000 + 3200 = 7200$.
When $x = 60$ and $y = 20$, we get $5(60)^2 + 5(20)^2 - 8(60)(20) = 18000 + 2000 - 9600 = 9400$.
When $x = -60$ and $y = -20$, we get $5(-60)^2 + 5(-20)^2 - 8(-60)(-20) = 18000 + 2000 - 9600 = 9400$.
When $x = 20$ and $y = -20$, we get $5(20)^2 + 5(-20)^2 - 8(20)(-20) = 2000 + 2000 + 3200 = 7200$.
Therefore, the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ is 7200. The answer is: $7200$

Question (hint: positive numerical answer):
"What is the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ when $x$ and $y$ range over all real numbers such that $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$?"
Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:


First, let's rewrite the expression $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ as $(5x^2-8xy+5y^2)$.
Now, we can complete the square for the expression inside the parentheses:
\[(5x^2-8xy+5y^2) = (x^2-2xy+y^2) + 4(x^2-2xy+y^2) = (x-y)^2 + 4(x-y)^2 = 5(x-y)^2.\]
So, the expression $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ is always non-negative (since it's equal to $5(x-y)^2$) and its minimum value is 0 when $x=y$.

Next, we need to find the values of $x$ and $y$ that satisfy the equation $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$.
If $x=y$, then $|x-2x| + |x-2x| = 0$, which does not equal 40.
However, if we let $x=2y$, then $|2y-2y| + |y-4y| = |0| + |-3y| = 3|y|$, and we want this to equal 40.
So, $3|y| = 40$, which means $|y| = \frac{40}{3}$.
Since $y$ can be either positive or negative, we have two cases to consider:
If $y > 0$, then $y = \frac{40}{3}$, and $x = 2y = \frac{80}{3}$.
If $y < 0$, then $y = -\frac{40}{3}$, and $x = 2y = -\frac{80}{3}$.

Now, we can substitute these values of $x$ and $y$ into the expression $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$:
If $x=\frac{80}{3}$ and $y=\frac{40}{3}$, then $5x^2+5y^2-8xy = 5\left(\frac{80}{3}\right)^2+5\left(\frac{40}{3}\right)^2-8\left(\frac{80}{3}\right)\left(\frac{40}{3}\right) = 0$.
If $x=-\frac{80}{3}$ and $y=-\frac{40}{3}$, then $5x^2+5y^2-8xy = 5\left(-\frac{80}{3}\right)^2+5\left(-\frac{40}{3}\right)^2-8\left(-\frac{80}{3}\right)\left(-\frac{40}{3}\right) = 0$.

In both cases, the value of the expression is 0. Therefore, the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ when $x$ and $y$ range over all real numbers such that $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$ is 0. The answer is: $0$

Question (hint: positive numerical answer):
"For how many positive integers $m$ does the equation \[\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}\] have $4$ distinct solutions?"
Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:



The equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has 4 distinct solutions.
We know that the absolute value function $\vert x \vert$ splits into two cases: $x$ if $x \geq 0$ and $-x$ if $x < 0$. So, we have four cases to consider:

1. $\vert x-1 -2 \vert = \frac{m}{100}$, when $x-1 \geq 0$. This simplifies to $\vert x-3 \vert = \frac{m}{100}$.
2. $\vert x-1 +2 \vert = \frac{m}{100}$, when $x-1 \geq 0$. This simplifies to $\vert x+1 \vert = \frac{m}{100}$.
3. $\vert -x+1 -2 \vert = \frac{m}{100}$, when $x-1 < 0$. This simplifies to $\vert -x-1 \vert = \frac{m}{100}$, or $\vert x+1 \vert = \frac{m}{100}$.
4. $\vert -x+1 +2 \vert = \frac{m}{100}$, when $x-1 < 0$. This simplifies to $\vert -x+3 \vert = \frac{m}{100}$, or $\vert x-3 \vert = \frac{m}{100}$.

From the above four cases, we see that the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ is equivalent to $\vert x-3 \vert = \frac{m}{100}$ or $\vert x+1 \vert = \frac{m}{100}$.

The equation $\vert x-3 \vert = \frac{m}{100}$ has two solutions: $x = 3 + \frac{m}{100}$ and $x = 3 - \frac{m}{100}$.
The equation $\vert x+1 \vert = \frac{m}{100}$ has two solutions: $x = -1 + \frac{m}{100}$ and $x = -1 - \frac{m}{100}$.

For the four solutions to be distinct, we require that the fractions $\frac{m}{100}$ are different from each other and from the numbers 1. This gives us the following conditions:

1. $\frac{m}{100} \neq 1$, so $m \neq 100$.
2. $\frac{m}{100} \neq -1 + 1 = 0$, so $m \neq 0$.
3. $\frac{m}{100} \neq -1 - 1 = -2$, so $m \neq -200$.

Since $m$ is a positive integer, the only possible values for $m$ are the positive integers from 1 to 99, excluding 0 and 100. There are thus 97 possible values for $m$.
The answer is: $97$.

Question (hint: positive numerical answer):
"For how many positive integers $m$ does the equation \[\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}\] have $4$ distinct solutions?"
Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:


The equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has $4$ distinct solutions.
This means that the expression inside the absolute value, $\vert x-1 \vert -2$, must be equal to $\frac{m}{100}$ or $-\frac{m}{100}$.
We can split this into two cases:
Case 1: $\vert x-1 \vert -2 = \frac{m}{100}$.
Adding $2$ to both sides gives $\vert x-1 \vert = 2 + \frac{m}{100}$.
This means that $x-1 = 2 + \frac{m}{100}$ or $x-1 = -2 - \frac{m}{100}$.
Simplifying these gives $x = 3 + \frac{m}{100}$ or $x = -1 - \frac{m}{100}$.
Case 2: $\vert x-1 \vert -2 = -\frac{m}{100}$.
Adding $2$ to both sides gives $\vert x-1 \vert = 2 - \frac{m}{100}$.
This means that $x-1 = 2 - \frac{m}{100}$ or $x-1 = -2 + \frac{m}{100}$.
Simplifying these gives $x = 3 - \frac{m}{100}$ or $x = -1 + \frac{m}{100}$.
So, the four distinct solutions are $x = 3 + \frac{m}{100}$, $x = -1 - \frac{m}{100}$, $x = 3 - \frac{m}{100}$, and $x = -1 + \frac{m}{100}$.
For these solutions to be distinct, the fractions $\frac{m}{100}$ must be different.
This means that $m$ must be a positive integer less than $100$.
So, we need to count the number of positive integers $m$ such that $1 \leq m \leq 100$.
There are $\boxed{100}$ such integers. The answer is: 100

Question (hint: positive numerical answer):
"For how many positive integers $m$ does the equation \[\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}\] have $4$ distinct solutions?"
Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:



The equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has 4 distinct solutions.
We know that $\frac{m}{100}$ must be positive because the absolute value of a quantity cannot be negative.
So $m$ must be positive.

The equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ can be rewritten as two separate equations:
$\vert x-1 \vert -2 = \frac{m}{100}$ and $\vert x-1 \vert -2 = -\frac{m}{100}$.

Let's solve the first equation $\vert x-1 \vert -2 = \frac{m}{100}$:
$\vert x-1 \vert = \frac{m}{100} + 2$.

The expression on the right side $\frac{m}{100} + 2$ must be positive, so $m > -200$.

The absolute value equation $\vert x-1 \vert = \frac{m}{100} + 2$ has two solutions:
$x-1 = \frac{m}{100} + 2$ and $x-1 = -(\frac{m}{100} + 2)$.

Solving these gives us $x = \frac{m}{100} + 3$ and $x = 1 - \frac{m}{100} - 2 = 1 - \frac{m+200}{100}$.

For the second equation $\vert x-1 \vert -2 = -\frac{m}{100}$, we have $\vert x-1 \vert = 2 - \frac{m}{100}$.

The expression on the right side $2 - \frac{m}{100}$ must be positive, so $m < 200$.

The absolute value equation $\vert x-1 \vert = 2 - \frac{m}{100}$ has two solutions:
$x-1 = 2 - \frac{m}{100}$ and $x-1 = - (2 - \frac{m}{100}) = \frac{m}{100} - 2$.

Solving these gives us $x = 3 - \frac{m}{100}$ and $x = \frac{m}{100} - 1$.

For the equation to have 4 distinct solutions, the four expressions for $x$ must be distinct.

We can see that the expressions for $x$ from the first and second equations are different, so we just need to make sure that the expressions for $x$ from the first set are different from those from the second set.

Comparing the four expressions for $x$:
$\frac{m}{100} + 3$, $1 - \frac{m+200}{100}$, $3 - \frac{m}{100}$, and $\frac{m}{100} - 1$.

We can see that $\frac{m}{100} + 3$ and $1 - \frac{m+200}{100}$ are different from $3 - \frac{m}{100}$ and $\frac{m}{100} - 1$.

So we just need to make sure that $\frac{m}{100} + 3$ is not equal to $3 - \frac{m}{100}$, and $1 - \frac{m+200}{100}$ is not equal to $\frac{m}{100} - 1$.

Simplifying these gives us $\frac{2m}{100} = 0$ and $\frac{m+100}{100} = 1$.

The first equation gives us $m = 0$, but $m$ must be positive, so this is not a valid solution.

The second equation gives us $m = 100$.

So the only positive integer $m$ that satisfies the conditions is $m = 100$.
The value of $m$ is 100.
The answer is: $1$

"For how many positive integers $m$ does the equation \[\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}\] have $4$ distinct solutions?"
Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:


The equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has 4 distinct solutions if and only if $\frac{m}{100}$ is strictly between 1 and 2. This is because the expression on the left side of the equation, $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert$, can take on any value from 0 to 3, and it takes on the value of $\frac{m}{100}$ exactly 4 times if $\frac{m}{100}$ is strictly between 1 and 2. Therefore, we have $1 < \frac{m}{100} < 2$, which implies $100 < m < 200$. The positive integers $m$ that satisfy this inequality are the integers from 101 to 199, inclusive. The number of these integers is $199 - 101 + 1 = 99$. The answer is: $99$

Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:



The equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has 4 distinct solutions if and only if $\frac{m}{100} = 2$. This is because the expression on the left side of the equation, $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert$, can take on values from 0 to 2, and it takes on the value of 2 exactly 4 times. Therefore, we set $\frac{m}{100} = 2$ and solve for $m$:
\[m = 2 \times 100 = 200.\]
So, there is only one positive integer $m$ that satisfies the condition, namely $m = 200$. The answer is: $1$

Question (hint: positive numerical answer):
"For how many positive integers $m$ does the equation \[\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}\] have $4$ distinct solutions?"
Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:



The equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has 4 distinct solutions.
We know that the absolute value function $|x|$ is equal to $x$ when $x \geq 0$ and $-x$ when $x < 0$. Therefore, the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ can be split into two cases:

Case 1: $\vert x-1 \vert -2 = \frac{m}{100}$.
In this case, we add 2 to both sides to get $\vert x-1 \vert = 2 + \frac{m}{100}$. Then we split this into two sub-cases:

Sub-case 1.1: $x-1 = 2 + \frac{m}{100}$. Solving for $x$ gives $x = 3 + \frac{m}{100}$.

Sub-case 1.2: $x-1 = -(2 + \frac{m}{100})$. Solving for $x$ gives $x = -1 - \frac{m}{100}$.

So in case 1, we have two solutions: $x = 3 + \frac{m}{100}$ and $x = -1 - \frac{m}{100}$.

Case 2: $\vert x-1 \vert -2 = -\frac{m}{100}$.
In this case, we add 2 to both sides to get $\vert x-1 \vert = 2 - \frac{m}{100}$. Then we split this into two sub-cases:

Sub-case 2.1: $x-1 = 2 - \frac{m}{100}$. Solving for $x$ gives $x = 3 - \frac{m}{100}$.

Sub-case 2.2: $x-1 = -(2 - \frac{m}{100})$. Solving for $x$ gives $x = -1 + \frac{m}{100}$.

So in case 2, we have two more solutions: $x = 3 - \frac{m}{100}$ and $x = -1 + \frac{m}{100}$.

In total, we have four distinct solutions: $x = 3 + \frac{m}{100}$, $x = -1 - \frac{m}{100}$, $x = 3 - \frac{m}{100}$, and $x = -1 + \frac{m}{100}$.

For these solutions to be distinct, the fractions $\frac{m}{100}$ must be different. Therefore, $m$ must be a positive integer such that $0 < \frac{m}{100} < 2$. This implies $0 < m < 200$.

The positive integers $m$ in this range are 1 through 199. However, we need to find the values of $m$ for which the equation has exactly 4 distinct solutions.

By analyzing the four solutions, we see that the solutions are distinct if and only if the fractions $\frac{m}{100}$ are different from each other and from 1 and -1. This happens if and only if $m$ is an integer such that $1 < \frac{m}{100} < 2$. This implies $100 < m < 200$.

The positive integers $m$ in this range are 101 through 199. However, we are asked for the number of such integers, so we simply count the number of integers in this range. The number of integers from 101 to 199 is $199 - 101 + 1 = 99$.

Therefore, the number of positive integers $m$ for which the equation has 4 distinct solutions is 99. The answer is: $99$

"For how many positive integers $m$ does the equation \[\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}\] have $4$ distinct solutions?"
Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:


The equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has $4$ distinct solutions.
This means that the expression inside the absolute value, $\vert x-1 \vert -2$, must be equal to $\frac{m}{100}$, $-\frac{m}{100}$, $2+\frac{m}{100}$, or $-2-\frac{m}{100}$.
Let's solve each case separately:
1. $\vert x-1 \vert -2 = \frac{m}{100}$: Adding $2$ to both sides gives $\vert x-1 \vert = 2+\frac{m}{100}$.
Taking the absolute value of $x-1$ gives two possible equations: $x-1 = 2+\frac{m}{100}$ or $x-1 = -(2+\frac{m}{100})$.
Simplifying these gives $x = 3+\frac{m}{100}$ or $x = -1-\frac{m}{100}$.
2. $\vert x-1 \vert -2 = -\frac{m}{100}$: Adding $2$ to both sides gives $\vert x-1 \vert = 2-\frac{m}{100}$.
Again, taking the absolute value of $x-1$ gives two possible equations: $x-1 = 2-\frac{m}{100}$ or $x-1 = -(2-\frac{m}{100})$.
Simplifying these gives $x = 3-\frac{m}{100}$ or $x = -1+\frac{m}{100}$.
3. $\vert x-1 \vert -2 = 2+\frac{m}{100}$: Adding $2$ to both sides gives $\vert x-1 \vert = 4+\frac{m}{100}$.
This equation has no solutions because the absolute value of a real number cannot be negative.
4. $\vert x-1 \vert -2 = -2-\frac{m}{100}$: Adding $2$ to both sides gives $\vert x-1 \vert = -\frac{m}{100}$.
This equation also has no solutions because the absolute value of a real number cannot be negative.

Therefore, the four distinct solutions are $x = 3+\frac{m}{100}$, $x = -1-\frac{m}{100}$, $x = 3-\frac{m}{100}$, and $x = -1+\frac{m}{100}$.
For these solutions to be distinct, the fractions $\frac{m}{100}$ must be different.
This means that $m$ must be one of the first $100$ positive integers.
Therefore, there are $100$ possible values of $m$ that satisfy the given condition.
The answer is: $100$

"For how many positive integers $m$ does the equation \[\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}\] have $4$ distinct solutions?"
Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:



The equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has $4$ distinct solutions.

We know that the absolute value function $\vert x \vert$ splits into two cases: $x$ if $x \geq 0$ and $-x$ if $x < 0$. So we can rewrite the given equation as two cases:

Case 1: $\vert x-1 -2 \vert = \frac{m}{100}$, which simplifies to $\vert x-3 \vert = \frac{m}{100}$. This further splits into two sub-cases:

Sub-case 1.1: $x-3 = \frac{m}{100}$, which gives $x = 3 + \frac{m}{100}$.

Sub-case 1.2: $-(x-3) = \frac{m}{100}$, which gives $x = 3 - \frac{m}{100}$.

Case 2: $\vert x-1 +2 \vert = \frac{m}{100}$, which simplifies to $\vert x+1 \vert = \frac{m}{100}$. This further splits into two sub-cases:

Sub-case 2.1: $x+1 = \frac{m}{100}$, which gives $x = -1 + \frac{m}{100}$.

Sub-case 2.2: $-(x+1) = \frac{m}{100}$, which gives $x = -1 - \frac{m}{100}$.

For the equation to have $4$ distinct solutions, the $x$-values from the sub-cases must be distinct. This gives us the following system of inequalities:

1. $3 + \frac{m}{100} \neq 3 - \frac{m}{100}$, which simplifies to $\frac{m}{100} \neq -\frac{m}{100}$, which holds true.

2. $3 + \frac{m}{100} \neq -1 + \frac{m}{100}$, which simplifies to $4 \neq 0$, which holds true.

3. $3 + \frac{m}{100} \neq -1 - \frac{m}{100}$, which simplifies to $4 \neq -2$, which holds true.

4. $3 - \frac{m}{100} \neq -1 + \frac{m}{100}$, which simplifies to $4 \neq 2$, which holds true.

5. $3 - \frac{m}{100} \neq -1 - \frac{m}{100}$, which simplifies to $4 \neq -4$, which holds true.

6. $-1 + \frac{m}{100} \neq -1 - \frac{m}{100}$, which simplifies to $\frac{m}{100} \neq -\frac{m}{100}$, which holds true.

So all the inequalities hold true, and we can conclude that the positive integer $m$ can be any positive integer from $1$ to $100$, inclusive. The number of such positive integers is $100$.
The answer is: $100$

Question (hint: positive numerical answer):
"For how many positive integers $m$ does the equation \[\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}\] have $4$ distinct solutions?"
Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:


The equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has $4$ distinct solutions.
The expression inside the absolute value, $\vert x-1 \vert -2$, can be positive or negative.
If it's positive, we have $\vert x-1 \vert -2 = \frac{m}{100}$.
If it's negative, we have $-\left(\vert x-1 \vert -2\right) = \frac{m}{100}$, or $\vert x-1 \vert -2 = -\frac{m}{100}$.
Solving the first equation, we get $\vert x-1 \vert = 2 + \frac{m}{100}$.
This implies two cases: $x-1 = 2 + \frac{m}{100}$ or $x-1 = -(2 + \frac{m}{100})$.
Solving the second equation, we get $\vert x-1 \vert = 2 - \frac{m}{100}$.
This implies two more cases: $x-1 = 2 - \frac{m}{100}$ or $x-1 = -(2 - \frac{m}{100})$.
Simplifying these equations, we have:
For the first equation, we have $x = 3 + \frac{m}{100}$ and $x = -1 - \frac{m}{100}$.
For the second equation, we have $x = 3 - \frac{m}{100}$ and $x = -1 + \frac{m}{100}$.
The solutions must be distinct, so we require that $3 + \frac{m}{100} \neq -1 - \frac{m}{100}$, $3 + \frac{m}{100} \neq 3 - \frac{m}{100}$, $-1 - \frac{m}{100} \neq -1 + \frac{m}{100}$, and $3 - \frac{m}{100} \neq -1 + \frac{m}{100}$.
Simplifying these conditions, we find that $m$ must be positive and less than $100$.
Therefore, the number of positive integers $m$ that satisfy the conditions is $99$. The answer is: $99$

Question (hint: positive numerical answer):
"For how many positive integers $m$ does the equation \[\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}\] have $4$ distinct solutions?"
Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:


The equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has 4 distinct solutions if and only if $\frac{m}{100}$ is equal to the value of $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert$ at 4 different points.

The function $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert$ is a "V" shape with vertices at $x=1-2= -1$, $x=1$, and $x=1+2=3$. Between $-1$ and $1$, the function is equal to $-(x-1) - 2 = -x + 1 - 2 = -x - 1$. Between $1$ and $3$, the function is equal to $x-1 - 2 = x - 3$.

For $x$ less than $-1$, the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ becomes $\vert -x - 1 - 2 \vert = \vert -x - 3 \vert = -(-x - 3) = x + 3$. So we want to find $m$ such that $x + 3 = \frac{m}{100}$ has one solution less than $-1$. This gives $x = -3 - \frac{m}{100}$. For this to be less than $-1$, we need $-3 - \frac{m}{100} < -1$, or $\frac{m}{100} > 2$, or $m > 200$.

For $-1 \le x \le 1$, the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ becomes $\vert -x - 1 - 2 \vert = \vert -x - 3 \vert = -(-x - 3) = x + 3$, which we have already considered.

For $1 \le x \le 3$, the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ becomes $\vert x - 1 - 2 \vert = \vert x - 3 \vert = -(x - 3) = -x + 3$. So we want to find $m$ such that $-x + 3 = \frac{m}{100}$ has two solutions in the interval $[1,3]$. This gives $x = 3 - \frac{m}{100}$. For $x$ to be in the interval $[1,3]$, we need $1 \le 3 - \frac{m}{100} \le 3$, or $0 \le \frac{m}{100} \le 2$, or $0 \le m \le 200$.

For $x \ge 3$, the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ becomes $\vert x - 1 - 2 \vert = \vert x - 3 \vert = x - 3$. So we want to find $m$ such that $x - 3 = \frac{m}{100}$ has one solution greater than $3$. This gives $x = 3 + \frac{m}{100}$. For this to be greater than $3$, we need $3 + \frac{m}{100} > 3$, or $\frac{m}{100} > 0$, or $m > 0$.

Therefore, the values of $m$ that work are those in the range $0 < m \le 200$. The positive integers in this range are 1 through 200, but not including 0. The number of positive integers in this range is 200.
The value of $m$ that works are those in the range $0 < m \le 200$. The number of positive integers in this range is 200.
The value of $m$ that works are those in the range $0 < m \le 200$. The number of positive integers in this range is 200. The answer is: $200$

The equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has 4 distinct solutions if and only if $\frac{m}{100} = 2$.

To see why this is true, let's first understand the graph of the function $y = \vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert$.

The function is composed of four line segments. It starts at $(1-2,0)=( -1,0)$, then goes up to $(1,2)$, then down to $(1+2,2) = (3,2)$, and finally back down to $(1+3,0) = (4,0)$.

The equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has 4 distinct solutions when the right side of the equation, $\frac{m}{100}$, is equal to the height of the graph, which is 2.

Setting $\frac{m}{100} = 2$, we get $m = 200$. Therefore, the only positive integer $m$ for which the equation has 4 distinct solutions is 200. The answer is: $\boxed{1}$

Question (hint: positive numerical answer):
"For how many positive integers $m$ does the equation \[\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}\] have $4$ distinct solutions?"
Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:



The equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has 4 distinct solutions.
The expression $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert$ is equal to 0 when $\vert x-1 \vert = 2$, which gives us $x = 3$ or $x = -1$.
When $\vert x-1 \vert > 2$, the expression $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert$ is equal to $\vert x-1 \vert - 2$.
When $\vert x-1 \vert < 2$, the expression $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert$ is equal to $2 - \vert x-1 \vert$.
So, the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ can be rewritten as two separate equations:
1. $\vert x-1 \vert - 2 = \frac{m}{100}$, when $x > 3$ or $x < -1$.
2. $2 - \vert x-1 \vert = \frac{m}{100}$, when $-1 < x < 3$.
For the first equation, we have $\vert x-1 \vert = 2 + \frac{m}{100}$.
This gives us two more equations: $x - 1 = 2 + \frac{m}{100}$ and $-(x - 1) = 2 + \frac{m}{100}$.
Solving these equations gives us $x = 3 + \frac{m}{100}$ and $x = -1 - \frac{m}{100}$.
For the second equation, we have $\vert x-1 \vert = 2 - \frac{m}{100}$.
This gives us two more equations: $x - 1 = 2 - \frac{m}{100}$ and $-(x - 1) = 2 - \frac{m}{100}$.
Solving these equations gives us $x = 3 - \frac{m}{100}$ and $x = -1 + \frac{m}{100}$.
So, the four distinct solutions are $x = 3 + \frac{m}{100}$, $x = -1 - \frac{m}{100}$, $x = 3 - \frac{m}{100}$, and $x = -1 + \frac{m}{100}$.
For these solutions to be distinct, we require that $\frac{m}{100} \neq 2$.
Therefore, the value of $m$ must be less than 200.
The positive integers $m$ for which the equation has 4 distinct solutions are 1, 2, 3, ..., 199.
There are 199 such positive integers. The answer is: $199$

Question (hint: positive numerical answer):
"For how many positive integers $m$ does the equation \[\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}\] have $4$ distinct solutions?"
Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:


The equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has $4$ distinct solutions.
For the expression inside the absolute value, $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert$, to be equal to a positive number $\frac{m}{100}$, the expression inside the absolute value must be less than $- \frac{m}{100}$ or greater than $\frac{m}{100}$. This is because the absolute value of a number is either positive or zero, and thus cannot be negative.
So we have two cases to consider:
1. $\vert x-1 \vert -2 < - \frac{m}{100}$, which simplifies to $\vert x-1 \vert < 2 - \frac{m}{100}$. This further simplifies to $- (2 - \frac{m}{100}) < x-1 < 2 - \frac{m}{100}$, which simplifies to $1 - 2 + \frac{m}{100} < x < 1 + 2 - \frac{m}{100}$, or $\frac{m}{100} < x < 3 - \frac{m}{100}$.
2. $\vert x-1 \vert -2 > \frac{m}{100}$, which simplifies to $\vert x-1 \vert > 2 + \frac{m}{100}$. This further simplifies to $x-1 < - (2 + \frac{m}{100})$ or $x-1 > 2 + \frac{m}{100}$, which simplifies to $x < 1 - 2 - \frac{m}{100}$ or $x > 1 + 2 + \frac{m}{100}$, or $x < -1 - \frac{m}{100}$ or $x > 3 + \frac{m}{100}$.
To have $4$ distinct solutions, the distance between the two outer bounds ($-1 - \frac{m}{100}$ and $3 + \frac{m}{100}$) must be greater than the distance between the two inner bounds ($\frac{m}{100}$ and $3 - \frac{m}{100}$). This gives us the inequality $3 + \frac{m}{100} - (-1 - \frac{m}{100}) > 3 - \frac{m}{100} - \frac{m}{100}$, which simplifies to $4 + \frac{2m}{100} > 3 - \frac{2m}{100}$.
Solving this inequality gives $4 + \frac{2m}{100} > 3 - \frac{2m}{100}$, or $\frac{4m}{100} > 1$, or $m > 25$. The smallest integer $m$ that satisfies this inequality is $26$.
Therefore, there is only one positive integer $m$ for which the equation has $4$ distinct solutions, and that is $m=26$. The answer is: $1$

Question (hint: positive numerical answer):
"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"
Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:


The expression $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ is true if and only if at least one of the factors is zero.
For the first factor to be zero, we must have either $\vert x + y \vert - 10 = 0$ or $\vert x - y \vert - 10 = 0$, which means $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ or $\vert x - y \vert = 10$.
For the second factor to be zero, we must have either $\vert x \vert - 8 = 0$ or $\vert y \vert - 8 = 0$, which means $\vert x \vert = 8$ or $\vert y \vert = 8$.
The solutions to $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ are the lines $x + y = 10$ and $x + y = -10$, and the solutions to $\vert x - y \vert = 10$ are the lines $x - y = 10$ and $x - y = -10$.
The solutions to $\vert x \vert = 8$ are the lines $x = 8$ and $x = -8$, and the solutions to $\vert y \vert = 8$ are the lines $y = 8$ and $y = -8$.
The intersection points of these lines are $(8, 2)$, $(8, -2)$, $(-8, 2)$, and $(-8, -2)$.
The polygon formed by these points is a square with side length $10$, so its area is $10^2 = 100$.
The answer is: $100$

Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:


The expression $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2)$ is equal to zero if and only if either $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$.

This means that either $\vert x + y \vert = 10$, $\vert x - y \vert = 10$, $\vert x \vert = 8$, or $\vert y \vert = 8$.

The equations $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$ represent two pairs of lines in the coordinate plane, forming a square with side length 10. The equations $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$ represent two pairs of lines in the coordinate plane, forming a square with side length 16.

The intersection of these two squares is the convex polygon whose area we want to find. This polygon is a square with side length 10, so its area is $10^2 = 100$. The answer is: $100$

Question (hint: positive numerical answer):
"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"
Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:


The equation $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + (\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ implies that $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$.
This means that $x + y = \pm 10$ and $x - y = \pm 10$.
Solving these equations, we find that the points $(x, y)$ that satisfy the first equation are $(5, 5)$, $(5, -5)$, $(-5, 5)$, and $(-5, -5)$.
Similarly, the points $(x, y)$ that satisfy the second equation are $(10, 0)$, $(0, 10)$, $(-10, 0)$, and $(0, -10)$.
Therefore, the points that satisfy the given equation are the intersection points of these two sets of points, which are $(5, 5)$, $(5, -5)$, $(-5, 5)$, $(-5, -5)$, $(10, 0)$, $(0, 10)$, $(-10, 0)$, and $(0, -10)$.
These points form a square with side length $10\sqrt{2}$.
The area of this square is $(10\sqrt{2})^2 = 200$.
Therefore, the area of the convex polygon is $200$. The answer is: $200$

"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"
Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:


The expression $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2)$ equals zero if and only if at least one of the factors equals zero.
This means that either $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$.
The first equation can only be satisfied if $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. This implies that $x = \pm 10$ and $y = \pm 10$. So these are the vertices of the square.
The second equation can only be satisfied if $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$. This implies that $x = \pm 8$ and $y = \pm 8$. So these are the vertices of the square.
Therefore, the points that satisfy the given equation are the vertices of a square with side length 10.
The area of a square is given by the square of the length of its side, so the area of this square is $10^2 = 100$. The answer is: $100$

"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"
Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:


The equation given is a product of two expressions equal to zero. This means that either the first expression is zero or the second expression is zero.
The first expression is $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)$, and this equals zero if and only if $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$.
The second expression is $((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2)$, and this equals zero if and only if $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$.
The solutions to $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$ are the lines $x + y = 10$, $x + y = -10$, $x - y = 10$, and $x - y = -10$.
The solutions to $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$ are the lines $x = 8$, $x = -8$, $y = 8$, and $y = -8$.
The lines $x + y = 10$, $x + y = -10$, $x - y = 10$, and $x - y = -10$ form a square with side length 10. The lines $x = 8$, $x = -8$, $y = 8$, and $y = -8$ form a square with side length 16.
The intersection of these two squares is a smaller square with side length 6 (since the side length of the smaller square is the difference between the side lengths of the larger and smaller squares).
The area of the smaller square is $6^2 = 36$. So, the area of the convex polygon is 36.
The answer is: $36$

Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:


The expression $A \cdot B = 0$ means that either $A = 0$ or $B = 0$. So, the given equation is equivalent to either $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$.

The equation $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ implies that $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. These are the equations of two lines in the plane, so they do not enclose a region.

The equation $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ implies that $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$, which are the equations of four lines in the plane. These lines form a square with side length 16, so the area of the square is $16^2 = 256$.

Therefore, the area of the convex polygon is 256. The answer is: $256$

Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:


The product of two numbers is zero if and only if at least one of the numbers is zero. So we have two cases to consider:

Case 1: $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$. This can only happen if $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. The only way this can happen is if $x = 0$ and $y = 0$.

Case 2: $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$. This can only happen if $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$. This means $-8 \leq x \leq 8$ and $-8 \leq y \leq 8$.

Combining these two cases, we see that the points $(x, y)$ that satisfy the equation are all the points in the square with vertices at $(8, 8), (8, -8), (-8, 8),$ and $(-8, -8)$. The side length of this square is $16$, so its area is $16^2 = 256$. The answer is: $256$

Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:


The expression $A \cdot B = 0$ means that at least one of the expressions $A$ or $B$ is zero. So, the given equation is equivalent to either $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$.
For the first equation to be zero, we must have $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. This means that $x + y = \pm 10$ and $x - y = \pm 10$. Solving these four equations, we get the vertices of the square: $(8, 2)$, $(8, -2)$, $(-8, -2)$, and $(-8, 2)$.
For the second equation to be zero, we must have $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$, which means that $x = \pm 8$ and $y = \pm 8$. This gives us four more vertices: $(8, 8)$, $(8, -8)$, $(-8, -8)$, and $(-8, 8)$.
So, the polygon is a square with side length 16. The area of a square is the square of its side length, so the area of this square is $16^2 = 256$.

Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:


The expression $AB=0$ is equivalent to $A=0$ or $B=0$. Therefore, the given equation is equivalent to either $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2=0$ or $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2=0$.
The first equation is satisfied if and only if $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$, which implies that $x + y = \pm 10$ and $x - y = \pm 10$. Solving these equations gives us the vertices of the square: $(8,2)$, $(8,-2)$, $(-8,2)$, and $(-8,-2)$.
The second equation is satisfied if and only if $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$, which implies that $x = \pm 8$ and $y = \pm 8$. This gives us the vertices of the square: $(8,8)$, $(8,-8)$, $(-8,8)$, and $(-8,-8)$.
Combining these two squares, we obtain a rectangle with side lengths $16$ and $16$, so its area is $16^2 = 256$. The answer is: $256$

Question (hint: positive numerical answer):
"A function $f: \mathbb N \to \mathbb N$ satisfies the following two conditions for all positive integers $n$:$f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$ and $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$. Calculate $f(100)$."
Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:


To find $f(100)$, we need to use the given equations.
First, let's try to find $f(1)$ using the second equation: $f(2 \cdot 1) = 2f(1) + 1 \implies f(2) = 2f(1) + 1$.
But we also know that $f(f(f(1))) = 8 \cdot 1 - 7 = 1$.
Since $f(f(f(1))) = 1$, and $f(f(f(1))) = f(f(2))$ (because $f(1) = 2$), we have $f(f(2)) = 1$.
Using the second equation again, we have $f(2f(1) + 1) = 1$.
Let $f(1) = a$. Then we have $f(2a + 1) = 1$.
But we also know that $f(2 \cdot 1) = 2f(1) + 1 \implies f(2) = 2a + 1$.
So we have $f(f(2)) = f(2a + 1) = 1$.
Comparing this with $f(f(f(1))) = 1$, we can see that $f(1) = 1$.
Now we can use the second equation to find $f(2)$: $f(2 \cdot 1) = 2f(1) + 1 \implies f(2) = 2 \cdot 1 + 1 = 3$.
Now we can use the first equation to find $f(f(f(1)))$: $f(f(f(1))) = 8 \cdot 1 - 7 = 1$.
But we also know that $f(f(f(1))) = f(f(2))$ (because $f(1) = 2$), so we have $f(f(2)) = 1$.
Using the second equation again, we have $f(2f(1) + 1) = 1$.
Let $f(1) = a$. Then we have $f(2a + 1) = 1$.
But we also know that $f(2 \cdot 1) = 2f(1) + 1 \implies f(2) = 2a + 1$.
So we have $f(f(2)) = f(2a + 1) = 1$.

Question (hint: positive numerical answer):
"A function $f: \mathbb N \to \mathbb N$ satisfies the following two conditions for all positive integers $n$:$f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$ and $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$. Calculate $f(100)$."
Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:



We are given that $f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$ and $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$. We want to find $f(100)$.

First, let's try to find $f(1)$ using the second equation. We have $f(2) = 2f(1) + 1$. But we don't know the value of $f(1)$ yet.

However, we can substitute $n=1$ into the first equation to get $f(f(f(1)))=8*1-7=1$.

Since $f(f(f(1)))=1$, this means that $f(f(1))$ is the only value that $f(x)$ can take such that $f(x)=1$. So we have $f(f(1))=1$.

Again using the second equation, we substitute $n=f(1)$ to get $f(2f(1))=2f(f(1))+1 \implies f(2f(1))=2*1+1=3$.

But we also know from the first equation that $f(f(f(1)))=1$, and since $f(1)=f(f(f(1)))$, we have $f(1)=1$.

Now we can substitute $n=1$ into the second equation to get $f(2)=2f(1)+1=2*1+1=3$.

Now we have found $f(1)=1$ and $f(2)=3$. We can use these values to find $f(3)$ using the second equation: $f(2*3)=2f(3)+1 \implies f(6)=2f(3)+1$.

But we know from the first equation that $f(f(f(3)))=8*3-7=13$. Since $f(6)=f(f(f(3)))$, we have $f(6)=13$.

So we have $2f(3)+1=13 \implies 2f(3)=12 \implies f(3)=6$.

Now we can continue this process to find $f(4)$, $f(5)$, etc. until we reach $f(100)$. However, this method can be quite tedious.

A quicker way is to observe that the function $f(n)=2n-1$ satisfies both given conditions.

For the first condition, $f(f(f(n)))=f(f(2n-1))=f(4n-3)=8n-7$.

For the second condition, $f(2n)=2(2n-1)+1=4n-1=2f(n)+1$.

So the function $f(n)=2n-1$ is a solution to the given problem. Therefore, $f(100)=2*100-1=199$.
The value of $f(100)$ is 199. The answer is: $199$

"A function $f: \mathbb N \to \mathbb N$ satisfies the following two conditions for all positive integers $n$:$f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$ and $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$. Calculate $f(100)$."
Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:


To find $f(100)$, we first need to find a pattern in the function $f$. We know that $f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$. Let's try to find the value of $f(n)$ for some small values of $n$.

For $n=1$, we have $f(f(f(1)))=8(1)-7=1$. So $f(f(1))=1$.
For $n=2$, we have $f(f(f(2)))=8(2)-7=9$. So $f(f(2))=9/2$.
For $n=3$, we have $f(f(f(3)))=8(3)-7=17$. So $f(f(3))=17/2$.
For $n=4$, we have $f(f(f(4)))=8(4)-7=23$. So $f(f(4))=23/2$.

From these examples, we can observe a pattern: $f(n)=\frac{2n-1}{1}$ for odd $n$, and $f(n)=\frac{2n}{2}=n$ for even $n$.

Now we can calculate $f(100)$ using this pattern. Since $100$ is even, we have $f(100)=100$.

Therefore, the value of $f(100)$ is $100$. The answer is: $100$

Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:


We are given that $f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$ and $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$.
To find $f(100)$, we can first find $f(50)$ using the second equation.
We know that $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$. Setting $n=50$, we have $f(100)=2f(50)+1$.
Now we need to find $f(50)$.
We can use the first equation to find $f(f(f(50)))=8(50)-7=393$.
Since $f(f(f(50)))=f(f(f(n)))$ for $n=50$, we have $f(f(f(50)))=f(f(f(n)))=393$.
So $f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$ implies that $f(f(f(50)))=8(50)-7=393$.
Therefore, $393=f(f(f(50)))=8(50)-7=393$.
This tells us that $f(f(50))=50$.
Now we can use the second equation to find $f(50)$.
Setting $n=25$ in the equation $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$, we get $f(50)=2f(25)+1$.
We need to find $f(25)$.
Using the first equation again, we have $f(f(f(25)))=8(25)-7=193$.
So $f(f(f(25)))=f(f(f(n)))=193$ implies that $f(f(f(25)))=193$.
Therefore, $193=f(f(f(25)))=8(25)-7=193$.
This tells us that $f(f(25))=25$.
Now we can use the second equation to find $f(25)$.
Setting $n=12.5$ (which is not an integer), we get a contradiction, so there must be a mistake in our reasoning.
Let's try a different approach.
From $f(f(f(50)))=393$, we can say that $f(50)$ is a number such that when it is input into the function $f$ three times, the output is $393$.
From $f(f(f(25)))=193$, we can say that $f(25)$ is a number such that when it is input into the function $f$ three times, the output is $193$.
We notice that the outputs $393$ and $193$ are both of the form $8n-7$ for some integer $n$.
This suggests that the function $f$ is such that $f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$ for all positive integers $n$.
Now we can use this information to find $f(100)$.
From $f(f(f(100)))=8(100)-7=793$, we know that $f(100)$ is a number such that when it is input into the function $f$ three times, the output is $793$.
So we have $f(f(f(100)))=793$.
Since $f(f(f(100)))=f(f(f(n)))$ for $n=100$, we have $f(f(f(100)))=f(f(f(n)))=793$.
Therefore, $793=f(f(f(100)))=8(100)-7=793$.
This tells us that $f(f(100))=100$.
Now we can use the second equation to find $f(100)$.
Setting $n=50$ in the equation $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$, we get $f(100)=2f(50)+1$.
We already know that $f(50)=50$, so we have $f(100)=2(50)+1=101$.
Therefore, $f(100)=101$.
The value of $f(100)$ is $101$. The answer is: $101$

Question (hint: positive numerical answer):
"A function $f: \mathbb N \to \mathbb N$ satisfies the following two conditions for all positive integers $n$:$f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$ and $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$. Calculate $f(100)$."
Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:


To find $f(100)$, we need to first understand the properties of the function $f$.
We know that $f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$. If we set $n=f(n)$, we get $f(f(f(f(n))))=8f(n)-7$. But we also know that $f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$, so we can substitute $n=f(n)$ into this equation to get $f(8f(n)-7)=8f(n)-7$.
Now, let's consider $n=1$. We have $f(f(f(1)))=8(1)-7=1$. Since $f(f(f(1)))=1$, we can conclude that $f(1)=1$.
Using the equation $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$, we can find $f(2)=2f(1)+1=2(1)+1=3$.
Then, we can find $f(4)=2f(2)+1=2(3)+1=7$.
Continuing this process, we find $f(8)=15$, $f(16)=31$, and so on. We notice that $f(2^k)=2f(2^{k-1})+1=2^2f(2^{k-2})+2^1+1=...=2^k-1$. So $f(n)=n-1$ for all powers of 2.
Now, let's try to find $f(100)$. Since $100=2^2 \cdot 25$, we can use the property $f(ab)=f(a)f(b)$ if $a$ and $b$ are coprime. We have $f(100)=f(2^2 \cdot 25)=f(2^2)f(25)=31 \cdot f(5)$.
We need to find $f(5)$. Since $5$ is not a power of $2$, we can't directly apply the formula we found earlier. However, we can use the equation $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$. Setting $n=2$, we get $f(4)=2f(2)+1=7$. Setting $n=4$, we get $f(8)=2f(4)+1=15$. Continuing this process, we find $f(16)=31$. Now, since $5$ and $16$ are coprime, we can use the property $f(ab)=f(a)f(b)$ to find $f(5)$. We have $f(5)=f(16 \cdot \frac{5}{16})=f(16)f(\frac{5}{16})=31 \cdot f(\frac{5}{16})$.
We notice that $f(\frac{5}{16})$ is the value of $f$ at a number less than $1$, which doesn't make sense in the context of this problem. However, we can use the equation $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$ to find $f(5)$ indirectly. We have $f(8)=2f(4)+1=15$. Since $5$ is between $4$ and $8$, we can use the equation $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$ to find $f(5)$. We have $f(5)=2f(\frac{5}{2})+1=2f(2.5)+1=2(2f(1.25)+1)+1=2(2(2f(0.625)+1)+1)+1=...=11$.
So $f(5)=11$.
Finally, we can find $f(100)=f(2^2 \cdot 25)=f(2^2)f(25)=31 \cdot f(5)=31 \cdot 11=341$.
Therefore, $f(100)=341$. The answer is: $341$

Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:


To find $f(100)$, we need to use the given equations to find the value of $f(n)$ for different values of $n$ and eventually reach $n=100$.

From the second equation, we know that $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$. If we let $n=1$, we get $f(2)=2f(1)+1$.

Now, we use the first equation $f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$. If we let $n=1$, we get $f(f(f(1)))=8*1-7=1$. Since $f(2)=2f(1)+1$, we can substitute $f(2)$ with $2f(1)+1$ in the equation $f(f(f(1)))=1$. This gives us $f(2f(1)+1)=1$.

We know that $f(2)=2f(1)+1$, so we can substitute $f(2)$ with $2f(1)+1$ in the equation $f(2f(1)+1)=1$. This gives us $f(2f(1)+1)=1$.

Now, we have $f(2f(1)+1)=1$. Since $f(2)=2f(1)+1$, we can substitute $2f(1)+1$ with $f(2)$ in the equation $f(2f(1)+1)=1$. This gives us $f(f(2))=1$.

Now, we can use the second equation $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$ to find $f(100)$. If we let $n=50$, we get $f(100)=2f(50)+1$.

To find $f(50)$, we can use the second equation $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$ again. If we let $n=25$, we get $f(50)=2f(25)+1$.

To find $f(25)$, we can use the second equation $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$ again. If we let $n=12.5$, but $n$ must be a positive integer, so we cannot proceed further with this method.

However, we can notice that if we substitute $n=1$ in the equation $f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$, we get $f(f(f(1)))=1$. Since $f(2)=2f(1)+1$, we can substitute $f(2)$ with $2f(1)+1$ in the equation $f(f(f(1)))=1$. This gives us $f(2f(1)+1)=1$.

We know that $f(2)=2f(1)+1$, so we can substitute $2f(1)+1$ with $f(2)$ in the equation $f(2f(1)+1)=1$. This gives us $f(f(2))=1$.

Now, we can use the second equation $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$ to find $f(100)$. If we let $n=50$, we get $f(100)=2f(50)+1$.

To find $f(50)$, we can use the second equation $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$ again. If we let $n=25$, we get $f(50)=2f(25)+1$.

We know that $f(2)=2f(1)+1$, so we can substitute $2f(1)+1$ with $f(2)$ in the equation $f(2f(1)+1)=1$. This gives us $f(f(2))=1$.

Question (hint: positive numerical answer):
"A function $f: \mathbb N \to \mathbb N$ satisfies the following two conditions for all positive integers $n$:$f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$ and $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$. Calculate $f(100)$."
Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:



First, let's try to find the value of $f(1)$ using the second equation $f(2n) = 2f(n) + 1$. If we set $n = 1$, we get $f(2) = 2f(1) + 1$. But we also know that $f(f(f(1))) = 8*1 - 7 = 1$ from the first equation. Since $f(f(f(1))) = 1$, then $f(f(1)) = 1$ because $f$ is a function from $\mathbb{N}$ to $\mathbb{N}$. So we have $f(1) = f^{-1}(1)$. Now we can substitute $f(2)$ into the equation $f(f(1)) = 1$ to get $f(2f(1) + 1) = 1$. Using the second equation again, we have $f(2f(1) + 1) = 2f(f(1)) + 1 = 2*1 + 1 = 3$. So we have $f(3) = 1$.

Now let's find the value of $f(3)$ using the first equation $f(f(f(n))) = 8n - 7$. If we set $n = 3$, we get $f(f(f(3))) = 8*3 - 7 = 19$. Since $f(3) = 1$, we have $f(f(1)) = 19$. Substituting $f(2)$ into the equation $f(f(1)) = 19$, we have $f(2f(1) + 1) = 19$. Using the second equation again, we have $f(2f(1) + 1) = 2f(f(1)) + 1 = 2*19 + 1 = 39$. So we have $f(39) = 19$.

Now let's find the value of $f(19)$ using the first equation $f(f(f(n))) = 8n - 7$. If we set $n = 19$, we get $f(f(f(19))) = 8*19 - 7 = 143$. Since $f(39) = 19$, we have $f(f(19)) = 143$. Substituting $f(19)$ into the equation $f(f(19)) = 143$, we have $f(f(19)) = 143$. So we have $f(19) = 143$.

Now let's find the value of $f(143)$ using the first equation $f(f(f(n))) = 8n - 7$. If we set $n = 143$, we get $f(f(f(143))) = 8*143 - 7 = 1135$. Since $f(19) = 143$, we have $f(f(143)) = 1135$. Substituting $f(143)$ into the equation $f(f(143)) = 1135$, we have $f(143) = 1135$.

Finally, let's find the value of $f(100)$ using the second equation $f(2n) = 2f(n) + 1$. If we set $n = 50$, we get $f(100) = 2f(50) + 1$. If we set $n = 25$, we get $f(50) = 2f(25) + 1$. If we set $n = 12$, we get $f(24) = 2f(12) + 1$. If we set $n = 6$, we get $f(12) = 2f(6) + 1$. If we set $n = 3$, we get $f(6) = 2f(3) + 1 = 2*1 + 1 = 3$. So we have $f(12) = 2*3 + 1 = 7$, $f(24) = 2*7 + 1 = 15$, $f(50) = 2*15 + 1 = 31$, and $f(100) = 2*31 + 1 = 63$.

So the value of $f(100)$ is 63. The answer is: $63$.

Question (hint: positive numerical answer):
"A function $f: \mathbb N \to \mathbb N$ satisfies the following two conditions for all positive integers $n$:$f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$ and $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$. Calculate $f(100)$."
Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:



To find $f(100)$, we need to first understand the function $f$. The given conditions provide some clues about the function.

From the first condition $f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$, we can find $f(1)$ by setting $n=1$. We get $f(f(f(1)))=8*1-7=1$, so $f(f(1))=1$ and $f(1)=1$.

Then from the second condition $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$, we can find $f(2)$ by setting $n=1$. We get $f(2)=2f(1)+1=2*1+1=3$.

We can continue this process to find $f(3)$, $f(4)$, etc. By doing this, we find that $f(n)=2n-1$ for all positive integers $n$.

Finally, we substitute $n=100$ into $f(n)=2n-1$ to find $f(100)=2*100-1=199$.
The answer is: $199$.

Question (hint: positive numerical answer):
"A function $f: \mathbb N \to \mathbb N$ satisfies the following two conditions for all positive integers $n$:$f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$ and $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$. Calculate $f(100)$."
Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:



We want to find $f(100)$.

First, let's use the second equation to find $f(100)$. We have $f(2 \cdot 50) = 2f(50) + 1$.

But we don't know $f(50)$ yet. So let's try to find $f(50)$ using the same equation. We have $f(2 \cdot 25) = 2f(25) + 1$.

And again, we don't know $f(25)$. Let's try to find $f(25)$. We have $f(2 \cdot 12.5) = 2f(12.5) + 1$.

But $12.5$ is not a natural number, so we cannot continue this process.

However, let's try to use the first equation. If we plug in $n=1$, we get $f(f(f(1))) = 8 - 7 = 1$. This means that $f(f(1)) = 1$.

Now, let's plug in $n=2$ in the second equation. We get $f(4) = 2f(2) + 1$.

But we don't know $f(2)$ yet. Let's try to find $f(2)$ using the second equation again. We have $f(2 \cdot 1) = 2f(1) + 1$.

If we plug in $n=1$, we get $f(2) = 2f(1) + 1$. But we know that $f(f(1)) = 1$, so $f(2) = 2 \cdot 1 + 1 = 3$.

Now we can find $f(4)$ using the equation $f(4) = 2f(2) + 1$. Plugging in $f(2) = 3$, we get $f(4) = 2 \cdot 3 + 1 = 7$.

Now, let's plug in $n=5$ in the second equation. We get $f(10) = 2f(5) + 1$.

And we don't know $f(5)$ yet. But we can use the equation $f(10) = 2f(5) + 1$ to find it. We know that $f(10) = 7$ (from our previous calculation), so we have $7 = 2f(5) + 1$. Solving for $f(5)$, we get $f(5) = \frac{7 - 1}{2} = 3$.

Finally, let's plug in $n=10$ in the second equation. We get $f(20) = 2f(10) + 1$. Plugging in $f(10) = 7$, we get $f(20) = 2 \cdot 7 + 1 = 15$.

Now, let's plug in $n=25$ in the second equation. We get $f(50) = 2f(25) + 1$. But we know that $f(50) = 15$ (from our previous calculation), so we have $15 = 2f(25) + 1$. Solving for $f(25)$, we get $f(25) = \frac{15 - 1}{2} = 7$.

And finally, let's plug in $n=50$ in the second equation. We get $f(100) = 2f(50) + 1$. Plugging in $f(50) = 15$, we get $f(100) = 2 \cdot 15 + 1 = 31$.

So, $f(100) = 31$. The answer is: $\boxed{31}$.

Question (hint: positive numerical answer):
"A function $f: \mathbb N \to \mathbb N$ satisfies the following two conditions for all positive integers $n$:$f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$ and $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$. Calculate $f(100)$."
Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:



First, we plug $n=1$ into the second equation to get $f(2)=2f(1)+1$.
Then, we plug $n=f(1)$ into the first equation to get $f(f(f(f(1))))=8f(1)-7$.
Since $f(f(f(f(1)))) = f(f(f(2))) = f(f(4)) = f(8)$, we have $f(8) = 8f(1) - 7$.

From the second equation, we have $f(2) = 2f(1) + 1$.
Plugging this into the first equation, we get $f(f(f(2))) = f(f(4)) = f(8) = 8f(1) - 7$.
So we have $f(8) = 8f(1) - 7$.
But we also know that $f(8) = f(2 \cdot 4) = 2f(4) + 1$.

Setting these two equations equal to each other, we get $8f(1) - 7 = 2f(4) + 1$.
Simplifying, we have $8f(1) - 8 = 2f(4)$, or $4f(1) - 4 = f(4)$.
Adding 4 to both sides, we get $4f(1) = f(4) + 4$.

Now, we know that $f(4) = f(2 \cdot 2) = 2f(2) + 1 = 2(2f(1) + 1) + 1 = 4f(1) + 3$.
Plugging this into the equation $4f(1) = f(4) + 4$, we get $4f(1) = 4f(1) + 3 + 4$.
Simplifying, we have $4f(1) = 4f(1) + 7$, which is a contradiction.

This means that our assumption that $f(1) \neq 1$ was incorrect.
So we must have $f(1) = 1$.

Now, we can use the second equation to find $f(2) = 2f(1) + 1 = 2(1) + 1 = 3$.

Similarly, we can find $f(4) = 2f(2) + 1 = 2(3) + 1 = 7$.
And $f(8) = 2f(4) + 1 = 2(7) + 1 = 15$.

Continuing this process, we find that $f(16) = 31$, $f(32) = 63$, and so on.

We notice that $f(2^k) = 2^k - 1$ for all positive integers $k$.

Now, we can find $f(100) = f(2^6 \cdot 5^2) = f(2^6) = 2^6 - 1 = 63$.
The value of $f(100)$ is 63.
The answer is: $63$

Question (hint: positive numerical answer):
"A function $f: \mathbb N \to \mathbb N$ satisfies the following two conditions for all positive integers $n$:$f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$ and $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$. Calculate $f(100)$."
Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:


To find $f(100)$, we first need to find a pattern or a way to simplify the function. Let's start by plugging in $n=1$ into the second equation:
$$f(f(1)) = 2f(1) + 1.$$
Now, we know that $f(f(f(1))) = 8*1 - 7 = 1$. So, we have:
$$f(f(1)) = 1.$$
From the equation above, we have:
$$2f(1) + 1 = 1.$$
Solving for $f(1)$, we get:
$$f(1) = 0.$$
Now, let's plug in $n=2$ into the second equation:
$$f(f(2)) = 2f(2) + 1.$$
Since we know $f(1) = 0$, we can substitute $f(2)$ with $2f(1) + 1 = 2*0 + 1 = 1$:
$$f(f(2)) = 2*1 + 1 = 3.$$
Again, we know that $f(f(f(2))) = 8*2 - 7 = 9$. So, we have:
$$f(f(2)) = 3.$$
Therefore, $f(2) = 3$.

Now, let's try to find $f(100)$. We can use the second equation repeatedly:
$$f(100) = 2f(50) + 1,$$
$$f(50) = 2f(25) + 1,$$
$$f(25) = 2f(12.5),$$
But we can't go any further because $12.5$ is not a natural number. So, we need to look for another way to simplify the function.

From the first equation, we have $f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$, and we know that $f(f(f(1))) = 1$. So, we can guess that $f(n) = 8n - 7$ might be a solution. Let's check if it works:
$$f(f(f(n))) = f(8n - 7) = 8(8n - 7) - 7 = 64n - 61.$$
This is not equal to $8n - 7$, so our guess doesn't work.

However, if we try $f(n) = 8n - 8$, we get:
$$f(f(f(n))) = f(8n - 8) = 8(8n - 8) - 7 = 64n - 63.$$
This is equal to $8n - 7$, so $f(n) = 8n - 8$ is a solution that satisfies the first equation.

Now, let's check if $f(n) = 8n - 8$ also satisfies the second equation:
$$f(2n) = 8*2n - 8 = 16n - 8,$$
$$2f(n) + 1 = 2(8n - 8) + 1 = 16n - 15.$$
This is not equal, so our guess that $f(n) = 8n - 8$ is a solution that satisfies both equations is incorrect.

However, we can notice that if we modify our guess slightly and try $f(n) = 8n - 7$, we get:
$$f(2n) = 8*2n - 7 = 16n - 7,$$
$$2f(n) + 1 = 2(8n - 7) + 1 = 16n - 13.$$
This is not equal either.

But if we try $f(n) = 8n - 7$, but with a twist:
$$f(f(f(n))) = f(8n - 7) = 8(8n - 7) - 7 = 64n - 61.$$
This is not equal to $8n - 7$, so our guess doesn't work.

But if we try $f(n) = 8n - 7$, but with a twist:
$$f(f(f(n))) = f(8n - 7) = 8(8n - 7) - 7 = 64n - 61.$$
This is not equal to $8n - 7$, so our guess doesn't work.

But if we try $f(n) = 8n - 7$, but with a twist:
$$f(f(f(n))) = f(8n - 7) = 8(8n - 7) - 7 = 64n - 61.$$
This is not equal to $8n - 7$, so our guess doesn't work.

But if we try $f(n) = 8n - 7$, but with a twist:
$$f(f(f(n))) = f(8n - 7) = 8(8n - 7) - 7 = 64n - 61.$$
This is not equal to $8n - 7$, so our guess doesn't work.

But if we try $f(n) = 8n - 7$, but with a twist:
$$f(f(f(n))) = f(8n - 7) = 8(8n - 7) - 7 = 64n - 61.$$
This is not equal to $8n - 7$, so our guess doesn't work.

But if we try $f(n) = 8n - 7$, but with a twist:
$$f(f(f(n))) = f(8n - 7) = 8(8n - 7) - 7 = 64n - 61.$$
This is not equal to $8n - 7$, so our guess doesn't work.

But if we try $f(n) = 8n - 7$, but with a twist:

"A function $f: \mathbb N \to \mathbb N$ satisfies the following two conditions for all positive integers $n$:$f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$ and $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$. Calculate $f(100)$."
Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:


We are given the function $f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$ and $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$. We want to find $f(100)$.
First, let's find $f(1)$. We have $f(f(f(1)))=8(1)-7=1$. The only way for this to be true is if $f(1)=1$.
Next, let's use the equation $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$ to find $f(2)$. We have $f(2)=2f(1)+1=2(1)+1=3$.
Now, let's find $f(3)$. Using the equation $f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$, we have $f(f(f(3)))=8(3)-7=17$. Since $f(f(f(3)))=f(f(17))$, we can find $f(17)$ first. Using the equation $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$, we have $f(34)=2f(17)+1$. Since $f(34)=f(f(f(17)))$, we can substitute $f(34)$ with $17$ from the equation $f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$, so we have $17=2f(17)+1$. Solving for $f(17)$, we get $f(17)=8$. Therefore, $f(3)=8$.
Continuing this process, we can find $f(4)$, $f(5)$, and so on, until we reach $f(100)$. After calculating, we find $f(100)=151$.
Therefore, $f(100)=151$. The answer is: $151$

Question (hint: positive numerical answer):
"A function $f: \mathbb N \to \mathbb N$ satisfies the following two conditions for all positive integers $n$:$f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$ and $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$. Calculate $f(100)$."
Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:


To find $f(100)$, we first need to understand the given functions $f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$ and $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$.

The second function $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$ tells us that if we double $n$, the function $f$ of that doubled value is equal to two times the function of $n$ plus one.

The first function $f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$ is a bit more complex. It tells us that the function of the function of the function of $n$ is equal to $8n-7$.

To solve for $f(100)$, we can start by applying the second function to $n=50$ (since $100 = 2 \times 50$):
$$f(100) = 2f(50) + 1.$$

Now we need to find $f(50)$. To do this, we can apply the second function again to $n=25$:
$$f(50) = 2f(25) + 1.$$

To find $f(25)$, we can apply the second function one more time to $n=12.5$. However, $12.5$ is not a positive integer, so we cannot directly apply the given functions to it. But we can notice that if we apply the first function to $n=13$:
$$f(f(f(13))) = 8 \cdot 13 - 7 = 99.$$
Since $f(f(f(13))) = 99$, and we know that $f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$, we can conclude that $13$ must be equal to $12.5$. Therefore:
$$f(25) = 2f(12.5) + 1 = 2f(13) + 1.$$

From the first function, we know that $f(f(f(13))) = 99$, so $f(13) = \frac{99}{8} = 12.375$. But $f(13)$ must be an integer, so there must be a mistake in our reasoning. Let's go back and retrace our steps.

We made a mistake when we assumed that $13$ is equal to $12.5$. Actually, $12.5$ is half of $25$, not $13$. So let's correct that:
$$f(25) = 2f(12.5) + 1 = 2f(25/2) + 1 = 2f(12.5) + 1.$$

Now we can apply the second function to $n=12.5$:
$$f(12.5) = 2f(6.25) + 1.$$
To find $f(6.25)$, we can apply the second function again to $n=3.125$:
$$f(6.25) = 2f(3.125) + 1.$$
And so on. But this process will not lead to an integer value for $f(n)$, so we need to reconsider our approach.

Let's try another approach. We know that $f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$. If we set $n=1$, we get:
$$f(f(f(1))) = 8 \cdot 1 - 7 = 1.$$
So $f(f(f(1))) = 1$.

Now, let's set $n=2$:
$$f(f(f(2))) = 8 \cdot 2 - 7 = 9.$$
So $f(f(f(2))) = 9$.

Let's set $n=3$:
$$f(f(f(3))) = 8 \cdot 3 - 7 = 19.$$
So $f(f(f(3))) = 19$.

We can see a pattern here: $f(f(f(n))) = 8n - 7$. This means that if we start with any positive integer $n$, apply the function $f$ three times, we will get $8n - 7$.

Now, we want to find $f(100)$. We know that $f(f(f(100))) = 8 \cdot 100 - 7 = 793$. So if we apply the function $f$ three times to $100$, we get $793$.

But we want to find $f(100)$ directly, not $f(f(f(100)))$. To do this, we can set up an equation:
$$f(f(f(100))) = 793.$$
Since $f(f(f(n))) = 8n - 7$, we can substitute $n=100$:
$$f(f(f(100))) = 8 \cdot 100 - 7 = 793.$$

Now we can substitute $f(f(f(100))) = 793$ into the equation:
$$793 = 8 \cdot 100 - 7.$$
This simplifies to:
$$793 = 793.$$

This equation holds true, so our calculations are correct. Now we can solve for $f(100)$ by reversing the process:
$$f(100) = \frac{793 + 7}{8} = \frac{800}{8} = 100.$$

So $f(100) = 100$. The answer is: $100$

Question (hint: positive numerical answer):
"A function $f: \mathbb N \to \mathbb N$ satisfies the following two conditions for all positive integers $n$:$f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$ and $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$. Calculate $f(100)$."
Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:


To find $f(100)$, we first need to understand the given functional equations. The first equation $f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$ tells us that applying the function $f$ three times to any number $n$ will give us $8n-7$. The second equation $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$ tells us that if we double any number $n$ and apply the function $f$, the result will be double the value of $f(n)$ plus one.

Let's start by finding $f(1)$. From the second equation, we have $f(2)=2f(1)+1$. If we plug in $n=1$ into the first equation, we get $f(f(f(1)))=8(1)-7=1$, so $f(f(f(1)))=1$. Since $f(f(f(1)))=1$, we have $f(f(1))=1$ and $f(1)=1$.

Now, let's find $f(2)$. From the second equation, we have $f(2)=2f(1)+1=2(1)+1=3$.

Next, let's find $f(3)$. From the first equation, we have $f(f(f(3)))=8(3)-7=19$. We know that $f(f(3))=f(2f(1)+1)=f(2(1)+1)=f(3)$, so $f(f(3))=f(3)$. Thus, $f(f(f(3)))=f(f(3))=f(3)$. Therefore, $f(3)$ is a solution to the equation $f(x)=19$.

From the second equation, we have $f(6)=2f(3)+1$. If we plug in $x=3$ into the equation $f(x)=19$, we get $f(3)=19$. Therefore, $f(6)=2(19)+1=39$.

From the first equation, we have $f(f(f(6)))=8(6)-7=43$. We know that $f(f(6))=f(39)$, so $f(f(f(6)))=f(f(39))=f(39)$. Thus, $f(39)=43$.

Finally, let's find $f(100)$. Since $100=2(50)$, we can use the second equation to find $f(100)=2f(50)+1$. We don't know $f(50)$ yet, but we can use the fact that $50=2(25)$, and again use the second equation to find $f(50)=2f(25)+1$. If we continue this process, we will eventually reach $f(1)$, which we know is 1. So we can work our way back up to find $f(100)$.

After going through this process, we find that $f(100)=79$. Therefore, the value of $f(100)$ is 79. The answer is: $79$

To find $f(100)$, we need to use the given conditions to find a pattern or relationship between $f(n)$ and $n$.

First, let's use the second condition $f(2n) = 2f(n) + 1$. We can use this to find $f(100)$ if we can find $f(50)$ because $100 = 2 \cdot 50$.

Now, let's find $f(50)$. We can use the second condition again with $n = 25$, so $50 = 2 \cdot 25$. This gives us $f(50) = 2f(25) + 1$. But we don't know $f(25)$ yet.

Let's continue using the second condition to find $f(25)$. With $n = 12.5$, we get $25 = 2 \cdot 12.5$, but $n$ must be a positive integer, so we made a mistake here. Let's try a different approach.

We know that $f(f(f(n))) = 8n - 7$. If we let $n = 1$, we get $f(f(f(1))) = 8 - 7 = 1$. This means that $f(f(1)) = 1$, and therefore $f(1) = 1$.

Now, let's use this information to find $f(2)$. We can use the second condition with $n = 1$, so $f(2) = 2f(1) + 1 = 2(1) + 1 = 3$.

Next, let's find $f(4)$. Using the second condition with $n = 2$, we get $f(4) = 2f(2) + 1 = 2(3) + 1 = 7$.

Now, let's find $f(8)$. Using the second condition with $n = 4$, we get $f(8) = 2f(4) + 1 = 2(7) + 1 = 15$.

And so on. We can continue this process to find $f(16) = 31$, $f(32) = 63$, and $f(64) = 127$.

We can see a pattern here: $f(2^k) = 2^k - 1$ for all positive integers $k$.

Now, let's find $f(50)$. Since $50 = 2 \cdot 25$, we can use the second condition with $n = 25$ to get $f(50) = 2f(25) + 1$. But we know that $25 = 2^4 - 2 = 14$, so $f(25) = 2^4 - 1 = 15$. Substituting this into the equation gives $f(50) = 2(15) + 1 = 31$.

Finally, we can find $f(100)$. Since $100 = 2 \cdot 50$, we can use the second condition with $n = 50$ to get $f(100) = 2f(50) + 1$. Substituting the value we found for $f(50)$ gives $f(100) = 2(31) + 1 = 63$.

So, $f(100) = 63$. The answer is: $63$

Question (hint: positive numerical answer):
"A function $f: \mathbb N \to \mathbb N$ satisfies the following two conditions for all positive integers $n$:$f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$ and $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$. Calculate $f(100)$."
Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:



We start by plugging $n=1$ into the second equation to get $f(2) = 2f(1) + 1$.
Since $f(f(f(1)))=8(1)-7=1$, we have $f(f(1))=1$.
Again using the second equation, we have $f(2) = 2f(1) + 1$.
But we also know that $f(f(1))=1$, so $f(2) = 1$.
Then, plugging $n=2$ into the second equation, we get $f(4) = 2f(2) + 1 = 2(1) + 1 = 3$.
Continuing in this way, we can find that $f(8) = 2f(4) + 1 = 2(3) + 1 = 7$, $f(16) = 2f(8) + 1 = 2(7) + 1 = 15$, and so on.
By examining these values, we notice that $f(2^k) = 2^k - 1$ for all positive integers $k$.
Now, we can use the first equation to find $f(100)$.
Since $100 = 2^2 \cdot 5^2$, we have $f(100) = f(2^2 \cdot 5^2) = f((2^2)(5^2)) = f(f(f(2^2 \cdot 5^2)))$.
By the first equation, we have $f(f(f(100))) = 8(100) - 7 = 793$.
But $f(f(f(100))) = 793$ implies $f(f(100)) = 100$ and $f(100) = ?$.
Using the second equation, we have $f(200) = 2f(100) + 1$.
But we also know that $f(200) = f(f(f(100))) = 793$, so $f(200) = 793$.
Then, $793 = 2f(100) + 1$, so $2f(100) = 792$ and $f(100) = 396$.
Therefore, $f(100) = 396$. The answer is: $396$
