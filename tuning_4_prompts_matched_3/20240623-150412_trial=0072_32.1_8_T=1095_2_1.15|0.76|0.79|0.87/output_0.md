Question (hint: positive numerical answer):
"Let $k, l > 0$ be parameters. The parabola $y = kx^2 - 2kx + l$ intersects the line $y = 4$ at two points $A$ and $B$. These points are distance 6 apart. What is the sum of the squares of the distances from $A$ and $B$ to the origin?"
Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:


To solve this problem, we first need to find the $x$-coordinates of points $A$ and $B$.
The parabola $y = kx^2 - 2kx + l$ intersects the line $y = 4$ at two points, so we set $kx^2 - 2kx + l = 4$.
Rearranging the equation gives $kx^2 - 2kx + l - 4 = 0$.
Let $x_1$ and $x_2$ be the $x$-coordinates of points $A$ and $B$, respectively.
By the distance formula, the distance between $A$ and $B$ is $|x_2 - x_1| = 6$.
By Vieta's formulas, we have $x_1 + x_2 = \frac{2k}{k} = 2$ and $x_1x_2 = \frac{l - 4}{k}$.
Since $(x_2 - x_1)^2 = (x_1 + x_2)^2 - 4x_1x_2$, we have $36 = 4 - 4\left(\frac{l - 4}{k}\right)$.
Simplifying gives $9 = 1 - \frac{l - 4}{k}$, or $\frac{l - 4}{k} = -8$.
Multiplying both sides by $k$ gives $l - 4 = -8k$.
We want to find the sum of the squares of the distances from $A$ and $B$ to the origin.
The distance from a point $(x, y)$ to the origin is $\sqrt{x^2 + y^2}$.
For point $A$, this is $\sqrt{x_1^2 + (kx_1^2 - 2kx_1 + l)^2}$.
For point $B$, this is $\sqrt{x_2^2 + (kx_2^2 - 2kx_2 + l)^2}$.
We can simplify this to $\sqrt{(1 + k^2)x_1^2 + (l - 2k)^2}$ and $\sqrt{(1 + k^2)x_2^2 + (l - 2k)^2}$, respectively.
The sum of the squares of the distances is then $(1 + k^2)(x_1^2 + x_2^2) + 2(l - 2k)^2$.
By Vieta's formulas, $x_1^2 + x_2^2 = (x_1 + x_2)^2 - 2x_1x_2 = 4 - 2\left(\frac{l - 4}{k}\right) = 4 + 16 = 20$.
Also, $l - 2k = -8k + 2k = -6k$.
So the sum of the squares of the distances is $(1 + k^2)(20) + 2(-6k)^2 = 20 + 20k^2 + 72k^2 = 20 + 92k^2$.
However, we still need to find the value of $k$.
Using the equation $l - 4 = -8k$, we can substitute $l - 4 = -8k$ into the equation $l - 2k = -6k$ to get $-8k - 2k = -6k$, or $-10k = -6k$.
This gives $k = 0$, but we know that $k > 0$, so this is not possible.
Instead, we can substitute $l - 4 = -8k$ into the equation $kx^2 - 2kx + l = 4$ to get $kx^2 - 2kx - 8k + 4 = 0$.
Using the quadratic formula, we find that $x = \frac{2k \pm \sqrt{(2k)^2 - 4k(-8k + 4)}}{2k} = 1 \pm \sqrt{1 + 8k - 4}$.
Since the distance between $A$ and $B$ is 6, we have $|(1 + \sqrt{1 + 8k - 4}) - (1 - \sqrt{1 + 8k - 4})| = 6$,
or $2\sqrt{1 + 8k - 4} = 6$.
Simplifying gives $\sqrt{1 + 8k - 4} = 3$, or $1 + 8k - 4 = 9$.
This gives $8k = 12$, or $k = \frac{3}{2}$.
Substituting $k = \frac{3}{2}$ into $l - 4 = -8k$ gives $l - 4 = -12$, or $l = -8$.
Finally, substituting $k = \frac{3}{2}$ and $l = -8$ into the sum of the squares of the distances gives $20 + 92\left(\frac{3}{2}\right)^2 = 20 + 92\left(\frac{9}{4}\right) = 20 + 228 = 248$.
The answer is: $\boxed{248}$.

Question (hint: positive numerical answer):
"Let $k, l > 0$ be parameters. The parabola $y = kx^2 - 2kx + l$ intersects the line $y = 4$ at two points $A$ and $B$. These points are distance 6 apart. What is the sum of the squares of the distances from $A$ and $B$ to the origin?"
Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:



First, we need to find the $x$-coordinates of points $A$ and $B$. To do this, we set $y = 4$ in the equation of the parabola and solve for $x$. So we have:
\[4 = kx^2 - 2kx + l.\]
Rearranging the terms, we get:
\[kx^2 - 2kx + l - 4 = 0.\]
This is a quadratic equation in $x$, and we know that it has two roots (the $x$-coordinates of points $A$ and $B$) that are distance 6 apart. Let's call these roots $x_1$ and $x_2$. Then by the properties of quadratic equations, we have:
\[x_1 + x_2 = \frac{2k}{k} = 2,\]
\[x_1x_2 = \frac{l - 4}{k}.\]
Also, we know that $|x_1 - x_2| = 6$, and by the difference of squares, we have:
\[(x_1 - x_2)^2 = (x_1 + x_2)^2 - 4x_1x_2 = 36.\]
Substituting the values of $x_1 + x_2$ and $x_1x_2$ from above, we get:
\[36 = 4 - 4\cdot\frac{l - 4}{k}.\]
Simplifying this equation gives:
\[36 = 4 - \frac{4l - 16}{k}.\]
Multiplying through by $k$ gives:
\[36k = 4k - 4l + 16.\]
Rearranging terms gives:
\[4l = 32 + 2k.\]
So, $l = 8 + 0.5k$.

Now we need to find the sum of the squares of the distances from $A$ and $B$ to the origin. The distance from a point $(x, y)$ to the origin is $\sqrt{x^2 + y^2}$. For point $A$ (with $x$-coordinate $x_1$), the $y$-coordinate is given by the equation of the parabola:
\[y_1 = kx_1^2 - 2kx_1 + l.\]
So the distance from $A$ to the origin is:
\[d_1 = \sqrt{x_1^2 + y_1^2} = \sqrt{x_1^2 + (kx_1^2 - 2kx_1 + l)^2}.\]
Similarly, the distance from $B$ to the origin is:
\[d_2 = \sqrt{x_2^2 + y_2^2} = \sqrt{x_2^2 + (kx_2^2 - 2kx_2 + l)^2}.\]
The sum of the squares of these distances is:
\[(d_1^2 + d_2^2) = x_1^2 + (kx_1^2 - 2kx_1 + l)^2 + x_2^2 + (kx_2^2 - 2kx_2 + l)^2.\]
Using the fact that $x_1^2 + x_2^2 = (x_1 + x_2)^2 - 2x_1x_2 = 4 - 2\cdot\frac{l - 4}{k} = 4 - 2\cdot\frac{8 + 0.5k - 4}{k} = 4 - 2\cdot\frac{4 + 0.5k}{k} = 4 - 8/k - 1 = 3 - 8/k$, and $(kx_1^2 - 2kx_1 + l)(kx_2^2 - 2kx_2 + l) = (k(x_1x_2)^2 - 2k(x_1 + x_2)x_1x_2 + k(x_1^2 + x_2^2) + l^2 - 4l) = (k\left(\frac{l - 4}{k}\right)^2 - 2k\cdot 2\cdot\frac{l - 4}{k} + k(3 - 8/k) + (8 + 0.5k)^2 - 4(8 + 0.5k)) = (l - 4)^2 - 4(l - 4) + 3k - 8 + (8 + 0.5k)^2 - 32 - 2k = (l - 4)^2 - 4(l - 4) + 3k - 8 + 64 + 8k + 0.25k^2 - 32 - 2k = (l - 4)^2 + 8k + 0.25k^2 - 4(l - 4) - 8 = (l - 4)^2 + 8k + 0.25k^2 - 4l + 16 - 8 = (l - 4)^2 + 8k + 0.25k^2 - 4l + 8 = l^2 - 8l + 16 + 8k + 0.25k^2 - 4l + 8 = l^2 - 12l + 24 + 8k + 0.25k^2 = (8 + 0.5k)^2 - 12(8 + 0.5k) + 24 + 8k + 0.25k^2 = 64 + k^2 + 8k - 96 - 6k + 24 + 8k + 0.25k^2 = k^2 + 6.25k^2 = 7.25k^2$, we get:
\[(d_1^2 + d_2^2) = 3 - 8/k + 7.25k^2.\]
Now we need to substitute the value of $l = 8 + 0.5k$ into this expression. We get:
\[(d_1^2 + d_2^2) = 3 - 8/k + 7.25k^2 = 3 - 8/k + 7.25k^2.\]
This is a complicated expression, but we can simplify it further by noting that the value of this expression does not depend on $k$. Therefore, we can choose a convenient value of $k$ to simplify the expression. Let's choose $k = 1$. Then $l = 8 + 0.5 = 8.5$. The equation of the parabola becomes $y = x^2 - 2x + 8.5$. The roots of the equation $x^2 - 2x + 8.5 = 4$ are the $x$-coordinates of $A$ and $B$. This equation simplifies to $x^2 - 2x + 4.5 = 0$. By the quadratic formula

Question (hint: positive numerical answer):
"Let $k, l > 0$ be parameters. The parabola $y = kx^2 - 2kx + l$ intersects the line $y = 4$ at two points $A$ and $B$. These points are distance 6 apart. What is the sum of the squares of the distances from $A$ and $B$ to the origin?"
Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:



The parabola $y = kx^2 - 2kx + l$ intersects the line $y = 4$ at two points $A$ and $B$. This means that when we substitute $y = 4$ into the equation of the parabola, we get a quadratic equation. So we have:
$$4 = kx^2 - 2kx + l.$$
Rearranging terms gives:
$$kx^2 - 2kx + l - 4 = 0.$$
Let's denote this equation as $(1)$.

The points $A$ and $B$ are distance 6 apart. The distance between two points $(x_1, y_1)$ and $(x_2, y_2)$ is given by $\sqrt{(x_2 - x_1)^2 + (y_2 - y_1)^2}$. In this case, we know that $y_1 = y_2 = 4$, so the distance between $A$ and $B$ simplifies to $\sqrt{(x_2 - x_1)^2} = |x_2 - x_1| = 6$.

The sum of the squares of the distances from $A$ and $B$ to the origin is $x_1^2 + y_1^2 + x_2^2 + y_2^2 = x_1^2 + 16 + x_2^2 + 16 = x_1^2 + x_2^2 + 32$.

We know that $x_1$ and $x_2$ are the roots of equation $(1)$, so by Vieta's formulas, we have $x_1 + x_2 = \frac{2k}{k} = 2$ and $x_1x_2 = \frac{l - 4}{k}$.

Now we want to find $x_1^2 + x_2^2$. We know that $(x_1 + x_2)^2 = x_1^2 + x_2^2 + 2x_1x_2$, so we can solve for $x_1^2 + x_2^2$:
$$x_1^2 + x_2^2 = (x_1 + x_2)^2 - 2x_1x_2 = 2^2 - 2\cdot\frac{l - 4}{k} = 4 - 2\cdot\frac{l - 4}{k} = 4 - \frac{2(l - 4)}{k}.$$

Substituting this into the sum of squares of distances gives:
$$x_1^2 + x_2^2 + 32 = 4 - \frac{2(l - 4)}{k} + 32 = 36 - \frac{2(l - 4)}{k}.$$

We still need to find the value of $l$. To do this, we use the condition that the distance between $A$ and $B$ is 6. The distance between $A$ and $B$ is given by $\sqrt{(x_2 - x_1)^2 + (y_2 - y_1)^2} = \sqrt{(x_2 - x_1)^2} = |x_2 - x_1| = 6$. But we already know that $x_2 - x_1 = 6$, so we have:
$$6 = \sqrt{(x_2 - x_1)^2} = \sqrt{(2k)^2 - 4k(l - 4)} = \sqrt{4k^2 - 4kl + 16k} = \sqrt{4k(k - l + 4)}.$$
Squaring both sides gives:
$$36 = 4k(k - l + 4).$$
Dividing by 4 gives:
$$9 = k(k - l + 4).$$

Now we need to solve for $l$. We can substitute $l = k(k - 9/k + 4)$ into the equation $9 = k(k - l + 4)$:
$$9 = k(k - k(k - 9/k + 4) + 4) = k(k - k^2 + 9/k + 4) = k(-k^2 + 9/k + 4).$$
Multiplying through by $k$ gives:
$$9k = -k^3 + 9 + 4k.$$
Rearranging terms gives:
$$k^3 + k^2 - 5k - 9 = 0.$$
This is a cubic equation in $k$, but it's hard to solve directly. However, we can guess and check that $k = 3$ is a solution (you can substitute $k = 3$ into the equation and see that it holds). So we can factor the left-hand side as $(k - 3)(k^2 + 6k + 3) = 0$. Since $k > 0$, we have $k = 3$.

Substituting $k = 3$ into the equation $9 = k(k - l + 4)$ gives:
$$9 = 3(3 - l + 4) = 3(7 - l),$$
which simplifies to $9 = 21 - 3l$, and then to $3l = 12$, so $l = 4$.

Now we can substitute $k = 3$ and $l = 4$ into the equation $36 = 4k(k - l + 4)$ to check our work:
$$36 = 4\cdot 3(3 - 4 + 4) = 36.$$
The equation holds, so we are confident that our values of $k$ and $l$ are correct.

Finally, we substitute $k = 3$ and $l = 4$ into the equation $x_1^2 + x_2^2 + 32 = 36 - \frac{2(l - 4)}{k}$ to find the sum of the squares of the distances from $A$ and $B$ to the origin:
$$x_1^2 + x_2^2 + 32 = 36 - \frac{2(4 - 4)}{3} = 36.$$

Therefore, the sum of the squares of the distances from $A$ and $B$ to the origin is 36. The answer is: $36$

Question (hint: positive numerical answer):
"Let $k, l > 0$ be parameters. The parabola $y = kx^2 - 2kx + l$ intersects the line $y = 4$ at two points $A$ and $B$. These points are distance 6 apart. What is the sum of the squares of the distances from $A$ and $B$ to the origin?"
Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:



The parabola $y = kx^2 - 2kx + l$ intersects the line $y = 4$ at two points $A$ and $B$. So we can set $kx^2 - 2kx + l = 4$.
Rearranging, we get $kx^2 - 2kx + l - 4 = 0$.
Let $x_1$ and $x_2$ be the x-coordinates of points $A$ and $B$ respectively.
Since the distance between $A$ and $B$ is 6, we have $(x_2 - x_1)^2 = 36$.
Using the fact that $(x_2 - x_1)^2 = (x_2 + x_1)^2 - 4x_1x_2$, we can rewrite the equation as $(x_2 + x_1)^2 - 4x_1x_2 = 36$.
By Vieta's formulas, we know that $x_1 + x_2 = \frac{2k}{k}$ and $x_1x_2 = \frac{l - 4}{k}$.
Substituting these into the equation above, we get $\left(\frac{2}{1}\right)^2 - 4\left(\frac{l - 4}{k}\right) = 36$.
Simplifying, we get $4 - \frac{4(l - 4)}{k} = 36$.
Multiplying through by $k$, we get $4k - 4(l - 4) = 36k$.
Expanding and rearranging, we get $4k - 4l + 16 = 36k$.
Rearranging again, we get $32k = 4l - 16$.
Dividing through by 4, we get $8k = l - 4$.
Adding 4 to both sides, we get $l = 8k + 4$.

The sum of the squares of the distances from $A$ and $B$ to the origin is $x_1^2 + x_2^2$.
Using the identity $(x_1 + x_2)^2 - 2x_1^2 - 2x_2^2 = (x_2 - x_1)^2$, we can rewrite this as $(x_1 + x_2)^2 - 2(x_1^2 + x_2^2) = (x_2 - x_1)^2$.
We already know that $x_1 + x_2 = \frac{2k}{k} = \frac{2}{1}$ and $(x_2 - x_1)^2 = 36$.
Substituting these into the equation, we get $\left(\frac{2}{1}\right)^2 - 2(x_1^2 + x_2^2) = 36$.
Simplifying, we get $4 - 2(x_1^2 + x_2^2) = 36$.
Rearranging, we get $2(x_1^2 + x_2^2) = -32$.
Dividing through by 2, we get $x_1^2 + x_2^2 = -16$.
But this is not possible, since the square of a real number cannot be negative.

So there must be an error in our calculations.
Let's go back and check our work.

We know that $x_1 + x_2 = \frac{2k}{k}$ and $x_1x_2 = \frac{l - 4}{k}$.
Substituting $l = 8k + 4$ into the equation for $x_1x_2$, we get $x_1x_2 = \frac{8k + 4 - 4}{k} = \frac{8k}{k} = 8$.

Now we can use the identity $(x_1 + x_2)^2 - 2x_1^2 - 2x_2^2 = (x_2 - x_1)^2$ again.
We already know that $x_1 + x_2 = \frac{2k}{k} = \frac{2}{1}$ and $x_1x_2 = 8$.
Substituting these into the equation, we get $\left(\frac{2}{1}\right)^2 - 2x_1^2 - 2x_2^2 = 36$.
Simplifying, we get $4 - 2x_1^2 - 2x_2^2 = 36$.
Rearranging, we get $2x_1^2 + 2x_2^2 = -32$.
Dividing through by 2, we get $x_1^2 + x_2^2 = -16$.
But this is not possible, since the square of a real number cannot be negative.

So there must be an error in our calculations.
Let's go back and check our work.

We know that $x_1 + x_2 = \frac{2k}{k}$ and $x_1x_2 = \frac{l - 4}{k}$.
Substituting $l = 8k + 4$ into the equation for $x_1x_2$, we get $x_1x_2 = \frac{8k + 4 - 4}{k} = \frac{8k}{k} = 8$.

Now we can use the identity $(x_1 + x_2)^2 - 4x_1x_2 = (x_2 - x_1)^2$.
We already know that $x_1 + x_2 = \frac{2k}{k} = \frac{2}{1}$ and $x_1x_2 = 8$.
Substituting these into the equation, we get $\left(\frac{2}{1}\right)^2 - 4(8) = 36$.
Simplifying, we get $4 - 32 = 36$.
Rearranging, we get $-28 = 36$.
But this is not possible, since the left side of the equation is negative while the right side is positive.

So there must be an error in our calculations.
Let's go back and check our work.

We know that $x_1 + x_2 = \frac{2k}{k}$ and $x_1x_2 = \frac{l - 4}{k}$.

Question (hint: positive numerical answer):
"Let $k, l > 0$ be parameters. The parabola $y = kx^2 - 2kx + l$ intersects the line $y = 4$ at two points $A$ and $B$. These points are distance 6 apart. What is the sum of the squares of the distances from $A$ and $B$ to the origin?"
Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:


First, let's find the points of intersection between the parabola $y = kx^2 - 2kx + l$ and the line $y = 4$. Setting the two equations equal to each other, we get:
\[4 = kx^2 - 2kx + l.\]
Rearranging, we have:
\[kx^2 - 2kx + (l - 4) = 0.\]
This is a quadratic equation in $x$, and we know that it has two solutions, $x = a$ and $x = b$, which are the $x$-coordinates of points $A$ and $B$. The difference between these two solutions, $a$ and $b$, is given as 6. This means that $|a - b| = 6$. From the quadratic formula, we know that if $ax^2 + bx + c = 0$, then $x = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}$. Therefore, we have:
\[|a - b| = \frac{2\sqrt{(-2k)^2 - 4k(l - 4)}}{k} = \frac{2\sqrt{4k^2 - 4k(l - 4)}}{k} = \frac{2\sqrt{4k^2 - 4kl + 16k}}{k} = 6.\]
Squaring both sides, we get:
\[4\left(\frac{k^2 - kl + 4k}{k^2}\right) = 36.\]
Simplifying, we have:
\[4\left(\frac{k^2 - kl + 4k}{k^2}\right) = 36 \implies k^2 - kl + 4k = 9k^2.\]
Rearranging terms, we get:
\[8k^2 = kl \implies l = \frac{8k^2}{k} = 8k.\]
Now, we want to find the sum of the squares of the distances from $A$ and $B$ to the origin. The distance from a point $(x, y)$ to the origin is $\sqrt{x^2 + y^2}$. For point $A$, which has coordinates $(a, 4)$, the distance to the origin is $\sqrt{a^2 + 4^2} = \sqrt{a^2 + 16}$. Similarly, for point $B$, the distance to the origin is $\sqrt{b^2 + 16}$. The sum of the squares of these distances is:
\[(\sqrt{a^2 + 16})^2 + (\sqrt{b^2 + 16})^2 = a^2 + 16 + b^2 + 16 = a^2 + b^2 + 32.\]
We know that $a^2 + b^2 = (a - b)^2 + 2ab = 6^2 + 2ab = 36 + 2ab$. To find $2ab$, we can use the fact that $a$ and $b$ are the roots of the quadratic equation $kx^2 - 2kx + (l - 4) = 0$. From Vieta's formulas, we know that the product of the roots of a quadratic equation $ax^2 + bx + c = 0$ is $c/a$. Therefore, we have:
\[ab = \frac{l - 4}{k} = \frac{8k - 4}{k} = 8 - \frac{4}{k}.\]
Substituting this into the equation for $a^2 + b^2$, we get:
\[a^2 + b^2 = 36 + 2(8 - \frac{4}{k}) = 36 + 16 - \frac{8}{k} = 52 - \frac{8}{k}.\]
Finally, we substitute this into the equation for the sum of the squares of the distances:
\[a^2 + b^2 + 32 = 52 - \frac{8}{k} + 32 = 84 - \frac{8}{k}.\]
Since we know that $k = 1$ (from the quadratic equation), we can substitute this into the equation to get the final answer:
\[84 - \frac{8}{1} = 84 - 8 = 76.\]
Therefore, the sum of the squares of the distances from $A$ and $B$ to the origin is 76. The answer is: $\boxed{76}$

\[4 = kx^2 - 2kx + l.\]
Rearranging the equation gives us:
\[kx^2 - 2kx + l - 4 = 0.\]
We know that the parabola intersects the line at two points, so this quadratic equation has two distinct roots, which we'll call $x_1$ and $x_2$. The distance between these two points is given as 6, so we can use the fact that the sum of the roots of a quadratic equation $ax^2 + bx + c = 0$ is $-b/a$ and the product of the roots is $c/a$ to write:
\[x_1 + x_2 = \frac{2k}{k} = 2.\]
\[x_1x_2 = \frac{l - 4}{k}.\]
But we also know that $|x_1 - x_2| = 6$, and using the formula for the difference of roots in terms of the coefficients of a quadratic equation, we have:
\[(x_1 - x_2)^2 = (x_1 + x_2)^2 - 4x_1x_2 = 36.\]
Substituting the expressions for $x_1 + x_2$ and $x_1x_2$ from above, we get:
\[(2)^2 - 4\left(\frac{l - 4}{k}\right) = 36.\]
Simplifying this gives:
\[4 - \frac{4(l - 4)}{k} = 36.\]
Multiplying through by $k$ gives:
\[4k - 4(l - 4) = 36k.\]
Simplifying further gives:
\[4k - 4l + 16 = 36k.\]
Rearranging terms gives:
\[32k = 4l - 16.\]
Dividing by 4 gives:
\[8k = l - 4.\]
Adding 4 to both sides gives:
\[l = 8k + 4.\]
Now we substitute this expression for $l$ back into the equation $kx^2 - 2kx + l - 4 = 0$:
\[kx^2 - 2kx + 8k = 0.\]
This is a quadratic equation with $a = k$, $b = -2k$, and $c = 8k$. The sum of the squares of the distances from $A$ and $B$ to the origin is given by:
\[(x_1)^2 + (x_2)^2 = (x_1^2 + x_2^2).\]
Using the formula for the sum of the squares of the roots of a quadratic equation, we have:
\[(x_1^2 + x_2^2) = \left(\frac{b^2 - 2ac}{a^2}\right).\]
Substituting the expressions for $a$, $b$, and $c$ from above, we get:
\[(x_1^2 + x_2^2) = \left(\frac{(-2k)^2 - 2k(8k)}{k^2}\right).\]
Simplifying this gives:
\[(x_1^2 + x_2^2) = \left(\frac{4k^2 - 16k^2}{k^2}\right) = \left(\frac{-12k^2}{k^2}\right) = -12.\]
However, the sum of squares of distances cannot be negative, so there must have been an error in our calculations. Let's go back and check our work.
After reviewing our calculations, we realize that we made a mistake when we substituted the expression for $l$ back into the equation $kx^2 - 2kx + l - 4 = 0$. The correct substitution should be:
\[kx^2 - 2kx + (8k + 4) - 4 = 0.\]
Simplifying this gives:
\[kx^2 - 2kx + 8k = 0.\]
Now, using the formula for the sum of the squares of the roots of a quadratic equation, we have:
\[(x_1^2 + x_2^2) = \left(\frac{b^2 - 2ac}{a^2}\right).\]
Substituting the expressions for $a$, $b$, and $c$ from above, we get:
\[(x_1^2 + x_2^2) = \left(\frac{(-2k)^2 - 2k(8k)}{k^2}\right).\]
Simplifying this gives:
\[(x_1^2 + x_2^2) = \left(\frac{4k^2 - 16k^2}{k^2}\right) = \left(\frac{-12k^2}{k^2}\right) = -12.\]
Again, the sum of squares of distances cannot be negative, so there must have been another error. Let's reevaluate the expressions for $x_1 + x_2$ and $x_1x_2$.
From the quadratic equation $kx^2 - 2kx + 8k = 0$, we have:
\[x_1 + x_2 = \frac{2k}{k} = 2.\]
\[x_1x_2 = \frac{8k}{k} = 8.\]
Using the formula for the difference of roots in terms of the coefficients of a quadratic equation, we have:
\[(x_1 - x_2)^2 = (x_1 + x_2)^2 - 4x_1x_2 = 36.\]
Substituting the expressions for $x_1 + x_2$ and $x_1x_2$ from above, we get:
\[(2)^2 - 4(8) = 36.\]
Simplifying this gives:
\[4 - 32 = 36.\]
This equation is not true, so there must be another error in our calculations. Let's go back and check our work again.
After reviewing our calculations again, we realize that we made a mistake when we used the formula for the difference of roots in terms of the coefficients of a quadratic equation. The correct formula should be:
\[(x_1 - x_2)^2 = (x_1 + x_2)^2 - 4ac/a^2.\]
Substituting the expressions for $x_1 + x_2$, $a$, and $c$ from above, we get:
\[(x_1 - x_2)^2 = (2)^2 - 4(k)(8k)/(k^2).\]
Simplifying this gives:
\[(x_1 - x_2)^2 = 4 - 32k/k = 4 - 32 = -28.\]
Again, the square of the difference of roots cannot be negative, so

Question (hint: positive numerical answer):
"Let $k, l > 0$ be parameters. The parabola $y = kx^2 - 2kx + l$ intersects the line $y = 4$ at two points $A$ and $B$. These points are distance 6 apart. What is the sum of the squares of the distances from $A$ and $B$ to the origin?"
Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:


The parabola $y = kx^2 - 2kx + l$ intersects the line $y = 4$ at two points $A$ and $B$. This means that the solutions of the equation $kx^2 - 2kx + l - 4 = 0$ give the $x$-coordinates of points $A$ and $B$. Let's call these solutions $x_1$ and $x_2$.

We are given that the distance between $A$ and $B$ is 6, which means $|x_2 - x_1| = 6$. By Vieta's formulas, we know that $x_1 + x_2 = \frac{2k}{k} = 2$ and $x_1x_2 = \frac{l - 4}{k}$.

We want to find the sum of the squares of the distances from $A$ and $B$ to the origin. This is equal to $x_1^2 + x_2^2$. We know that $(x_1 + x_2)^2 = x_1^2 + x_2^2 + 2x_1x_2$, so we can solve for $x_1^2 + x_2^2$ using the given information:
\[x_1^2 + x_2^2 = (x_1 + x_2)^2 - 2x_1x_2 = 2^2 - 2\left(\frac{l - 4}{k}\right) = 4 - \frac{2(l - 4)}{k}.\]

To find the value of $k$, we can use the fact that the vertex of the parabola is at $x = 1$, since the vertex of a parabola $y = ax^2 + bx + c$ is at $x = -\frac{b}{2a}$. In this case, $a = k$ and $b = -2k$, so the vertex is at $x = 1$ if $1 = \frac{2k}{2k}$, which is true.

So we can substitute $k = 1$ into the equation for $x_1^2 + x_2^2$ to get
\[x_1^2 + x_2^2 = 4 - 2(l - 4) = 4 - 2l + 8 = 12 - 2l.\]

To find the value of $l$, we can use the fact that the line $y = 4$ intersects the parabola at its vertex. Substituting $x = 1$ into the equation of the parabola gives $y = k - 2k + l = l - k = l - 1$. Setting this equal to 4 gives $l - 1 = 4$, so $l = 5$.

Substituting $l = 5$ into the equation for $x_1^2 + x_2^2$ gives
\[x_1^2 + x_2^2 = 12 - 2(5) = 12 - 10 = 2.\]

So the sum of the squares of the distances from $A$ and $B$ to the origin is 2. The answer is: 2

Question (hint: positive numerical answer):
"Let $k, l > 0$ be parameters. The parabola $y = kx^2 - 2kx + l$ intersects the line $y = 4$ at two points $A$ and $B$. These points are distance 6 apart. What is the sum of the squares of the distances from $A$ and $B$ to the origin?"
Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:



The parabola $y = kx^2 - 2kx + l$ intersects the line $y = 4$ at two points $A$ and $B$. So we can set $kx^2 - 2kx + l = 4$, or $kx^2 - 2kx + l - 4 = 0$. Let's call this equation (1).

We are given that the points $A$ and $B$ are distance 6 apart. The distance between two points $(x_1, y_1)$ and $(x_2, y_2)$ is given by $\sqrt{(x_2 - x_1)^2 + (y_2 - y_1)^2}$. In this case, we have $y_1 = y_2 = 4$, so the distance simplifies to $|x_2 - x_1|$. We are given that this distance is 6, so $|x_2 - x_1| = 6$.

The sum of the squares of the distances from $A$ and $B$ to the origin is $x_1^2 + y_1^2 + x_2^2 + y_2^2 = x_1^2 + 4^2 + x_2^2 + 4^2 = x_1^2 + x_2^2 + 32$.

We know from Vieta's formulas that for a quadratic equation $ax^2 + bx + c = 0$, the sum of the roots is $-b/a$ and the product of the roots is $c/a$. In equation (1), $a = k$, $b = -2k$, and $c = l - 4$.

We are given that the roots $x_1$ and $x_2$ are distance 6 apart, which means $(x_2 - x_1)^2 = 6^2 = 36$. But $(x_2 - x_1)^2 = (x_2 + x_1)^2 - 4x_1x_2$. From Vieta's formulas, $x_1 + x_2 = -(-2k)/k = 2$ and $x_1x_2 = (l - 4)/k$. Substituting these into the equation gives $36 = 4 - 4(l - 4)/k$, or $4(l - 4)/k = -32$, or $(l - 4)/k = -8$. Solving for $l$ gives $l = 4 - 8k$.

Substituting $l = 4 - 8k$ into equation (1) gives $kx^2 - 2kx + 4 - 8k - 4 = 0$, or $kx^2 - 2kx - 8k = 0$.

Now we can use Vieta's formulas again. The sum of the squares of the roots is $(x_1^2 + x_2^2) = (x_1 + x_2)^2 - 2x_1x_2 = 2^2 - 2(-8) = 4 + 16 = 20$.

Finally, the sum of the squares of the distances from $A$ and $B$ to the origin is $x_1^2 + x_2^2 + 32 = 20 + 32 = 52$. The answer is: $52$

Question (hint: positive numerical answer):
"Let $k, l > 0$ be parameters. The parabola $y = kx^2 - 2kx + l$ intersects the line $y = 4$ at two points $A$ and $B$. These points are distance 6 apart. What is the sum of the squares of the distances from $A$ and $B$ to the origin?"
Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:


To find the $x$-coordinates of points $A$ and $B$, we set $y = 4$ in the equation of the parabola:
\[4 = kx^2 - 2kx + l.\]
Rearranging terms, we get the quadratic equation:
\[kx^2 - 2kx + (l - 4) = 0.\]
Let $x_1$ and $x_2$ be the roots of this quadratic equation. By Vieta's formulas, we know that $x_1 + x_2 = \frac{2k}{k} = 2$ and $x_1x_2 = \frac{l - 4}{k}$. We are given that $|x_1 - x_2| = 6/k$.

By the difference of squares, we have $(x_1 - x_2)^2 = (x_1 + x_2)^2 - 4x_1x_2 = \left(\frac{6}{k}\right)^2$. Substituting the values of $x_1 + x_2$ and $x_1x_2$, we get:
\[\left(2\right)^2 - 4\cdot\frac{l - 4}{k} = \left(\frac{6}{k}\right)^2.\]
Simplifying, we get:
\[4 - \frac{4l - 16}{k} = \frac{36}{k^2}.\]
Multiplying through by $k^2$ gives:
\[4k^2 - 4lk + 16k = 36.\]
Rearranging terms, we have:
\[4k^2 - 4lk + 16k - 36 = 0.\]
Dividing through by 4, we get:
\[k^2 - lk + 4k - 9 = 0.\]
Now, we want to find the sum of the squares of the distances from $A$ and $B$ to the origin. This is equal to $(x_1)^2 + (x_2)^2$. Using the identity $(x_1 + x_2)^2 - 2(x_1x_2) = (x_1)^2 + (x_2)^2$, we can find:
\[(x_1)^2 + (x_2)^2 = (x_1 + x_2)^2 - 2x_1x_2 = (2)^2 - 2\cdot\frac{l - 4}{k} = 4 - \frac{2l - 8}{k}.\]
Substituting the value of $k^2 - lk + 4k - 9 = 0$, we get:
\[(x_1)^2 + (x_2)^2 = 4 - \frac{2l - 8}{k} = 4 - \frac{2(9 - k^2 + 4k)}{k} = 4 - \frac{18 - 2k^2 + 8k}{k} = 4 - \frac{18}{k} + 2k - \frac{8}{k}.\]
Simplifying, we get:
\[(x_1)^2 + (x_2)^2 = 4 - \frac{18}{k} + 2k - \frac{8}{k} = 4 - \frac{18 + 8}{k} + 2k = 4 - \frac{26}{k} + 2k.\]
To find the value of $(x_1)^2 + (x_2)^2$, we substitute the value of $k$ from the quadratic equation $k^2 - lk + 4k - 9 = 0$. By Vieta's formulas, we know that $k = \frac{l}{2}$. Substituting this into the equation $k^2 - lk + 4k - 9 = 0$, we get:
\[\left(\frac{l}{2}\right)^2 - l\cdot\frac{l}{2} + 4\cdot\frac{l}{2} - 9 = 0.\]
Simplifying, we get:
\[\frac{l^2}{4} - \frac{l^2}{2} + 2l - 9 = 0.\]
Multiplying through by 4 to clear the fractions, we get:
\[l^2 - 2l^2 + 8l - 36 = 0.\]
Rearranging terms, we have:
\[-l^2 + 8l - 36 = 0.\]
Multiplying through by -1, we get:
\[l^2 - 8l + 36 = 0.\]
This is a perfect square trinomial: $(l - 4)^2 = 0$. Thus, $l = 4$. Substituting this into the equation $k = \frac{l}{2}$, we get $k = 2$.

Now, we can substitute the values of $k = 2$ and $l = 4$ into the equation $(x_1)^2 + (x_2)^2 = 4 - \frac{26}{k} + 2k$. We get:
\[(x_1)^2 + (x_2)^2 = 4 - \frac{26}{2} + 2(2) = 4 - 13 + 4 = -5.\]
However, this result is not possible, as the square of a distance cannot be negative. Therefore, we must have made a mistake in our calculations. Let's go back and retrace our steps.

When we substituted $k = \frac{l}{2}$ into the equation $k^2 - lk + 4k - 9 = 0$, we should have multiplied through by 2 to get:
\[2k^2 - 2lk + 8k - 18 = 0.\]
This equation is still quadratic in $k$, but the coefficients are different from the original equation. Let's substitute $k = \frac{l}{2}$ into this new equation and see what we get:
\[2\left(\frac{l}{2}\right)^2 - 2l\cdot\frac{l}{2} + 8\cdot\frac{l}{2} - 18 = 0.\]
Simplifying, we get:
\[\frac{l^2}{2} - l^2 + 4l - 18 = 0.\]
Multiplying through by 2 to clear the fraction, we get:
\[l^2 - 2l^2 + 8l - 36 = 0.\]
Rearranging terms, we have:
\[-l^2 + 8l - 36 = 0.\]
Multiplying through by -1, we get:
\[l^2 - 8l + 36 = 0.\]
This is a perfect square trinomial: $(l - 4)^2 = 0$. Thus, $l = 4$. Substituting this into the equation $k = \frac{l}{2}$, we get $k = 2$.

Now, we can substitute the values

Question (hint: positive numerical answer):
"Let $k, l > 0$ be parameters. The parabola $y = kx^2 - 2kx + l$ intersects the line $y = 4$ at two points $A$ and $B$. These points are distance 6 apart. What is the sum of the squares of the distances from $A$ and $B$ to the origin?"
Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:


First, we find the points of intersection of the parabola $y = kx^2 - 2kx + l$ and the line $y = 4$. Setting the two equations equal to each other gives:
\[4 = kx^2 - 2kx + l.\]
Rearranging, we get the quadratic equation:
\[kx^2 - 2kx + (l - 4) = 0.\]
Since the parabola intersects the line at two points $A$ and $B$, these points correspond to the two solutions $x_1$ and $x_2$ of the quadratic equation. We are given that the distance between $A$ and $B$ is 6, which means $|x_1 - x_2| = 6$. By Vieta's formulas, we know that $x_1 + x_2 = \frac{2k}{k} = 2$ and $x_1x_2 = \frac{l - 4}{k}$. We can use the difference of squares identity to find:
\[(x_1 - x_2)^2 = (x_1 + x_2)^2 - 4x_1x_2 = 4 - 4\frac{l - 4}{k} = \frac{16 - 4l + 16}{k} = \frac{32 - 4l}{k}.\]
Since $(x_1 - x_2)^2 = 36$, we have $\frac{32 - 4l}{k} = 36$, which simplifies to $32 - 4l = 36k$.

Now, we want to find the sum of the squares of the distances from $A$ and $B$ to the origin. The coordinates of $A$ and $B$ are $(x_1, 4)$ and $(x_2, 4)$ respectively. The distance from a point $(x, y)$ to the origin is $\sqrt{x^2 + y^2} = \sqrt{x^2 + 16}$. So, the sum of the squares of the distances from $A$ and $B$ to the origin is:
\[(x_1^2 + 16) + (x_2^2 + 16) = x_1^2 + x_2^2 + 32.\]
By Vieta's formulas, we know that $x_1^2 + x_2^2 = (x_1 + x_2)^2 - 2x_1x_2 = 4 - 2\frac{l - 4}{k} = 4 - \frac{2l - 8}{k} = \frac{8 + 2l}{k}$.

Substituting this into our expression for the sum of the squares of the distances, we get:
\[\frac{8 + 2l}{k} + 32 = \frac{8 + 2l + 32k}{k}.\]
From the equation $32 - 4l = 36k$, we can solve for $l$ to get $l = \frac{32 - 36k}{4}$. Substituting this into our expression for the sum of the squares of the distances, we get:
\[\frac{8 + 2\left(\frac{32 - 36k}{4}\right) + 32k}{k} = \frac{8 + 16 - 18k + 32k}{k} = \frac{24 + 14k}{k}.\]
From the equation $32 - 4l = 36k$, we can also solve for $k$ to get $k = \frac{32 - 4l}{36}$. Substituting this into our expression for the sum of the squares of the distances, we get:
\[\frac{24 + 14\left(\frac{32 - 4l}{36}\right)}{\frac{32 - 4l}{36}} = \frac{24(36) + 14(32 - 4l)}{32 - 4l} = \frac{864 + 448 - 56l}{32 - 4l} = \frac{1312 - 56l}{32 - 4l}.\]
We know that $l = \frac{32 - 36k}{4}$, so we can substitute this into our expression for the sum of the squares of the distances to get:
\[\frac{1312 - 56\left(\frac{32 - 36k}{4}\right)}{32 - 4\left(\frac{32 - 36k}{4}\right)} = \frac{1312 - 448 + 168k}{32 - 32 + 36k} = \frac{864 + 168k}{36k}.\]
Finally, we know that $k = \frac{32 - 4l}{36}$, so we can substitute this into our expression for the sum of the squares of the distances to get:
\[\frac{864 + 168\left(\frac{32 - 4l}{36}\right)}{\frac{32 - 4l}{36}} = \frac{864(36) + 168(32 - 4l)}{32 - 4l} = \frac{31104 + 5376 - 704l}{32 - 4l} = \frac{36480 - 704l}{32 - 4l}.\]
We know that $l = \frac{32 - 36k}{4}$, so we can substitute this into our expression for the sum of the squares of the distances to get:
\[\frac{36480 - 704\left(\frac{32 - 36k}{4}\right)}{32 - 4\left(\frac{32 - 36k}{4}\right)} = \frac{36480 - 5376 + 704(36k)}{32 - 32 + 36k} = \frac{31104 + 704(36k)}{36k}.\]
Finally, we know that $k = \frac{32 - 4l}{36}$, so we can substitute this into our expression for the sum of the squares of the distances to get:
\[\frac{31104 + 704\left(36\left(\frac{32 - 4l}{36}\right)\right)}{\frac{32 - 4l}{36}} = \frac{31104 + 704(32 - 4l)}{32 - 4l} = \frac{31104 + 22528 - 2816l}{32 - 4l} = \frac{53632 - 2816l}{32 - 4l}.\]

Question (hint: positive numerical answer):
"Let $k, l > 0$ be parameters. The parabola $y = kx^2 - 2kx + l$ intersects the line $y = 4$ at two points $A$ and $B$. These points are distance 6 apart. What is the sum of the squares of the distances from $A$ and $B$ to the origin?"
Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:



The parabola $y = kx^2 - 2kx + l$ intersects the line $y = 4$ at two points $A$ and $B$. This means that when we substitute $y = 4$ into the equation of the parabola, we get a quadratic equation. Let's do that:
\[4 = kx^2 - 2kx + l.\]
Rearranging terms gives us:
\[kx^2 - 2kx + (l - 4) = 0.\]
This is a quadratic equation, and we know that it has two solutions (the $x$-coordinates of points $A$ and $B$) that are distance 6 apart. The distance between two points in a plane with coordinates $(x_1, y_1)$ and $(x_2, y_2)$ is given by $\sqrt{(x_2 - x_1)^2 + (y_2 - y_1)^2}$. Here, $y_1 = y_2 = 4$, so the distance is just $|x_2 - x_1| = 6$. 

The sum of the squares of the distances from $A$ and $B$ to the origin is just the sum of the squares of the coordinates of these points. Since the origin is at $(0,0)$, the sum of the squares of the distances from $A$ and $B$ to the origin is just $x_1^2 + y_1^2 + x_2^2 + y_2^2 = x_1^2 + 16 + x_2^2 + 16 = x_1^2 + x_2^2 + 32$.

We know that $x_1$ and $x_2$ are the roots of the quadratic equation $kx^2 - 2kx + (l - 4) = 0$. By Vieta's formulas, the sum of the roots of this equation is $\frac{2k}{k} = 2$, and the product of the roots is $\frac{l - 4}{k}$. 

Since the distance between the roots is 6, we can use the formula for the distance between two roots of a quadratic equation, which is $\sqrt{(2)^2 - 4(1)(l - 4)/k} = 6$. Squaring both sides gives us:
\[4 - \frac{4(l - 4)}{k} = 36.\]
Simplifying gives us:
\[- \frac{4(l - 4)}{k} = 32.\]
Multiplying both sides by $-k$ gives us:
\[4(l - 4) = -32k.\]
Dividing both sides by 4 gives us:
\[l - 4 = -8k.\]
Rearranging terms gives us:
\[l = 4 - 8k.\]
Now we can substitute this into the equation $x_1^2 + x_2^2 + 32$. Since $x_1^2 + x_2^2 = (x_1 + x_2)^2 - 2x_1x_2$, and by Vieta's formulas, $x_1 + x_2 = 2$ and $x_1x_2 = \frac{l - 4}{k}$, we have:
\[x_1^2 + x_2^2 = 2^2 - 2\frac{l - 4}{k} = 4 - 2\frac{4 - 8k - 4}{k} = 4 - 2\frac{-8k}{k} = 4 + 16 = 20.\]
So the sum of the squares of the distances from $A$ and $B$ to the origin is $x_1^2 + x_2^2 + 32 = 20 + 32 = 52$.
The answer is: $52$.

Question (hint: positive numerical answer):
"Let $k, l > 0$ be parameters. The parabola $y = kx^2 - 2kx + l$ intersects the line $y = 4$ at two points $A$ and $B$. These points are distance 6 apart. What is the sum of the squares of the distances from $A$ and $B$ to the origin?"
Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:


First, we set the equation of the parabola equal to the equation of the line $y=4$:
\[4 = kx^2 - 2kx + l.\]
Rearranging, we get
\[kx^2 - 2kx + (l - 4) = 0.\]
This is a quadratic equation, and we know that the line intersects the parabola at two points $A$ and $B$ which are distance 6 apart. Therefore, the difference of the roots of the quadratic equation is 6. The difference of the roots of a quadratic equation $ax^2 + bx + c = 0$ is given by $\frac{\sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{a}$. In this case, $a = k$, $b = -2k$, and $c = l - 4$. So we have
\[6 = \frac{\sqrt{(-2k)^2 - 4k(l - 4)}}{k} = \frac{\sqrt{4k^2 - 4kl + 16k}}{k} = \sqrt{4k^2 - 4kl + 16k}.\]
Squaring both sides, we get
\[36 = 4k^2 - 4kl + 16k.\]
Rearranging, we get
\[4k^2 - 4kl + 16k - 36 = 0.\]
Dividing by 4, we get
\[k^2 - kl + 4k - 9 = 0.\]
This is a quadratic equation in $k$. Let's solve it for $k$. We can use the quadratic formula:
\[k = \frac{l \pm \sqrt{l^2 - 4(1)(-9)}}{2} = \frac{l \pm \sqrt{l^2 + 36}}{2}.\]
Since $k > 0$, we take the positive root:
\[k = \frac{l + \sqrt{l^2 + 36}}{2}.\]
Now, we need to find the sum of the squares of the distances from $A$ and $B$ to the origin. The distance from a point $(x, y)$ to the origin is $\sqrt{x^2 + y^2}$. For points on the parabola $y = kx^2 - 2kx + l$, we have $y = kx^2 - 2kx + l$, so the distance from a point $(x, kx^2 - 2kx + l)$ to the origin is $\sqrt{x^2 + (kx^2 - 2kx + l)^2}$. The sum of the squares of the distances from $A$ and $B$ to the origin is
\[\left(\sqrt{x_A^2 + (kx_A^2 - 2kx_A + l)^2}\right)^2 + \left(\sqrt{x_B^2 + (kx_B^2 - 2kx_B + l)^2}\right)^2.\]
Since $A$ and $B$ are symmetric with respect to the $y$-axis (because the line $y=4$ is symmetric with respect to the $y$-axis and the parabola $y=kx^2 - 2kx + l$ is also symmetric with respect to the $y$-axis), the $x$-coordinates of $A$ and $B$ are negatives of each other. Let's say $x_A = a$ and $x_B = -a$. Then the sum of the squares of the distances from $A$ and $B$ to the origin is
\[\left(\sqrt{a^2 + (ka^2 - 2ka + l)^2}\right)^2 + \left(\sqrt{(-a)^2 + (k(-a)^2 - 2k(-a) + l)^2}\right)^2.\]
This simplifies to
\[\left(\sqrt{a^2 + (ka^2 - 2ka + l)^2}\right)^2 + \left(\sqrt{a^2 + (ka^2 + 2ka + l)^2}\right)^2.\]
This expression is difficult to simplify further, but we can use the fact that the sum of the squares of the distances from $A$ and $B$ to the origin is twice the square of the distance from the midpoint of $A$ and $B$ to the origin. The midpoint of $A$ and $B$ is the point $(0, \frac{l}{2})$, so the distance from the midpoint to the origin is $\sqrt{0^2 + \left(\frac{l}{2}\right)^2} = \frac{l}{2}$. Therefore, the sum of the squares of the distances from $A$ and $B$ to the origin is $2\left(\frac{l}{2}\right)^2 = \frac{l^2}{2}$.

Now, we substitute the value of $k$ we found earlier:
\[k = \frac{l + \sqrt{l^2 + 36}}{2}.\]
We can simplify this expression:
\[2k = l + \sqrt{l^2 + 36}.\]
Squaring both sides, we get
\[4k^2 = l^2 + 2l\sqrt{l^2 + 36} + l^2 + 36.\]
Rearranging, we get
\[4k^2 - 2l^2 = 2l\sqrt{l^2 + 36} + 36.\]
Subtracting $2l^2$ from both sides, we get
\[4k^2 - 2l^2 - 36 = 2l\sqrt{l^2 + 36}.\]
Dividing by 2, we get
\[2k^2 - l^2 - 18 = l\sqrt{l^2 + 36}.\]
Squaring both sides, we get
\[4k^4 - 4l^2k^2 + l^4 + 36l^2 - l^2(l^2 + 36) = 0.\]
Expanding, we get
\[4k^4 - 4l^2k^2 + l^4 + 36l^2 - l^4 - 36l^2 = 0.\]
Simplifying, we get
\[4k^4 - 4l^2k^2 = 0.\]
Dividing by 4, we get
\[k^4 - l^2k^2 = 0.\]
Factoring, we get
\[k^2(k^2 - l^2) = 0.\]
Since $k > 0$, we have $k^2 - l^2 = 0$, or $k^2 = l^2$. Taking the square root of both sides, we get $k = l$.

Now, we substitute this into the equation $2k = l + \sqrt{l^2 + 36}$:
\[2l = l + \sqrt{l^2 + 36}.\]
Subtracting $l$ from both sides, we get
\[l = \sqrt{l^2 + 36}.\]
Squaring both sides, we get
\[l^2 = l^2 +

Question (hint: positive numerical answer):
"Let $k, l > 0$ be parameters. The parabola $y = kx^2 - 2kx + l$ intersects the line $y = 4$ at two points $A$ and $B$. These points are distance 6 apart. What is the sum of the squares of the distances from $A$ and $B$ to the origin?"
Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:


To find the points $A$ and $B$, we set $y = 4$ in the equation of the parabola:
\[4 = kx^2 - 2kx + l.\]
Rearranging terms, we have $kx^2 - 2kx + (l - 4) = 0$.

Since the parabola intersects the line $y = 4$ at two points, this quadratic equation has two distinct real roots, say $x_1$ and $x_2$, which represent the x-coordinates of points $A$ and $B$.

Given that the distance between $A$ and $B$ is 6, we have $|x_2 - x_1| = 6$. Using the fact that for a quadratic equation $ax^2 + bx + c = 0$, the roots $x_1$ and $x_2$ satisfy $x_1 + x_2 = -\frac{b}{a}$ and $x_1x_2 = \frac{c}{a}$, we can express the distance between $A$ and $B$ in terms of the coefficients of the quadratic equation:
\[(x_2 - x_1)^2 = (x_2 + x_1)^2 - 4x_1x_2 = \left(\frac{2k}{k}\right)^2 - 4\cdot\frac{l - 4}{k} = 4 - \frac{4(l - 4)}{k}.\]
Setting this equal to 36, we get
\[4 - \frac{4(l - 4)}{k} = 36 \Rightarrow \frac{4(l - 4)}{k} = -32 \Rightarrow 4(l - 4) = -32k \Rightarrow l - 4 = -8k \Rightarrow l = 4 - 8k.\]
Now we want to find the sum of the squares of the distances from $A$ and $B$ to the origin. The distance from a point $(x, y)$ to the origin is $\sqrt{x^2 + y^2}$. For point $A$ with coordinates $(x_1, 4)$, this distance is $\sqrt{x_1^2 + 4^2} = \sqrt{x_1^2 + 16}$. Similarly, for point $B$ with coordinates $(x_2, 4)$, the distance is $\sqrt{x_2^2 + 16}$.

The sum of the squares of the distances is then
\[(\sqrt{x_1^2 + 16})^2 + (\sqrt{x_2^2 + 16})^2 = x_1^2 + 16 + x_2^2 + 16 = x_1^2 + x_2^2 + 32.\]
We know that $x_1^2 + x_2^2 = (x_1 + x_2)^2 - 2x_1x_2 = \left(\frac{2k}{k}\right)^2 - 2\cdot\frac{l - 4}{k} = 4 - \frac{2(l - 4)}{k}$.

Substituting $l = 4 - 8k$ into this expression, we get
\[x_1^2 + x_2^2 = 4 - \frac{2((4 - 8k) - 4)}{k} = 4 - \frac{-16k}{k} = 4 + 16 = 20.\]
Therefore, the sum of the squares of the distances from $A$ and $B$ to the origin is $20 + 32 = 52$.
The answer is: $52$

Question (hint: positive numerical answer):
"Let $k, l > 0$ be parameters. The parabola $y = kx^2 - 2kx + l$ intersects the line $y = 4$ at two points $A$ and $B$. These points are distance 6 apart. What is the sum of the squares of the distances from $A$ and $B$ to the origin?"
Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:



First, we need to find the $x$-coordinates of points $A$ and $B$. Since the parabola $y = kx^2 - 2kx + l$ intersects the line $y = 4$, we can set these two equations equal to each other to get $kx^2 - 2kx + l = 4$. Rearranging, we have $kx^2 - 2kx + l - 4 = 0$. This is a quadratic equation, and we know that the solutions to this equation are the $x$-coordinates of points $A$ and $B$. Let's call these solutions $x_1$ and $x_2$. We are given that $|x_2 - x_1| = 6/k$.

Now, we want to find the sum of the squares of the distances from $A$ and $B$ to the origin. The distance from a point $(x, y)$ to the origin is $\sqrt{x^2 + y^2}$. So, the square of the distance from a point on the parabola to the origin is $x^2 + (kx^2 - 2kx + l)^2$. We want to find the sum of these squares for points $A$ and $B$, which means we want to find $x_1^2 + (kx_1^2 - 2kx_1 + l)^2 + x_2^2 + (kx_2^2 - 2kx_2 + l)^2$.

By Vieta's formulas, we know that $x_1 + x_2 = \frac{2k}{k} = 2$ and $x_1x_2 = \frac{l - 4}{k}$. We can use these formulas to express the desired sum in terms of $k$, $l$, $x_1$, and $x_2$.

We have $x_1^2 + x_2^2 = (x_1 + x_2)^2 - 2x_1x_2 = 2^2 - 2\cdot\frac{l - 4}{k} = 4 - \frac{2l - 8}{k} = \frac{4k - 2l + 8}{k}$.

Also, we have $(kx_1^2 - 2kx_1 + l)^2 + (kx_2^2 - 2kx_2 + l)^2 = k^2(x_1^2 + x_2^2) - 4k(kx_1x_2) + 2l(kx_1x_2) + l^2$.

Substituting the expressions for $x_1^2 + x_2^2$ and $x_1x_2$, we get
\begin{align*}
(kx_1^2 - 2kx_1 + l)^2 + (kx_2^2 - 2kx_2 + l)^2 &= k^2\left(\frac{4k - 2l + 8}{k}\right) - 4k\left(\frac{l - 4}{k}\right) + 2l\left(\frac{l - 4}{k}\right) + l^2 \\
&= 4k^2 - 2kl + 8k - 4l + 16 + 4l - 16 + 2l^2 - 8l + l^2 \\
&= 6l^2 - 10kl + 4k^2 + 8k.
\end{align*}

So the sum of the squares of the distances from $A$ and $B$ to the origin is $\frac{4k - 2l + 8}{k} + 6l^2 - 10kl + 4k^2 + 8k$.

To find the numerical value of this expression, we need to substitute the values of $k$ and $l$. However, we don't have enough information to do this yet. But we can express the final answer in terms of $k$ and $l$.

The sum of the squares of the distances from $A$ and $B$ to the origin is $\frac{4k - 2l + 8}{k} + 6l^2 - 10kl + 4k^2 + 8k$.

The value of this expression depends on the specific values of $k$ and $l$, which are not given in the problem. Therefore, we cannot find the numerical value of the sum of the squares of the distances from $A$ and $B$ to the origin without more information. The answer is: The sum of the squares of the distances from $A$ and $B$ to the origin is $\frac{4k - 2l + 8}{k} + 6l^2 - 10kl + 4k^2 + 8k$. However, we cannot find the numerical value without more information. So, we leave the expression as is. The answer is: $\frac{4k - 2l + 8}{k} + 6l^2 - 10kl + 4k^2 + 8k$.

Question (hint: positive numerical answer):
"Let $k, l > 0$ be parameters. The parabola $y = kx^2 - 2kx + l$ intersects the line $y = 4$ at two points $A$ and $B$. These points are distance 6 apart. What is the sum of the squares of the distances from $A$ and $B$ to the origin?"
Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:


The equation of the parabola is $y = kx^2 - 2kx + l$. The equation of the line is $y = 4$.
To find the points of intersection, we set the two equations equal to each other:
\[kx^2 - 2kx + l = 4.\]
Rearranging, we have $kx^2 - 2kx + l - 4 = 0$.
Let $x_1$ and $x_2$ be the x-coordinates of points $A$ and $B$, respectively. By Vieta's formulas, we have $x_1 + x_2 = \frac{2k}{k} = 2$ and $x_1x_2 = \frac{l - 4}{k}$.
Given that the distance between $A$ and $B$ is 6, we can use the distance formula to get
\[(x_2 - x_1)^2 = 6^2 = 36.\]
Expanding, we have $(x_2 - x_1)^2 = (x_2 + x_1)^2 - 4x_1x_2 = 4^2 - 4\left(\frac{l - 4}{k}\right) = 16 - \frac{4(l - 4)}{k}$.
Substituting the value of $x_1 + x_2$, we get
\[36 = 16 - \frac{4(l - 4)}{k}.\]
Simplifying, we have $\frac{4(l - 4)}{k} = 20$, or $l - 4 = 5k$.
Substituting this into the equation of the parabola at the point $(x_1, 4)$, we get
\[4 = kx_1^2 - 2kx_1 + l = kx_1^2 - 2kx_1 + 4 + 5k.\]
Rearranging, we have $kx_1^2 - 2kx_1 + 5k = 0$.
Using Vieta's formulas again, we have $x_1^2 + \left(\frac{2k}{k}\right)^2 - 2\cdot\frac{5k}{k} = 0$, or $x_1^2 + 4 - 10 = 0$.
Simplifying, we get $x_1^2 = 6$.
Similarly, we can find that $x_2^2 = 6$.
The sum of the squares of the distances from $A$ and $B$ to the origin is $x_1^2 + x_2^2 = 6 + 6 = 12$. The answer is: 12

Question (hint: positive numerical answer):
"Let $k, l > 0$ be parameters. The parabola $y = kx^2 - 2kx + l$ intersects the line $y = 4$ at two points $A$ and $B$. These points are distance 6 apart. What is the sum of the squares of the distances from $A$ and $B$ to the origin?"
Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:


To solve this problem, we first need to find the x-coordinates of points A and B.
The parabola $y = kx^2 - 2kx + l$ intersects the line $y = 4$, so we can set $kx^2 - 2kx + l = 4$.
Rearranging the equation gives $kx^2 - 2kx + l - 4 = 0$.
This is a quadratic equation in x, and we know that the distance between A and B is 6.
The quadratic formula gives us the x-coordinates of A and B as $\frac{2k \pm \sqrt{4k^2 - 4k(l - 4)}}{2k} = 1 \pm \frac{\sqrt{4k^2 - 4k(l - 4)}}{2k}$.
Let's denote these x-coordinates as $x_1$ and $x_2$, where $x_1 = 1 + \frac{\sqrt{4k^2 - 4k(l - 4)}}{2k}$ and $x_2 = 1 - \frac{\sqrt{4k^2 - 4k(l - 4)}}{2k}$.
The distance from A and B to the origin can be calculated as $\sqrt{x_1^2 + y_1^2}$ and $\sqrt{x_2^2 + y_2^2}$, respectively, where $y_1 = 4$ and $y_2 = 4$.
Therefore, the sum of the squares of the distances from A and B to the origin is $(x_1^2 + y_1^2) + (x_2^2 + y_2^2) = (x_1^2 + 16) + (x_2^2 + 16) = x_1^2 + x_2^2 + 32$.
We know that the distance between A and B is 6, so $|x_1 - x_2| = 6$.
Expanding $(x_1 - x_2)^2 = 36$ gives $x_1^2 - 2x_1x_2 + x_2^2 = 36$.
We can substitute $x_1x_2 = (1 + \frac{\sqrt{4k^2 - 4k(l - 4)}}{2k})(1 - \frac{\sqrt{4k^2 - 4k(l - 4)}}{2k}) = 1 - \frac{4k^2 - 4k(l - 4)}{4k^2} = 1 - (1 - \frac{l - 4}{k}) = \frac{l - 4}{k}$.
Thus, $x_1^2 + x_2^2 = 36 + 2\frac{l - 4}{k}$.
Finally, we substitute this into the sum of the squares of the distances: $(x_1^2 + x_2^2 + 32) = 36 + 2\frac{l - 4}{k} + 32 = 68 + 2\frac{l - 4}{k}$.
However, we know that the line $y = 4$ is tangent to the parabola $y = kx^2 - 2kx + l$ at the point of tangency, which is the midpoint of A and B.
The derivative of the parabola is $2kx - 2k$, and at the point of tangency, this is equal to the slope of the line $y = 4$, which is 0.
Therefore, $2kx - 2k = 0$ at the point of tangency, which gives $x = 1$.
Substituting $x = 1$ into the equation of the parabola gives $y = k - 2k + l = l - k$.
Since the point of tangency lies on the line $y = 4$, we have $l - k = 4$.
Substituting this into the sum of the squares of the distances gives $(68 + 2\frac{l - 4}{k}) = 68 + 2\frac{4}{k} = 68 + \frac{8}{k}$.
However, we also know that the line $y = 4$ is tangent to the parabola $y = kx^2 - 2kx + l$, so the discriminant of the quadratic equation must be zero.
The discriminant is $4k^2 - 4k(l - 4) = 0$.
Substituting $l - k = 4$ gives $4k^2 - 4k(4 - k + 4) = 0$, which simplifies to $4k^2 - 4k(8 - k) = 0$, or $4k^2 - 32k + 4k^2 = 0$, or $8k^2 - 32k = 0$.
Factoring out $8k$ gives $8k(k - 4) = 0$, so $k = 0$ or $k = 4$.
Since $k > 0$, we have $k = 4$.
Substituting this into the sum of the squares of the distances gives $68 + \frac{8}{4} = 68 + 2 = 70$.
Therefore, the sum of the squares of the distances from A and B to the origin is 70. The answer is: $70$
