Approach:


We can solve this problem by using the inequality $|a| + |b| \geq |a + b|$. Applying this inequality to the given equation $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$, we get:
\[|x-2y| + |-2x+y| \geq |x-2y - (-2x+y)| = |3x-3y| = 3|x-y|.\]
So we have $3|x-y| = 40$, which implies $|x-y| = \frac{40}{3}$.
Now let's consider the expression $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$. We can rewrite it as:
\[5(x^2+y^2) - 8xy = 5[(x-y)^2 + 2xy] - 8xy = 5(x-y)^2 + 3xy.\]
Substituting $|x-y| = \frac{40}{3}$, we get:
\[5\left(\frac{40}{3}\right)^2 + 3xy.\]
To minimize this expression, we need to minimize $xy$. By the inequality of arithmetic and geometric means, we have:
\[xy \geq \left(\frac{x+y}{2}\right)^2.\]
From $|x-y| = \frac{40}{3}$, we have $x+y = \pm \frac{40}{3}$.
So the minimum value of $xy$ is achieved when $x=y$, which gives $x=y=\pm \frac{20}{3}$.
Substituting these values into the expression $5(x-y)^2 + 3xy$, we get:
\[5\left(\frac{40}{3}\right)^2 + 3\left(\frac{20}{3}\right)^2 = \frac{8000}{9}.\]
Therefore, the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ is $\frac{8000}{9}$. The answer is: $\frac{8000}{9}$

Approach:



First, let's rewrite the expression $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ as $\frac{1}{2}((5x-4y)^2+(4y-5x)^2)$.

Now, let's consider the equation $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$. By the triangle inequality, we know that $|a| + |b| \geq |a+b|$, so $|x-2y| + |y-2x| \geq |(x-2y) + (y-2x)| = |-x - y| = |-(x+y)| = |x+y|$. Therefore, we have $|x+y| = 40$.

Let $A = 5x-4y$ and $B = 4y-5x$, then we have $\frac{1}{2}(A^2+B^2) = 5x^2+5y^2-8xy$. Notice that $A+B = (5x-4y) + (4y-5x) = 0$, so $A = -B$.

We know that $(A+B)^2 = A^2 + B^2 + 2AB$, so $0 = A^2 + B^2 + 2AB$, which implies $A^2 + B^2 = -2AB$.

Substituting $A = -B$, we get $A^2 + A^2 = -2A^2$, which implies $A^2 = \frac{1}{2}(A^2+B^2) = \frac{1}{2} \cdot 2(5x^2+5y^2-8xy) = 5x^2+5y^2-8xy$.

Therefore, the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ is achieved when $A^2 = 0$, which implies $5x-4y = 0$ and $4y-5x = 0$. Solving these equations, we find $x = \frac{4}{3}y$.

Substituting this into $|x+y| = 40$, we get $|\frac{7}{3}y| = 40$, which implies $y = \pm \frac{40 \cdot 3}{7} = \pm \frac{120}{7}$.

Substituting $y = \frac{120}{7}$ into $x = \frac{4}{3}y$, we get $x = \frac{4}{3} \cdot \frac{120}{7} = \frac{160}{7}$.

Substituting $x = \frac{160}{7}$ and $y = \frac{120}{7}$ into $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$, we get $5(\frac{160}{7})^2 + 5(\frac{120}{7})^2 - 8(\frac{160}{7})(\frac{120}{7}) = 0$.

Therefore, the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ is 0. The answer is: $0$

We are given the equation $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ and the constraint $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$. The constraint is actually a bit tricky to work with directly. Instead, we can use the Cauchy-Schwarz inequality to simplify the problem.

By the Cauchy-Schwarz inequality, we have:
\[(1+4)(x^2+y^2) \geq (x+2y)^2\]
\[5(x^2+y^2) \geq (x+2y)^2\]

Similarly,
\[5(x^2+y^2) \geq (2x+y)^2\]

Adding these two inequalities gives:
\[10(x^2+y^2) \geq (x+2y)^2 + (2x+y)^2\]
\[10(x^2+y^2) \geq x^2 + 4xy + 4y^2 + 4x^2 + 4xy + y^2\]
\[10(x^2+y^2) \geq 5x^2 + 8xy + 5y^2\]
\[5(x^2+y^2) \geq 8xy\]

Now, we can substitute this into the expression we want to minimize:
\[5x^2+5y^2-8xy = 5(x^2+y^2) - 8xy \geq 0\]

So the minimum value of the expression $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ is 0.

However, this minimum value is achieved when $x=2y$ and $y=2x$. Substituting these into the constraint gives:
\[|x-4x| + |2x-x| = |-3x| + |x| = 4x = 40\]
\[x = 10\]
\[y = 20\]

So the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ is indeed 0 when $x=10$ and $y=20$.

The answer is: $0$

Approach:



We can start by using the condition $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$. We know that $|a| + |b| = |a+b| + |a-b|/2$. So we can rewrite the condition as $|(x-2y) + (y-2x)| + |(x-2y) - (y-2x)|/2 = 40$. This simplifies to $|x-3y| + |y-x|/2 = 40$. 

Next, we know that $|a| = \sqrt{a^2}$, so we can rewrite the condition as $\sqrt{(x-3y)^2} + \sqrt{(y-x)^2}/2 = 40$. This simplifies to $\sqrt{x^2 - 6xy + 9y^2} + \sqrt{y^2 - 2xy + x^2}/2 = 40$. 

We can now use the fact that $a^2 + b^2 \geq 2ab$ for all real numbers $a$ and $b$. Applying this to the terms under the square roots gives us $\sqrt{(x^2 - 6xy + 9y^2) + (y^2 - 2xy + x^2)/4} \geq 40$. 

This simplifies to $\sqrt{5(x^2 + y^2 - 4xy)} \geq 40$. Squaring both sides gives us $5(x^2 + y^2 - 4xy) \geq 1600$. 

Now, we want to minimize the expression $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$. We know that $x^2 + y^2 - 4xy = (x-2y)^2/4$, so we can rewrite the expression as $5(x^2 + y^2 - 4xy) = 5(x-2y)^2/4$. 

Substituting the inequality $5(x^2 + y^2 - 4xy) \geq 1600$ into this gives us $5(x-2y)^2/4 \geq 1600$. Multiplying both sides by 4 gives us $5(x-2y)^2 \geq 6400$. Dividing both sides by 5 gives us $(x-2y)^2 \geq 1280$. 

Taking the square root of both sides gives us $|x-2y| \geq \sqrt{1280}$. 

Since $|x-2y| = 40$, we can conclude that $|x-2y| = \sqrt{1280}$. Squaring both sides gives us $(x-2y)^2 = 1280$. 

Substituting $x-2y = 40$ into this equation gives us $40^2 = 1280$. So we have found a solution to the condition $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$. 

Now, we can substitute this solution into the expression $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$. We have $5x^2+5y^2-8xy = 5(x^2 + y^2 - 4xy) = 5(x-2y)^2/4 = 5(1280)/4 = 1600$. 

So the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ is 1600.

The answer is: $\boxed{1600}$

Approach:


To solve this problem, we will first simplify the expression $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ by completing the square. Then we will use the condition $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$ to find the minimum value of the expression.

Step 1: Simplify the expression $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ by completing the square.
We can rewrite the expression as $5(x^2- \frac{8}{5}xy + y^2)$.
Now, complete the square inside the parentheses: $x^2- \frac{8}{5}xy + y^2 = (x - \frac{4}{5}y)^2 - \frac{16}{25}y^2 + y^2 = (x - \frac{4}{5}y)^2 + \frac{9}{25}y^2$.
So, $5x^2+5y^2-8xy = 5(x - \frac{4}{5}y)^2 + \frac{45}{5}y^2$.

Step 2: Use the condition $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$ to find the minimum value of the expression.
We know that $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$ implies $|x-2y| = |2x-y|$.
This means $x-2y = 2x-y$ or $x-2y = -(2x-y)$.
Solving the first equation gives $x = 3y$. Substituting this into the second equation gives $3y - 2y = -(6y - y)$, which simplifies to $y = 0$.
Then, $x = 3y = 0$.

Step 3: Substitute the values of $x$ and $y$ into the simplified expression.
$5x^2+5y^2-8xy = 5(0 - \frac{4}{5}\cdot0)^2 + \frac{45}{5}\cdot0^2 = 0$.

Therefore, the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ when $x$ and $y$ satisfy the condition $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$ is 0.
The answer is: $0$

Solve the following problem with a Python Script (positive numerical answer):

Approach:


This problem involves two parts: first, we need to find the relationship between $x$ and $y$ from the given equation $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$, and then substitute this relationship into the expression $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ to find its minimum value.

Step 1: Solve the equation $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$ for $x$ and $y$.

Since $|a - b| = |b - a|$, we can rewrite the equation as $|x - 2y| + |2y - x| = 40$.

By the definition of absolute value, we have:

1. If $x - 2y \geq 0$ and $2y - x \geq 0$, then $x - 2y + 2y - x = 40$, which simplifies to $0 = 40$, a contradiction.
2. If $x - 2y < 0$ and $2y - x < 0$, then $-(x - 2y) - (2y - x) = 40$, which simplifies to $-2(x - 2y) = 40$, and further simplifies to $x - 2y = -20$.
3. If $x - 2y \geq 0$ and $2y - x < 0$, then $x - 2y - (2y - x) = 40$, which simplifies to $2x - 4y = 40$, and further simplifies to $x - 2y = 20$.
4. If $x - 2y < 0$ and $2y - x \geq 0$, then $-(x - 2y) + (2y - x) = 40$, which simplifies to $-2(x - 2y) = 40$, and further simplifies to $x - 2y = -20$.

From the above analysis, we find that the only valid solution is $x - 2y = 20$.

Step 2: Substitute $x = 2y + 20$ into the expression $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$.

We have $5(2y + 20)^2 + 5y^2 - 8(2y + 20)y$.

Expanding and simplifying, we get $5(4y^2 + 80y + 400) + 5y^2 - 16y^2 - 160y = 20y^2 + 400y + 2000 + 5y^2 - 16y^2 - 160y = -y^2 + 240y + 2000$.

Step 3: Find the minimum value of the expression $-y^2 + 240y + 2000$.

To find the minimum value of a quadratic function $ax^2 + bx + c$, we can use the formula $x = -\frac{b}{2a}$. In this case, $a = -1$, $b = 240$, and $c = 2000$. So the $y$ value that gives the minimum value is $y = -\frac{240}{2(-1)} = 120$.

Step 4: Substitute $y = 120$ back into the equation $x = 2y + 20$ to find the corresponding $x$ value.

We have $x = 2(120) + 20 = 240 + 20 = 260$.

Step 5: Substitute $x = 260$ and $y = 120$ into the expression $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$.

We get $5(260)^2 + 5(120)^2 - 8(260)(120) = 338000$.

So the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ when $x$ and $y$ range over all real numbers such that $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$ is 338000.
The answer is: $338000$
