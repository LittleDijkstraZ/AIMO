Solve the following problem with a Python Script (positive numerical answer):
"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"
Write comments to indicate the steps you take. Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Assistant:

Approach:


The equation given is a product of two expressions, which is equal to zero. This means that either the first expression is zero or the second expression is zero. 

Let's consider the two cases:

1. $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$
This implies that $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$.
This is the equation of a square with side length 20 centered at the origin.

2. $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$
This implies that $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$.
This is the equation of a square with side length 16 centered at the origin.

The intersection of these two squares forms a smaller square with side length 16.

To find the area of this square, we simply square the length of its side. So the area is $16^2 = 256$.
The answer is: $256$

Approach:

 The equation given is a product of two terms equal to zero. Therefore, either the first term is zero or the second term is zero. This gives us two systems of equations to solve. The solutions to these systems of equations will be the vertices of the polygon. Once we have the vertices, we can calculate the area of the polygon.

1. Solve the system of equations: $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ and $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$.
This implies that $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$.
The solutions to these equations are all points of the form $(5,5)$, $(-5,-5)$, $(5,-5)$, and $(-5,5)$.

2. Solve the system of equations: $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ and $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$.
This implies that $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$.
The solutions to these equations are all points of the form $(8,0)$, $(-8,0)$, $(0,8)$, and $(0,-8)$.

The vertices of the polygon are the solutions to the above systems of equations.

The polygon is a square with side length 10. To find the area of the square, we use the formula $Area = side^2$. Therefore, the area of the polygon is $10^2 = 100$. The answer is: $100$

Approach:


The equation given in the problem is a product of two terms equal to zero. Therefore, either the first term is zero or the second term is zero.

1. If $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$, then $\vert x + y \vert = 10$, which implies $x + y = \pm 10$.
2. If $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$, then $\vert x - y \vert = 10$, which implies $x - y = \pm 10$.
3. If $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$, then $\vert x \vert = 8$, which implies $x = \pm 8$.
4. If $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$, then $\vert y \vert = 8$, which implies $y = \pm 8$.

The system of equations formed by these conditions represents a square with side length 16. To find the area of the square, we simply square the length of its side: $16^2 = 256$.

So, the area of the convex polygon is 256 square units. The answer is: $256$

Approach:


The equation $A \cdot B = 0$ implies that either $A = 0$ or $B = 0$. Therefore, the given equation is equivalent to either $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$.
The first equation implies that $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. This gives us four equations: $x + y = 10$, $x + y = -10$, $x - y = 10$, and $x - y = -10$. Solving these equations, we find the vertices of the polygon: $(5,5)$, $(5,-5)$, $(-5,5)$, and $(-5,-5)$.
The second equation implies that $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$. This gives us four more vertices: $(8,0)$, $(-8,0)$, $(0,8)$, and $(0,-8)$.
The polygon formed by these vertices is a square with side length $10$. Therefore, its area is $10^2 = 100$.

The answer is: $100$

Solve the following problem with a Python Script (positive numerical answer):
"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"
Write comments to indicate the steps you take. Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Assistant:

Approach:


The equation $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ is true if and only if either of the two factors is zero. 

This gives us two cases:

1. $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ and $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 \neq 0$.
2. $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 \neq 0$ and $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$.

For the first case, we have $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$. This means $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. This is the equation of a square with side length 20.

For the second case, we have $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$. This means $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$. This is the equation of a square with side length 16.

Therefore, the convex polygon is the union of two squares, one with side length 20 and the other with side length 16.

The area of a square is given by the square of its side length. So the area of the larger square is $20^2 = 400$ and the area of the smaller square is $16^2 = 256$.

The area of the convex polygon is the sum of the areas of the two squares, which is $400 + 256 = 656$.

Therefore, the area of the convex polygon is 656 square units. The answer is: $656$

Solve the following problem with a Python Script (positive numerical answer):
"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"

Assistant:

Approach:


The given equation is a product of two expressions, so it equals to zero if and only if at least one of the expressions equals to zero. Thus, the points that satisfy the equation are the solutions of the following two equations:
1. $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$.
2. $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$.

For the first equation, we have $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. This implies that $x + y = \pm 10$ and $x - y = \pm 10$. Solving these four equations, we get the vertices of the square as $(5, 5), (5, -5), (-5, -5), (-5, 5)$.

For the second equation, we have $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$. This implies that $x = \pm 8$ and $y = \pm 8$. Solving these four equations, we get the vertices of the square as $(8, 0), (0, 8), (0, -8), (-8, 0)$.

The two squares overlap at the origin, so the area of the convex polygon formed by the union of the two squares is the sum of the areas of the two squares minus the area of the overlapping square. The side length of the first square is $10$, so its area is $10^2 = 100$. The side length of the second square is $8$, so its area is $8^2 = 64$. The side length of the overlapping square is $8$, so its area is $8^2 = 64$.

Therefore, the area of the convex polygon is $100 + 64 - 64 = 100$. The answer is: $100$

Solve the following problem with a Python Script (positive numerical answer):
"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"

Approach:



The equation $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ is satisfied if and only if either of the two factors is zero. This gives us two sets of equations to solve:

1. $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ and $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$
2. $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ and $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$

For the first set of equations, we have $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x \vert = 8$. This implies $-10 \leq x + y \leq 10$ and $-8 \leq x \leq 8$. Similarly, for the second set of equations, we have $\vert x - y \vert = 10$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$. This implies $-10 \leq x - y \leq 10$ and $-8 \leq y \leq 8$.

The points that satisfy both sets of equations are the points that lie in the intersection of the four regions defined by the above inequalities. These regions form a square with side length 16. Therefore, the area of the convex polygon is $16^2 = 256$. The answer is: $\boxed{256}$

Approach:


The equation $A \cdot B = 0$ is equivalent to either $A = 0$ or $B = 0$. Therefore, the given equation is equivalent to either $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$.

The equation $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ implies that $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. This is only possible when $x = y = \pm 10$ or $x = -y = \pm 10$.

The equation $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ implies that $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$. This is only possible when $x = y = \pm 8$.

Therefore, the vertices of the polygon are $(8,8)$, $(8,-8)$, $(-8,8)$, and $(-8,-8)$. These form a square with side length $16$. The area of the square is $16^2 = 256$.
The answer is: $256$
