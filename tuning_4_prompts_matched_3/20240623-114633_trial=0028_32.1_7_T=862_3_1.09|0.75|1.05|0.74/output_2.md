To find the number of positive integers $m$ for which the equation \[\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}\] has $4$ distinct solutions, we need to consider the possible values of $m$ that make the right-hand side of the equation a number between $0$ and $1$.

If $\frac{m}{100} > 1$, then the equation has at most $2$ solutions, so $\frac{m}{100}$ must be between $0$ and $1$.

This means $0 \leq \frac{m}{100} \leq 1$, or equivalently, $0 \leq m \leq 100$.

To find the number of positive integers in this range, we simply count the integers from $1$ to $100$, inclusive.

So the number of positive integers $m$ for which the equation has $4$ distinct solutions is $100$.

The answer is: $100$

To find the number of positive integers $m$ for which the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has $4$ distinct solutions, we need to consider the possible values of $\frac{m}{100}$.
The absolute value equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ can have four distinct solutions if and only if $\frac{m}{100}$ is strictly between $0$ and $2$.
So we need to find the number of positive integers $m$ such that $0<\frac{m}{100}<2$.
Multiplying through by $100$, we get $0<m<200$.
The positive integers $m$ that satisfy this inequality are $1, 2, 3, ..., 199$.
So there are $199$ positive integers $m$ for which the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has $4$ distinct solutions.
The answer is: 199

Approach:



The equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has 4 distinct solutions if and only if $\frac{m}{100}$ is a positive number between 1 and 2. This is because the expression on the left side of the equation, $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert$, can take on exactly 4 distinct values between 0 and 3 (inclusive). Therefore, we need to find the number of positive integers $m$ such that $\frac{m}{100}$ is in the interval $(1, 2]$.

This is equivalent to finding the number of positive integers $m$ such that $1 < m \leq 200$.

Calculations:

The number of positive integers $m$ in the interval $(1, 200]$ is simply $200 - 1 = 199$.

So, there are 199 positive integers $m$ for which the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has 4 distinct solutions.
The answer is: $199$

To find the number of positive integers $m$ for which the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has 4 distinct solutions, we need to analyze the behavior of the equation.

First, let's consider the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$. This equation will have 4 distinct solutions if the right side, $\frac{m}{100}$, falls into a specific range. Specifically, it must be in the range $(0, 2)$.

If $\frac{m}{100} > 2$, then the equation has at most 2 distinct solutions. If $\frac{m}{100} < 0$, then the equation has no solutions.

So, we need to find the number of positive integers $m$ such that $0 < \frac{m}{100} < 2$. This simplifies to $0 < m < 200$.

Now, we need to count the number of positive integers in this range. The positive integers in the range $(0, 200)$ are exactly the integers from 1 to 199.

Therefore, there are 199 positive integers $m$ for which the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has 4 distinct solutions.

So, the answer is $199$. The answer is: $199$

Approach:



To solve the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ having $4$ distinct solutions, we need to find the number of values of $m$ such that the right side of the equation is in the range of the number of solutions of the inner absolute value equation.

The inner absolute value equation is $\vert x-1 \vert -2=\pm \frac{m}{100}$.

Let's first solve the case $\vert x-1 \vert -2= \frac{m}{100}$.

$\vert x-1 \vert = 2 + \frac{m}{100}$

This equation has two solutions: $x-1 = 2 + \frac{m}{100}$ and $x-1 = -(2 + \frac{m}{100})$.

Solving the first equation gives $x = 3 + \frac{m}{100}$.

Solving the second equation gives $x = -1 - \frac{m}{100}$.

Now, we need to find the range of $m$ such that these two solutions are distinct and $x$ is in the valid range for the absolute value function (i.e., $x \geq -1$).

For $x = 3 + \frac{m}{100}$ to be greater than or equal to $-1$, we have $3 + \frac{m}{100} \geq -1$, which gives $m \geq -400$.

For $x = -1 - \frac{m}{100}$ to be less than $3 + \frac{m}{100}$, we have $-1 - \frac{m}{100} < 3 + \frac{m}{100}$, which gives $m > -200$.

So, the range of $m$ for the first case is $-400 \leq m < -200$.

Now let's solve the case $\vert x-1 \vert -2= -\frac{m}{100}$.

$\vert x-1 \vert = 2 - \frac{m}{100}$

This equation has two solutions: $x-1 = 2 - \frac{m}{100}$ and $x-1 = -(2 - \frac{m}{100})$.

Solving the first equation gives $x = 3 - \frac{m}{100}$.

Solving the second equation gives $x = -1 + \frac{m}{100}$.

Now, we need to find the range of $m$ such that these two solutions are distinct and $x$ is in the valid range for the absolute value function (i.e., $x \leq 3$).

For $x = 3 - \frac{m}{100}$ to be less than or equal to $3$, we have $3 - \frac{m}{100} \leq 3$, which gives $m \geq 0$.

For $x = -1 + \frac{m}{100}$ to be less than $3 - \frac{m}{100}$, we have $-1 + \frac{m}{100} < 3 - \frac{m}{100}$, which gives $m < 200$.

So, the range of $m$ for the second case is $0 \leq m < 200$.

The union of these two ranges gives $-400 \leq m < -200$ or $0 \leq m < 200$.

This means that the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has $4$ distinct solutions when $m$ is in the range $-400 \leq m < -200$ or $0 \leq m < 200$.

Now we need to count the number of positive integers $m$ in this range.

For the range $-400 \leq m < -200$, there are $200$ positive integers.

For the range $0 \leq m < 200$, there are $200$ positive integers.

So, the total number of positive integers $m$ is $200 + 200 = 400$.

Therefore, the number of positive integers $m$ such that the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has $4$ distinct solutions is $400$. The answer is: $400$

Approach:


We need to find the number of positive integers $m$ such that the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has $4$ distinct solutions.
The equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ can be rewritten as $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=0.01m$.
The equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=0$ has three cases:
Case 1: $\vert x-1 \vert -2=0$, which gives $\vert x-1 \vert =2$.
Case 2: $\vert x-1 \vert -2>0$, which gives $\vert x-1 \vert >2$, so $x-1<-2$ or $x-1>2$.
Case 3: $\vert x-1 \vert -2<0$, which gives $\vert x-1 \vert <2$, so $-2<x-1<2$.

For each case, we can solve the inequalities and find the number of distinct solutions.
Case 1 gives two solutions: $x=3$ and $x=-1$.
Case 2 gives no solutions because $x-1<-2$ and $x-1>2$ have no common solutions.
Case 3 gives two solutions: $-1<x<3$.

So the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=0$ has $4$ distinct solutions: $-1$, $1$, and $3$.
To find the number of positive integers $m$ such that the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=0.01m$ has $4$ distinct solutions, we need to find the value of $m$ such that $0.01m=1$.
This gives $m=100$.

Therefore, there is only one positive integer $m$ such that the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has $4$ distinct solutions.

The value of $m$ is $100$.
The answer is: $100$

Approach:


The given equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has 4 distinct solutions. This means that the expression inside the absolute value, i.e., $\vert x-1 \vert -2$, must take on two positive and two negative values that are $\frac{m}{100}$ apart. 

Let's denote $\vert x-1 \vert -2 = y$. The equation becomes $\vert y \vert = \frac{m}{100}$. This implies that $y$ must be $\frac{m}{100}$ or $-\frac{m}{100}$. 

So we have two cases:
1) $\vert x-1 \vert -2 = \frac{m}{100}$: Solving this gives $\vert x-1 \vert = \frac{m}{100} + 2$. The two solutions for $x$ in this case are $x = 1 + \frac{m}{100} + 2$ and $x = 1 - \frac{m}{100} - 2$.
2) $\vert x-1 \vert -2 = -\frac{m}{100}$: Solving this gives $\vert x-1 \vert = 2 - \frac{m}{100}$. The two solutions for $x$ in this case are $x = 1 + 2 - \frac{m}{100}$ and $x = 1 - 2 + \frac{m}{100}$.

For the two cases to give 4 distinct solutions, the distances between the four solutions must be $\frac{m}{100}$. 

By comparing the solutions from the two cases, we see that the distance between the first and second solutions in the first case is equal to the distance between the third and fourth solutions in the second case. Similarly, the distance between the first and third solutions in the first case is equal to the distance between the second and fourth solutions in the second case. 

Therefore, the distances between the four solutions are indeed $\frac{m}{100}$.

So we need to find the values of $m$ such that the four solutions are distinct. 

By analyzing the solutions, we find that this happens when $0 < \frac{m}{100} < 4$, or equivalently, $0 < m < 400$. 

The number of positive integers $m$ in this range is $399$.

Therefore, there are 399 positive integers $m$ for which the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has 4 distinct solutions. The answer is: $399$

Approach:


We start by considering the possible values of $m$ that will give us 4 distinct solutions.
The right-hand side of the equation is $\frac{m}{100}$, which is a fraction between 0 and 1.
The left-hand side of the equation, $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert$, is a piecewise function with four pieces.
We need to find the values of $m$ for which the equation has 4 distinct solutions.

Solution:
To find the number of distinct solutions, we need to consider the number of times the right-hand side intersects each piece of the left-hand side.
The left-hand side has 4 pieces:
1. $\vert x-1 \vert -2$ for $x \geq 1$.
2. $-\vert x-1 \vert -2$ for $x < 1$.
3. $\vert x-1 \vert +2$ for $x \geq 1$.
4. $-\vert x-1 \vert +2$ for $x < 1$.

For the right-hand side to intersect each piece 1 time, we need the value of $\frac{m}{100}$ to be between 1 and 2.
This means $1 \leq \frac{m}{100} < 2$, or $100 \leq m < 200$.
The positive integers $m$ that satisfy this inequality are the integers from 100 to 199, inclusive.
To find the number of these integers, we subtract the smallest integer from the largest integer and add 1: $199 - 100 + 1 = 100$.
Therefore, there are 100 positive integers $m$ for which the equation has 4 distinct solutions.
The answer is: $\boxed{100}$.

Assistant:

Approach:



1. First, we need to understand that the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has four distinct solutions. This means that the expression inside the absolute value, $\vert x-1 \vert -2$, must be equal to $\frac{m}{100}$, $-\frac{m}{100}$, $\frac{m}{100} + 2$, and $-\frac{m}{100} + 2$ four times.

2. Next, we need to consider the properties of absolute value. The absolute value of a number is always nonnegative, and $|a|=b$ has two solutions: $a=b$ and $a=-b$. So, we can rewrite the equation as four separate equations:

   (a) $\vert x-1 \vert -2 = \frac{m}{100}$,
   (b) $\vert x-1 \vert -2 = -\frac{m}{100}$,
   (c) $\vert x-1 \vert -2 = \frac{m}{100} + 2$,
   (d) $\vert x-1 \vert -2 = -\frac{m}{100} + 2$.

3. Now, we can solve each of these equations separately. For each equation, we first add 2 to both sides to isolate the absolute value:

   (a') $\vert x-1 \vert = \frac{m}{100} + 2$,
   (b') $\vert x-1 \vert = 2 - \frac{m}{100}$,
   (c') $\vert x-1 \vert = \frac{m}{100} + 4$,
   (d') $\vert x-1 \vert = 4 - \frac{m}{100}$.

4. Each of these equations gives two solutions for $x$, because of the absolute value. So, we have a total of 8 solutions in total. But we are looking for the number of distinct positive integer values of $m$.

5. To find the possible values of $m$, we can consider the range of the right-hand side of each equation. For (a') and (c'), the right-hand side is at least 2 (when $m=0$), and for (b') and (d'), the right-hand side is at most 2 (when $m=100$). So, the right-hand side of each equation must be in the range $(2, 4)$. This means $\frac{m}{100}$ must be in the range $(0, 2)$, so $m$ must be in the range $(0, 200)$.

6. Now, we need to find how many positive integer values of $m$ in the range $(0, 200)$ make the four expressions on the right-hand side of (a'), (b'), (c'), and (d') distinct.

7. By considering the graphs of the four expressions, we find that there are exactly 100 positive integer values of $m$ in the range $(0, 200)$ that make the four expressions distinct.

So, there are 100 positive integers $m$ such that the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has four distinct solutions. The answer is: $\boxed{100}$.
