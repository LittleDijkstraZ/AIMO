"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"
Analyze this problem and think step by step to come to a solution with programs. After solving the problem, output the final numerical answer within \boxed{}.

Assistant:

 The equation $ab = 0$ is equivalent to $a = 0$ or $b = 0$. So the given equation is equivalent to either $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$, $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$, $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$, or $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$.

These equations are satisfied if and only if $|x + y| = 10$, $|x - y| = 10$, $|x| = 8$, or $|y| = 8$. 

The solutions to $|x + y| = 10$ are the points on the lines $x + y = 10$ and $x + y = -10$. 
The solutions to $|x - y| = 10$ are the points on the lines $x - y = 10$ and $x - y = -10$. 
The solutions to $|x| = 8$ are the points on the lines $x = 8$ and $x = -8$. 
The solutions to $|y| = 8$ are the points on the lines $y = 8$ and $y = -8$.

The intersections of these lines form a rectangle with side lengths 16 and 20. Therefore, the area of the convex polygon is $16 \times 20 = 320$.

Below is a math problem you are to solve (positive numerical answer!):
"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"

The given equation is $0$ if and only if both the factors are $0$. Thus we have two systems of equations:

1. $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ and $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$.
2. $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ and $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$.

For the first system, we have $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x \vert = 8$. This implies $-10 \le x + y \le 10$ and $-8 \le x \le 8$. Similarly, for the second system, we have $\vert x - y \vert = 10$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$. This implies $-10 \le x - y \le 10$ and $-8 \le y \le 8$.

The intersection of these two systems gives us the coordinates $(x, y)$ that satisfy both systems of equations, which is the convex polygon.

The solutions to the systems of equations are all the points in the square with vertices at $(8,8)$, $(8,-8)$, $(-8,8)$, and $(-8,-8)$. The side length of the square is $16$, so the area of the square is $16^2 = 256$.

Therefore, the area of the convex polygon is $256$.
The answer is: $256$

Below is a math problem you are to solve (positive numerical answer!):
"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"

Assistant:

 The given equation is $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$.
This equation is equal to 0 if either of the two factors is equal to 0.
If $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$, then $\vert x + y \vert = 10$.
If $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$, then $\vert x - y \vert = 10$.
If $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$, then $\vert x \vert = 8$.
If $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$, then $\vert y \vert = 8$.
The solutions to these equations are:
- $x + y = 10$ or $x + y = -10$
- $x - y = 10$ or $x - y = -10$
- $x = 8$ or $x = -8$
- $y = 8$ or $y = -8$
These equations define a square with side length 16, so the area of the square is $16^2 = 256$. The answer is: $256$

Below is a math problem you are to solve (positive numerical answer!):
"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"
Analyze this problem and think step by step to come to a solution with programs. After solving the problem, output the final numerical answer within \boxed{}.

Assistant:


The expression $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2)$ is equal to zero if and only if both of its factors are equal to zero. This means that either $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$.

For the first factor to be equal to zero, we must have $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. This implies that $x + y = \pm 10$ and $x - y = \pm 10$, which gives us four lines: $x + y = 10$, $x + y = -10$, $x - y = 10$, and $x - y = -10$. The intersection of these lines form a square with side length $20$.

For the second factor to be equal to zero, we must have $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$. This implies that $x = \pm 8$ and $y = \pm 8$, which gives us four lines: $x = 8$, $x = -8$, $y = 8$, and $y = -8$. The intersection of these lines form a square with side length $16$.

The points that satisfy the original equation are the union of the points that satisfy each of these conditions. Therefore, the convex polygon formed by these points is the union of the two squares, which is a larger square with side length $20$. The area of this square is $20^2 = 400$.

Therefore, the area of the convex polygon is 400. The answer is: $400$.

"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"

Assistant:

 The equation $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ implies that either of the two factors must be zero. This means either $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$.
For the first factor to be zero, both $\vert x + y \vert - 10 = 0$ and $\vert x - y \vert - 10 = 0$, which implies $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. This gives us a square with side length 10.
For the second factor to be zero, both $\vert x \vert - 8 = 0$ and $\vert y \vert - 8 = 0$, which implies $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$. This gives us a square with side length 8.
The area of the square with side length 10 is $10^2 = 100$, and the area of the square with side length 8 is $8^2 = 64$.
Therefore, the area of the convex polygon formed by the intersection of the two squares is the sum of their areas, which is $100 + 64 = 164$. The answer is: $164$

Assistant:

 The equation given in the problem is a product of two terms equal to zero. Therefore, either of the two terms must be zero for the entire equation to be zero. This gives us two separate conditions to consider:

1. $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$.
2. $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$.

From the first condition, we have $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. From the second condition, we have $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$. These conditions represent a square with side length 16. The area of this square is $16^2 = 256$. Therefore, the area of the convex polygon is 256 square units.
