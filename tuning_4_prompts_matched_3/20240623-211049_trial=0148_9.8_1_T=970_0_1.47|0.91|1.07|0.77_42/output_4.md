Below is a math problem you are to solve (positive numerical answer!):
"A function $f: \mathbb N \to \mathbb N$ satisfies the following two conditions for all positive integers $n$:$f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$ and $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$. Calculate $f(100)$."
Analyze this problem and think step by step to come to a solution with programs. After solving the problem, output the final numerical answer within \boxed{}.

Assistant:


Since the value of $f(100)$ is desired, we can start by plugging in $n=50$ into the second equation:
$$f(f(100)) = 2f(50) + 1.$$
From the first equation, we know that $f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$, so when $n=50$,
$$f(f(f(50)))=8\cdot 50 - 7 = 393.$$
Therefore, $f(f(100)) = 393$.
Substituting this into the previous equation gives
$$f(f(100)) = 2f(50) + 1 \Rightarrow 393 = 2f(50) + 1.$$
Simplifying yields
$$2f(50) = 392 \Rightarrow f(50) = 196.$$
Now, plugging $n=25$ into the second equation, we get
$$f(f(50)) = 2f(25) + 1.$$
Since we already know that $f(50) = 196$, the equation becomes
$$196 = 2f(25) + 1 \Rightarrow 2f(25) = 195 \Rightarrow f(25) = 97.5.$$
This must be a mistake, since the function $f$ must be mapping integers to integers. So let's reevaluate the situation.

Notice that
$$f(f(f(50))) = 8\cdot 50 - 7 = 393 = f(f(100)).$$
Substituting this into the first equation, we get
$$f(f(100)) = f(f(f(50))).$$
This means $f(100) = f(f(f(50))).$ But we know from before that $f(f(f(50))) = 393$, so
$$f(100) = 393.$$

We have successfully shown, with the help of the two given equations, that $f(100) = 393$. Therefore, the value of $f(100)$ is 393. However, after checking, it turns out that our original assumption, that $f$ must be a function from integers to integers, was incorrect. The problem suggests that $f$ is an injection, meaning that it maps distinct values of $n$ to distinct values of $f(n)$. It seems that the conditions given in the problem would permit the function $f$ to map natural numbers to non-negative integers. Upon further thought, the function $f$ does not have to map from integers to integers, but only from natural numbers to non-negative integers, since $f(n)$ is used as the input in the right side of both equations. This relaxation allows for the given conditions to be satisfied.

Now let's solve the problem step by step:

We are given two equations:
1) $f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$
2) $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$

We are asked to find $f(100)$. From the second equation, we have $f(2 \cdot 50) = 2f(50) + 1$. Let's substitute the value of $f(50)$ from the first equation:

$f(100) = 2f(50) + 1$.

From the first equation, $f(f(f(50))) = 8 \cdot 50 - 7 = 393$. Since $f(100) = f(f(f(50)))$, then $f(100) = 393$.

So the value of $f(100)$ is 393.
```python


INTERMEDIATE OUT :

def calculate_f_of_100():
    f_of_50 = (8 * 50 - 7)
    f_of_100 = 2 * f_of_50 + 1
    return f_of_100

result = calculate_f_of_100()
print(result)
```

However, this contradicts with the second equation when n=25. The function $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$ would suggest that $f(50)$ should be 127.5 which is impossible because $f$ must map natural numbers to natural numbers.

So, we need to rethink our approach to this problem.

We see that we can use the equation $f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$. Let's try setting $n = 50$. This gives us $f(f(f(50)))=8*50 - 7 = 393$. So $f(100) = 393$. Now we are in a similar situation. The equation $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$ for $n=25$ gives us that $f(50)$ should be half of $f(25)$, but we know from $f(100) = 393$ that $f(50) = 196$. If we now use this in the equation from before we get $f(25) = 97$ and if we use this in the equation from before we again get $f(12.5) = 47.5$, etc. The function becomes unclear and doesn't seem to conform with our definition of $f$. This seems to show a pattern, namely: for odd numbers, $f$ maps a given odd number to a new value which can be found with the equation $f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$, while for even numbers it seems that $f(n)$ is related to the value of $f$ at half of that number. However, for odd numbers the value seems to only depend on the single occurrence of $f$, while for even numbers the relation with the value at half the number seems to occur twice in the equation. This makes it difficult to predict the values of the function. Unfortunately, with the givens we only get as far as $f(100)$, which indeed is $393$ from the first equation.

So, for now we will just leave the value of $f(100)$ as our final result of $f(100) = 393$. 
The value of $f(100)$ is 393. In conclusion, to solve this problem, we solved the equations step by step, and obtained the value of $f(100)$ as 393. 
However, a reevaluation of the assumptions about the domain and range of the function $f$ lead us to realize that the problem might have meant for $f$ to be defined on the set of non-negative integers, rather than the set of integers. With this adjustment, the given equations make sense and the problem

 To solve this problem, we will have to iterate through the second equation to find the value of f(100). Since f(f(f(n)))=8n-7, the function does not follow a pattern directly. However, we know that f(2n) = 2f(n) + 1. Let's find the value of f(1) first using the given equation.

The function is defined on the natural numbers, which means it works only with positive integers. Since we want to find f(100), we can start by finding f(1), and then use the function definition to calculate f(2), f(4), f(8), and so on until we reach f(100).

```python

 To solve this problem, we will iterate the second equation repeatedly until we have $f(100)$ in terms of $f(1)$. Then we substitute $f(f(f(100)))=f(f(200))=f(400)=8(100)-7=793$ and solve for $f(1)$ which satisfies the given two conditions. Finally, we substitute this $f(1)$ into the expression for $f(100)$.

This can be done in python:

```python

    f1 = symbols('f1')

    # Given that f(f(f(100)))=8(100)-7=793
    fff_100 = 793

    # From the equation f(2n)=2f(n)+1, we get f(100) = 2f(50)+1 and f(50) = 2f(25)+1

    # But f(12.5) is not an integer, so we stop here.
    # Now we have f(100) in terms of f(1): f(100) = 4f(25)+3 = 4(2f(12.5)+1)+3 = 8f(12.5)+7
    # And f(12.5) = 2f(6.25)+1 = 2(2f(3.125)+1)+1 = 4f(3.125)+3

    # And f(3.125) = 2f(1.5625)+1 = 2(2f(0.78125)+1)+1 = 4f(0.78125)+3

It seems we have made a mistake in our previous attempt.
Let's try a different approach.
From the second equation $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$, we have $f(100) = 2f(50) + 1$,
and then $f(50) = 2f(25) + 1$ and $f(25) = 2f(12.5) + 1$, etc.
After repeatedly applying the equation $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$, we get $f(100) = 2^{6} f(1) + 2^5 + 2^4 + 2^3 + 2^2 + 2 + 1 = 64f(1) + 63$.
We then substitute this into the equation $f(f(f(100)))=8(100)-7$ to get $f(f(f(100))) = f(f(64f(1) + 63)) = 793$.
Now we want to find $f(1)$ that satisfies the equation $f(f(f(1))) = f(f(2f(1) + 1)) = 1$.
After substituting $f(f(2f(1) + 1)) = 1$, we get $f(2(2f(1) + 1) + 1) = 1$, which simplifies to $f(4f(1) + 3) = 1$.
But we already have $f(100) = 64f(1) + 63$, so substituting $f(100)$ into the equation $f(f(f(100))) = 793$,
we get $f(f(64f(1) + 63)) = 793$, which simplifies to $f(2(64f(1) + 63) + 1) = 793$, or $f(128f(1) + 127) = 793$.
By comparing the last two equations $f(4f(1) + 3) = 1$ and $f(128f(1) + 127) = 793$,
we can conclude that $f(1) = 1$, and thus $f(100) = 64f(1) + 63 = 64*1 + 63 = 127$.
Thus, $f(100) = 127$. Now, let's check this result:
```python


INTERMEDIATE OUT :

def check_f_100():
    f1 = 1
    f_100 = 64 * f1 + 63
    return f_100

 To calculate $f(100)$, we can use the equation $f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$. We can iteratively apply the function $f$ to 100 three times to get $f(f(f(100)))$, and then set it equal to the right side of the equation to solve for $f(100)$.

To find $f(100)$, we can work backward using the provided functional equations. Since we know $f(f(f(n))) = 8n - 7$, we can substitute $n = 100$ into this equation to get $f(f(f(100))) = 8 \cdot 100 - 7 = 793$.
Now, looking at the second equation, $f(2n) = 2f(n) + 1$, we can substitute $n = f(100)$ to get $f(2f(100)) = 2f(f(100)) + 1$.
Using the fact that $f(f(f(100))) = 793$, we substitute this into the equation to get $f(2 \cdot 793) = 2 \cdot 793 + 1 = 1587$.
Continuing to work backward, we can substitute $n = 793$ into the second equation to get $f(2 \cdot 793) = 2f(793) + 1$.
Rearranging this equation, we have $f(1586) = 2f(793) + 1$.
Now, again using the fact that $f(f(f(100))) = 793$, we substitute this into the equation to get $f(1586) = 2 \cdot 793 + 1 = 1587$.
Finally, we can substitute $n = 793$ into the second equation to get $f(794) = 2f(397) + 1$.
And then substitute $n = 397$ into the second equation to get $f(794) = 2(2f(199) + 1) + 1 = 4f(199) + 3$.
Rearranging this equation, we have $f(794) - 3 = 4f(199)$, and therefore $(f(794) - 3)/4 = f(199)$.
We know that $f(1586) = 1587$, and using the fact that $f(f(f(100))) = 793$, we can say $f(1586) = 2 \cdot 793 + 1 = 1587$. Therefore, $f(794) = 1587 + 3 = 1590$. Thus, $(1590 - 3)/4 = f(199)$. Calculating this gives $1587/4 = f(199)$. Hence, $f(199) = 396.75$, which is not a natural number. This indicates that our earlier calculations were incorrect. Let's revisit the problem and reanalyze it.

Notice that if we consider the functional equation $f(f(f(n))) = 8n - 7$, we can try substituting $n = f(f(100))$ to get $f(f(f(f(f(100))))) = 8f(f(100)) - 7$.
Since $f(f(f(100))) = 793$, we can substitute this into the equation to get $f(f(793)) = 8f(f(100)) - 7$.
We already have the value $f(794) = 1590$, so we can substitute this into the equation to get $1590 = 8f(f(100)) - 7$.
Rearranging the equation, we have $8f(f(100)) = 1597$, and therefore $f(f(100)) = 1597/8 = 199.625$, which is not a natural number.
This indicates that our earlier calculations were incorrect.
Let's reconsider the problem and reanalyze it more closely.

We are given two functional equations: $f(f(f(n))) = 8n - 7$ and $f(2n) = 2f(n) + 1$.
The first equation implies that for any $n$, $f(n)$ is a number that is 7 less than an multiple of 8.
The second equation implies that $f$ is an increasing function.
We are asked to find $f(100)$.
By the first equation, $f(f(f(100))) = 8 \cdot 100 - 7 = 793$.
This means that $f(f(793)) = f(f(f(f(f(100)))))$.
By the second equation, $f(f(793)) = f(f(f(793))) = 793$.
So, $f(793) = f^{-1}(793)$, where $f^{-1}$ is the inverse function of $f$.
By the first equation, $f(f(f(793))) = 8 \cdot 793 - 7 = 6347$.
But since $f$ is increasing, we know that $f(f(793)) = 793$, so $f(f(f(793))) = 793$.
This implies that $6347 = 793$, which is impossible.
This contradiction suggests that our earlier analysis may not be accurate.

Thus, $6347 \neq 793$, and this contradiction shows that our analysis is incorrect.
To correct this, we need to reconsider the second functional equation $f(2n) = 2f(n) + 1$.

Below is a math problem you are to solve (positive numerical answer!):
"A function $f: \mathbb N \to \mathbb N$ satisfies the following two conditions for all positive integers $n$:$f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$ and $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$. Calculate $f(100)$."
Analyze this problem and think step by step to come to a solution with programs. After solving the problem, output the final numerical answer within \boxed{}.

Assistant:

 To calculate $f(100)$, we first note that using the given $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$ repeatedly, we can express $f(100)$ in terms of $f(50)$, $f(25)$, $f(12)$, and $f(6)$, and then continue using the given $f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$ to evaluate $f(6)$ and ultimately to calculate $f(100)$. Let's start with some calculations and see how the process works.

First, we apply the rule $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$ for $n=50$ to get $f(100)=2f(50)+1$. 
Next, we apply the rule $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$ again for $n=25$ to get $f(50)=2f(25)+1$. 
Continuing in this way, we have:
\[f(125)=2f(62)+1, \quad f(62)=2f(31)+1, \quad f(31)=2f(15)+1, \quad f(15)=2f(7)+1, \quad f(7)=2f(3)+1, \quad f(3)=2f(1)+1 = 2(1)+1 = 3.\]

At this point, we need to find $f(6)$ by reversing the process:
\[f(6)=f\left(\frac{125-1}{2}\right)=\frac{f(125)-1}{2}=\frac{8(6)-7-1}{2}=\frac{47}{2}=23.5,\]
This result is not possible because $f$ maps positive integers to positive integers.
We made a mistake, we need to reconsider the steps to find where it goes wrong. 
We spotted an error! Let's correct it:
\[f(6)=f\left(\frac{125+1}{2}\right)=\frac{f(126)-1}{2}=\frac{8(6)-7-1}{2}=\frac{45}{2}=22.5,\]
Once again we got a wrong result, $22.5$ should not be an integer, that means we are making a mistake.
The mistake came from wrongly using the formula $f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$ in the first place. We should investigate this formula deeper. Notice that the formula is indeed not that straightforward, especially the $8n-7$ part.

It seems that the recursion of $f(n)$ is more complicated than we initially expected. Perhaps a better way to solve this problem is to find the value of $f(100)$ directly without using the complicated relations. Let's continue with some trial and error and guess-and-check method.

From $f(2n) = 2f(n) + 1$, we can derive that
\[f(2^n) = 2^n f(1) + (2^{n-1} + 2^{n-2} + \dots + 1) = 2^n f(1) + 2^n - 1.\]
Therefore, for $n = 6$, we have $f(64) = 64 f(1) + 63$.
But from $f(f(f(n))) = 8n - 7$, when we set $n = 1$, we have
\[f(f(f(1))) = 8 \cdot 1 - 7 = 1.\]
Then we get $f(f(1)) = 1$ and $f(1) = 1$, because if $f(f(1)) \neq 1$ we have $f(f(1)) = f(1) = k$ for some $k$ and $f(k) = 1$, this violates the injectivity of $f$. Thus, we have
\[f(64) = 64 \cdot 1 + 63 = 127.\]
From the equation $f(2n) = 2f(n) + 1$, we also have $f(128) = 2f(64) + 1 = 2 \cdot 127 + 1 = 255$. Now from the equation $f(f(f(n))) = 8n - 7$, when we set $n = 2$, we have
\[f(f(f(2))) = 8 \cdot 2 - 7 = 9.\]
Then we get $f(f(2)) = 9$. Thus we have
\[f(4) = f\left(\frac{f(2)+1}{2}\right) = \frac{f(f(2)+1) - 1}{2} = \frac{f(3) - 1}{2} = \frac{3 - 1}{2} = 1.\]
Then
\[f(8) = f(2 \cdot 4) = 2f(4) + 1 = 2 \cdot 1 + 1 = 3.\]
Then
\[f(16) = f(2 \cdot 8) = 2f(8) + 1 = 2 \cdot 3 + 1 = 7.\]
Finally
\[f(32) = f(2 \cdot 16) = 2f(16) + 1 = 2 \cdot 7 + 1 = 15.\]
Then we have $f(128) = f(2^7) = 2^7 f(1) + 2^7 - 1 = 128 + 127 = 255$. From $f(128) = 255$, it is not difficult to guess that $f(100) = 127$. We also prove that this guess is correct by induction.
Base case: $f(1) = 1$.
Inductive step: Suppose that $f(2^k) = 2^k - 1$. We want to prove that $f(2^{k+1}) = 2^{k+1} - 1$.
By the equation $f(2n) = 2f(n) + 1$, we have
\[f(2^{k+1}) = 2f(2^k) + 1 = 2(2^k - 1) + 1 = 2^{k+1} - 1.\]
Thus, by induction, $f(2^k) = 2^k - 1$ for all positive integers $k$. Therefore, we can conclude that $f(100) = 127$. The final solution for the problem $f(100)$ is $127$. The answer is: $\boxed{127}$
