Assistant:


The equation $AB=0$ is equivalent to $A=0$ or $B=0$. Therefore, the given equation is equivalent to either $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$.
The solutions to these equations are:
1. $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ gives $x + y = 10$ or $x + y = -10$.
2. $\vert x - y \vert = 10$ gives $x - y = 10$ or $x - y = -10$.
3. $\vert x \vert = 8$ gives $x = 8$ or $x = -8$.
4. $\vert y \vert = 8$ gives $y = 8$ or $y = -8$.

These lines form a rectangle with side lengths 16 and 20. The area of this rectangle is $16 \times 20 = 320$.
The answer is: $320$

The given equation is satisfied if and only if at least one of the factors is zero.
The factors are $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2$ and $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2$, and $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2$ and $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2$.
Each of these factors being zero means that $\vert x + y \vert = 10$, $\vert x - y \vert = 10$, $\vert x \vert = 8$, and $\vert y \vert = 8$.
These conditions describe a square with side length 16, centered at the origin.
The area of this square is $16^2 = 256$.
Therefore, the area of the convex polygon is 256.
The answer is: $256$

"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"

The equation $AB = 0$ is satisfied if and only if $A = 0$ or $B = 0$. Therefore, the given equation is equivalent to the system of equations:
\[(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0,\]
\[(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0.\]
For the first equation to be satisfied, we must have $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. This implies that $x + y = \pm 10$ and $x - y = \pm 10$. Solving these equations, we find that the points satisfying the first equation are $(5,5)$, $(5,-5)$, $(-5,5)$, and $(-5,-5)$.
For the second equation to be satisfied, we must have $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$. This implies that $x = \pm 8$ and $y = \pm 8$. Solving these equations, we find that the points satisfying the second equation are $(8,8)$, $(8,-8)$, $(-8,8)$, and $(-8,-8)$.
The points that satisfy both equations are $(5,5)$, $(5,-5)$, $(-5,5)$, $(-5,-5)$, $(8,8)$, $(8,-8)$, $(-8,8)$, and $(-8,-8)$. These points form a square with side length 10. The area of this square is $10^2 = 100$. Therefore, the area of the convex polygon is 100.
The answer is: $100$

Assistant:


The given equation is a product of two terms, which means that the equation equals to zero if and only if at least one of the terms equals to zero. 

We have two cases:
1. $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$. This implies $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ or $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. The solutions to these two equations form a square with side length 20, so the area of this square is $20^2 = 400$.

2. $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$. This implies $\vert x \vert = 8$ or $\vert y \vert = 8$. The solutions to these two equations form a square with side length 16, so the area of this square is $16^2 = 256$.

However, the intersection of the two cases is not empty, which means the solutions to the original equation are included in both cases. Therefore, the area of the convex polygon is the sum of the areas of the two squares, which is $400 + 256 = 656$.

So, the area of the convex polygon is 656 square units. The answer is: $656$

"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"
Analyze this problem and think step by step to come to a solution with programs. After solving the problem, output the final numerical answer within \boxed{}.

Assistant:

 To solve this problem, we need to understand the properties of absolute values and how they affect the given expressions. The equation $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ is equal to zero if any of the terms inside the parentheses is zero. This gives us the following equations:

1. $\vert x + y \vert - 10 = 0 \implies \vert x + y \vert = 10$
2. $\vert x - y \vert - 10 = 0 \implies \vert x - y \vert = 10$
3. $\vert x \vert - 8 = 0 \implies \vert x \vert = 8$
4. $\vert y \vert - 8 = 0 \implies \vert y \vert = 8$

From these equations, we can deduce the following:

1. $x + y = \pm 10$
2. $x - y = \pm 10$
3. $x = \pm 8$
4. $y = \pm 8$

Now, we can find the intersections of these lines to determine the vertices of the polygon:

1. Intersection of $x + y = 10$ and $x - y = 10$: $x = 10, y = 0$
2. Intersection of $x + y = 10$ and $x - y = -10$: $x = 0, y = 10$
3. Intersection of $x + y = -10$ and $x - y = 10$: $x = 0, y = -10$
4. Intersection of $x + y = -10$ and $x - y = -10$: $x = -10, y = 0$
5. Intersection of $x = 8$ and $y = 8$: $x = 8, y = 8$
6. Intersection of $x = 8$ and $y = -8$: $x = 8, y = -8$
7. Intersection of $x = -8$ and $y = 8$: $x = -8, y = 8$
8. Intersection of $x = -8$ and $y = -8$: $x = -8, y = -8$

These eight points are the vertices of the polygon. By plotting these points on a coordinate plane and connecting them, we can see that the polygon is a square with side length 20. The area of a square is given by the square of the side length, so the area of this square is $20^2 = 400$. Therefore, the area of the convex polygon is 400. The answer is: $400$

 The given equation is $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$.
This equation is satisfied if either $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$.
This means that the points that satisfy the equation are those where either $\vert x + y \vert = 10$, $\vert x - y \vert = 10$, $\vert x \vert = 8$, or $\vert y \vert = 8$.
These conditions represent the sides of the square, which has side length 16.
Therefore, the area of the convex polygon is $16^2 = 256$.

"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"
Analyze this problem and think step by step to come to a solution with programs. After solving the problem, output the final numerical answer within \boxed{}.

Assistant:

 To solve this problem, we first need to understand the given equation and its implications on the points $(x, y)$ in the coordinate plane. The equation is:
\[((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0.\]
The product of two numbers is zero if and only if at least one of the numbers is zero. Therefore, this equation is satisfied if either:
1. $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$, or
2. $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$.
The only way for a square of a real number to be zero is if the number itself is zero. Therefore, the above conditions are equivalent to:
1. $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ or $\vert x - y \vert = 10$, or
2. $\vert x \vert = 8$ or $\vert y \vert = 8$.
These conditions define a series of lines and circles in the coordinate plane, which enclose a convex polygon.
The area of this polygon is the sum of the areas of the squares formed by the intersections of these lines and circles.

The vertices of the polygon are the points where these lines and circles intersect. By analyzing the equations, we can find these points:
- The lines $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$ intersect at the points $(5, 5)$, $(5, -5)$, $(-5, 5)$, and $(-5, -5)$.
- The lines $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$ intersect at the points $(8, 0)$, $(-8, 0)$, $(0, 8)$, and $(0, -8)$.

The polygon is a square with side length $10$ (the diameter of the circles defined by $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$), since the lines $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$ intersect at the midpoints of the sides of the square defined by the circles.

The area of this square is $10^2 = 100$. Therefore, the area of the convex polygon is $100$.
The answer is: $100$

Assistant:

 The given equation is a product of two terms equal to zero. Therefore, either of the terms must be zero for the equation to hold. This gives us two separate conditions:

1. $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$
2. $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$

For the first condition to be true, it must be the case that $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. This implies that $x = \pm 10$ and $y = \pm 10$.

For the second condition to be true, it must be the case that $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$. This implies that $x = \pm 8$ and $y = \pm 8$.

The points that satisfy these conditions are the vertices of a square with side length 20. The area of this square is $20^2 = 400$. The answer is: $400$

"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"
Analyze this problem and think step by step to come to a solution with programs. After solving the problem, output the final numerical answer within \boxed{}.

Assistant:

 The equation $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + (\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + (\vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ is satisfied only when both $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ and $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$, or when both $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ and $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$. 

This implies that the points that satisfy the equation are those for which $\vert x + y \vert = 10$, $\vert x - y \vert = 10$, $\vert x \vert = 8$, or $\vert y \vert = 8$. 

The lines $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$ form a square with side length $10\sqrt{2}$, while the lines $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$ form a square with side length $16$. 

The area of the square formed by the lines $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$ is $(10\sqrt{2})^2 = 200$. The area of the square formed by the lines $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$ is $16^2 = 256$. 

Therefore, the area of the convex polygon is the sum of the areas of these two squares, which is $200 + 256 = 456$. The answer is: $456$

Assistant:

 The equation $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ implies that $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$, which means $x + y = \pm 10$ and $x - y = \pm 10$. Solving these four equations gives us the vertices of the square: $(8, 2)$, $(8, -2)$, $(-8, -2)$, and $(-8, 2)$.

Similarly, the equation $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ implies that $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$, which means $x = \pm 8$ and $y = \pm 8$. This gives us the vertices of the square: $(8, 8)$, $(8, -8)$, $(-8, -8)$, and $(-8, 8)$.

The convex polygon formed by the intersection of these two squares is a smaller square with side length 4 and area $4^2 = 16$. So the area of the convex polygon is 16.
The answer is: 16

This problem is asking for the area of the convex polygon formed by the points $(x, y)$ that satisfy the equation
\[((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0.\]
The equation is equal to zero if either of the two factors is zero. 
The first factor is zero if $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ or $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. These are the equations of two squares with side length 10.
The second factor is zero if $\vert x \vert = 8$ or $\vert y \vert = 8$, which are the equations of two squares with side length 16.
The intersection of these squares forms a convex polygon, and the area of this polygon is the sum of the areas of the two smaller squares minus the area of the larger squares.
The area of a square with side length $a$ is $a^2$, so the area of the smaller squares is $8^2 = 64$ each, and the area of the larger squares is $10^2 = 100$ each.
Therefore, the area of the convex polygon is $2(64) - 2(100) = 128 - 200 = -72$. However, the area cannot be negative, so we must have made a mistake. 
Upon further inspection, we realize that we should have used absolute values in our calculations. The correct equations are:
$\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$ give squares with side length 10,
$\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$ give squares with side length 16.

The given equation is a product of two terms equal to zero, so either the first term or the second term must be zero.
The first term is $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)$, and the second term is $((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2)$.
For the first term to be zero, we need both $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$.
For the second term to be zero, we need both $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$.
The first set of conditions $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$ defines a square with side length 10.
The second set of conditions $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$ also defines a square with side length 16.
The intersection of these two squares is the convex polygon we are looking for.
The side length of the smaller square is 10, and the side length of the larger square is 16, so the area of the convex polygon is the area of the smaller square, which is $10^2 = 100$.

So the area of the convex polygon is $\boxed{100}$.
The answer is: $100$

 To find the area of the convex polygon, we need to analyze the given equation and determine the vertices of the polygon.

First, we notice that the product of two numbers is zero if and only if at least one of the numbers is zero. Therefore, we have two cases to consider:
1. $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$.
2. $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$.

For the first case, we have $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. This implies that $x + y = \pm 10$ and $x - y = \pm 10$. Solving these equations gives us the vertices of the polygon: $(0, 10), (0, -10), (10, 0), (-10, 0)$.

For the second case, we have $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$. This implies that $x = \pm 8$ and $y = \pm 8$. Adding these vertices to our previous set, we now have the complete set of vertices: $(0, 10), (0, -10), (10, 0), (-10, 0), (8, 8), (8, -8), (-8, 8), (-8, -8)$.

Now, we can draw the polygon and find its area. The polygon is a square with side length 10, so its area is $10^2 = 100$.

Therefore, the area of the convex polygon is 100. The answer is: $100$
