Question (hint: positive numerical answer):
"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"
Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:


The expression $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ is true if and only if at least one of the factors is zero.
For the first factor to be zero, either $\vert x + y \vert - 10 = 0$ or $\vert x - y \vert - 10 = 0$.
This means $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ or $\vert x - y \vert = 10$.
Similarly, for the second factor to be zero, either $\vert x \vert - 8 = 0$ or $\vert y \vert - 8 = 0$.
This means $\vert x \vert = 8$ or $\vert y \vert = 8$.
The solutions to these equations are the vertices of a square with side length 10, centered at the origin.
The area of this square is $10^2 = 100$.
Therefore, the area of the convex polygon is 100. The answer is: $100$

Question (hint: positive numerical answer):
"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"
Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:


The expression $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2)$ is equal to zero if and only if at least one of the factors is zero.
The factor $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2$ is zero if and only if $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$.
These equations represent a square with side length 10 and diagonals of length $10\sqrt{2}$.
The factor $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2$ is zero if and only if $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$.
These equations represent a square with side length 8 and diagonals of length $8\sqrt{2}$.
The intersection of these two squares is a square with side length 6 and diagonals of length $6\sqrt{2}$.
The area of this square is $\left(\frac{6\sqrt{2}}{2}\right)^2 = 18$.
Therefore, the area of the convex polygon is 18.
The answer is: $18$

Question (hint: positive numerical answer):
"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"
Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:


The product of two numbers is zero if and only if at least one of the numbers is zero. Therefore, we have two cases to consider:
Case 1: $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$. This implies that $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. The solutions to these equations are all points of the form $(x, y) = (10, 0)$ or $(x, y) = (-10, 0)$ or $(x, y) = (0, 10)$ or $(x, y) = (0, -10)$ or $(x, y) = (10, 10)$ or $(x, y) = (-10, -10)$ or $(x, y) = (10, -10)$ or $(x, y) = (-10, 10)$.
Case 2: $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$. This implies that $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$. The solutions to these equations are all points of the form $(x, y) = (8, 0)$ or $(x, y) = (-8, 0)$ or $(x, y) = (0, 8)$ or $(x, y) = (0, -8)$.
The intersection of the solutions from both cases gives us the vertices of the convex polygon, which are $(8, 0)$, $(-8, 0)$, $(0, 8)$, $(0, -8)$, $(10, 0)$, $(-10, 0)$, $(10, 10)$, $(-10, -10)$, $(10, -10)$, and $(-10, 10)$.
Plotting these points, we can see that the convex polygon is a square with side length 16. The area of this square is $16^2 = 256$.
Therefore, the area of the convex polygon is 256. The answer is: $256$

"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"
Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:


The expression $A \cdot B = 0$ implies that either $A = 0$ or $B = 0$. Thus, we have two cases to consider:

Case 1: $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$. This implies that $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. The only way this can happen is if $x = 0$ and $y = 0$.

Case 2: $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$. This implies that $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$. The only way this can happen is if $-8 \leq x \leq 8$ and $-8 \leq y \leq 8$.

Therefore, the points that satisfy the equation are all the points in the square with vertices at $(\pm 8, \pm 8)$. The area of this square is $8^2 \cdot 4 = 256$. The answer is: $256$

Question (hint: positive numerical answer):
"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"
Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:


The product of two numbers is zero if and only if at least one of the numbers is zero. Therefore, we have two cases to consider:

Case 1: $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$.
This means $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ or $\vert x - y \vert = 10$.

Case 2: $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$.
This means $\vert x \vert = 8$ or $\vert y \vert = 8$.

Now, let's analyze each case:

For Case 1:
$\vert x + y \vert = 10$ means $x + y = 10$ or $x + y = -10$.
$\vert x - y \vert = 10$ means $x - y = 10$ or $x - y = -10$.
This gives us a total of 4 lines: $x + y = 10$, $x + y = -10$, $x - y = 10$, and $x - y = -10$.

For Case 2:
$\vert x \vert = 8$ means $x = 8$ or $x = -8$.
$\vert y \vert = 8$ means $y = 8$ or $y = -8$.
This gives us a total of 4 lines: $x = 8$, $x = -8$, $y = 8$, and $y = -8$.

The intersection of these lines forms a square with side length 10 (from the equations $x + y = 10$ and $x - y = 10$). The area of this square is $10^2 = 100$. So, the area of the convex polygon is 100 square units.
The answer is: $100$

Question (hint: positive numerical answer):
"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"
Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:



The expression $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2)$ is equal to zero if and only if at least one of the factors is equal to zero.

The first factor, $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)$, is equal to zero if and only if both $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. These equations represent two squares of side length 10, one with its center at the origin and the other with its center at the point $(10,0)$.

The second factor, $((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2)$, is equal to zero if and only if both $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$. These equations represent two squares of side length 16, one with its center at the origin and the other with its center at the point $(8,0)$.

The intersection of these two squares forms a convex polygon, which is a square with side length 10. The area of this square is $10^2 = 100$.

So, the area of the convex polygon is 100 square units. The answer is: $100$

Question (hint: positive numerical answer):
"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"
Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:



For the product of two factors to be zero, one or both of the factors must be zero. Therefore, either $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$, $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$, $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$, or $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$.
If $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$, then $\vert x + y \vert = 10$, which implies $x + y = 10$ or $x + y = -10$.
If $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$, then $\vert x - y \vert = 10$, which implies $x - y = 10$ or $x - y = -10$.
If $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$, then $\vert x \vert = 8$, which implies $x = 8$ or $x = -8$.
If $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$, then $\vert y \vert = 8$, which implies $y = 8$ or $y = -8$.
Combining these conditions, we find that the points $(x, y)$ that satisfy the equation are: $(8, 2)$, $(8, -2)$, $(-8, 2)$, $(-8, -2)$, $(2, 8)$, $(-2, 8)$, $(2, -8)$, and $(-2, -8)$.
These points form a square with side length 16. The area of this square is $16^2 = 256$. The answer is: $256$

"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"
Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:


The expression $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2)$ is equal to zero if and only if either of the two factors is zero.

The first factor is zero if and only if $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ or $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. These are the equations of two concentric circles with radii 10 in the coordinate plane.

The second factor is zero if and only if $\vert x \vert = 8$ or $\vert y \vert = 8$. These are the equations of two perpendicular lines that intersect the x-axis and y-axis at $\pm 8$.

The intersection of these lines and circles gives the vertices of the polygon. The polygon is a square with side length 16. The area of the square is $16^2 = 256$. The answer is: $256$
