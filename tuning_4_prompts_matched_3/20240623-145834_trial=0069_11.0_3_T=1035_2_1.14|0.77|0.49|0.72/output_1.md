Question (hint: positive numerical answer):
"What is the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ when $x$ and $y$ range over all real numbers such that $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$?"
Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:


To solve this problem, we need to use the inequality $|a| + |b| \geq |a + b|$. This inequality holds for all real numbers $a$ and $b$.

Applying this inequality to the given equation $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$, we have:
\[|x-2y| + |-2x+y| \geq |(x-2y) + (-2x+y)| = |-x-y|.\]
So, we get:
\[|-x-y| = 40.\]

Now, let's consider the expression $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$. We can rewrite it as:
\[5(x^2+y^2) - 8xy = 5[(x-y)^2 + 2xy] - 8xy = 5(x-y)^2 + 3xy.\]

We want to minimize this expression. Notice that $(x-y)^2 \geq 0$, so $5(x-y)^2 \geq 0$. Therefore, the minimum value of the expression is achieved when $xy$ is minimized.

From the equation $|-x-y| = 40$, we know that $x+y = \pm 40$. We can square both sides to get:
\[(x+y)^2 = 1600 \implies x^2 + 2xy + y^2 = 1600.\]
Substituting $x^2 + y^2 = \frac{1600 - 2xy}{1}$ into the expression $5(x^2+y^2) - 8xy$, we get:
\[5\left(\frac{1600 - 2xy}{1}\right) - 8xy = 8000 - 18xy.\]

Now, we want to minimize $8000 - 18xy$. Since $xy$ is minimized when $x+y = \pm 40$, we can substitute $x+y = 40$ into the equation $x^2 + 2xy + y^2 = 1600$ to get:
\[(40)^2 - 2xy = 1600 \implies 2xy = 1600 - 1600 = 0.\]
So, $xy = 0$ when $x+y = 40$. Similarly, we can show that $xy = 0$ when $x+y = -40$.

Therefore, the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ is achieved when $xy = 0$, and the minimum value is $8000 - 18(0) = 8000$.
The answer is: $\boxed{8000}$.

Question (hint: positive numerical answer):
"What is the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ when $x$ and $y$ range over all real numbers such that $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$?"
Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:


First, let's rewrite the given equation $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$ as $|2y-x| + |2x-y| = 40$.
Using the property $|a-b| = |b-a|$, we can simplify this to $|2y-x| + |x-2y| = 40$.
This equation represents the sum of the absolute values of two expressions, and it equals to 40.
The only way this equation can hold true is when each absolute value equals to 20, so $|2y-x| = 20$ and $|x-2y| = 20$.
Now, let's solve the system of equations:
\[
\begin{cases}
2y - x = 20 \\
x - 2y = 20
\end{cases}
\]
or
\[
\begin{cases}
2y - x = -20 \\
x - 2y = -20
\end{cases}
\]
Solving the first system, we get $x = 0$ and $y = 10$.
Solving the second system, we get $x = -20$ and $y = 0$.
Now, let's substitute these values into the expression $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$:
For $(x, y) = (0, 10)$, we have $5(0)^2+5(10)^2-8(0)(10) = 500$.
For $(x, y) = (-20, 0)$, we have $5(-20)^2+5(0)^2-8(-20)(0) = 2000$.
Therefore, the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ is 500. The answer is: $500$

Question (hint: positive numerical answer):
"What is the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ when $x$ and $y$ range over all real numbers such that $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$?"
Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:


First, we notice that the given equation $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$ can be rewritten as $|2y-x| + |2x-y| = 40$.
By the triangle inequality, $|a| + |b| \geq |a+b|$, so $|2y-x| + |2x-y| \geq |(2y-x) + (2x-y)| = |y| = |2y/2|$.
Therefore, we have $|2y-x| + |2x-y| \geq |y|$.
But we know that $|2y-x| + |2x-y| = 40$, so $|y| = 40/2 = 20$.
This means that $y = \pm 20$.

Now, we substitute $y = 20$ into the given expression $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$:
$5x^2 + 5(20)^2 - 8x(20) = 5x^2 + 2000 - 160x$.
To find the minimum value of this expression, we can take the derivative with respect to $x$ and set it equal to zero:
$\frac{d}{dx}(5x^2 - 160x + 2000) = 10x - 160 = 0$.
Solving for $x$, we find $x = \frac{160}{10} = 16$.

Similarly, we substitute $y = -20$ into the given expression:
$5x^2 + 5(-20)^2 - 8x(-20) = 5x^2 + 2000 + 160x$.
Taking the derivative with respect to $x$ and setting it equal to zero:
$\frac{d}{dx}(5x^2 + 160x + 2000) = 10x + 160 = 0$.
Solving for $x$, we find $x = \frac{-160}{10} = -16$.

Now, we substitute $x = 16$ and $y = 20$ into the given expression:
$5(16)^2 + 5(20)^2 - 8(16)(20) = 1280 + 2000 - 2560 = 720$.
And we substitute $x = -16$ and $y = -20$ into the given expression:
$5(-16)^2 + 5(-20)^2 - 8(-16)(-20) = 1280 + 2000 - 2560 = 720$.

Therefore, the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ is 720.
The answer is: $720$

Question (hint: positive numerical answer):
"What is the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ when $x$ and $y$ range over all real numbers such that $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$?"
Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:



First, let's simplify the expression $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$. This can be written as $5(x^2+y^2)-8xy$. We can complete the square for the $x$ and $y$ terms:
\[5(x^2-2xy+y^2) = 5[(x-y)^2].\]
So the expression simplifies to $5(x-y)^2$.

Now, let's look at the constraint $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$. We can rewrite this as $|x-2y| + |2y-x| = 40$. The absolute value function $|a|$ is equal to $|a| = a$ if $a \ge 0$ and $|a| = -a$ if $a < 0$. So we can split the absolute value functions into two cases:

Case 1: If $(x-2y)(2y-x) \ge 0$, then $|x-2y| = (x-2y)$ and $|2y-x| = (2y-x)$. So the constraint becomes:
\[(x-2y) + (2y-x) = 40 \implies 0 = 40,\]
which is a contradiction. So this case is not possible.

Case 2: If $(x-2y)(2y-x) < 0$, then $|x-2y| = -(x-2y)$ and $|2y-x| = -(2y-x)$. So the constraint becomes:
\[-(x-2y) - (2y-x) = 40 \implies -4y = 40 \implies y = -10.\]
Substituting $y = -10$ into the constraint gives $|x+20| + |-20-x| = 40$. This simplifies to $|x+20| + |x+20| = 40 \implies 2|x+20| = 40 \implies |x+20| = 20$. This gives two possibilities: $x+20 = 20$ or $x+20 = -20$. Solving these gives $x = 0$ or $x = -40$.

Now we substitute the possible values of $x$ and $y$ into the expression $5(x-y)^2$:

If $x = 0$ and $y = -10$, then $5(x-y)^2 = 5(0 - (-10))^2 = 500$.
If $x = -40$ and $y = -10$, then $5(x-y)^2 = 5(-40 - (-10))^2 = 5(-30)^2 = 4500$.

So the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ is 500 when $x = 0$ and $y = -10$. The answer is: $\boxed{500}$

Question (hint: positive numerical answer):
"What is the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ when $x$ and $y$ range over all real numbers such that $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$?"
Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:


We first observe that $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$ can be rewritten as $|2y-x| + |2x-y| = 40$.
By the triangle inequality, $|a| + |b| \geq |a+b|$, so we have $|2y-x| + |2x-y| \geq |(2y-x) + (2x-y)| = |y| = |2y/2| \geq 2|y|/2 = |y|$.
Therefore, $|y| \leq 40$.
Similarly, $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$ implies $|x| \leq 40$.
Now, we can consider the expression $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$.
By completing the square, we have $5x^2-8xy+5y^2 = (5x^2-8xy+4y^2) + y^2 = (5x-4y)^2 + y^2$.
Since $(5x-4y)^2 \geq 0$ and $y^2 \geq 0$, we have $(5x-4y)^2 + y^2 \geq 0$.
Therefore, the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ is 0, which occurs when $5x-4y = 0$ and $y = 0$.
Substituting $y = 0$ into $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$, we get $|x| = 40$, which is not possible since $|x| \leq 40$.
Therefore, we need to consider the case when $x = 2y$.
Substituting $x = 2y$ into $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$, we get $|0| + |y-4y| = 40$, which simplifies to $|3y| = 40$.
So, $|y| = \frac{40}{3}$, which is also not possible since $|y| \leq 40$.
However, if we substitute $x = 2y$ into $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$, we get $5(2y)^2+5y^2-8(2y)y = 20y^2+5y^2-16y^2 = 9y^2$.
Since $y^2 \geq 0$, we have $9y^2 \geq 0$.
Therefore, the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ when $x$ and $y$ satisfy $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$ is 0.
However, we need to check if this minimum value is achievable.
Substituting $x = 2y$ into $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$, we get $|0| + |-3y| = 40$, which simplifies to $3|y| = 40$.
So, $|y| = \frac{40}{3}$, which is possible since $|y| \leq 40$.
Therefore, the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ when $x$ and $y$ satisfy $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$ is indeed 0, and it is achievable when $x = \frac{80}{3}$ and $y = \frac{40}{3}$.
The answer is: $0$

Question (hint: positive numerical answer):
"What is the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ when $x$ and $y$ range over all real numbers such that $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$?"
Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:


We start by noting that $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$ can be rewritten as $|2y-x| + |2x-y| = 40$.
Using the triangle inequality, we know that $|a| + |b| \geq |a+b|$, so we have $|2y-x| + |2x-y| \geq |(2y-x) + (2x-y)| = |y| = 40$.
Thus, $|y| = 20$.
Substituting this back into the equation $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$, we get $|x-40| + |40-2x| = 40$.
By considering the cases $x \geq 40$ and $x < 40$, we can solve for $x$.
If $x \geq 40$, then $|x-40| = x-40$ and $|40-2x| = 40-2x$.
So we have $x-40 + 40-2x = 40$, which simplifies to $-x = 40$.
However, this is not possible since $x$ cannot be negative.
If $x < 40$, then $|x-40| = 40-x$ and $|40-2x| = 2x-40$.
So we have $40-x + 2x-40 = 40$, which simplifies to $x = 40$.
However, this also does not satisfy the inequality $|x-40| + |40-2x| \geq |y| = 20$.
Therefore, we must have $|y| = 20$.
Now, we can substitute $y = \pm 20$ into the expression $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ to find the minimum value.
If $y = 20$, then $5x^2+5(20)^2-8x(20) = 5x^2+2000-160x$.
If $y = -20$, then $5x^2+5(-20)^2-8x(-20) = 5x^2+2000+160x$.
To find the minimum value, we can take the derivative of each expression with respect to $x$ and set it equal to zero.
For $y = 20$, the derivative is $10x-160$, so setting it equal to zero gives $x = 16$.
Substituting $x = 16$ and $y = 20$ into the expression $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$, we get $5(16)^2+5(20)^2-8(16)(20) = 1280$.
For $y = -20$, the derivative is $10x+160$, so setting it equal to zero gives $x = -16$.
Substituting $x = -16$ and $y = -20$ into the expression $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$, we also get $1280$.
Therefore, the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ is $1280$.
The answer is: $1280$

"What is the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ when $x$ and $y$ range over all real numbers such that $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$?"
Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:


First, let's simplify the given equation $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$.
We know that $|a-b| = |b-a|$, so we can rewrite the equation as $|x-2y| + |2y-x| = 40$.
Now, we can use the property $|a| + |b| = |a+b|$ when $a$ and $b$ have the same sign.
So, we have $|x-2y + 2y-x| = 40$, which simplifies to $|0| = 40$.
This is a contradiction, so we must have made a mistake in our simplification.
Let's go back and check our work.
We know that $|a-b| = |b-a|$, so $|x-2y| = |2y-x|$.
This means that $|x-2y| = |-1*(2y-x)| = |2x-y|$.
So, the equation $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$ simplifies to $|x-2y| + |2x-y| = 40$.
Now, we can use the property $|a| + |b| = |a+b|$ when $a$ and $b$ have the same sign.
So, we have $|x-2y + 2x-y| = 40$, which simplifies to $|3x-3y| = 40$.
Dividing both sides by 3, we get $|x-y| = \frac{40}{3}$.
Now, let's go back to the expression we want to minimize, $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$.
We can rewrite this as $5(x^2+y^2)-8xy = 5[(x-y)^2 + 2xy] - 8xy$.
Using the equation $|x-y| = \frac{40}{3}$, we can substitute in the value of $xy$:
$xy = \frac{(x-y)^2}{2} - \frac{40^2}{18}$.
Substituting this into the expression we want to minimize:
$5[(x-y)^2 + 2\left(\frac{(x-y)^2}{2} - \frac{40^2}{18}\right)] - 8\left(\frac{(x-y)^2}{2} - \frac{40^2}{18}\right)$.
Simplifying, we get $5(x-y)^2 + 5\left(\frac{40^2}{18}\right) - 4(x-y)^2 + \frac{3200}{9}$.
Combining like terms, we get $(x-y)^2 + \frac{200^2}{9}$.
Since $(x-y)^2$ is always non-negative, the minimum value of this expression is when $(x-y)^2 = 0$, which means $x=y$.
Substituting $x=y$ into the equation $|x-y| = \frac{40}{3}$, we get $0 = \frac{40}{3}$, which is a contradiction.
So, we must have made a mistake in our work.
Let's go back and reevaluate our steps.
We know that $|a-b| = |b-a|$, so $|x-2y| = |2y-x|$.
This means that $|x-2y| = |-1*(2y-x)| = |2x-y|$.
So, the equation $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$ simplifies to $|x-2y| + |2x-y| = 40$.
Now, we can use the property $|a| + |b| = |a+b|$ when $a$ and $b$ have the same sign.
So, we have $|x-2y + 2x-y| = 40$, which simplifies to $|3x-3y| = 40$.
Dividing both sides by 3, we get $|x-y| = \frac{40}{3}$.
Now, let's go back to the expression we want to minimize, $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$.
We can rewrite this as $5(x^2+y^2)-8xy = 5[(x-y)^2 + 2xy] - 8xy$.
Using the equation $|x-y| = \frac{40}{3}$, we can substitute in the value of $xy$:
$xy = \frac{(x+y)^2 - (x-y)^2}{4} - \frac{40^2}{18}$.
Substituting this into the expression we want to minimize:
$5\left[\left(\frac{40}{3}\right)^2 + 2\left(\frac{(x+y)^2 - \left(\frac{40}{3}\right)^2}{4}\right)\right] - 8\left(\frac{(x+y)^2 - \left(\frac{40}{3}\right)^2}{4}\right)$.
Simplifying, we get $5\left(\frac{40^2}{9}\right) + 5\left(\frac{(x+y)^2}{2} - \frac{40^2}{9}\right) - 2\left(\frac{(x+y)^2}{2} - \frac{40^2}{9}\right)$.
Combining like terms, we get $5\left(\frac{40^2}{9}\right) + 3\left(\frac{(x+y)^2}{2} - \frac{40^2}{9}\right)$.
Since $\frac{(x+y)^2}{2} - \frac{40^2}{9}$ is always non-negative, the minimum value of this expression is when $\frac{(x+y)^2}{2} - \frac{40^2}{9} = 0$, which means $\frac{(x+y)^2}{2} = \frac{40^2}{9}$.
Substituting this into the expression we want to minimize:
$5\left(\frac{40^2}{9}\right) + 3\left(0\right) = \frac{4000}{9}$.
So, the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ when $x$ and $y$ range over all real numbers such that $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$ is $\frac{4000}{9}$.
The answer is: $\boxed{\frac{4000}{9}}$

Question (hint: positive numerical answer):
"What is the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ when $x$ and $y$ range over all real numbers such that $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$?"
Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:


To solve this problem, we first need to find a relationship between $x$ and $y$ from the given equation $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$.
Without loss of generality, we can assume that $x \geq y$ (if not, we can swap $x$ and $y$). Then $|x-2y| = x-2y$ and $|y-2x| = 2x-y$. Substituting these into the equation gives:
\[x-2y + 2x-y = 40 \implies 3x-3y = 40 \implies x-y = \frac{40}{3}.\]
Now we can express $x$ in terms of $y$: $x = y + \frac{40}{3}$.
Next, we substitute this into the expression $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$:
\[5(y+\frac{40}{3})^2 + 5y^2 - 8y(y+\frac{40}{3}).\]
Expanding and simplifying, we get:
\[5(y^2 + \frac{80y}{3} + \frac{1600}{9}) + 5y^2 - 8y^2 - \frac{320y}{3} = 5y^2 + \frac{400y}{3} + \frac{8000}{9} + 5y^2 - 8y^2 - \frac{320y}{3} = 2y^2 + \frac{80y}{3} + \frac{8000}{9}.\]
Now we want to find the minimum value of this expression. To do this, we can complete the square:
\[2(y^2 + \frac{40y}{3}) + \frac{8000}{9} = 2(y^2 + \frac{40y}{3} + \frac{400}{9}) - \frac{800}{9} + \frac{8000}{9} = 2(y+\frac{20}{3})^2 + \frac{7200}{9} = 2(y+\frac{20}{3})^2 + 800.\]
Since $(y+\frac{20}{3})^2$ is always non-negative, the minimum value of $2(y+\frac{20}{3})^2 + 800$ is achieved when $(y+\frac{20}{3})^2 = 0$, which gives a minimum value of 800. Therefore, the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ is 800. The answer is: $800$

"What is the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ when $x$ and $y$ range over all real numbers such that $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$?"
Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:


First, let's rewrite the equation $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$ as $|2y-x| + |2x-y| = 40$.
We can apply the triangle inequality, which states that $|a| + |b| \geq |a+b|$, to this equation.
Applying the triangle inequality, we get $|2y-x + 2x-y| \geq |40|$, which simplifies to $|y| \geq 10$.
Now, let's substitute $u = x - 2y$ and $v = y - 2x$. Then, we have $x = \frac{u+2v}{5}$ and $y = \frac{2u+v}{5}$.
Substituting these into the expression $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$, we get
\begin{align*}
5\left(\frac{u+2v}{5}\right)^2 + 5\left(\frac{2u+v}{5}\right)^2 - 8\left(\frac{u+2v}{5}\right)\left(\frac{2u+v}{5}\right) &= \frac{u^2+4uv+4v^2}{5} + \frac{4u^2+4uv+v^2}{5} - \frac{8(u^2+3uv+2v^2)}{25} \\
&= \frac{9u^2-12uv+9v^2}{25} \\
&= \frac{9(u-v)^2}{25}.
\end{align*}
Since $|y| \geq 10$, we have $|2u+v| \geq 50$, which implies $|u-v| \geq 25$. Therefore, the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ is $\frac{9(25^2)}{25} = 225$. The answer is: $225$

Question (hint: positive numerical answer):
"What is the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ when $x$ and $y$ range over all real numbers such that $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$?"
Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:


First, let's simplify the given equation $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$.
We can rewrite it as $|x-2y| + |2y-x| = 40$.
Using the property $|a| = |-a|$, we can further simplify it to $|x-2y| - |2y-x| = 40$.
Now, we know that $|a|-|b| = |a-b|$ or $|a|-|b| = -|a-b|$, so we have $|x-2y| - |2y-x| = |x-2y - (2y-x)| = |x-2y - 2y + x| = |2x-4y| = 40$.
This simplifies to $2|x-2y| = 40$, and further simplifies to $|x-2y| = 20$.
Now, let's solve the expression $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$.
We can rewrite it as $5(x^2+y^2) - 8xy$.
Using the identity $(a-b)^2 = a^2 - 2ab + b^2$, we can rewrite $5(x^2+y^2) - 8xy$ as $5[(x-y)^2 + 2xy] - 8xy$.
This simplifies to $5(x-y)^2 + 2xy - 8xy = 5(x-y)^2 - 6xy$.
Now, let's substitute $x-2y = 20$ into this expression.
We have $5(20)^2 - 6xy$.
Since we want to find the minimum value of this expression, we need to minimize $xy$.
By the Trivial Inequality, $xy \geq \left(\frac{x+y}{2}\right)^2$.
From $|x-2y| = 20$, we have $x-2y = \pm 20$.
If $x-2y = 20$, then $x = 2y + 20$.
If $x-2y = -20$, then $x = 2y - 20$.
In both cases, $x+y = 2y + 20 + y = 3y + 20$.
So, $xy = y(3y+20) = 3y^2 + 20y$.
By AM-GM, $3y^2 + 20y \geq 2\sqrt{3y^2 \cdot 20y} = 2\sqrt{60y^3} = 20\sqrt{6y}$.
Since $y$ can be any real number, the minimum value of $20\sqrt{6y}$ is 0, when $y = 0$.
When $y = 0$, $x = \pm 20$, and $xy = 0$.
So, the minimum value of $5(x-y)^2 - 6xy = 5(20)^2 - 6 \cdot 0 = 2000$.
Therefore, the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ is 2000. The answer is: $2000$.

Question (hint: positive numerical answer):
"What is the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ when $x$ and $y$ range over all real numbers such that $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$?"
Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:


To solve this problem, we first need to find a relationship between $x$ and $y$ from the given equation $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$.
We can rewrite the equation as $|2y-x| + |2x-y| = 40$.
By the triangle inequality, we know that $|a| + |b| \geq |a+b|$, so we have $|2y-x| + |2x-y| \geq |(2y-x) + (2x-y)| = |y| = y$ if $y \geq 0$, and $-y = |y|$ if $y < 0$.
Similarly, we have $|2y-x| + |2x-y| \geq |(2y-x) - (2x-y)| = |-x| = -x$ if $x \geq 0$, and $x = |-x|$ if $x < 0$.
So, we have $y = 40$ or $-x = 40$, which implies $x = -40$.
Now, we substitute $x = -40$ into the equation $y = 2x$, we get $y = -80$.
So, the only solution for $x$ and $y$ that satisfies the given equation is $x = -40$ and $y = -80$.
Now, we substitute $x = -40$ and $y = -80$ into the expression $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$, we get $5(-40)^2+5(-80)^2-8(-40)(-80) = 8000 + 32000 - 25600 = 28400$.
So, the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ when $x$ and $y$ range over all real numbers such that $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$ is 28400.
The answer is: 28400

"What is the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ when $x$ and $y$ range over all real numbers such that $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$?"
Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:



First, we can rewrite the given equation $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$ as $|2y-x| + |2x-y| = 40$.
By the triangle inequality, $|a| + |b| \geq |a+b|$, so $|2y-x| + |2x-y| \geq |(2y-x) + (2x-y)| = |y| = y$.
Therefore, $y = 40$.
Substituting $y = 40$ into the equation $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$, we get $|x-80| + |40-2x| = 40$.
By the triangle inequality again, $|x-80| + |40-2x| \geq |(x-80) + (40-2x)| = |-40| = 40$, so equality holds.
This means that $x-80 = 40-2x$, which simplifies to $3x = 120$ and $x = 40$.

Now, we can substitute $x = 40$ and $y = 40$ into the expression $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ to find its minimum value:
$5(40)^2 + 5(40)^2 - 8(40)(40) = 5(1600) + 5(1600) - 8(1600) = 8000 + 8000 - 12800 = 3200$.

Therefore, the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ is 3200. The answer is: $3200$

"What is the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ when $x$ and $y$ range over all real numbers such that $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$?"
Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:


First, let's rewrite the given equation $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$ as $|2y-x| + |2x-y| = 40$.
We can then use the property $|a| + |b| = |a+b| + |a-b|$ to rewrite the equation as $|2y-x+2x-y| + |2y-x-(2x-y)| = 40$,
which simplifies to $|y+x| + |-x-y| = 40$.
Since $|a| = |-a|$ for all real numbers $a$, we can further simplify this to $2|x+y| = 40$.
So $|x+y| = 20$.
Now let's consider the expression $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$. We can rewrite this as $(5x^2-8xy+5y^2)$.
We can then complete the square in $x$ and $y$ to get $(5(x-y)^2)$.
Since $(x-y)^2 \geq 0$ for all real numbers $x$ and $y$, the minimum value of $(5(x-y)^2)$ is $0$.
Therefore, the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ is $0$. The answer is: $0$
