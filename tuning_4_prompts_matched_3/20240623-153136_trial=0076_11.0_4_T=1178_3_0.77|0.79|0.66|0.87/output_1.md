Approach:


This problem involves finding the minimum value of a function under a constraint. We can use the method of Lagrange multipliers to solve this problem.

Let $f(x, y) = 5x^2 + 5y^2 - 8xy$ and $g(x, y) = |x - 2y| + |y - 2x| - 40$. We want to find the minimum of $f(x, y)$ subject to the constraint $g(x, y) = 0$.

First, we need to find the gradient of $f(x, y)$ and $g(x, y)$:

$\nabla f(x, y) = \left(\frac{\partial f}{\partial x}, \frac{\partial f}{\partial y}\right) = (10x - 8y, 10y - 8x)$

$\nabla g(x, y) = \left(\frac{\partial g}{\partial x}, \frac{\partial g}{\partial y}\right)$

The partial derivatives of $g(x, y)$ are more complicated, but we can find them by considering the four cases for the absolute values:

1. If $x \geq 2y$ and $y \geq 2x$, then $g(x, y) = x - 2y + 2x - y - 40 = 3x - 3y - 40$. So, $\frac{\partial g}{\partial x} = 3$ and $\frac{\partial g}{\partial y} = -3$.

2. If $x \geq 2y$ and $y < 2x$, then $g(x, y) = x - 2y + y - 2x - 40 = -x - y - 40$. So, $\frac{\partial g}{\partial x} = -1$ and $\frac{\partial g}{\partial y} = -1$.

3. If $x < 2y$ and $y \geq 2x$, then $g(x, y) = 2y - x + y - 2x - 40 = 3y - 3x - 40$. So, $\frac{\partial g}{\partial x} = -3$ and $\frac{\partial g}{\partial y} = 3$.

4. If $x < 2y$ and $y < 2x$, then $g(x, y) = 2y - x + 2x - y - 40 = y - 40$. So, $\frac{\partial g}{\partial x} = 0$ and $\frac{\partial g}{\partial y} = 1$.

Now we can use the method of Lagrange multipliers. We want to find $(\lambda, x, y)$ such that:

$\nabla f(x, y) = \lambda \nabla g(x, y)$

This gives us the following system of equations:

$10x - 8y = 3\lambda$
$10y - 8x = -3\lambda$
$g(x, y) = 0$

Solving this system of equations is quite involved and requires considering all four cases for the gradient of $g(x, y)$. After solving the system, we find that the minimum value of $f(x, y)$ under the constraint $g(x, y) = 0$ is achieved at the point $(x, y) = (10, 5)$.

Substituting $(x, y) = (10, 5)$ into $f(x, y)$, we get:

$f(10, 5) = 5(10)^2 + 5(5)^2 - 8(10)(5) = 500 + 125 - 400 = 225$.

So, the minimum value of $5x^2 + 5y^2 - 8xy$ when $x$ and $y$ range over all real numbers such that $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$ is 225.
The answer is: $225$

To find the minimum value of the function $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ subject to the constraint $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$, we can use the method of Lagrange multipliers. First, let's rewrite the constraint as $g(x, y) = |x-2y| + |y-2x| - 40 = 0$. The function we want to minimize is $f(x, y) = 5x^2+5y^2-8xy$. We will form the Lagrangian function $L(x, y, \lambda) = f(x, y) - \lambda g(x, y)$.

Now, we need to find the partial derivatives of $L$ with respect to $x$, $y$, and $\lambda$ and set them equal to zero:

$\frac{\partial L}{\partial x} = 10x - 8y + 2\lambda(1 - 2) = 0$,
$\frac{\partial L}{\partial y} = 10y - 8x + 2\lambda(1 - 2) = 0$,
$\frac{\partial L}{\partial \lambda} = g(x, y) = 0$.

Simplifying the first two equations, we get:

$10x - 8y - 2\lambda = 0$,
$10y - 8x - 2\lambda = 0$.

Adding these two equations, we get $2(10x - 8y) = 0$, which implies $x = y$.

Substituting $x = y$ into the constraint equation, we get:

$|x-2x| + |x-2x| = 40$,
$|x-2x| = 20$,
$|x| = 20$.

Since $x$ can be positive or negative, we have two cases: $x = 20$ or $x = -20$.

Case 1: $x = 20$, then $y = 20$. Substituting into the function $f(x, y)$, we get:

$f(20, 20) = 5(20)^2 + 5(20)^2 - 8(20)(20) = 2000$.

Case 2: $x = -20$, then $y = -20$. Substituting into the function $f(x, y)$, we get:

$f(-20, -20) = 5(-20)^2 + 5(-20)^2 - 8(-20)(-20) = 2000$.

So in both cases, the value of the function is 2000. Therefore, the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ subject to the constraint is 2000. The answer is: $2000$

Approach:


We can use the inequality $|a| + |b| \geq |a + b|$ to simplify the constraint equation. We have $|x - 2y| + |y - 2x| = |x - 2y| + |2x - y| \geq |(x - 2y) + (2x - y)| = |3x - 3y| = 3|x - y|$.
Setting $3|x - y| = 40$, we get $|x - y| = \frac{40}{3}$.
Now we can use the method of completing the square to minimize the expression $5x^2 + 5y^2 - 8xy$.
We have $5x^2 + 5y^2 - 8xy = 5(x^2 - \frac{8}{5}xy + y^2) + 5(y^2 - \frac{8}{5}xy + x^2) - 16xy = 5(x - y)^2 - 16xy$.
Substituting $|x - y| = \frac{40}{3}$, we get $5(x - y)^2 - 16xy = 5(\frac{40}{3})^2 - 16xy = \frac{8000}{9} - 16xy$.
To minimize this expression, we need to maximize $16xy$.
By the AM-GM inequality, we have $16xy \leq \frac{(16x)^2 + (16y)^2}{2} = \frac{256(x^2 + y^2)}{2} = 128(x^2 + y^2)$.
Since $|x - 2y| + |y - 2x| = 40$, we have $3|x - y| = 40$, so $|x - y| = \frac{40}{3}$.
By the triangle inequality, we have $|x - y| \leq |x| + |y|$, so $|x| + |y| \geq \frac{40}{3}$.
By the AM-GM inequality, we have $|x| + |y| \geq 2\sqrt{|x||y|}$, so $2\sqrt{|x||y|} \geq \frac{40}{3}$, and $|x||y| \geq \frac{400}{9}$.
Therefore, $16xy \leq 128(x^2 + y^2) = 128(2(|x||y|) - xy) \leq 128(2(\frac{400}{9}) - xy) = \frac{9920}{9} - 128xy$.
So we have $16xy \leq \frac{9920}{9}$.
Therefore, the minimum value of $5x^2 + 5y^2 - 8xy$ is $\frac{8000}{9} - 16xy \geq \frac{8000}{9} - \frac{9920}{9} = -\frac{1920}{9}$.
However, this is not possible because the expression $5x^2 + 5y^2 - 8xy$ is always nonnegative.
So we must have equality in the AM-GM inequality, which means $x = y$.
Substituting $x = y$ into the constraint equation, we get $|x - 2x| + |x - 2x| = 40$, which simplifies to $2|x| = 40$, so $|x| = 20$.
Therefore, the minimum value of $5x^2 + 5y^2 - 8xy$ occurs when $x = y = 20$ or $x = y = -20$.
Substituting $x = y = 20$ into the expression, we get $5(20)^2 + 5(20)^2 - 8(20)(20) = 2000$.
So the minimum value of $5x^2 + 5y^2 - 8xy$ is 2000. The answer is: $2000$

Approach:



To find the minimum value of the expression $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ subject to the constraint $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$, we can use the method of Lagrange multipliers.

Let $f(x, y) = 5x^2 + 5y^2 - 8xy$ and $g(x, y) = |x - 2y| + |y - 2x| - 40$. We want to find the points $(x, y)$ where the gradient of $f$ is a scalar multiple of the gradient of $g$.

The gradient of $f$ is $\nabla f(x, y) = \left(\frac{\partial f}{\partial x}, \frac{\partial f}{\partial y}\right) = (10x - 8y, 10y - 8x)$.

The gradient of $g$ is more complicated to compute. However, we can use the fact that $|a - b| = \sqrt{(a - b)^2}$, so

$$g(x, y) = \sqrt{(x - 2y)^2} + \sqrt{(y - 2x)^2} - 40 = \sqrt{x^2 - 4xy + 4y^2} + \sqrt{y^2 - 4xy + 4x^2} - 40.$$

Computing the gradient of $g$ involves taking partial derivatives with respect to $x$ and $y$. After some algebra, we find that $\nabla g(x, y) = \left(\frac{x - 2y}{\sqrt{(x - 2y)^2} + \sqrt{(y - 2x)^2}}, \frac{y - 2x}{\sqrt{(x - 2y)^2} + \sqrt{(y - 2x)^2}}\right)$.

Now we want to find the points $(x, y)$ where $\nabla f(x, y) = \lambda \nabla g(x, y)$ for some scalar $\lambda$. This gives us the system of equations

$$\begin{cases} 10x - 8y = \lambda \frac{x - 2y}{\sqrt{(x - 2y)^2} + \sqrt{(y - 2x)^2}} \\ 10y - 8x = \lambda \frac{y - 2x}{\sqrt{(x - 2y)^2} + \sqrt{(y - 2x)^2}} \end{cases}.$$

Solving this system of equations is quite involved and requires numerical methods. Once we find the solutions $(x, y)$, we can substitute them into the expression $5x^2 + 5y^2 - 8xy$ to find the minimum value.

However, we can simplify the problem by noting that the expression $5x^2 + 5y^2 - 8xy$ is symmetric in $x$ and $y$. Therefore, if $(x, y)$ is a solution, then so is $(y, x)$. Moreover, if $(x, y)$ is a solution, then so is $(-x, -y)$. This means that without loss of generality, we can assume that $x \geq y$. Then, the constraint equation becomes $|x - 2y| + |y - 2x| = 40$.

By considering the cases $x \geq 2y$ and $x < 2y$, we can simplify the constraint equation to $3(x - y) = 40$. Solving for $y$ in terms of $x$, we get $y = x - \frac{40}{3}$. Substituting this into the expression $5x^2 + 5y^2 - 8xy$, we get

$$5x^2 + 5\left(x - \frac{40}{3}\right)^2 - 8x\left(x - \frac{40}{3}\right).$$

Simplifying this expression and taking the derivative with respect to $x$, we find that the minimum value occurs at $x = \frac{40}{3}$. Substituting this back into the equation $y = x - \frac{40}{3}$, we find that $y = 0$.

Finally, substituting $x = \frac{40}{3}$ and $y = 0$ into the expression $5x^2 + 5y^2 - 8xy$, we find that the minimum value is $5\left(\frac{40}{3}\right)^2 = \frac{8000}{9}$.

Therefore, the minimum value of $5x^2 + 5y^2 - 8xy$ subject to the constraint $|x - 2y| + |y - 2x| = 40$ is $\frac{8000}{9}$. The answer is: $\boxed{\frac{8000}{9}}$

Approach:


This problem involves finding the minimum value of a function subject to a constraint. The constraint equation is $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$. We can rewrite this equation as $|x-2y| = 40 - |y-2x|$. Squaring both sides, we get $(x-2y)^2 = (40 - |y-2x|)^2$. Expanding and simplifying, we get $x^2 - 4xy + 4y^2 = 1600 - 80|y-2x| + (y-2x)^2$. Rearranging terms, we get $5x^2 + 5y^2 - 8xy = 1600 - 80|y-2x|$. Since the left side of this equation is the expression we want to minimize, we want to minimize the right side as well. The minimum value of $|y-2x|$ is 0, which occurs when $y=2x$. Substituting $y=2x$ into the constraint equation, we get $|x-4x| + |2x-4x| = 40$, which simplifies to $3|x| = 40$. Thus, $|x| = \frac{40}{3}$, and since $y=2x$, $|y| = \frac{80}{3}$. The minimum value of the expression is therefore $1600 - 80 \cdot 0 = 1600$.

However, we need to check if this minimum value satisfies the constraint equation. Substituting $x=\frac{40}{3}$ and $y=\frac{80}{3}$ into the constraint equation, we get $| \frac{40}{3} - 2 \cdot \frac{80}{3} | + | \frac{80}{3} - 2 \cdot \frac{40}{3} | = | -\frac{160}{3} | + | \frac{160}{3} | = \frac{160}{3} + \frac{160}{3} = \frac{320}{3}$. This does not equal 40.

Therefore, we made a mistake in our reasoning. Let's reconsider the constraint equation. The equation $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$ can be rewritten as $|x-2y| = 40 - |y-2x|$. This implies that $|x-2y|$ and $|y-2x|$ must have the same absolute value. This means that either $x-2y = y-2x + 40$ or $x-2y = -(y-2x + 40)$. Solving these two equations, we get $x = \frac{40}{3}$ and $y = \frac{80}{3}$ or $x = -\frac{40}{3}$ and $y = -\frac{80}{3}$.

Now, let's substitute these values into the expression $5x^2 + 5y^2 - 8xy$. We get $5(\frac{40}{3})^2 + 5(\frac{80}{3})^2 - 8(\frac{40}{3})(\frac{80}{3}) = 1600$.

Therefore, the minimum value of the expression $5x^2 + 5y^2 - 8xy$ subject to the constraint $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$ is 1600. The answer is: $1600$

Approach:



The given expression is $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$. We can rewrite this as $5(x^2+y^2)-8xy$. Now, we know that $(x-y)^2 = x^2 - 2xy + y^2 \geq 0$, so $x^2 + y^2 \geq 2xy$. Substituting this into the expression gives $5(x^2+y^2)-8xy \geq 5(2xy) - 8xy = 2xy$.

Now, we need to find the maximum value of $2xy$ under the constraint $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$. This constraint can be rewritten as $|x-2y| + |2y-x| = 40$, which simplifies to $2|x-2y| = 40$. Thus, $|x-2y| = 20$.

The expression $2xy$ is maximized when $x$ and $y$ are as far apart as possible, which occurs when $x-2y = \pm 20$. Without loss of generality, let's assume $x-2y = 20$. Then, $x = 2y + 20$. Substituting this into the constraint gives $|(2y+20)-2y| + |y-(2(2y+20))| = 40$, which simplifies to $|20| + |-40| = 40$, which is true.

Now, we substitute $x = 2y + 20$ into $2xy$ to get $2(2y+20)y = 4y^2 + 40y$. To find the maximum of this expression, we can take the derivative with respect to $y$ and set it equal to zero: $8y + 40 = 0$, which gives $y = -5$. Substituting $y = -5$ into $x = 2y + 20$ gives $x = 10$.

Finally, substituting $x = 10$ and $y = -5$ into $2xy$ gives $2(10)(-5) = -100$. However, we made a mistake in our reasoning earlier. The correct inequality is $x^2 + y^2 \geq 0$, not $x^2 + y^2 \geq 2xy$. Therefore, the expression $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ is minimized, not maximized. So, we need to minimize $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$.

To minimize this expression, we need to find the values of $x$ and $y$ that satisfy the constraint and make $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ as small as possible. Using the same approach as before, we find that the minimum occurs when $x = 10$ and $y = -5$. Substituting these values into $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ gives $5(10)^2 + 5(-5)^2 - 8(10)(-5) = 500 + 125 + 400 = 1025$.

Therefore, the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ is -100, but since we are asked for the minimum value of the expression, the answer is 1025.
The answer is: $1025$

Approach:


To solve this problem, we will first use the given condition $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$ to simplify it. Then we will substitute the simplified form into the expression $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ and complete the square to find its minimum value.

Step 1: Simplify the given condition $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$.
We know that $|a-b| = |b-a|$, so $|x-2y| = |2y-x|$. Thus, we can rewrite the given condition as:
$|x-2y| + |x-2y| = 40 \implies 2|x-2y| = 40 \implies |x-2y| = 20$.
This implies that $x-2y = 20$ or $x-2y = -20$.

Step 2: Substitute the simplified form into the expression $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$.
We will consider both cases separately.

Case 1: $x-2y = 20$. Solving for $x$, we get $x = 2y + 20$. Substituting this into the expression, we get:
$5(2y+20)^2 + 5y^2 - 8(2y+20)y = 5(4y^2 + 80y + 400) + 5y^2 - 16y^2 - 160y = 20y^2 + 400y + 2000 + 5y^2 - 16y^2 - 160y = 7y^2 + 240y + 2000$.

Case 2: $x-2y = -20$. Solving for $x$, we get $x = 2y - 20$. Substituting this into the expression, we get:
$5(2y-20)^2 + 5y^2 - 8(2y-20)y = 5(4y^2 - 80y + 400) + 5y^2 - 16y^2 + 160y = 20y^2 - 400y + 2000 + 5y^2 - 16y^2 + 160y = 9y^2 - 240y + 2000$.

Step 3: Find the minimum value of the expression.
We will now find the minimum value of $7y^2 + 240y + 2000$ and $9y^2 - 240y + 2000$.

For $7y^2 + 240y + 2000$, the minimum value occurs at $y = -\frac{240}{2*7} = -\frac{120}{7}$. Substituting this into the expression, we get:
$7\left(-\frac{120}{7}\right)^2 + 240\left(-\frac{120}{7}\right) + 2000 = 1200 - \frac{28800}{7} + 2000 = -\frac{28800}{7} + 3200$.

For $9y^2 - 240y + 2000$, the minimum value occurs at $y = \frac{240}{2*9} = \frac{40}{3}$. Substituting this into the expression, we get:
$9\left(\frac{40}{3}\right)^2 - 240\left(\frac{40}{3}\right) + 2000 = 4800 - 3200 + 2000 = 3600$.

Comparing the two minimum values, $-\frac{28800}{7} + 3200 = -\frac{28800}{7} + \frac{22400}{7} = -\frac{6400}{7}$ and $3600$, we see that the minimum value of the expression is $-\frac{6400}{7}$.

However, this is not possible since the minimum value of the given expression should be a positive number. Therefore, we must have made a mistake in our calculations. Let's retrace our steps and see where we went wrong.

Upon reexamination, we realize that we made a mistake in our calculations when finding the minimum value of the expressions. The correct way to find the minimum value of a quadratic expression $ax^2 + bx + c$ is to use the formula $x = -\frac{b}{2a}$. Applying this formula to the expressions, we get:

For $7y^2 + 240y + 2000$, the minimum value occurs at $y = -\frac{240}{2*7} = -\frac{120}{7}$. Substituting this into the expression, we get:
$7\left(-\frac{120}{7}\right)^2 + 240\left(-\frac{120}{7}\right) + 2000 = 1200 - \frac{28800}{7} + 2000 = -\frac{28800}{7} + 3200$.

For $9y^2 - 240y + 2000$, the minimum value occurs at $y = \frac{240}{2*9} = \frac{40}{3}$. Substituting this into the expression, we get:
$9\left(\frac{40}{3}\right)^2 - 240\left(\frac{40}{3}\right) + 2000 = 4800 - 3200 + 2000 = 3600$.

However, these calculations still do not give us a positive minimum value for the expression. We must have made another mistake in our calculations. Let's retrace our steps once more and see where we went wrong.

Upon reexamination, we realize that we made a mistake in our calculations when simplifying the given condition $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$. We incorrectly assumed that $|x-2y| = |2y-x|$. The correct way to simplify the given condition is to consider the two cases separately:

Case 1: $x-2y \geq 0$ and $y-2x \geq 0$. This implies that $x \geq 2y$ and $y \geq 2x$. The given condition becomes:
$x-2y + y-2x = 40 \implies -x - y = 40$, which is not possible since $x \geq 2y$ and $y \geq 2x$.

We can use the Cauchy-Schwarz inequality to solve this problem. The Cauchy-Schwarz inequality states that for any real numbers $a_1, a_2, ..., a_n$ and $b_1, b_2, ..., b_n$, we have
\[(a_1^2 + a_2^2 + ... + a_n^2)(b_1^2 + b_2^2 + ... + b_n^2) \geq (a_1b_1 + a_2b_2 + ... + a_nb_n)^2.\]

Let's apply this inequality to our problem. Let $a_1 = x - 2y$, $a_2 = y - 2x$, $b_1 = 1$, and $b_2 = 1$. Then we have
\[((x - 2y)^2 + (y - 2x)^2)(1^2 + 1^2) \geq ((x - 2y)(1) + (y - 2x)(1))^2.\]

Simplifying, we get
\[((x - 2y)^2 + (y - 2x)^2)(2) \geq (x - 2y + y - 2x)^2.\]

Simplifying further, we get
\[((x - 2y)^2 + (y - 2x)^2)(2) \geq (-x + y)^2.\]

Expanding and simplifying, we get
\[2((x - 2y)^2 + (y - 2x)^2) \geq (x - y)^2.\]

Expanding and simplifying further, we get
\[2(x^2 - 4xy + 4y^2 + y^2 - 4xy + 4x^2) \geq x^2 - 2xy + y^2.\]

Simplifying, we get
\[2(5x^2 - 8xy + 5y^2) \geq x^2 - 2xy + y^2.\]

Simplifying further, we get
\[10x^2 - 16xy + 10y^2 \geq x^2 - 2xy + y^2.\]

Rearranging, we get
\[9x^2 - 14xy + 9y^2 \geq 0.\]

Now, let's go back to our original expression $5x^2 + 5y^2 - 8xy$. We can rewrite this as
\[5x^2 + 5y^2 - 8xy = \frac{1}{2}(10x^2 - 16xy + 10y^2).\]

Using the inequality we derived above, we have
\[5x^2 + 5y^2 - 8xy \geq \frac{1}{2}(x^2 - 2xy + y^2).\]

Simplifying, we get
\[5x^2 + 5y^2 - 8xy \geq \frac{1}{2}(x - y)^2.\]

Since $|x - 2y| + |y - 2x| = 40$, we know that $(x - 2y)^2 + (y - 2x)^2 = 40^2/2 = 400$. Therefore, we have
\[5x^2 + 5y^2 - 8xy \geq \frac{1}{2}(400).\]

Simplifying, we get
\[5x^2 + 5y^2 - 8xy \geq 200.\]

So the minimum value of $5x^2 + 5y^2 - 8xy$ is 200. The answer is: $200$

This problem involves finding the minimum value of a function subject to a constraint. To solve this problem, we can use the method of Lagrange multipliers. First, we introduce a new variable $\lambda$ and form the Lagrangian function:

$$L(x, y, \lambda) = 5x^2 + 5y^2 - 8xy + \lambda(|x - 2y| + |y - 2x - 40).$$

Now we need to find the critical points of $L(x, y, \lambda)$ by setting its partial derivatives with respect to $x$, $y$, and $\lambda$ to zero:

$$\frac{\partial L}{\partial x} = 10x - 8y + \lambda(-1 + 2\delta_1) = 0,$$
$$\frac{\partial L}{\partial y} = 10y - 8x + \lambda(2 - 1 + 2\delta_2) = 0,$$
$$\frac{\partial L}{\partial \lambda} = |x - 2y| + |y - 2x - 40) = 0.$$

Here, $\delta_1 = \frac{x - 2y}{|x - 2y|}$ and $\delta_2 = \frac{y - 2x - 40}{|y - 2x - 40|}$ are the signs of the absolute values.

Now we need to solve this system of equations. First, we can simplify the first two equations:

$$10x - 8y - \lambda + 2\lambda\delta_1 = 0,$$
$$10y - 8x + 2\lambda - \lambda + 2\lambda\delta_2 = 0.$$

This gives us:

$$10x - 8y + \lambda(2\delta_1 - 1) = 0,$$
$$10y - 8x + \lambda(2 + 2\delta_2) = 0.$$

Now we can use the constraint $|x - 2y| + |y - 2x - 40| = 0$ to simplify the system further. If $|x - 2y| = 0$, then $x = 2y$. If $|y - 2x - 40| = 0$, then $y = 2x + 40$. We can substitute these into the equations above and solve for $\lambda$.

For $x = 2y$, we get:

$$10(2y) - 8y + \lambda(4 - 1) = 0,$$
$$10y - 8(2y) + \lambda(4 + 2) = 0.$$

This simplifies to:

$$12y + 3\lambda = 0,$$
$$-6y + 6\lambda = 0.$$.

From the second equation, we get $y = \lambda$. Substituting this into the first equation gives $12\lambda + 3\lambda = 0$, so $\lambda = 0$. But this is not possible because the constraint $|x - 2y| + |y - 2x - 40| = 0$ is not satisfied for $\lambda = 0$.

For $y = 2x + 40$, we get:

$$10x - 8(2x + 40) + \lambda(2 - 1 + 2\delta_1) = 0,$$
$$10(2x + 40) - 8x + \lambda(2 + 2\delta_2) = 0.$$

This simplifies to:

$$-6x - 320 + \lambda(2\delta_1 + 1) = 0,$$
$$12x + 400 + \lambda(2 + 2\delta_2) = 0.$$

From the first equation, we get $\lambda = 6x + 320$. Substituting this into the second equation gives:

$$12x + 400 + (6x + 320)(2 + 2\delta_2) = 0.$$

This simplifies to:

$$12x + 400 + 12x + 320 + 12x\delta_2 + 640\delta_2 = 0,$$
$$36x + 720 + 12x\delta_2 + 640\delta_2 = 0.$$

Rearranging terms gives:

$$48x + 12x\delta_2 + 640\delta_2 = -720.$$

Dividing by 12 gives:

$$4x + x\delta_2 + 53.33\delta_2 = -60.$$

Now we can substitute the value of $\delta_2$ from the constraint equation $|y - 2x - 40| = 0$:

$$4x + x\delta_1 + 53.33(-1 + 2\delta_1) = -60.$$

This simplifies to:

$$4x + x\delta_1 - 53.33 + 106.66\delta_1 = -60.$$

Rearranging terms gives:

$$(4 + \delta_1)x = -60 + 53.33 - 106.66\delta_1,$$
$$(4 + \delta_1)x = -6.67 - 106.66\delta_1.$$

Now we can substitute the value of $\delta_1$ from the constraint equation $|x - 2y| = 0$:

$$(4 + 1)x = -6.67 - 106.66(-1),$$
$$5x = -6.67 + 106.66,$$
$$5x = 100,$$
$$x = 20.$$

Substituting $x = 20$ into the constraint equation gives:

$$|20 - 2y| + |y - 2(20) - 40| = 0,$$
$$|20 - 2y| + |y - 80| = 0.$$

From the first absolute value, we get $20 - 2y = 0$, so $y = 10$. Substituting $x = 20$ and $y = 10$ into the original function gives:

$$5(20)^2 + 5(10)^2 - 8(20)(10) = 2000 + 500 - 1600 = 1900.$$

Therefore, the minimum value of the function is 1900. The answer is: $1900$

This is a constrained optimization problem. We need to minimize the function $f(x, y) = 5x^2 + 5y^2 - 8xy$ subject to the constraint $g(x, y) = |x - 2y| + |y - 2x| - 40 = 0$.

First, let's rewrite the constraint equation $g(x, y) = 0$ in a more convenient form. We have:

$$|x - 2y| + |y - 2x| = 40.$$

By the triangle inequality, we know that $|a + b| \leq |a| + |b|$ for all real numbers $a$ and $b$. Therefore, we have:

$$|x - 2y| + |y - 2x| \geq |(x - 2y) + (y - 2x)| = |-x - y| = |-(x + y)| = |x + y|.$$

So, we have $|x + y| = 40$.

Now, let's consider the function $f(x, y) = 5x^2 + 5y^2 - 8xy$. We can rewrite this as:

$$f(x, y) = 5(x^2 + y^2) - 8xy = 5[(x + y)^2 - 2xy] - 8xy = 5(x + y)^2 - 18xy.$$

Since $|x + y| = 40$, we know that $(x + y)^2 = 1600$. Substituting this into the expression for $f(x, y)$, we get:

$$f(x, y) = 5(1600) - 18xy = 8000 - 18xy.$$

To minimize $f(x, y)$, we need to maximize $18xy$. Since $x$ and $y$ are real numbers, the maximum value of $xy$ occurs when $x = y$. In this case, we have:

$$18xy = 18x^2.$$

Now, we need to find the maximum value of $18x^2$ subject to the constraint $|x + x| = 40$, which simplifies to $|2x| = 40$. This gives us $x = \pm 20$. Since $x^2$ is always non-negative, the maximum value of $18x^2$ is achieved when $x = 20$, and we have:

$$18x^2 = 18(20)^2 = 7200.$$

Substituting this back into the expression for $f(x, y)$, we get:

$$f(x, y) = 8000 - 7200 = 800.$$

Therefore, the minimum value of $5x^2 + 5y^2 - 8xy$ subject to the constraint $|x - 2y| + |y - 2x| = 40$ is 800. The answer is: $800$

We can use the Cauchy-Schwarz inequality to solve this problem. First, let's rewrite the given equation $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$ as $2|x-2y| = 40$, which simplifies to $|x-2y| = 20$. Now, let's apply the Cauchy-Schwarz inequality:

$$(1^2 + 2^2)(x^2 + y^2) \geq (x + 2y)^2.$$

Expanding the left side gives $5(x^2 + y^2) \geq (x + 2y)^2$.

Expanding the right side gives $5(x^2 + y^2) \geq x^2 + 4xy + 4y^2$.

Rearranging terms, we get $5x^2 + 5y^2 - 4xy \geq 0$.

Now, we want to minimize the value of $5x^2 + 5y^2 - 8xy$. We know that $5x^2 + 5y^2 - 4xy \geq 0$, so $5x^2 + 5y^2 - 8xy \geq 0$.

Therefore, the minimum value of $5x^2 + 5y^2 - 8xy$ is 0.
The answer is: $0$

To find the minimum value of the expression $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ under the condition $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$, we can use the method of Lagrange multipliers.

Let $f(x, y) = 5x^2 + 5y^2 - 8xy$ and $g(x, y) = |x - 2y| + |y - 2x| - 40$. We want to find the minimum of $f(x, y)$ subject to the constraint $g(x, y) = 0$.

The method of Lagrange multipliers tells us to find the points where the gradient of $f$ is proportional to the gradient of $g$. So we need to solve the system of equations:

$\nabla f(x, y) = \lambda \nabla g(x, y)$

$g(x, y) = 0$

Computing the gradients, we have:

$\nabla f(x, y) = \begin{pmatrix} 10x - 8y \\ 10y - 8x \end{pmatrix}$

$\nabla g(x, y) = \begin{pmatrix} \frac{1}{1+|2|^{-1}} - \frac{2}{1+|{-2}|^{-1}} \\ \frac{1}{1+|{-2}|^{-1}} - \frac{2}{1+|2|^{-1}} \end{pmatrix} = \begin{pmatrix} -1 \\ 1 \end{pmatrix}$

So we need to solve the system of equations:

$\begin{cases} 10x - 8y = - \lambda \\ 10y - 8x = \lambda \end{cases}$

and

$|x - 2y| + |y - 2x| = 40$

Solving the first system of equations, we get:

$10x - 8y = - \lambda$ and $10y - 8x = \lambda$

Adding these two equations, we get $2x = 2y$, so $x = y$.

Substituting $x = y$ into the constraint equation, we get:

$|x - 2x| + |x - 2x| = 40$

$| - x| + | - x| = 40$

$2|x| = 40$

$|x| = 20$

So $x = \pm 20$. Since $x = y$, we have $y = \pm 20$.

Now we can compute the value of $f(x, y)$ at these points:

$f(20, 20) = 5(20^2) + 5(20^2) - 8(20)(20) = 2000$

$f(-20, -20) = 5(-20^2) + 5(-20^2) - 8(-20)(-20) = 2000$

So the minimum value of $f(x, y)$ is 2000.
The answer is: $2000$
