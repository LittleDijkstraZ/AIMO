Approach:



The equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has $4$ distinct solutions means that the right side of the equation $\frac{m}{100}$ is equal to the distance between two adjacent vertical lines in the graph of $y = \vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert$. In the graph of $y = \vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert$, the distance between two adjacent vertical lines is $1$. Therefore, we have $\frac{m}{100} = 1$, which gives $m = 100$.

So, there is only one positive integer $m$ that makes the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ have $4$ distinct solutions.
The answer is: $1$

Approach:


The equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has 4 distinct solutions, it means that $\frac{m}{100}$ is the distance between two branches of the piecewise function $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert$. The maximum value of this distance is 2, and the minimum value is 0. Therefore, we need to find the number of multiples of $\frac{1}{100}$ in the interval $[0, 2]$.

To find the number of multiples of $\frac{m}{100}$ in the interval $[0, 2]$, we can multiply the interval length by 100 to get the interval $[0, 200]$, and then divide by the length of the multiple, which is 1, to get the number of multiples. This gives us $200$ multiples.

However, we need to exclude the cases where the distance is 0, which correspond to the cases where the two branches of the piecewise function touch each other. There are two such cases, when $m=0$ and $m=200$. So we subtract 2 from the total number of multiples.

Solution:
The number of positive integers $m$ for which the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has 4 distinct solutions is $200-2=198$. The answer is: $198$

Approach:


The equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has 4 distinct solutions, it means that the expression inside the absolute value, i.e., $\vert x-1 \vert -2$, must be equal to $\frac{m}{100}$, $-\frac{m}{100}$, $2+\frac{m}{100}$, and $-2-\frac{m}{100}$.

Let's consider each case separately:

1. $\vert x-1 \vert -2 = \frac{m}{100}$:
\[\vert x-1 \vert = 2 + \frac{m}{100}\]
This gives us two sub-cases:

1.1. $x-1 = 2 + \frac{m}{100}$:
\[x = 3 + \frac{m}{100}\]
1.2. $x-1 = -(2 + \frac{m}{100})$:
\[x = -1 - \frac{m}{100}\]

2. $\vert x-1 \vert -2 = -\frac{m}{100}$:
\[\vert x-1 \vert = 2 - \frac{m}{100}\]
This gives us two sub-cases:

2.1. $x-1 = 2 - \frac{m}{100}$:
\[x = 3 - \frac{m}{100}\]
2.2. $x-1 = -(2 - \frac{m}{100})$:
\[x = -1 + \frac{m}{100}\]

3. $\vert x-1 \vert -2 = 2 + \frac{m}{100}$:
\[\vert x-1 \vert = 4 + \frac{m}{100}\]
This gives us two sub-cases:

3.1. $x-1 = 4 + \frac{m}{100}$:
\[x = 5 + \frac{m}{100}\]
3.2. $x-1 = -(4 + \frac{m}{100})$:
\[x = -3 - \frac{m}{100}\]

4. $\vert x-1 \vert -2 = -2 - \frac{m}{100}$:
\[\vert x-1 \vert = \frac{m}{100}\]
This gives us two sub-cases:

4.1. $x-1 = \frac{m}{100}$:
\[x = 1 + \frac{m}{100}\]
4.2. $x-1 = -\frac{m}{100}$:
\[x = 1 - \frac{m}{100}\]

Now, we need to find for how many positive integers $m$ the above solutions are distinct.

By comparing the solutions, we can see that the solutions are distinct when $m$ is between $0$ and $100$. So there are $100$ positive integers $m$ for which the equation has $4$ distinct solutions.

The answer is: $100$.

Approach:



The equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has 4 distinct solutions, it means that the expression inside the absolute value, i.e., $\vert x-1 \vert -2$, must be equal to $\frac{m}{100}$, $-\frac{m}{100}$, $2+\frac{m}{100}$, and $-2-\frac{m}{100}$.

Let's solve each case separately:

1. $\vert x-1 \vert -2 = \frac{m}{100}$:

Adding 2 to both sides gives $\vert x-1 \vert = 2 + \frac{m}{100}$.

This equation has two cases:

- $x-1 = 2 + \frac{m}{100}$, which simplifies to $x = 3 + \frac{m}{100}$.
- $-(x-1) = 2 + \frac{m}{100}$, which simplifies to $x = -1 + \frac{m}{100}$.

2. $\vert x-1 \vert -2 = -\frac{m}{100}$:

Adding 2 to both sides gives $\vert x-1 \vert = 2 - \frac{m}{100}$.

This equation also has two cases:

- $x-1 = 2 - \frac{m}{100}$, which simplifies to $x = 3 - \frac{m}{100}$.
- $-(x-1) = 2 - \frac{m}{100}$, which simplifies to $x = -1 - \frac{m}{100}$.

3. $\vert x-1 \vert -2 = 2 + \frac{m}{100}$:

Adding 2 to both sides gives $\vert x-1 \vert = 4 + \frac{m}{100}$.

This equation has two cases:

- $x-1 = 4 + \frac{m}{100}$, which simplifies to $x = 5 + \frac{m}{100}$.
- $-(x-1) = 4 + \frac{m}{100}$, which simplifies to $x = -3 + \frac{m}{100}$.

4. $\vert x-1 \vert -2 = -2 - \frac{m}{100}$:

Adding 2 to both sides gives $\vert x-1 \vert = \frac{m}{100}$.

This equation also has two cases:

- $x-1 = \frac{m}{100}$, which simplifies to $x = 1 + \frac{m}{100}$.
- $-(x-1) = \frac{m}{100}$, which simplifies to $x = 1 - \frac{m}{100}$.

So, the four distinct solutions are $x = 3 + \frac{m}{100}$, $x = -1 + \frac{m}{100}$, $x = 3 - \frac{m}{100}$, $x = -1 - \frac{m}{100}$, $x = 5 + \frac{m}{100}$, $x = -3 + \frac{m}{100}$, $x = 1 + \frac{m}{100}$, and $x = 1 - \frac{m}{100}$.

For these solutions to be distinct, the values of $\frac{m}{100}$ must be different. This implies that $m$ must be a multiple of 100. The only multiples of 100 that are between 0 and 4 (since the absolute value cannot be negative) are 0, 1, 2, and 3.

However, for $m=0$, the equation becomes $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=0$, which simplifies to $\vert x-1 \vert = 2$. This gives two solutions: $x=3$ and $x=-1$. So, $m=0$ does not give 4 distinct solutions.

For $m=1$, the equation becomes $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{1}{100}$, which does not have 4 distinct solutions.

For $m=2$, the equation becomes $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{2}{100}$, which does not have 4 distinct solutions.

For $m=3$, the equation becomes $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{3}{100}$, which does not have 4 distinct solutions.

For $m=4$, the equation becomes $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{4}{100}$, which does not have 4 distinct solutions.

So, there is no positive integer $m$ for which the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has 4 distinct solutions.

However, we made a mistake in our approach. We should not have discarded the case when $m=0$ because it does not give 4 distinct solutions. Let's reconsider the case when $m=0$.

When $m=0$, the equation becomes $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=0$, which simplifies to $\vert x-1 \vert = 2$. This gives two solutions: $x=3$ and $x=-1$. So, $m=0$ does give 2 distinct solutions.

Now, let's reconsider the other cases again.

For $m=1$, the equation becomes $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{1}{100}$, which does not have 4 distinct solutions.

For $m=2$, the equation becomes $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{2}{100}$, which does not have 4 distinct solutions.

For $m=3$, the equation becomes $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{3}{100}$, which does not have 4 distinct solutions.

For $m=4$, the equation becomes $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{4}{100}$, which does not have 4 distinct solutions.

So, there is still no positive integer $m$ for which the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has 4 distinct solutions.

However, we made another mistake in our approach. We should not have discarded the case when $m=1$, $m=2$, $m=3$, and $m=4$ because it does not give 4 distinct solutions. Let's reconsider the cases when $m=1$, $m=2$, $m=3$, and $m=4$.

When $m=1$, the equation becomes $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \

Approach:



The equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has $4$ distinct solutions, it means that $\frac{m}{100}$ must be a number in the interval $(0, 2)$. Therefore, we have $0 < \frac{m}{100} < 2$, which implies $0 < m < 200$. The positive integers $m$ that satisfy this inequality are the integers from $1$ to $199$. We need to count how many of these integers make the equation have $4$ distinct solutions.

To count the number of $m$, we need to consider the number of times the value of $\frac{m}{100}$ hits the corners of the "V" shape formed by the piecewise function $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert$. This happens when $\frac{m}{100}$ equals $0$, $1$, or $2$. Solving these equations gives us $m = 0$, $100$, or $200$. However, $m = 0$ is not a positive integer, so we discard it.

Therefore, we need to count the number of positive integers $m$ such that $100 < m < 200$. This is a range of $100$ consecutive positive integers.

Solution:

The number of positive integers $m$ in the range $100 < m < 200$ is $100$.

Therefore, the number of positive integers $m$ for which the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has $4$ distinct solutions is $100$. The answer is: $100$

Approach:



The equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has $4$ distinct solutions, we need to find the number of positive integers $m$ for which this is true.

We can start by considering the possible values of $m$. Since $m$ is a positive integer and $\frac{m}{100}$ is a positive number, $m$ must be a multiple of $100$. Let $m=100k$, where $k$ is a positive integer.

The equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ then becomes $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=k$.

The number of distinct solutions of this equation depends on the value of $k$. Specifically, the equation has $4$ distinct solutions when $k=1$.

Therefore, the only positive integer $m$ for which the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has $4$ distinct solutions is $m=100$.

So the number of positive integers $m$ for which the equation has $4$ distinct solutions is $1$. The answer is: $1$

Approach:



The equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has 4 distinct solutions if and only if $\frac{m}{100}$ is strictly between 1 and 2. This is because the function $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert$ has a graph that is a series of "V"s, with the "bottom" of each "V" being $\frac{m}{100}$ units above the x-axis. If $\frac{m}{100}$ is less than 1, there will be no solutions. If $\frac{m}{100}$ is equal to 1 or more than 2, there will be fewer than 4 solutions. If $\frac{m}{100}$ is strictly between 1 and 2, there will be 4 distinct solutions.

So we need to find the number of positive integers $m$ such that $1 < \frac{m}{100} < 2$. Multiplying all parts of the inequality by 100 gives $100 < m < 200$. The number of positive integers in this range is $200 - 100 - 1 = 99$.

So the number of positive integers $m$ for which the equation has 4 distinct solutions is 99. The answer is: $99$

Approach:



The equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has 4 distinct solutions, we need to find the values of $m$ such that the right side of the equation is a positive number less than 2.

Let's denote $\frac{m}{100}$ as $k$. So we need to find the values of $k$ such that $0<k<2$. This means $0<\frac{m}{100}<2$, and multiplying all sides of the inequality by 100, we get $0<m<200$.

Now, we need to find the number of positive integers $m$ in this range. The positive integers from 1 to 199 are the possible values of $m$. So the number of such integers is 199.

Therefore, there are 199 positive integers $m$ for which the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has 4 distinct solutions. The answer is: $199$

Approach:


The equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has $4$ distinct solutions, we need to find the values of $m$ such that the right side of the equation $\frac{m}{100}$ is a positive number and it can be split into two cases:

Case 1: $\vert x-1 \vert -2 = \frac{m}{100}$ or $\vert x-1 \vert -2 = -\frac{m}{100}$.

Case 2: $\vert x-1 \vert +2 = \frac{m}{100}$ or $\vert x-1 \vert +2 = -\frac{m}{100}$.

We need to solve these equations and find the values of $m$ that give us $4$ distinct solutions.

Solution:

For Case 1, we have:

1. $\vert x-1 \vert -2 = \frac{m}{100}$, which gives $\vert x-1 \vert = \frac{m}{100} + 2$. This equation has two sub-cases:

   a. $x-1 = \frac{m}{100} + 2$ which gives $x = \frac{m}{100} + 3$.
   
   b. $-(x-1) = \frac{m}{100} + 2$ which gives $x = 1 - \frac{m}{100} - 2 = - \frac{m}{100} - 1$.

2. $\vert x-1 \vert -2 = -\frac{m}{100}$, which gives $\vert x-1 \vert = 2 - \frac{m}{100}$. This equation also has two sub-cases:

   a. $x-1 = 2 - \frac{m}{100}$ which gives $x = 3 - \frac{m}{100}$.
   
   b. $-(x-1) = 2 - \frac{m}{100}$ which gives $x = -1 + \frac{m}{100}$.

For Case 2, we have:

1. $\vert x-1 \vert +2 = \frac{m}{100}$, which gives $\vert x-1 \vert = \frac{m}{100} - 2$. This equation has two sub-cases:

   a. $x-1 = \frac{m}{100} - 2$ which gives $x = \frac{m}{100} - 1$.
   
   b. $-(x-1) = \frac{m}{100} - 2$ which gives $x = 1 - \frac{m}{100} + 2 = 3 - \frac{m}{100}$.

2. $\vert x-1 \vert +2 = -\frac{m}{100}$, which gives $\vert x-1 \vert = -2 - \frac{m}{100}$. But this equation has no solution because the absolute value of a number cannot be negative.

To have $4$ distinct solutions, we need to have the following conditions:

1. $\frac{m}{100} + 3 > 0$, which gives $m > -300$.
2. $- \frac{m}{100} - 1 > 0$, which gives $m < -100$.
3. $3 - \frac{m}{100} > 0$, which gives $m < 300$.
4. $-1 + \frac{m}{100} > 0$, which gives $m > 100$.

The intersection of all these conditions is $100 < m < 300$. The positive integers in this range are from $101$ to $299$, and the number of such integers is $199$.

So, there are $199$ positive integers $m$ such that the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has $4$ distinct solutions. The answer is: $199$

Approach:



We know that the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has 4 distinct solutions. The right side of the equation is a positive number, so the absolute value on the left must be equal to a positive number. This means that $\frac{m}{100}$ must be less than 2, because if it were equal to or greater than 2, the absolute value on the left would always be greater than or equal to 2, and the equation would have either 2 or 0 solutions. So we have $\frac{m}{100} < 2$, which gives $m < 200$.

Now we need to find how many positive integers $m$ satisfy this condition and also make the equation have 4 distinct solutions.

To do this, we can analyze the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ for different values of $\frac{m}{100}$.

If $\frac{m}{100} = 1$, the equation becomes $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=1$, which has 4 distinct solutions.

If $\frac{m}{100} = 0.5$, the equation becomes $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=0.5$, which also has 4 distinct solutions.

If $\frac{m}{100}$ is less than 0.5, the equation has either 2 or 0 solutions.

So the values of $m$ that work are those for which $\frac{m}{100}$ is either 1 or 0.5. This gives $m$ as either 100 or 50.

Therefore, there are 2 positive integers $m$ that satisfy the conditions. The answer is: $2$

Approach:



We start by analyzing the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$.

This equation will have 4 distinct solutions if and only if $\frac{m}{100} = 1$. This is because the function $f(x) = \vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert$ will take the value 1 exactly once between its minimum and maximum values. The minimum value of $f(x)$ is 0 and the maximum value is 4.

So we have $\frac{m}{100} = 1$, which gives $m = 100$.

Therefore, there is only one positive integer $m$ for which the equation has 4 distinct solutions, namely $m = 100$.
The answer is: 1

Assistant:

Approach:



The equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has 4 distinct solutions means that the right side of the equation, $\frac{m}{100}$, is equal to the distance between two "jumps" in the graph of $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert$. The graph of $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert$ has two "jumps" at $x=1\pm2$, which are at $x=-1$ and $x=3$. The distance between these two jumps is $3 - (-1) = 4$. So, $\frac{m}{100} = 2$. Solving for $m$ gives $m = 200$.

So, there is only one positive integer $m$ for which the equation has 4 distinct solutions, and that is $m=200$. The answer is: $1$
