Solve the following problem with a Python Script (positive numerical answer):
"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"
Write comments to indicate the steps you take. Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Assistant:

Approach:



The expression is equal to zero when either $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$, which implies $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ or $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. This gives us the lines $x + y = 10$, $x + y = -10$, $x - y = 10$, and $x - y = -10$. These lines form a rectangle with vertices at $(0, 10)$, $(10, 0)$, $(0, -10)$, and $(-10, 0)$.

The length of the rectangle is $20$ and the width is $20$, so the area of the rectangle is $20 \times 20 = 400$. Therefore, the area of the convex polygon is 400.

Solution:
The area of the convex polygon is 400.
The answer is: $400$

Approach:



The equation in the problem involves absolute values, which makes it a bit difficult to solve directly. However, we can consider the cases when the two factors are separately equal to zero.

For the first factor to be zero, we have:

$\vert x + y \vert - 10 = 0 \implies \vert x + y \vert = 10$,
$\vert x - y \vert - 10 = 0 \implies \vert x - y \vert = 10$.

This implies that $-10 \leq x + y \leq 10$ and $-10 \leq x - y \leq 10$.

Similarly, for the second factor to be zero, we have:

$\vert x \vert - 8 = 0 \implies \vert x \vert = 8 \implies -8 \leq x \leq 8$,
$\vert y \vert - 8 = 0 \implies \vert y \vert = 8 \implies -8 \leq y \leq 8$.

So the points $(x, y)$ that satisfy the equation lie within a square with side length 16 (since $-8 \leq x, y \leq 8$). The square is centered at the origin and its sides are parallel to the axes.

The intersections of the lines defined by $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$ with the square form a square of side length 8.

The area of the larger square is $16^2 = 256$, and the area of the smaller square is $8^2 = 64$. Therefore, the area of the convex polygon is the difference of these two areas: $256 - 64 = 192$.

So the area of the convex polygon is 192.
The answer is: $192$

Approach:

 The equation $AB = 0$ is equivalent to $A = 0$ or $B = 0$. Therefore, the given equation is equivalent to $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$. The first equation implies $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$, which represent a square with side length 10. The second equation implies $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$, which represent a square with side length 16. The area of the convex polygon is the sum of the areas of these two squares.

```python


INTERMEDIATE OUT :

def area_of_polygon():
    # Calculate the area of the square with side length 10
    area1 = 10 ** 2

    # Calculate the area of the square with side length 16
    area2 = 16 ** 2

    # Calculate the total area
    total_area = area1 + area2

    return total_area

result = area_of_polygon()
print(result)
```

CODE RESULTS 356

INTERMEDIATE OUT :
```output
356
```
The area of the convex polygon is 356 square units. The answer is: $356$

Approach:


The equation $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + (\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ implies that $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$.
This means that $x + y = \pm 10$ and $x - y = \pm 10$.
Solving these equations, we get the points $(5,5), (5,-5), (-5,5), (-5,-5)$.

Similarly, the equation $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + (\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ implies that $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$.
This means that $x = \pm 8$ and $y = \pm 8$.
Solving these equations, we get the points $(8,0), (0,8), (-8,0), (0,-8)$.

Plotting these points on a coordinate plane, we find that they form a square with side length 10.
The area of this square is $10^2 = 100$.
The answer is: $100$

Solve the following problem with a Python Script (positive numerical answer):

Approach:

 The equation given is a product of two expressions equal to zero. This means that either one of the expressions is zero or both are zero. The expressions are $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2$ and $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + (\vert y \vert - 8)^2$. For the product to be zero, either one of these expressions must be zero.

1. If $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$, then $\vert x + y \vert = 10$, which means $x + y = \pm 10$. This forms two lines $x + y = 10$ and $x + y = -10$.

2. If $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + (\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$, then $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$, which means $x = \pm 8$ and $y = \pm 8$. This forms four lines $x = 8$, $x = -8$, $y = 8$, and $y = -8$.

The region enclosed by these lines is a rectangle with length 16 and width 20. To find the area, multiply the length and width: $16 \times 20 = 320$. So, the area of the convex polygon is 320 square units.

The answer is: $320$

Solve the following problem with a Python Script (positive numerical answer):
"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"
Write comments to indicate the steps you take. Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Assistant:

Approach:

 The equation $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ is satisfied only when either of the factors is zero.

Let's consider each factor:

1. $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0 \Rightarrow \vert x + y \vert = 10 \Rightarrow x + y = \pm 10$.
2. $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0 \Rightarrow \vert x - y \vert = 10 \Rightarrow x - y = \pm 10$.
3. $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0 \Rightarrow \vert x \vert = 8 \Rightarrow x = \pm 8$.
4. $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0 \Rightarrow \vert y \vert = 8 \Rightarrow y = \pm 8$.

The solutions to these equations give us the vertices of the polygon: $(8, 8), (8, -8), (-8, 8),$ and $(-8, -8)$. These points form a square with side length 16. The area of a square is given by the square of the length of its side, so the area of this square is $16^2 = 256$. The answer is: $256$

"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"

Approach:


The equation is given as $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$.
This equation is satisfied if either of the two factors is zero.
For the first factor to be zero, we have $\vert x + y \vert - 10 = 0$ and $\vert x - y \vert - 10 = 0$, which implies $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$.
For the second factor to be zero, we have $\vert x \vert - 8 = 0$ and $\vert y \vert - 8 = 0$, which implies $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$.
The solutions from the first factor give a square with side length $20$ (from $-10$ to $10$ in each direction), and the solutions from the second factor give a square with side length $16$ (from $-8$ to $8$ in each direction).
The area of the first square is $20^2 = 400$, and the area of the second square is $16^2 = 256$.
Therefore, the area of the convex polygon is the sum of the areas of these two squares, which is $400 + 256 = 656$. The answer is: $656$

Assistant:

Approach:


The equation $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + (\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ implies that $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. These conditions imply that $x$ and $y$ must be both positive or both negative. Similarly, the equation $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + (\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ implies that $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$, which means that $x$ and $y$ must be in the range $-8 \leq x, y \leq 8$.
Therefore, the points $(x, y)$ that satisfy the given equation lie on the square with vertices at $(\pm 8, \pm 8)$. The area of this square is $8^2 \times 4 = 256$.
The answer is: $256$.

Approach:


The equation is given as $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$. For the product of two terms to be zero, either of the terms must be zero. Therefore, either of the following must be true:
1. $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$
2. $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$
From equation 2, we can conclude that $x = \pm 8$ and $y = \pm 8$. This means the polygon is a square with side length of 16 units. The area of a square is given by the square of the length of its side. Therefore, the area of the square is $16^2 = 256$ square units.

The answer is: $\boxed{256}$.

Assistant:

Approach:


The given equation is a product of two terms equal to zero, which means either the first term is zero or the second term is zero.
Let's consider each term separately:

1. $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0 \Rightarrow \vert x + y \vert = 10 \Rightarrow x + y = \pm 10$.
2. $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0 \Rightarrow \vert x - y \vert = 10 \Rightarrow x - y = \pm 10$.
3. $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0 \Rightarrow \vert x \vert = 8 \Rightarrow x = \pm 8$.
4. $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0 \Rightarrow \vert y \vert = 8 \Rightarrow y = \pm 8$.

These equations represent lines in the xy-plane. The intersections of these lines form a square with side length 10. The area of the square is therefore $10^2 = 100$.

So, the area of the convex polygon enclosed by the points satisfying the given equation is 100.

The answer is: $100$

Write comments to indicate the steps you take. Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Assistant:

Approach:

 The equation is satisfied only when both of the terms are equal to zero. This gives us two pairs of equations:

1) $|x+y| - 10 = 0$ and $|x - y| - 10 = 0$
2) $|x| - 8 = 0$ and $|y| - 8 = 0$

From the first pair of equations, we get:

1) $|x+y| = 10$ and $|x - y| = 10$
2) $|x| = 8$ and $|y| = 8$

From the second pair of equations, we get:

1) $x = -8, 8$ and $y = -8, 8$

The points satisfying the first pair of equations are all the points in a square of side length 16 (from the properties of absolute values), which is centered at the origin.

The points satisfying the second pair of equations are all the points in a square of side length 16, which is centered at $(0,0)$.

So the solution to the problem is the intersection of these two squares, which is also a square of side length 16.

The area of a square with side length $s$ is $s^2$, so the area of this square is $16^2 = 256$.

The answer is: $256$
