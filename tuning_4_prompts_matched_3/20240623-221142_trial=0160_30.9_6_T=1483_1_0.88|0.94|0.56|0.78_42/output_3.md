Interesting, let's analyze step by step:



The given equation is a product of two terms equal to zero, thus either of the terms must be zero. This implies that either of the following two sets of equations must be true:

1. $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ and $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$
2. $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ and $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$

From the first set of equations, we have:

$\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$

From the second set of equations, we have:

$\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$

Solving these equations, we find that the points that satisfy either of these sets of equations are:

1. For the first set of equations, the points are: $(x, y) = (5, 5), (-5, -5), (5, -5), (-5, 5)$
2. For the second set of equations, the points are: $(x, y) = (8, 0), (0, 8), (-8, 0), (0, -8)$

These points form a square with side length 10, so the area of the square is $10^2 = 100$. Since the area must be a positive integer, the area of the convex polygon is 100. The answer is: $100$

Interesting, let's analyze step by step:



The equation is given by 
\[((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0\]
This equation is satisfied if either of the two factors is zero.

This means that either $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$.

Solving these equations gives us the following:

1. If $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$, then $\vert x + y \vert = 10$, which implies that $x + y = 10$ or $x + y = -10$.
2. If $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$, then $\vert x - y \vert = 10$, which implies that $x - y = 10$ or $x - y = -10$.
3. If $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$, then $\vert x \vert = 8$, which implies that $x = 8$ or $x = -8$.
4. If $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$, then $\vert y \vert = 8$, which implies that $y = 8$ or $y = -8$.

Combining these results, we find that the points $(x, y)$ that satisfy the equation are:

$(8, 8)$, $(8, -8)$, $(-8, 8)$, $(-8, -8)$, $(10, 0)$, $(0, 10)$, $(-10, 0)$, $(0, -10)$.

These points form a square with side length 16. The area of this square is $16^2 = 256$. So the area of the convex polygon is 256.

Since 256 is a positive integer, the answer is indeed $\boxed{256}$. To get the answer, we just need to calculate the area of the square formed by the points that satisfy the given equation. The side length of the square is 16 (since the points are 8 units away from the origin in both x and y directions), so the area of the square is $16^2 = 256$. The answer is: $256$

Interesting, let's analyze step by step:



1. The expression $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2)$ is equal to zero if and only if both of its factors are equal to zero. 

2. Each factor is a sum of squares, so it is equal to zero if and only if each square is equal to zero.

3. For the first factor, $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ implies $\vert x + y \vert = 10$. Similarly, $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. This means $x + y = \pm 10$ and $x - y = \pm 10$. Solving these equations gives $x = \pm 5, y = \pm 5$.

4. For the second factor, $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ implies $\vert x \vert = 8$. Similarly, $\vert y \vert = 8$. This means $x = \pm 8$ and $y = \pm 8$.

5. Therefore, the points satisfying the equation are $(\pm 5, \pm 5)$ and $(\pm 8, \pm 8)$.

6. These points form a square with side length 10. The area of the square is $10^2 = 100$.

Now let's verify that the area is a positive integer:

```python


INTERMEDIATE OUT :

from sympy import symbols, Rational, simplify

def area_of_square():
    """The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"""
    # Side length of the square
    side_length = 10

    # Area of the square
    area = side_length**2

    return area

result = area_of_square()
print(result)
```

CODE RESULTS 100

INTERMEDIATE OUT :

The area of the convex polygon is 100, which is a positive integer. The answer is $\boxed{100}$.

Interesting, let's analyze step by step:


The product of two numbers is zero if and only if at least one of them is zero. So the equation $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ is satisfied if either of the following two conditions is true:

1. $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$
2. $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$

For the first condition to be true, we must have $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. This implies that $x = \pm 10$ and $y = \pm 10$. These four points form a square with side length 20 and area $400$.

For the second condition to be true, we must have $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$. This implies that $x = \pm 8$ and $y = \pm 8$. These four points form a square with side length 16 and area $256$.

Adding the two areas together, the total area of the convex polygon is $400 + 256 = 656$.

Now let's verify if the answer is a positive integer: $656$ is a positive integer. Therefore, the area of the convex polygon is 656.
The answer is: $656$

Interesting, let's analyze step by step:



The given equation is a product of two terms equals to zero, this means that either the first term equals to zero or the second term equals to zero.

The first term is $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)$ and the second term is $((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2)$.

Setting each term to zero, we have:

1. $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0 \Rightarrow \vert x + y \vert = 10$.
2. $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0 \Rightarrow \vert x - y \vert = 10$.
3. $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0 \Rightarrow \vert x \vert = 8$.
4. $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0 \Rightarrow \vert y \vert = 8$.

From 3. and 4., we have $-8 \leq x \leq 8$ and $-8 \leq y \leq 8$.

From 1. and 2., we have $x + y = \pm 10$ and $x - y = \pm 10$.

Solving these equations, we get four pairs of $(x, y)$: $(5, 5)$, $(5, -5)$, $(-5, 5)$, and $(-5, -5)$.

The points $(5, 5)$, $(5, -5)$, $(-5, 5)$, and $(-5, -5)$ form a square with side length of 10 units. The area of this square is $10^2 = 100$ square units.

So, the area of the convex polygon is 100 square units. The answer is: $\boxed{100}$.
