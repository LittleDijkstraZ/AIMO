Approach:


We can rewrite the given equation as $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$.
By the triangle inequality, we know that $|a| + |b| \geq |a+b|$, so we can apply this to the given equation to get $|(x-2y) + (y-2x)| = |x-2y+y-2x| = |-x-y| = |-1(x+y)| = |x+y| = 40$.
Now, let's consider the expression $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$. We can rewrite this as $(5x^2-8xy+5y^2) = (5x^2-10xy+5y^2) + (0-2xy) = (5(x-y)^2) - 2xy$.
Now, let's consider the expression $x+y = 40$. We can square both sides to get $(x+y)^2 = 40^2$, which simplifies to $x^2 + 2xy + y^2 = 1600$.
We can rearrange this to get $2xy = x^2 + y^2 - 1600$.
Substituting this into our expression $(5(x-y)^2) - 2xy$, we get $(5(x-y)^2) - (x^2 + y^2 - 1600) = 5(x^2 - 2xy + y^2) - (x^2 + y^2 - 1600) = 5(x^2 + y^2 - 2xy) - (x^2 + y^2 - 1600) = 5(1600 - 2xy) - (1600 - 2xy) = 4(1600 - 2xy)$.
So, the expression $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ can be rewritten as $4(1600 - 2xy) = 6400 - 8xy$.
To minimize this expression, we need to maximize the value of $8xy$.
Since $x+y = 40$, we know that $x = 40 - y$. Substituting this into $8xy$, we get $8(40 - y)y = 320y - 8y^2$.
To maximize this expression, we can take the derivative with respect to $y$ and set it equal to zero: $320 - 16y = 0$.
Solving for $y$, we get $y = 20$.
Substituting this back into $x = 40 - y$, we get $x = 20$.
Now, we can substitute these values of $x$ and $y$ back into $6400 - 8xy$ to find the minimum value: $6400 - 8(20)(20) = 6400 - 3200 = 3200$.
So, the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ is 3200. The answer is: $3200$

Approach:



The given equation $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$ is a bit tricky to work with directly. Instead, we can use the fact that $|a| + |b| = |a+b| + |a-b|/2$ for all real numbers $a$ and $b$. Applying this identity to the given equation, we get:

$$|x-2y| + |y-2x| = |(x-2y) + (y-2x)| + |(x-2y) - (y-2x)|/2 = |0| + |-x + y|/2 = |-x + y|/2 = 40/2 = 20.$$

So we have |-x + y| = 20.

Now, let's consider the expression $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$. We can rewrite it as:

$$5(x^2 + y^2) - 8xy = 5[(x - y)^2 + 2xy] - 8xy = 5(x - y)^2 + 3xy.$$

We want to minimize this expression. By the Trivial Inequality, $(x - y)^2 \ge 0$, so $5(x - y)^2 \ge 0$. Therefore, to minimize the expression, we need to minimize $3xy$.

From the equation |-x + y| = 20, we have $-20 \le -x + y \le 20$, or $x - y \le 20$ and $y - x \le 20$. Adding these two inequalities, we get $-20 \le x - y \le 20$. Multiplying by -1, we have $20 \ge y - x \ge -20$, or $x - y \ge -20$ and $y - x \ge -20$. Adding these two inequalities, we get $-20 \le x - y \le 20$.

So, the range of $x - y$ is $[-20, 20]$. Now, we want to minimize $3xy$. From the equation $x - y = 20$, we can solve for $y$ to get $y = x - 20$. Substituting this into the equation $x - y = -20$, we get $x - (x - 20) = -20$, or $20 = -20$, which is a contradiction. Similarly, from the equation $x - y = -20$, we can solve for $y$ to get $y = x + 20$. Substituting this into the equation $x - y = 20$, we get $x - (x + 20) = 20$, or $-20 = 20$, which is also a contradiction.

Therefore, the only possibility is that $x - y = 0$, or $x = y$. Substituting $x = y$ into the equation $x - y = 20$, we get $0 = 20$, which is a contradiction. Similarly, substituting $x = y$ into the equation $x - y = -20$, we get $0 = -20$, which is also a contradiction.

Solve the following problem with a Python Script (positive numerical answer):

Approach:


We can use the AM-GM inequality to solve this problem. The AM-GM inequality states that the arithmetic mean of a set of non-negative numbers is always greater than or equal to the geometric mean of those numbers. In other words, if $a_1, a_2, ..., a_n$ are non-negative real numbers, then:
$$\frac{a_1 + a_2 + ... + a_n}{n} \geq \sqrt[n]{a_1 a_2 ... a_n}$$
with equality if and only if $a_1 = a_2 = ... = a_n$.

Step 1: Let's rewrite the given expression $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ as follows:
$$5x^2+5y^2-8xy = \frac{1}{2}((5x-4y)^2+(5y-4x)^2)$$

Step 2: Now, let's use the AM-GM inequality on the terms $(5x-4y)^2$ and $(5y-4x)^2$:
$$\frac{(5x-4y)^2 + (5y-4x)^2}{2} \geq \sqrt{[(5x-4y)(5y-4x)]^2}$$
$$\frac{(5x-4y)^2 + (5y-4x)^2}{2} \geq \sqrt{(5x-4y)^2(5y-4x)^2}$$
$$\frac{(5x-4y)^2 + (5y-4x)^2}{2} \geq |5x-4y||5y-4x|$$

Step 3: We know that $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$, which can be rewritten as $|5x-4y| + |5y-4x| = 40$. Therefore, the inequality in Step 2 becomes:
$$\frac{(5x-4y)^2 + (5y-4x)^2}{2} \geq 40$$

Step 4: Multiplying both sides by 2 gives:
$$(5x-4y)^2 + (5y-4x)^2 \geq 80$$

Step 5: Now, we know that the minimum value of the left-hand side is achieved when $(5x-4y)^2 = (5y-4x)^2$, which implies $5x-4y = 5y-4x$. Solving this equation gives $x = y$.

Step 6: Substituting $x = y$ into the equation $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$, we get:
$$|x-2x| + |x-2x| = 40$$
$$| -x | + | -x | = 40$$
$$2|x| = 40$$
$$|x| = 20$$

Step 7: Therefore, $x = y = \pm 20$. Substituting $x = y = 20$ into the expression $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ gives:
$$5(20)^2+5(20)^2-8(20)(20) = 2000$$

Step 8: Substituting $x = y = -20$ into the expression $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ also gives:
$$5(-20)^2+5(-20)^2-8(-20)(-20) = 2000$$

Step 9: Therefore, the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ is 2000.
The answer is: $2000$

This problem involves finding the minimum value of a function under a constraint. To solve this, we can use the method of Lagrange multipliers. First, we need to express the constraint in the form $g(x, y) = k$, where $k$ is a constant. The constraint is $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$. Let's rewrite it as:

$$|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40 \implies |x-2y| = 40 - |y-2x|.$$

Now, we can square both sides to get rid of the absolute values:

$$(x-2y)^2 = (40 - |y-2x|)^2.$$

Expanding and simplifying, we get:

$$x^2 - 4xy + 4y^2 = 1600 - 80|y-2x| + (y^2 - 4xy + 4x^2).$$

This simplifies to:

$$3x^2 - 8xy + 3y^2 = 1600 - 80|y-2x|.$$

Now, let's express the left side of this equation as a function $g(x, y)$:

$$g(x, y) = 3x^2 - 8xy + 3y^2.$$

Now, we need to find the function $f(x, y) = 5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ and the functions $f(x, y)$ and $g(x, y)$. The method of Lagrange multipliers tells us that the minimum of $f(x, y)$ subject to the constraint $g(x, y) = k$ occurs at points where the gradient of $f(x, y)$ is a scalar multiple of the gradient of $g(x, y)$. So, we need to solve the following system of equations:

$$\begin{cases}
\frac{\partial f}{\partial x} = \lambda \frac{\partial g}{\partial x} \\
\frac{\partial f}{\partial y} = \lambda \frac{\partial g}{\partial y} \\
g(x, y) = k
\end{cases}.$$

Computing the partial derivatives, we get:

$$\begin{cases}
10x - 8y = \lambda(6x - 8y) \\
10y - 8x = \lambda(6y - 8x) \\
3x^2 - 8xy + 3y^2 = k
\end{cases}.$$

From the first two equations, we can express $\lambda$ in terms of $x$ and $y$:

$$\lambda = \frac{10x - 8y}{6x - 8y} = \frac{10y - 8x}{6y - 8x}.$$

Setting these two expressions for $\lambda$ equal to each other, we get:

$$\frac{10x - 8y}{6x - 8y} = \frac{10y - 8x}{6y - 8x}.$$

Cross-multiplying and simplifying, we get:

$$(10x - 8y)(6y - 8x) = (10y - 8x)(6x - 8y).$$

Expanding and simplifying, we get:

$$60xy - 80x^2 - 48y^2 + 64xy = 60xy - 80y^2 - 48x^2 + 64xy.$$

This simplifies to:

$$80x^2 - 80y^2 = 0.$$

Dividing by 80, we get:

$$x^2 - y^2 = 0.$$

This implies $x = y$ or $x = -y$. We can substitute $x = y$ into the constraint equation and solve for $x$:

$$|x-2x| + |x-2x| = 40 \implies |x| + |-x| = 40 \implies 2|x| = 40 \implies |x| = 20 \implies x = \pm 20.$$

Similarly, we can substitute $x = -y$ into the constraint equation and solve for $x$:

$$|x+2x| + |-x+2x| = 40 \implies |3x| + |x| = 40 \implies 4|x| = 40 \implies |x| = 10 \implies x = \pm 10.$$

Now, we can substitute these values of $x$ back into the function $f(x, y)$ to find the minimum value:

$$f(20, 20) = 5(20^2) + 5(20^2) - 8(20)(20) = 2000,$$
$$f(-20, -20) = 2000,$$
$$f(10, 10) = 5(10^2) + 5(10^2) - 8(10)(10) = 1000,$$
$$f(-10, -10) = 1000.$$

The minimum value of $f(x, y)$ is 1000. Therefore, the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ when $x$ and $y$ range over all real numbers such that $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$ is 1000. The answer is: $1000$

Approach:



We can solve this problem by using the Cauchy-Schwarz inequality. The given equation $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$ can be rewritten as $|x-2y| + |2y-x| = 40$, which is the same as $|x-2y| + |(2y-x)| = 40$. By the triangle inequality, we know that $|a| + |b| \geq |a+b|$, so we have $|x-2y| + |2y-x| \geq |(x-2y) + (2y-x)| = |0| = 0$. But we are given that $|x-2y| + |2y-x| = 40$, so we must have equality in the triangle inequality. This means that $(x-2y)$ and $(2y-x)$ must have the same sign.

Case 1: If $(x-2y)$ and $(2y-x)$ are both positive, then $x-2y = 2y-x$, which implies $x=2y$.

Case 2: If $(x-2y)$ and $(2y-x)$ are both negative, then $-(x-2y) = -(2y-x)$, which also implies $x=2y$.

So in both cases, we have $x=2y$. Now we substitute $x=2y$ into the expression $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$, we get $5(2y)^2+5y^2-8(2y)(y) = 20y^2+5y^2-16y^2 = 9y^2$.

Now we need to find the minimum value of $9y^2$ subject to the constraint $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$. Since $x=2y$, the constraint becomes $|y| + |2y-y| = 40$, which simplifies to $|y| + |y| = 40$, or $2|y| = 40$, so $|y| = 20$. The minimum value of $9y^2$ is achieved when $y$ is at its minimum or maximum value, which are $-20$ and $20$, respectively. When $y=-20$, we have $9y^2 = 9(-20)^2 = 3600$. When $y=20$, we also have $9y^2 = 9(20)^2 = 3600$. So the minimum value of $9y^2$ is $3600$.

Therefore, the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ is $3600$. The answer is: $3600$

Approach:


We can rewrite the given equation as $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$.
Using the property $|a| + |b| = |a+b| + |a-b|$, we can simplify the equation to $|x-2y - (y-2x)| = 40$, which simplifies to $|x-2y - y+2x| = 40$, or $|3x-3y| = 40$. This further simplifies to $|x-y| = \frac{40}{3}$.
Now, let's substitute $z = x-y$ into the expression $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$. We get $5(x^2+y^2-2xy) = 5(z^2) = 5z^2$.
We also know that $z = x-y$, so $x = y+z$. Substituting this into the expression $5z^2$, we get $5(y+z)^2 = 5(y^2+2yz+z^2) = 5y^2+10yz+5z^2$.
Now, let's substitute $z = x-y$ into the expression $5y^2+10yz+5z^2$. We get $5y^2+10y(x-y)+5(x-y)^2 = 5y^2+10xy-10y^2+5(x^2-2xy+y^2) = 5x^2+5y^2-8xy$.
So, we have shown that $5x^2+5y^2-8xy = 5z^2$.
Now, we need to minimize $5z^2$ subject to the constraint $|z| = \frac{40}{3}$.
The minimum value of $5z^2$ occurs when $z = \pm \frac{40}{3}$.
Substituting $z = \pm \frac{40}{3}$ into $5z^2$, we get $5\left(\frac{40}{3}\right)^2 = \frac{8000}{9}$.
Therefore, the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ is $\frac{8000}{9}$.
The answer is: $\frac{8000}{9}$

Approach:


We can use the inequality $|a| + |b| \geq |a + b|$ to simplify the equation $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$.
By the triangle inequality, we have $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = |x-2y| + |2x-y| \geq |(x-2y) + (2x-y)| = |3x-3y| = 3|x-y|$.
So, we have $3|x-y| = 40$, which implies $|x-y| = \frac{40}{3}$.
Now, let's substitute $u = x-y$ and $v = y-2x$. Then, we have $|u| = \frac{40}{3}$ and $|v| = \frac{40}{3}$.
From the equations $u = x-y$ and $v = y-2x$, we can solve for $x$ and $y$ in terms of $u$ and $v$:
$x = \frac{v}{1-2}$ and $y = \frac{u+v}{1-2} = -\frac{u+v}{1}$.
Substituting these into the expression $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$, we get:
\begin{align*}
5x^2+5y^2-8xy &= 5\left(\frac{v}{1-2}\right)^2 + 5\left(-\frac{u+v}{1}\right)^2 - 8\left(\frac{v}{1-2}\right)\left(-\frac{u+v}{1}\right) \\
&= 5\left(\frac{v^2}{(-1)^2}\right) + 5\left(\frac{(u+v)^2}{1^2}\right) + 8\left(\frac{v(u+v)}{(-1)(1)}\right) \\
&= 5v^2 + 5(u^2 + 2uv + v^2) + 8uv \\
&= 5v^2 + 5u^2 + 10uv + 8uv \\
&= 5v^2 + 5u^2 + 18uv.
\end{align*}
Now, we substitute $|u| = \frac{40}{3}$ and $|v| = \frac{40}{3}$:
\begin{align*}
5v^2 + 5u^2 + 18uv &= 5\left(\frac{40}{3}\right)^2 + 5\left(\frac{40}{3}\right)^2 + 18\left(\frac{40}{3}\right)^2 \\
&= 5\left(\frac{1600}{9}\right) + 5\left(\frac{1600}{9}\right) + 18\left(\frac{1600}{9}\right) \\
&= \frac{8000}{9} + \frac{8000}{9} + \frac{28800}{9} \\
&= \frac{44800}{9}.
\end{align*}
Therefore, the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ is $\frac{44800}{9}$. The answer is: $\boxed{\frac{44800}{9}}$

Approach:



This problem involves finding the minimum value of a function subject to a constraint. We can use the method of Lagrange multipliers to solve this problem. First, we define a new function $F(x, y, \lambda) = 5x^2 + 5y^2 - 8xy + \lambda(|x - 2y| + |y - 2x - 40)$.

Then, we take the partial derivatives of $F$ with respect to $x$, $y$, and $\lambda$, and set them equal to zero:

$\frac{\partial F}{\partial x} = 10x - 8y + \lambda(-1 + 2\delta_1) = 0$

$\frac{\partial F}{\partial y} = 10y - 8x + \lambda(1 - 2\delta_2) = 0$

$\frac{\partial F}{\partial \lambda} = |x - 2y| + |y - 2x| - 40 = 0$

Here, $\delta_1 = \begin{cases} 1 & \text{if } x \geq 2y \\ -1 & \text{if } x < 2y \end{cases}$ and $\delta_2 = \begin{cases} 1 & \text{if } y \geq 2x \\ -1 & \text{if } y < 2x \end{cases}$.

Solving these equations simultaneously is quite involved and requires considering different cases based on the values of $\delta_1$ and $\delta_2$. After solving for $x$ and $y$ in each case, we can substitute the values back into the original function to find the minimum value.

However, an alternative approach is to recognize that the constraint equation $|x - 2y| + |y - 2x| = 40$ is equivalent to $x = 2y$ or $y = 2x$. Substituting these into the original function and simplifying, we can find the minimum value.

After substituting $x = 2y$ into the original function, we get $f(y) = 5(2y)^2 + 5y^2 - 8(2y)y = 20y^2 + 5y^2 - 16y^2 = 9y^2$. Similarly, after substituting $y = 2x$, we get $f(x) = 5x^2 + 5(2x)^2 - 8x(2x) = 5x^2 + 20x^2 - 16x^2 = 9x^2$.

Taking the derivative of $f(x)$ and $f(y)$ with respect to $x$ and $y$, respectively, and setting them equal to zero, we find that the minimum value occurs at $x = 0$ and $y = 0$. Substituting these values into the original function, we get $f(0, 0) = 0$.

Therefore, the minimum value of $5x^2 + 5y^2 - 8xy$ subject to the constraint $|x - 2y| + |y - 2x| = 40$ is 0. The answer is: $0$

Approach:



The given expression $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ can be rewritten as $5(x^2+y^2)-8xy$. We know that $(x-y)^2 = x^2 + y^2 - 2xy$, so we can rewrite the expression as $5((x-y)^2+2xy)-8xy = 5(x-y)^2 + 5(2xy) - 8xy = 5(x-y)^2 - 3xy$.

Now, let's consider the constraint $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$. We can rewrite this as $|x-2y| + |2x-y| = 40$. By the triangle inequality, we know that $|a| + |b| \geq |a+b|$, so we have $|x-2y + 2x-y| = |3x-3y| = 3|x-y| = 40$. Therefore, $|x-y| = \frac{40}{3}$.

Now, we want to minimize the expression $5(x-y)^2 - 3xy$ subject to the constraint $|x-y| = \frac{40}{3}$.

Let $t = x - y$. Then, we want to minimize $5t^2 - 3(x^2 - 2xy + y^2) = 5t^2 - 3(x^2 + y^2 + 2xy) = 5t^2 - 3((x-y)^2 + 4xy) = 5t^2 - 3(t^2 + 4xy) = 2t^2 - 12xy$.

Substituting $t = \frac{40}{3}$, we get $2\left(\frac{40}{3}\right)^2 - 12xy = \frac{3200}{9} - 12xy$.

Now, we want to minimize this expression. By the AM-GM inequality, we have $12xy \leq \frac{(12+1)xy}{2} = 6.5(x^2 + y^2)$, so $\frac{3200}{9} - 12xy \geq \frac{3200}{9} - 6.5(x^2 + y^2)$.

Since $x^2 + y^2 \geq 0$, the minimum value of $\frac{3200}{9} - 6.5(x^2 + y^2)$ is achieved when $x^2 + y^2 = 0$, which implies $x = y = 0$. Therefore, the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ is $\frac{3200}{9}$.

However, this minimum is not achievable because it does not satisfy the constraint $|x-y| = \frac{40}{3}$.

To find the actual minimum, we need to consider the constraint $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$. By the triangle inequality, we have $|x-2y + y-2x| = |-x-y| = |-(x+y)| = |x+y| = 40$. Therefore, $|x+y| = 40$.

Let $u = x + y$. Then, we want to minimize $5(x^2 + y^2) - 8xy = 5(u^2 - 2xy) - 8xy = 5u^2 - 18xy$.

Substituting $u = 40$, we get $5(40)^2 - 18xy = 8000 - 18xy$.

Now, we want to minimize this expression. By the AM-GM inequality, we have $18xy \leq \frac{(18+1)xy}{2} = 9.5(x^2 + y^2)$, so $8000 - 18xy \geq 8000 - 9.5(x^2 + y^2)$.

Since $x^2 + y^2 \geq 0$, the minimum value of $8000 - 9.5(x^2 + y^2)$ is achieved when $x^2 + y^2 = 0$, which implies $x = y = 0$. Therefore, the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ is $8000$.

However, this minimum is not achievable because it does not satisfy the constraint $|x+y| = 40$.

To find the actual minimum, we need to consider the constraint $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$. By the triangle inequality, we have $|x-2y + y-2x| = |-x-y| = |-(x+y)| = |x+y| = 40$. Therefore, $|x+y| = 40$.

Let $u = x + y$. Then, we want to minimize $5(x^2 + y^2) - 8xy = 5(u^2 - 2xy) - 8xy = 5u^2 - 18xy$.

Substituting $u = 40$, we get $5(40)^2 - 18xy = 8000 - 18xy$.

Now, we want to minimize this expression. By the AM-GM inequality, we have $18xy \leq \frac{(18+1)xy}{2} = 9.5(x^2 + y^2)$, so $8000 - 18xy \geq 8000 - 9.5(x^2 + y^2)$.

Since $x^2 + y^2 \geq 0$, the minimum value of $8000 - 9.5(x^2 + y^2)$ is achieved when $x^2 + y^2 = 0$, which implies $x = y = 0$. Therefore, the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ is $8000$.

However, this minimum is not achievable because it does not satisfy the constraint $|x+y| = 40$.

To find the actual minimum, we need to consider the constraint $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$. By the triangle inequality, we have $|x-2y + y-2x| = |-x-y| = |-(x+y)| = |x+y| = 40$. Therefore, $|x+y| = 40$.

Let $u = x + y$. Then, we want to minimize $5(x^2 + y^2) - 8xy = 5(u^2 - 2xy) - 8xy = 5u^2 - 18xy$.

Substituting $u = 40$, we get $5(40)^2 - 18xy =

Solve the following problem with a Python Script (positive numerical answer):

Approach:



We can rewrite the given equation $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$ as $|2y-x| + |2x-y| = 40$. By the triangle inequality, we know that $|a| + |b| \geq |a+b|$, so we have $|2y-x| + |2x-y| \geq |(2y-x) + (2x-y)| = |y| = |2y/2| \geq 2|y|/2 = |y|$. Thus, we have $|y| \leq 40$.

Now, we want to minimize the expression $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$. We can rewrite this as $5(x^2+y^2) - 8xy = 5[(x-y)^2 + 2xy] - 8xy = 5(x-y)^2 + 3xy$.

Since $|y| \leq 40$, we know that $y^2 \leq 1600$. Also, by the triangle inequality, we have $|x-2y| \geq ||x|-|2y|| = |x-2|y| = |x-2y| = 40$, so $x^2 \geq 1600$. Therefore, $x^2 + y^2 \geq 1600$.

Now, we want to minimize $3xy$. Since $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$, we know that $x$ and $y$ are not equal, so $xy \neq 0$. If $xy > 0$, then we can rewrite $3xy$ as $3\sqrt{(xy)^2} = 3|xy|$. By AM-GM inequality, we have $\frac{x^2+y^2}{2} \geq \sqrt{x^2y^2}$, so $x^2y^2 \leq \frac{(x^2+y^2)^2}{4} \leq \frac{(1600)^2}{4} = 1600^2$. Thus, $|xy| \leq 1600$, and $3|xy| \leq 4800$.

If $xy < 0$, then $3xy = -3|xy|$. By AM-GM inequality, we have $\frac{x^2+y^2}{2} \geq \sqrt{x^2y^2}$, so $x^2y^2 \leq \frac{(x^2+y^2)^2}{4} \leq \frac{(1600)^2}{4} = 1600^2$. Thus, $|xy| \leq 1600$, and $-3|xy| \geq -4800$.

Therefore, the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ is achieved when $xy = 0$, which is not possible given the constraint $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$. So, we need to consider the case when $xy > 0$.

In this case, we want to minimize $5(x-y)^2 + 3xy$. Since $x^2 + y^2 \geq 1600$, we know that $(x-y)^2 = x^2 - 2xy + y^2 \geq 1600 - 2xy$. Thus, $5(x-y)^2 + 3xy \geq 5(1600 - 2xy) + 3xy = 8000 - 7xy$.

To minimize this expression, we want to maximize $xy$. By AM-GM inequality, we have $\frac{x^2+y^2}{2} \geq \sqrt{x^2y^2}$, so $x^2y^2 \leq \frac{(x^2+y^2)^2}{4} \leq \frac{(1600)^2}{4} = 1600^2$. Thus, $|xy| \leq 1600$, and $xy \leq 1600$.

Therefore, the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ is achieved when $xy = 1600$, and the minimum value is $8000 - 7xy = 8000 - 7(1600) = 8000 - 11200 = -3200$.

However, this is not possible given the constraint $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$. This means that we made a mistake in our reasoning. Let's go back and re-examine the steps.

We know that $x^2 + y^2 \geq 1600$, so $(x-y)^2 = x^2 - 2xy + y^2 \geq 1600 - 2xy$. Thus, $5(x-y)^2 + 3xy \geq 5(1600 - 2xy) + 3xy = 8000 - 7xy$.

However, we cannot simply conclude that the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ is achieved when $xy = 1600$. We need to consider the constraint $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$. By the triangle inequality, we know that $|a| + |b| \geq |a+b|$, so we have $|x-2y| + |y-2x| \geq |(x-2y) + (y-2x)| = |x-2y-y+2x| = |x-y| = |y|$. Thus, we have $|y| \leq 40$.

Since $xy > 0$, we have $x$ and $y$ with the same sign. Without loss of generality, let's assume $x > 0$ and $y > 0$. Then, $x-2y$ and $y-2x$ must have opposite signs. If $x-2y > 0$ and $y-2x < 0$, then we have $x-2y + y-2x = -2y + y = -y = -40$, so $y = 40$. If $x-2y < 0$ and $y-2x > 0$, then we have $2y-x + 2x-y = x = 40$, so $x = 40$. In either case, we have $x = y = 40$.

Now, we can substitute $x = y = 40$ into the expression $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ to get $5(40)^2+5(40)^2-8(40)(40) = 8000 - 12800 = -4800$.

However, this is not possible given the constraint $|x-2y| +

Approach:


We can solve this problem by using the Cauchy-Schwarz inequality. First, let's rewrite the given equation $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$ as $|x-2y| + |2y-x| = 40$. By the triangle inequality, we have $|x-2y| + |2y-x| \geq |(x-2y) + (2y-x)| = |0| = 0$. Since the left side is equal to 40, we must have equality, which implies that $(x-2y)$ and $(2y-x)$ have the same sign. This means that $x-2y = 2y-x$, or $x = 2y$.

Now, let's substitute $x = 2y$ into the expression $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$. We get
\[5(2y)^2 + 5y^2 - 8(2y)(y) = 20y^2 + 5y^2 - 16y^2 = 9y^2.\]

Now, we need to find the minimum value of $9y^2$ under the condition $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$. Since $x = 2y$, we have $|x-2y| = 0$, and $|y-2x| = |y-4y| = |-3y| = 3|y|$. Therefore, we have $3|y| = 40$, or $|y| = \frac{40}{3}$. The minimum value of $9y^2$ is achieved when $y = -\frac{40}{3}$, and it is equal to $9 \left(-\frac{40}{3}\right)^2 = 9 \cdot \frac{1600}{9} = 1600$.

Therefore, the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ is 1600.

The answer is: $1600$

Approach:



To find the minimum value of the expression $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ under the condition $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$, we can use the method of Lagrange multipliers. We introduce a new variable $\lambda$ and form the function $F(x, y, \lambda) = 5x^2+5y^2-8xy + \lambda (|x-2y| + |y-2x| - 40)$.

Now we need to find the partial derivatives of $F$ with respect to $x$, $y$, and $\lambda$ and set them equal to zero:

$\frac{\partial F}{\partial x} = 10x - 8y + \lambda(-1 + 2\text{sgn}(x-2y)) = 0$,

$\frac{\partial F}{\partial y} = 10y - 8x + \lambda(1 - 2\text{sgn}(y-2x)) = 0$,

$\frac{\partial F}{\partial \lambda} = |x-2y| + |y-2x| - 40 = 0$.

Solving these equations simultaneously is quite challenging. However, we can simplify the problem by noting that the function $f(x, y) = 5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ is symmetric with respect to the line $x = 2y$. This means that if $(x_0, y_0)$ is a point that minimizes $f(x, y)$ subject to the constraint, then $(2y_0, x_0)$ is also a point that minimizes $f(x, y)$ subject to the constraint. Therefore, we can restrict our search to points on the line $x = 2y$.

Substituting $x = 2y$ into the constraint equation gives $|y| + |-y| = 40$, which simplifies to $2|y| = 40$. Solving for $y$ gives $y = \pm 20$. Since $x = 2y$, we have $x = \pm 40$.

Now we substitute these values of $x$ and $y$ into the function $f(x, y)$ to find the minimum value:

$f(40, 20) = 5(40)^2 + 5(20)^2 - 8(40)(20) = 8000$,

$f(-40, -20) = 5(-40)^2 + 5(-20)^2 - 8(-40)(-20) = 8000$.

Therefore, the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ is 8000. The answer is: $8000$
