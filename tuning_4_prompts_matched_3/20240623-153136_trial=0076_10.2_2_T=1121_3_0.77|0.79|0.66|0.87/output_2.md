Approach:



The equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has 4 distinct solutions, we need to find the number of values of $m$ for which this is true.

Let's first consider the right side of the equation, $\frac{m}{100}$. Since $m$ is a positive integer, $\frac{m}{100}$ is a positive fraction.

Now, let's consider the left side of the equation, $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert$. This expression is equal to a positive fraction (specifically, $\frac{m}{100}$) and has 4 distinct solutions.

The expression $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert$ will be equal to a positive fraction (specifically, $\frac{m}{100}$) when the expression inside the absolute value, $\vert x-1 \vert -2$, is equal to $\frac{m}{100}$, $-\frac{m}{100}$, $\frac{m}{100}-2$, or $-\frac{m}{100}-2$.

This means that the value of $m$ must be such that the expressions $\frac{m}{100}$, $-\frac{m}{100}$, $\frac{m}{100}-2$, and $-\frac{m}{100}-2$ are all positive and result in 4 distinct solutions.

Let's analyze each of these cases:

1. $\vert x-1 \vert -2 = \frac{m}{100}$: This gives us two equations: $\vert x-1 \vert = \frac{m}{100} + 2$ and $\vert x-1 \vert = -\frac{m}{100} + 2$. The first equation has two solutions if $\frac{m}{100} + 2 > 0$, and the second equation has no solutions if $-\frac{m}{100} + 2 < 0$.

2. $\vert x-1 \vert -2 = -\frac{m}{100}$: This gives us two equations: $\vert x-1 \vert = \frac{m}{100} - 2$ and $\vert x-1 \vert = -\frac{m}{100} - 2$. The first equation has no solutions if $\frac{m}{100} - 2 < 0$, and the second equation has two solutions if $-\frac{m}{100} - 2 > 0$.

By analyzing these cases, we find that $100 < m < 200$ is the only range of values for $m$ that results in 4 distinct solutions.

Therefore, the number of positive integers $m$ that satisfy the equation is the number of integers in the range $100 < m < 200$, which is $100$.

The answer is: $100$

Approach:


The equation $| |x-1|-2|=\frac{m}{100}$ has four distinct solutions if and only if $\frac{m}{100}$ is strictly between $0$ and $2$. Therefore, $0<\frac{m}{100}<2$, which implies $0<m<200$.
The positive integers $m$ that satisfy this inequality are the integers from $1$ to $199$.

However, we need to find the number of these integers that make the equation have exactly four distinct solutions.
For each $m$, the equation $| |x-1|-2|=\frac{m}{100}$ can be rewritten as $|x-1|-2=\pm\frac{m}{100}$.
This gives us two equations: $|x-1|-2=\frac{m}{100}$ and $|x-1|-2=-\frac{m}{100}$.

The number of distinct solutions of each equation depends on the value of $\frac{m}{100}$.
For the first equation, $|x-1|-2=\frac{m}{100}$, it has four distinct solutions if and only if $\frac{m}{100}<2$.
For the second equation, $|x-1|-2=-\frac{m}{100}$, it has four distinct solutions if and only if $2-\frac{m}{100}>0$.

Combining these two conditions, we have $0<\frac{m}{100}<2-\frac{m}{100}$, which implies $0<\frac{m}{100}<1$. Therefore, $0<m<100$.
The positive integers $m$ that satisfy this inequality are the integers from $1$ to $99$.

So, the number of positive integers $m$ for which the equation has four distinct solutions is the number of integers from $1$ to $99$, which is $99$.

Therefore, the number of positive integers $m$ for which the equation has four distinct solutions is $99$. The answer is: $99$

Approach:


We know that the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has 4 distinct solutions. 
The right-hand side of the equation is always positive, so the left-hand side must also be positive. 
This means that $\vert x-1 \vert -2 > 0$, or $\vert x-1 \vert > 2$. 
This implies that $x-1 > 2$ or $x-1 < -2$, which gives us $x > 3$ or $x < -1$. 
So the solutions to the equation are in the intervals $(-\infty, -1)$ and $(3, \infty)$. 

Now let's consider the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$. 
The equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=0$ has two solutions: $x=3$ and $x=-1$. 
So the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ will have 4 distinct solutions if $\frac{m}{100} > 0$ and $\frac{m}{100} < \vert \vert 3-1 \vert -2 \vert = 0$. 
This means $0 < \frac{m}{100} < 2$, or $0 < m < 200$. 

The number of positive integers $m$ that satisfy this inequality is 199. 
However, we need to check if these values of $m$ indeed give 4 distinct solutions to the equation. 

For $m=1$, the equation becomes $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{1}{100}$, which has 4 distinct solutions. 
So the number of positive integers $m$ that give 4 distinct solutions is 1. 

Therefore, the number of positive integers $m$ for which the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has 4 distinct solutions is 1. The answer is: $1$

The equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has $4$ distinct solutions means that the right-hand side $\frac{m}{100}$ must be equal to $2$ (the value inside the absolute value on the left-hand side). Therefore, we have $m = 200$.

The answer is: $1$

Approach:


The equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has $4$ distinct solutions, we need to find the values of $m$ for which this is true.

We know that the absolute value function $\vert x \vert$ splits into two cases: $x$ if $x \geq 0$ and $-x$ if $x < 0$. Therefore, we can split the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ into two cases based on the value of $\vert x-1 \vert$.

Case 1: If $\vert x-1 \vert \geq 2$, then the equation becomes $\vert x-1 -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$, or $\vert x-3 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$. This splits into two sub-cases:
- If $x-3 \geq 0$, then $x-3=\frac{m}{100}$, or $x=3+\frac{m}{100}$.
- If $x-3 < 0$, then $-(x-3)=\frac{m}{100}$, or $x=3-\frac{m}{100}$.

Case 2: If $\vert x-1 \vert < 2$, then the equation becomes $\vert -(x-1) -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$, or $\vert -x+1-2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$, or $\vert -x-1 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$, or $\vert x+1 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$. This splits into two sub-cases:
- If $x+1 \geq 0$, then $x+1=\frac{m}{100}$, or $x=-1+\frac{m}{100}$.
- If $x+1 < 0$, then $-(x+1)=\frac{m}{100}$, or $x=-1-\frac{m}{100}$.

For each of the four sub-cases, we need to find the values of $m$ for which the resulting equation has $4$ distinct solutions. This is a bit involved and requires a bit of analysis. However, after analyzing the solutions, we find that the only value of $m$ that works is $m=200$.

Therefore, there is only one positive integer $m$ for which the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has $4$ distinct solutions, and that is $m=200$. The answer is: $1$

Approach:



The equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has 4 distinct solutions if and only if $\frac{m}{100} = 1$.

This is because the function $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert$ has a graph that is a series of "V"s, with each "V" corresponding to a value of $m$ that makes the equation have 4 distinct solutions.

The value of $m$ that makes $\frac{m}{100} = 1$ is $m = 100$.

Therefore, there is only 1 value of $m$ for which the equation has 4 distinct solutions. The answer is: $1$
