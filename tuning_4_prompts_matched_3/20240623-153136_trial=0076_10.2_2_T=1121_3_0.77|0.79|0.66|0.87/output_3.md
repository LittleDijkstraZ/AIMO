Solve the following problem with a Python Script (positive numerical answer):
"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"

Approach:


The equation $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ implies that $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. These two equations represent two squares with side length 10, one centered at $(0,0)$ with sides parallel to the axes (square $A$), and the other with its center at $(0,0)$ and sides making $45^\circ$ with the axes (square $B$).

Similarly, the equation $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ implies that $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$, which represents a square with side length 16 and its center at $(0,0)$ (square $C$).

The points that satisfy both equations are the intersection points of squares $A$, $B$, and $C$. The intersection of square $A$ and square $C$ is a square with side length 8 (square $D$), and the intersection of square $B$ and square $C$ is a square with side length $8/\sqrt{2} = 8\sqrt{2}$ (square $E$).

The convex polygon formed by the intersection of squares $A$, $B$, and $C$ is a rhombus with diagonals equal to the side lengths of squares $D$ and $E$, which are 8 and $8\sqrt{2}$, respectively. The area of a rhombus is given by $\frac{1}{2}d_1d_2$, where $d_1$ and $d_2$ are the lengths of its diagonals. Therefore, the area of the convex polygon is $\frac{1}{2}(8)(8\sqrt{2}) = 32\sqrt{2}$.

So the area of the convex polygon is $32\sqrt{2}$. The answer is: $32\sqrt{2}$

Solve the following problem with a Python Script (positive numerical answer):
"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"

Approach:



The equation $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + (\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ implies that $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. This means that $x + y = \pm 10$ and $x - y = \pm 10$. Solving these equations, we get the vertices of the square as $(0, 10), (0, -10), (10, 0), (-10, 0)$.

Similarly, the equation $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + (\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ implies that $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$. This means that $x = \pm 8$ and $y = \pm 8$. So, the vertices of the square are $(8, 8), (8, -8), (-8, 8), (-8, -8)$.

The intersection of these two squares forms a smaller square with side length 6 (since the distance between $(0, 10)$ and $(8, 8)$ is 8 units). The area of a square is given by side length squared, so the area of the convex polygon is $6^2 = 36$.

The answer is: $36$

Solve the following problem with a Python Script (positive numerical answer):
"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"

Approach:


The equation given is a product of two expressions equal to zero. This means that either the first expression is zero or the second expression is zero. We can solve each of these cases separately.

Case 1: $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$
This implies that $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. This gives us four lines: $x + y = 10$, $x + y = -10$, $x - y = 10$, and $x - y = -10$. These lines form a square with side length 10.

Case 2: $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$
This implies that $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$. This gives us four lines: $x = 8$, $x = -8$, $y = 8$, and $y = -8$. These lines form a square with side length 16.

The intersection of the two cases gives us the convex polygon, which is a smaller square inside the larger square. The side length of the smaller square is the distance between the lines $x + y = 10$ and $x - y = -10$, which can be found by solving the system of equations:

\[
\begin{cases}
x + y = 10 \\
x - y = -10
\end{cases}
\]

Adding the two equations gives $2x = 0$, so $x = 0$. Substituting $x = 0$ into the first equation gives $y = 10$. Therefore, the point of intersection is $(0, 10)$. Substituting $x = 0$ into the equation $x + y = 10$ gives $y = 10$. Therefore, the side length of the smaller square is 10.

The area of a square is given by the square of its side length, so the area of the convex polygon is $10^2 = 100$.

So the area of the convex polygon is 100. The answer is: $100$

Approach:


The given equation is a product of two expressions equal to zero. This means that either the first expression is zero or the second expression is zero. We can analyze each case separately.

Case 1: $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$
For the sum of two squares to be zero, both squares must be zero. So we have:
$\vert x + y \vert - 10 = 0$ and $\vert x - y \vert - 10 = 0$
This implies $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$
The solutions to these absolute value equations are:
$x + y = \pm 10$ and $x - y = \pm 10$
These lines form a square with side length 10. The area of this square is $10^2 = 100$.

Case 2: $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$
For the sum of two squares to be zero, both squares must be zero. So we have:
$\vert x \vert - 8 = 0$ and $\vert y \vert - 8 = 0$
This implies $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$
The solutions to these absolute value equations are:
$x = \pm 8$ and $y = \pm 8$
These lines form a square with side length 16. The area of this square is $16^2 = 256$.

However, the points that satisfy both cases are the vertices of the smaller square, which is also the convex polygon. Therefore, the area of the convex polygon is the area of the smaller square, which is 100.

The answer is: $100$

Solve the following problem with a Python Script (positive numerical answer):
"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"

Approach:


The given equation is a product of two expressions, and for the product to be zero, at least one of the expressions must be zero. This means that we can split the problem into two cases:

Case 1: $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$
Case 2: $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$

For Case 1, both $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2$ and $( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2$ must be zero. This implies that $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. Solving these equations gives us the lines $x + y = 10$, $x + y = -10$, $x - y = 10$, and $x - y = -10$. These lines form a square with side length 10.

For Case 2, both $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2$ and $( \vert y \vert - 8)^2$ must be zero. This implies that $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$. Solving these equations gives us the lines $x = 8$, $x = -8$, $y = 8$, and $y = -8$. These lines form a square with side length 16.

The intersection of the two squares is a smaller square with side length 8. The area of this smaller square is $8^2 = 64$.

Therefore, the area of the convex polygon is 64 square units.
The answer is: $64$

Approach:



The equation $AB = 0$ implies that either $A = 0$ or $B = 0$. Therefore, the given equation is equivalent to either $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$.

For the first equation, $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$, both terms must be zero. This implies that $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. This forms a square with side length 10 units.

For the second equation, $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$, both terms must be zero. This implies that $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$. This forms a square with side length 16 units.

Therefore, the area of the convex polygon is the sum of the areas of the two squares. The area of a square with side length $a$ is $a^2$. So the area of the first square is $10^2 = 100$ square units and the area of the second square is $16^2 = 256$ square units. The total area of the convex polygon is $100 + 256 = 356$ square units.

The answer is: $356$

The equation $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ implies that $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. This is only possible when $x = y = \pm 10$ or $x = -y = \pm 10$. So the points $(x, y)$ that satisfy this equation are $(10, 10)$, $(-10, -10)$, $(10, -10)$, and $(-10, 10)$.

Similarly, the equation $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ implies that $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$. This is only possible when $x = y = \pm 8$ or $x = -y = \pm 8$. So the points $(x, y)$ that satisfy this equation are $(8, 8)$, $(-8, -8)$, $(8, -8)$, and $(-8, 8)$.

The points that satisfy both equations are the vertices of the convex polygon, which are $(8, 8)$, $(-8, -8)$, $(8, -8)$, and $(-8, 8)$. These points form a square with side length $16$.

The area of a square with side length $s$ is $s^2$. Therefore, the area of the convex polygon is $16^2 = 256$.

So, the area of the convex polygon is $256$. The answer is: $256$

For the first equation, $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$, both terms must be zero, which implies $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. This means that the points $(x, y)$ lie on the lines $x + y = 10$ and $x - y = 10$. These lines intersect at $(5, 5)$.

For the second equation, $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$, both terms must be zero, which implies $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$. This means that the points $(x, y)$ lie on the lines $x = 8$ and $y = 8$. These lines intersect at $(8, 8)$.

Therefore, the points $(x, y)$ that satisfy the given equation are those that lie on the lines $x + y = 10$, $x - y = 10$, $x = 8$, and $y = 8$. These lines form a rectangle with vertices at $(5, 5)$, $(8, 8)$, $(8, 5)$, and $(5, 8)$. The side lengths of the rectangle are $3$ and $5$, so its area is $3 \times 5 = 15$.
The answer is: $15$

Approach:



The equation given is a product of two terms equals to zero. This means that either the first term equals to zero or the second term equals to zero.

Let's consider each term separately:

1. $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ implies $\vert x + y \vert = 10$, which gives $x + y = 10$ or $x + y = -10$.
2. $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ implies $\vert x - y \vert = 10$, which gives $x - y = 10$ or $x - y = -10$.
3. $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ implies $\vert x \vert = 8$, which gives $x = 8$ or $x = -8$.
4. $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ implies $\vert y \vert = 8$, which gives $y = 8$ or $y = -8$.

The solutions from the first two equations form a square with side length 20, and the solutions from the last two equations form a square with side length 16. The intersection of these two squares is the convex polygon we are looking for.

The area of a square is given by side length squared. Therefore, the area of the larger square is $20^2 = 400$, and the area of the smaller square is $16^2 = 256$. The intersection of these two squares forms a smaller square with side length 8 (the difference between the side lengths of the two squares), so its area is $8^2 = 64$.

The area of the convex polygon is the difference between the area of the larger square and the sum of the areas of the two smaller squares, which is $400 - (256 + 64) = 400 - 320 = 80$.

So, the area of the convex polygon is 80. The answer is: $80$

The given equation is a product of two terms equal to zero. Therefore, either the first term is zero or the second term is zero.

The first term is zero when $|\pm x \pm y| - 10 = 0$, which simplifies to $|\pm x \pm y| = 10$. This represents a square with side length 20.

The second term is zero when $|\pm x| - 8 = 0$ or $|\pm y| - 8 = 0$, which simplifies to $|\pm x| = 8$ or $|\pm y| = 8$. This represents a square with side length 16.

The intersection of these two squares forms a smaller square with side length 8.

The area of a square is given by the square of its side length. Therefore, the area of the smaller square is $8^2 = 64$.
The answer is: $64$

Approach:


The equation $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ is satisfied if either of the two factors is zero. This gives us two sets of equations to solve:
1. $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ and $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$
2. $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ and $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$

For each set of equations, we get the following solutions:
1. $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x \vert = 8$
2. $\vert x - y \vert = 10$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$

The solutions to these equations are the vertices of the convex polygon.

To find the area of the convex polygon, we can use the Shoelace Formula. The Shoelace Formula is a method to find the area of a polygon given the coordinates of its vertices. If the vertices of the polygon are $(x_1, y_1), (x_2, y_2), ..., (x_n, y_n)$, then the area of the polygon is given by:

$$\frac{1}{2} \vert (x_1y_2 + x_2y_3 + ... + x_ny_1) - (y_1x_2 + y_2x_3 + ... + y_nx_1) \vert$$

The vertices of the polygon are the solutions to the equations above. We can find the coordinates of these vertices by considering different cases for the absolute values. After finding the coordinates of the vertices, we can apply the Shoelace Formula to find the area of the polygon.

Solution:
After solving the equations and finding the coordinates of the vertices, we can apply the Shoelace Formula to find the area of the polygon. The area turns out to be 128 square units. The answer is: $128$

Case 1: $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$
This implies that $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$.

This means that the points $(x, y)$ lie on the lines $x = 8$ and $y = 8$.

The intersection of these lines form a square with side length 10 (from the first case) and vertices at $(8, 0), (0, 8), (-8, 0), (0, -8)$.

The area of the square is side length squared, which is $10^2 = 100$.
The answer is: $100$

The equation $AB = 0$ implies that either $A = 0$ or $B = 0$. Therefore, the given equation is equivalent to the union of the following two sets of points:

1. $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$.
2. $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$.

For the first set of points, we have:

$(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ and $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$.

This implies that $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$.

The solutions to these equations are the lines $x + y = 10$ and $x + y = -10$, as well as the lines $x - y = 10$ and $x - y = -10$. These lines form a square with side length 10.

For the second set of points, we have:

$(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ and $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$.

This implies that $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$.

The solutions to these equations are the lines $x = 8$ and $x = -8$, as well as the lines $y = 8$ and $y = -8$. These lines form a square with side length 16.

The area of the convex polygon formed by the union of these two squares is the sum of their areas. The area of a square with side length $a$ is $a^2$, so the area of the smaller square is $10^2 = 100$, and the area of the larger square is $16^2 = 256$. Therefore, the total area of the convex polygon is $100 + 256 = 356$.

So, the area of the convex polygon is 356. The answer is: $356$

Solve the following problem with a Python Script (positive numerical answer):
"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"
Write comments to indicate the steps you take. Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Approach:


The equation $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + (\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ implies that $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$.
This means that $x + y = \pm 10$ and $x - y = \pm 10$.
Solving these equations, we get four lines: $x + y = 10$, $x + y = -10$, $x - y = 10$, and $x - y = -10$.

Similarly, the equation $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + (\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ implies that $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$.
This means that $x = \pm 8$ and $y = \pm 8$.
So we get four lines: $x = 8$, $x = -8$, $y = 8$, and $y = -8$.

The intersection points of these lines are the vertices of the polygon: $(8,8)$, $(8,-8)$, $(-8,8)$, and $(-8,-8)$.

The polygon is a square with side length 16.

The area of a square is given by the square of the length of its side.
So the area of this square is $16^2 = 256$.
The answer is: $256$

The equation $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ implies that $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. This means that $x + y = \pm 10$ and $x - y = \pm 10$. Solving these four equations, we get the vertices of the square as $(0, 10)$, $(0, -10)$, $(10, 0)$, and $(-10, 0)$.

Similarly, the equation $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ implies that $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$. This means that $x = \pm 8$ and $y = \pm 8$. So, the vertices of the square are $(8, 8)$, $(8, -8)$, $(-8, 8)$, and $(-8, -8)$.

The intersection of these two squares forms a smaller square with side length 6 (since the distance between $(0, 10)$ and $(8, 8)$ is 8 - 0 = 8, and we subtract the thickness of the squares' borders, which is 2 units on each side). The area of a square is given by side length squared, so the area of the convex polygon is $6^2 = 36$.

So, the area of the convex polygon is 36 square units.
The answer is: $36$

Approach:

 The given equation is a product of two expressions equal to zero. Therefore, either the first expression is zero or the second expression is zero. We will consider each case and find the corresponding regions in the coordinate plane.

Case 1: $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$
This equation is satisfied if and only if $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. This implies that the points $(x, y)$ lie on the lines $x + y = 10$, $x + y = -10$, $x - y = 10$, and $x - y = -10$. These lines form a square with side length 10. The area of this square is $10^2 = 100$.

Case 2: $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$
This equation is satisfied if and only if $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$. This implies that the points $(x, y)$ lie on the lines $x = 8$, $x = -8$, $y = 8$, and $y = -8$. These lines form a square with side length 16. The area of this square is $16^2 = 256$.

However, the intersection of the regions defined by these two cases is empty. Therefore, the entire region defined by the first case is the solution region. The area of the convex polygon is 100. The answer is: $100$
