Approach:


We will try to find a pattern in the function $f(n)$ by plugging in some values and simplifying.
Let's start with $n=1$. From the second condition, we have $f(2)=2f(1)+1$.
Then from the first condition, we have $f(f(f(1)))=8(1)-7=1$.
So we have $f(f(f(1)))=1$.
Since $f(f(f(1)))=1$, we have $f(f(1))=1$.
Again using the second condition, we have $f(2)=2f(1)+1$.
And since $f(f(1))=1$, we have $f(1)=1$.
Now we can use the second condition again to find $f(2)$:
$f(2)=2f(1)+1=2(1)+1=3$.
We can continue this process to find $f(3)$:
$f(3)=f(2*1.5)=2f(1.5)+1=2f(f(1))+1=2f(1)+1=2(1)+1=3$.
And so on.
We can see that $f(n)=3$ for all positive integers $n$.
Now we can calculate $f(100)$:
$f(100)=3$.
The answer is: $3$

Solve the following problem with a Python Script (positive numerical answer):
"A function $f: \mathbb N \to \mathbb N$ satisfies the following two conditions for all positive integers $n$:$f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$ and $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$. Calculate $f(100)$."

Approach:


To find $f(100)$, we can use the second condition $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$. We can express $100$ as $2 \cdot 50$, so we can find $f(100)$ by first finding $f(50)$.
To find $f(50)$, we can again use the second condition. We can express $50$ as $2 \cdot 25$, so we can find $f(50)$ by first finding $f(25)$.
Continuing this process, we can keep breaking down the numbers until we reach a number for which we can directly apply the first condition $f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$.

Solution:

Let's start with $f(100)$:
\[f(100) = f(2 \cdot 50) = 2f(50) + 1.\]
To find $f(50)$, we use the same method:
\[f(50) = f(2 \cdot 25) = 2f(25) + 1.\]
To find $f(25)$, we can use the first condition:
\[f(f(f(25))) = 8 \cdot 25 - 7 = 200 - 7 = 193.\]
Since $f(f(f(25))) = 193$, we have $f(25) = f(f^{-1}(193))$. To find $f^{-1}(193)$, we can substitute $n = f^{-1}(193)$ into the first condition:
\[f(f(f(f^{-1}(193)))) = 8 \cdot f^{-1}(193) - 7 = 193.\]
Simplifying this equation, we get:
\[f(193) = 8f^{-1}(193) - 7.\]
But from the first condition, we know that $f(193) = 193$, so we have:
\[193 = 8f^{-1}(193) - 7.\]
Rearranging this equation, we get:
\[8f^{-1}(193) = 200.\]
Dividing both sides by 8, we get:
\[f^{-1}(193) = 25.\]
So, $f(25) = 25$.

Now we can substitute this into the equation for $f(50)$:
\[f(50) = 2 \cdot 25 + 1 = 51.\]
Finally, we can substitute this into the equation for $f(100)$:
\[f(100) = 2 \cdot 51 + 1 = 103.\]

So, $f(100) = 103$. The answer is: $103$

Approach:


We will try to find a pattern in the function $f$ by plugging in some values and see if we can find a relationship that helps us calculate $f(100)$.

Let's start by calculating $f(1)$ using the second condition:
$f(2*1) = 2f(1) + 1 \implies f(2) = 2f(1) + 1$.

Now, let's use the first condition to find $f(f(f(1)))$:
$f(f(f(1))) = 8*1 - 7 = -1$.

But since $f$ maps from $\mathbb{N}$ to $\mathbb{N}$, $f(f(f(1))) = -1$ doesn't make sense. Let's try another approach.

Let's plug in $n=2$ into the second condition:
$f(2*2) = 2f(2) + 1 \implies f(4) = 2f(2) + 1$.

Now, let's use the first condition to find $f(f(f(2)))$:
$f(f(f(2))) = 8*2 - 7 = 9$.

But we also know that $f(f(f(2))) = f(f(4))$ (since $f(2) = 2f(1) + 1$), and we can use the second condition again to find $f(4)$:
$f(4) = 2f(2) + 1$.

Now we have two equations:
1) $f(4) = 2f(2) + 1$
2) $f(f(f(2))) = 9$

From equation (2), we know that $f(f(4)) = 9$, and from equation (1), we can substitute $f(4)$ into equation (2) to get:
$f(9) = 9$.

Now, let's try to find $f(100)$ using the second condition:
$f(2*100) = 2f(100) + 1$.

We know that $f(200) = 2f(100) + 1$.

But we also know that $f(200) = f(f(f(100)))$ (from the first condition), and $f(f(f(100))) = 8*100 - 7 = 793$.

So we have:
$f(200) = 793$.

Substituting this into the equation $f(200) = 2f(100) + 1$, we get:
$793 = 2f(100) + 1$.

Solving for $f(100)$, we get:
$f(100) = \frac{793 - 1}{2} = 396$.

So, $f(100) = 396$. The answer is: $396$

Solve the following problem with a Python Script (positive numerical answer):
"A function $f: \mathbb N \to \mathbb N$ satisfies the following two conditions for all positive integers $n$:$f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$ and $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$. Calculate $f(100)$."

Approach:



To find $f(100)$, we need to first understand the properties of the function $f$. We are given two conditions:

1. $f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$
2. $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$

From the second condition, we can infer that $f$ is an increasing function. This is because for $n_1 < n_2$, we have $f(2n_1) < f(2n_2)$, which simplifies to $2f(n_1) + 1 < 2f(n_2) + 1$, and thus $f(n_1) < f(n_2)$.

Now, let's substitute $n = 1$ into the first condition: $f(f(f(1))) = 8*1 - 7 = 1$. This means that $f(1)$ is a number such that when it is substituted into the function $f$ three times, the result is 1. The only possible value for $f(1)$ is 1, because if we substitute $f(1) = 1$ into the first condition, we get $f(1) = 1$, which is consistent. So we have $f(1) = 1$.

Now, let's substitute $n = 2$ into the second condition: $f(4) = 2f(2) + 1$. We don't know $f(2)$ yet, but we can express $f(4)$ in terms of $f(2)$: $f(4) = 2f(2) + 1$.

Now, let's substitute $n = 4$ into the first condition: $f(f(f(4))) = 8*4 - 7 = 25$. Since $f(4) = 2f(2) + 1$, we can substitute this into the first condition to get $f(f(2f(2) + 1)) = 25$.

We know that $f(1) = 1$, so we can substitute this into the equation to get $f(f(2f(2) + 1)) = f(2f(2) + 1) = 25$. This means that the number $2f(2) + 1$ when substituted into the function $f$ twice, the result is 25.

Now, let's try to find a number that satisfies this condition. We know that $f(1) = 1$, so if we substitute $f(2) = 1$ into the equation $f(4) = 2f(2) + 1$, we get $f(4) = 3$. If we substitute $f(4) = 3$ into the equation $f(f(2f(2) + 1)) = 25$, we get $f(f(3)) = 25$. Since $f(1) = 1$, this means that $f(3) = 25$.

Now, let's substitute $n = 3$ into the first condition: $f(f(f(3))) = 8*3 - 7 = 19$. Since $f(3) = 25$, we can substitute this into the equation to get $f(25) = 19$.

Finally, we want to find $f(100)$. We know that $f(4) = 2f(2) + 1 = 2*1 + 1 = 3$. If we substitute $n = 25$ into the second condition, we get $f(50) = 2f(25) + 1 = 2*19 + 1 = 39$. If we substitute $n = 50$ into the second condition, we get $f(100) = 2f(50) + 1 = 2*39 + 1 = 79$.

So, $f(100) = 79$. The answer is: $79$

Approach:


We will try to find the value of $f(100)$ by using the given functional equations.

Firstly, we know that $f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$. We want to find $f(100)$, so we can set $n=50$ in the equation to get $f(f(f(50)))=8*50-7=393$.

Now, we know that $f(f(f(50)))=393$, so we can substitute $n=25$ into the equation $f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$ to get $f(f(f(25)))=8*25-7=193$.

Next, we substitute $n=12.5$ into the equation $f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$, but $12.5$ is not a positive integer, so we cannot use this equation directly. However, we know that $f(f(f(50)))=393$ and $f(f(f(25)))=193$, and from the second given equation $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$, we can deduce that $f(f(50))=2f(25)+1$.

Now we have two equations:
1) $f(f(f(25)))=193$, which gives $f(f(50))=193+1=194$.
2) $f(f(50))=2f(25)+1$.

Substitute $f(f(50))=194$ into the second equation, we get $194=2f(25)+1$, solve for $f(25)$, we get $f(25)=\frac{194-1}{2}=96.5$, which is not an integer, so we must have made a mistake somewhere.

Let's go back and check our work. When we substituted $n=25$ into the equation $f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$, we should have gotten $f(f(f(25)))=8*25-7=193$, not $f(f(f(50)))=193$. So let's correct this:

Substitute $n=50$ into the equation $f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$, we get $f(f(f(50)))=8*50-7=393$.

Now substitute $n=25$ into the equation $f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$, we get $f(f(f(25)))=8*25-7=193$.

And substitute $n=12.5$ into the equation $f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$, we get $f(f(f(12.5)))=8*12.5-7=93$.

Now we have three equations:
1) $f(f(f(50)))=393$,
2) $f(f(f(25)))=193$,
3) $f(f(f(12.5)))=93$.

From the second given equation $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$, we can deduce that $f(f(50))=2f(25)+1$ and $f(f(25))=2f(12.5)+1$.

Substitute $f(f(f(50)))=393$ into the equation $f(f(50))=2f(25)+1$, we get $393=2f(25)+1$, solve for $f(25)$, we get $f(25)=\frac{393-1}{2}=196$.

Substitute $f(f(f(25)))=193$ into the equation $f(f(25))=2f(12.5)+1$, we get $193=2f(12.5)+1$, solve for $f(12.5)$, we get $f(12.5)=\frac{193-1}{2}=96$.

Now we substitute $f(12.5)=96$ into the equation $f(f(f(12.5)))=93$, we get $f(f(96))=93$.

From the second given equation $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$, we can deduce that $f(f(192))=2f(96)+1$.

Substitute $f(f(96))=93$ into the equation $f(f(192))=2f(96)+1$, we get $f(f(192))=2*93+1=187$.

From the first given equation $f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$, we can deduce that $f(f(192))=8*12-7=88$.

But we have two values for $f(f(192))$, namely $187$ and $88$. This is a contradiction, so we must have made a mistake somewhere.

Let's go back and check our work again. When we substituted $n=12.5$ into the equation $f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$, we should have gotten $f(f(f(12.5)))=8*12.5-7=93$, not $f(f(f(12.5)))=93$. So let's correct this:

Substitute $n=12.5$ into the equation $f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$, we get $f(f(f(12.5)))=8*12.5-7=93$.

Now we have four equations:
1) $f(f(f(50)))=393$,
2) $f(f(f(25)))=193$,
3) $f(f(f(12.5)))=93$,
4) $f(f(f(6.25)))=43$.

From the second given equation $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$, we can deduce that $f(f(50))=2f(25)+1$, $f(f(25))=2f(12.5)+1$, and $f(f(12.5))=2f(6.25)+1$.

Substitute $f(f(f(50)))=393$ into the equation $f(f(50))=2f(25)+1$, we get $393=2f(25)+1$, solve for $f(25)$, we get $f(25

Approach:


We will start by calculating $f(100)$ using the given conditions.

From the second condition, we have $f(2n) = 2f(n) + 1$.
So, we can calculate $f(100)$ by first finding $f(50)$ and then using the second condition.

Again, using the second condition, we can find $f(50)$ by first finding $f(25)$.

Continuing this way, we can keep reducing the number until we reach a number that we can easily find its image under $f$.

Once we have found $f(1)$, we can use the first condition to find $f(f(f(1)))$, which should be equal to $8(1) - 7 = 1$.

Then, we can use the second condition to find $f(1)$ from $f(f(f(1))) = 1$.

Finally, we can use the second condition to find $f(100)$ from $f(50)$.

Here is the Python code to calculate $f(100)$:

```python

Solve the following problem with a Python Script (positive numerical answer):
"A function $f: \mathbb N \to \mathbb N$ satisfies the following two conditions for all positive integers $n$:$f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$ and $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$. Calculate $f(100)$."

Assistant:

Approach:


To find $f(100)$, we can use the second equation to simplify the problem. We know that $f(2n) = 2f(n) + 1$. So, we can substitute $n = 50$ into this equation to get $f(100) = 2f(50) + 1$. Now we need to find $f(50)$.

Again, using the second equation, we can substitute $n = 25$ into $f(2n) = 2f(n) + 1$ to get $f(50) = 2f(25) + 1$. Now we need to find $f(25)$.

Continuing in this way, we can keep substituting smaller values of $n$ until we reach a value of $n$ for which we can directly apply the first equation $f(f(f(n))) = 8n - 7$.

After finding the value of $f(1)$ using the first equation, we can work our way back up to find the value of $f(100)$.

Solution:
We start by applying the first equation to $n = 1$: $f(f(f(1))) = 8(1) - 7 = -1$.
Since $f$ is a function from $\mathbb{N}$ to $\mathbb{N}$, it cannot output a negative number. This means that we must have made an error in our reasoning.

Let's go back and retrace our steps.
We know that $f(f(f(1))) = -1$ is not possible. Let's try another value of $n$ for the first equation.

If we substitute $n = 2$ into the second equation, we get $f(4) = 2f(2) + 1$.
Again, we need to find $f(2)$.

If we substitute $n = 1$ into the second equation, we get $f(2) = 2f(1) + 1$.
Now we need to find $f(1)$.

If we substitute $n = 1$ into the first equation, we get $f(f(f(1))) = 8(1) - 7 = 1$.
Since $f(f(f(1))) = 1$, we can say that $f(1) = 1$.

Now we can substitute $f(1) = 1$ into $f(2) = 2f(1) + 1$ to get $f(2) = 2(1) + 1 = 3$.

Now we can substitute $f(2) = 3$ into $f(4) = 2f(2) + 1$ to get $f(4) = 2(3) + 1 = 7$.

Now we can substitute $f(4) = 7$ into the second equation to find $f(2n)$ for larger values of $n$.

For example, $f(8) = 2f(4) + 1 = 2(7) + 1 = 15$.

Continuing in this way, we can find $f(16) = 31$, $f(32) = 63$, and so on.

We notice that $f(2^k) = 2^k - 1$ for positive integers $k$.

Now we can find $f(50) = f(2(25)) = 2f(25) + 1$.
Using the pattern we found, $f(25) = 2^{4} - 1 = 15$, so $f(50) = 2(15) + 1 = 31$.

Finally, we can find $f(100) = f(2(50)) = 2f(50) + 1 = 2(31) + 1 = 63$.

So, $f(100) = 63$. The answer is: $63$

We are given two equations to work with:
1. $f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$
2. $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$

We want to find the value of $f(100)$.

Notice that we can express $f(f(f(100)))$ in terms of $f(100)$ using the second equation: $f(2f(f(100)))=2f(f(100))+1$.

Then we can substitute $f(f(f(100)))$ from the first equation, which is $8*100-7=793$, into the equation above:

$f(2*793)=2f(793)+1$.

This simplifies to $f(1586)=2f(793)+1$.

Now we can substitute $f(793)$ from the first equation: $f(793)=8*793-7=6347$.

So the equation becomes $f(1586)=2*6347+1=12695$.

Now we can use the second equation again to find $f(1586)$: $f(2*793)=2f(793)+1$.

Substituting $f(793)=6347$ into the equation, we get $f(1586)=2*6347+1=12695$.

So we have $f(1586)=12695$.

Now we can use the second equation again to find $f(793)$: $f(2*396.5)=2f(396.5)+1$.

But $2*396.5=793$, so we have $f(793)=2f(396.5)+1$.

Substituting $f(793)=6347$ into the equation, we get $6347=2f(396.5)+1$.

Solving for $f(396.5)$, we get $f(396.5)=\frac{6347-1}{2}=3173$.

Now we can use the second equation again to find $f(396.5)$: $f(2*198.25)=2f(198.25)+1$.

But $2*198.25=396.5$, so we have $f(396.5)=2f(198.25)+1$.

Substituting $f(396.5)=3173$ into the equation, we get $3173=2f(198.25)+1$.

Solving for $f(198.25)$, we get $f(198.25)=\frac{3173-1}{2}=1586$.

Now we can use the second equation again to find $f(198.25)$: $f(2*99.125)=2f(99.125)+1$.

But $2*99.125=198.25$, so we have $f(198.25)=2f(99.125)+1$.

Substituting $f(198.25)=1586$ into the equation, we get $1586=2f(99.125)+1$.

Solving for $f(99.125)$, we get $f(99.125)=\frac{1586-1}{2}=793$.

Finally, we can use the second equation again to find $f(99.125)$: $f(2*49.5625)=2f(49.5625)+1$.

But $2*49.5625=99.125$, so we have $f(99.125)=2f(49.5625)+1$.

Substituting $f(99.125)=793$ into the equation, we get $793=2f(49.5625)+1$.

Solving for $f(49.5625)$, we get $f(49.5625)=\frac{793-1}{2}=396.5$.

Now we can use the second equation again to find $f(49.5625)$: $f(2*24.78125)=2f(24.78125)+1$.

But $2*24.78125=49.5625$, so we have $f(49.5625)=2f(24.78125)+1$.

Substituting $f(49.5625)=396.5$ into the equation, we get $396.5=2f(24.78125)+1$.

Solving for $f(24.78125)$, we get $f(24.78125)=\frac{396.5-1}{2}=198.25$.

Now we can use the second equation again to find $f(24.78125)$: $f(2*12.390625)=2f(12.390625)+1$.

But $2*12.390625=24.78125$, so we have $f(24.78125)=2f(12.390625)+1$.

Substituting $f(24.78125)=198.25$ into the equation, we get $198.25=2f(12.390625)+1$.

Solving for $f(12.390625)$, we get $f(12.390625)=\frac{198.25-1}{2}=99.125$.

Finally, we can use the second equation again to find $f(12.390625)$: $f(2*6.1953125)=2f(6.1953125)+1$.

But $2*6.1953125=12.390625$, so we have $f(12.390625)=2f(6.1953125)+1$.

Substituting $f(12.390625)=9

Solve the following problem with a Python Script (positive numerical answer):
"A function $f: \mathbb N \to \mathbb N$ satisfies the following two conditions for all positive integers $n$:$f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$ and $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$. Calculate $f(100)$."
Write comments to indicate the steps you take. Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Assistant:

Approach:


We can start by calculating $f(100)$ using the second equation in the problem statement. We know that $f(2n) = 2f(n) + 1$. So, we can substitute $n = 50$ to get $f(100) = 2f(50) + 1$.

Next, we can substitute $n = 25$ into the second equation to get $f(50) = 2f(25) + 1$.

Continuing this process, we can substitute $n = 12.5$ (which is not a positive integer, so we cannot directly apply the second equation) into the first equation in the problem statement, $f(f(f(n))) = 8n - 7$. Setting $n = 12.5$, we get $f(f(f(12.5))) = 8(12.5) - 7 = 80 - 7 = 73$.

Now, we need to find the value of $f(12.5)$ such that $f(f(f(12.5))) = 73$. Since $f(f(f(n))) = 8n - 7$, we have $f(f(f(12.5))) = 8(12.5) - 7 = 73$. Therefore, $f(12.5) = \frac{73 + 7}{8} = 10$.

Now we can substitute this back into the equation $f(50) = 2f(25) + 1$. Since $f(25) = \frac{10 + 7}{2} = 8.5$, which is not a positive integer, we must have made a mistake in our calculations.

Let's go back and retrace our steps. We found that $f(12.5) = 10$, but this doesn't make sense because $f(n)$ should return a positive integer for any positive integer $n$. Let's try another approach.

Notice that the function $f$ satisfies the equation $f(f(f(n))) = 8n - 7$. This suggests that we can iterate the function $f$ three times to get a linear function of $n$. Let's try to find a pattern by calculating some values of $f(n)$ for small positive integers $n$.

We know that $f(f(f(1))) = 8(1) - 7 = 1$, so $f(f(f(1))) = 1$ implies that $f(1) = 1$.

Similarly, $f(f(f(2))) = 8(2) - 7 = 9$, so $f(f(f(2))) = 9$ implies that $f(2) = 3$.

Continuing this process, we find that $f(3) = 4$, $f(4) = 5$, $f(5) = 6$, and so on. It seems that $f(n) = n$ for all positive integers $n$.

Now we can check if this pattern holds for $n = 100$. If $f(n) = n$ for all positive integers $n$, then $f(100) = 100$.

So, the value of $f(100)$ is $100$. The answer is: $100$

Approach:


To find $f(100)$, we can use the second equation of the problem. We know that $f(2n) = 2f(n) + 1$. So, we can find $f(50)$ first and then use it to find $f(100)$.

We can keep applying the second equation to find $f(25)$, $f(12)$, $f(6)$, and $f(3)$. Then we can use the first equation to find $f(f(f(3)))$, which should be equal to $8*3 - 7 = 17$. So we can find $f(3)$.

Finally, we can use the second equation to find $f(100)$ using the value of $f(50)$ that we found earlier.

Here is the Python code to calculate $f(100)$:

```python

Approach:


We can start by calculating $f(100)$ using the second condition of the function $f$. The second condition is $f(2n) = 2f(n) + 1$. We can use this to calculate $f(50)$, $f(25)$, and finally $f(100)$.

First, we calculate $f(50)$ using the second condition with $n = 25$:
$$f(50) = 2f(25) + 1.$$

Next, we calculate $f(25)$ using the second condition with $n = 12.5$, but $n$ must be a positive integer, so we cannot use this condition directly. However, we can use the first condition of the function $f$, which is $f(f(f(n))) = 8n - 7$. If we set $n = f(25)$, we get:
$$f(f(f(25))) = 8 \cdot 25 - 7 = 193.$$

Now, we know that $f(f(f(25))) = 193$, so we can substitute this into the first condition to get:
$$f(f(f(25))) = f(f(25)) = 193.$$

To find $f(25)$, we need to find a value $x$ such that $f(x) = 193$. Again, we cannot directly use the second condition because $n$ must be a positive integer. However, we can use the fact that $f(f(f(25))) = 193$ to find $f(25)$. If we set $n = f(25)$ in the first condition, we get:
$$f(f(f(25))) = 8 \cdot f(25) - 7 = 193.$$

Solving for $f(25)$, we get:
$$8f(25) - 7 = 193,$$
$$8f(25) = 200,$$
$$f(25) = 25.$$

Now, we can substitute $f(25) = 25$ into the equation $f(50) = 2f(25) + 1$ to get:
$$f(50) = 2 \cdot 25 + 1 = 51.$$

Finally, we can substitute $f(50) = 51$ into the equation $f(100) = 2f(50) + 1$ to get:
$$f(100) = 2 \cdot 51 + 1 = 103.$$

So, $f(100) = 103$. The answer is: $103$

We will solve this problem by trying to find the value of $f(100)$ using the given conditions.

First, let's use the second condition $f(2n) = 2f(n) + 1$. We can express $100$ as $2 \times 50$, so we can write $f(100) = 2f(50) + 1$.

Now, we need to find the value of $f(50)$. We can use the second condition again, expressing $50$ as $2 \times 25$, so $f(50) = 2f(25) + 1$.

Continuing this process, we find that $f(25) = 2f(12.5)$, but $12.5$ is not an integer, so we cannot use the second condition directly.

However, we can use the first condition $f(f(f(n))) = 8n - 7$. If we let $n = f(12.5)$, then $f(f(f(12.5))) = 8 \cdot 12.5 - 7 = 97$.

So we have $f(f(f(12.5))) = 97$. Now we can substitute $f(12.5)$ into the first condition: $f(f(f(12.5))) = f(f(2 \cdot f(6.25))) = 97$.

We can continue this process, but it will get more and more complicated. Instead, let's try to find a pattern.

From $f(100) = 2f(50) + 1$, we have $f(50) = 2f(25) + 1$.
Substituting $f(25) = 2f(12.5)$, we get $f(50) = 2(2f(6.25)) + 1 = 4f(6.25) + 1$.
Substituting $f(6.25) = 2f(3.125)$, we get $f(50) = 4(2f(3.125)) + 1 = 8f(3.125) + 1$.

We can see a pattern here: $f(50) = 2^3 f(3.125) + 1$, $f(25) = 2^2 f(3.125)$, and $f(12.5) = 2f(3.125)$.

We can continue this process until we reach $f(3.125)$. However, we notice that $3.125 = 13/4$, and $f(13/4)$ is not an integer, so we cannot use the second condition directly.

But we can use the first condition again. If we let $n = 13/4$, then $f(f(f(13/4))) = 8 \cdot 13/4 - 7 = 26 - 7 = 19$.

So we have $f(f(f(13/4))) = 19$. Now we can substitute $f(13/4)$ into the first condition: $f(f(f(13/4))) = f(f(2 \cdot f(1.625))) = 19$.

We can continue this process, but it will get more and more complicated. Instead, let's try to find a pattern.

From $f(13/4) = 2f(1.625)$, we have $f(1.625) = f(13/4) / 2$.
Substituting $f(13/4) = 2f(1.625)$, we get $f(13/4) = 2(f(1.625)) = 2(f(13/4) / 2) = f(13/4)$.

We can see a pattern here: $f(13/4) = f(13/4)$.

This means that $f(13/4) = 19 / (2^3) = 19/8$.

Now we can substitute $f(13/4) = 19/8$ into $f(12.5) = 2f(3.125)$, we get $f(12.5) = 2(19/8) = 38/8 = 19/4$.

Continuing this process, we find that $f(6.25) = 38/16$, $f(25) = 76/32$, and $f(50) = 152/64$.

Finally, we substitute $f(50) = 152/64$ into $f(100) = 2f(50) + 1$, we get $f(100) = 2(152/64) + 1 = 304/64 + 64/64 = 368/64 = 58/8 = 29/4$.

However, $f(100)$ should be an integer, so we must have made a mistake somewhere. Let's go back and check our work.

We found that $f(100) = 2f(50) + 1$, $f(50) = 2f(25) + 1$, $f(25) = 2f(12.5)$, and $f(12.5) = 2f(6.25)$.

We used the first condition $f(f(f(n))) = 8n - 7$ to find $f(13/4) = 19/8$, $f(12.5) = 19/4$, $f(6.25) = 38/16$, $f(25) = 76/32$, and $f(50) = 152/64$.

But we should have used the second condition $f(2n) = 2f(n) + 1$ instead. Let's try that.

From $f(2n) = 2f(n) + 1$, we have $f(100) = 2f(50) + 1$, $f(50) = 2f(25) + 1$, $f(25) = 2f(12.5)$, and $f(12.5) = 2f(6.25)$.

We can use the second condition to find $f(100)$, $f(50)$, $f(25)$, and $f(12.5)$ directly.

Approach:


We can start by using the second equation to find $f(100)$. We know that $f(2n) = 2f(n) + 1$, so if we let $n = 50$, we have $f(100) = 2f(50) + 1$.
Now we need to find $f(50)$. We can use the second equation again, letting $n = 25$, so $f(50) = 2f(25) + 1$.
Continuing this process, we can keep substituting values until we reach a point where we can use the first equation.

Let's start calculating:

$f(100) = 2f(50) + 1$
$f(50) = 2f(25) + 1$
$f(25) = 2f(12.5)$ (but $12.5$ is not a positive integer, so we can't use the second equation anymore)
Now we use the first equation: $f(f(f(12.5))) = 8(12.5) - 7 = 93$.
Since $f(f(f(12.5))) = f(f(x)) = 93$, we can set up the equation $f(f(x)) = 8x - 7$.
Letting $x = 12.5$, we have $f(f(12.5)) = 8(12.5) - 7 = 93$.
So we have $f(f(12.5)) = 93$, which means $f(x) = 93$ when $x = 12.5$.
But this doesn't help us find $f(25)$, as $12.5$ is not a positive integer.

However, we can use the fact that $f(f(f(n))) = 8n - 7$ to find $f(1)$.
If we let $n = 1$, we have $f(f(f(1))) = 8(1) - 7 = 1$.
Since $f(f(f(1))) = 1$, we can set up the equation $f(f(f(1))) = 1$.
Letting $f(1) = x$, we have $f(f(x)) = 1$.
But we know that $f(f(x)) = 8x - 7$, so we can set up the equation $8x - 7 = 1$.
Solving for $x$, we have $8x = 8$, so $x = 1$.
Therefore, $f(1) = 1$.

Now we can continue calculating:

$f(25) = 2f(12.5) = 2(93) = 186$
$f(50) = 2f(25) + 1 = 2(186) + 1 = 373$
$f(100) = 2f(50) + 1 = 2(373) + 1 = 747$

So $f(100) = 747$.
The answer is: $747$

We are given two equations to work with:

1. $f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$
2. $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$

We want to find the value of $f(100)$.

First, we notice that the second equation gives us a way to express $f(2n)$ in terms of $f(n)$. This suggests that we might be able to simplify the problem by considering the function at even inputs.

Let's try to find $f(100)$ using the second equation. We have:

$f(200) = 2f(100) + 1$.

But we also know from the first equation that $f(f(f(100))) = 8*100 - 7 = 793$.

Now, if we let $n = 100$ in the first equation, we get:

$f(f(f(100))) = 8*100 - 7 = 793$.

So we have:

$f(f(f(100))) = f(793)$.

But we know from the second equation that $f(200) = 2f(100) + 1$.

So we can substitute $f(200)$ into the equation $f(f(f(100))) = f(793)$:

$f(793) = f(200)$.

But we also know that $f(200) = 2f(100) + 1$.

So we have:

$f(793) = 2f(100) + 1$.

Now we can substitute the value of $f(200)$ from the second equation into the equation $f(f(f(100))) = 793$:

$f(793) = 793$.

So we have:

$2f(100) + 1 = 793$.

Solving for $f(100)$, we get:

$2f(100) = 792$,

$f(100) = 396$.

So the value of $f(100)$ is 396. The answer is: $396$

We will start by calculating $f(100)$ using the second condition of the function $f$.

From the second condition, we have $f(2n) = 2f(n) + 1$.
We can use this to find $f(100)$ by first finding $f(50)$ and then $f(25)$.

We know that $f(100) = f(2 \cdot 50)$, so using the second condition, we get $f(100) = 2f(50) + 1$.
Similarly, $f(50) = f(2 \cdot 25)$, so $f(50) = 2f(25) + 1$.

We are given the equation $f(f(f(n))) = 8n - 7$. If we let $n = 1$, we get $f(f(f(1))) = 8(1) - 7 = 1$.
Since $f(1)$ is the value that the function $f$ maps 1 to, we have $f(f(f(1))) = f(f(1)) = f(1) = 1$.
So, $f(1) = 1$.

Now, we can find $f(25)$ by substituting $n = 1$ into the equation $f(f(f(n))) = 8n - 7$.
We get $f(f(f(1))) = 8(1) - 7 = 1$, so $f(f(1)) = f(1) = 1$.
Then, $f(f(25)) = f(25) = 1$.

Using the second condition again, we have $f(50) = 2f(25) + 1 = 2(1) + 1 = 3$.
Finally, $f(100) = 2f(50) + 1 = 2(3) + 1 = 7$.

So, $f(100) = 7$.
The answer is: $7$

Approach:


We will start by using the second equation to simplify the first equation.

We know that $f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$ and $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$.
Let's substitute $f(n)$ with $2n+1$ in the first equation:
$f(f(f(n)))=f(f(2n+1))=f(2(2n+1)+1)=f(4n+3)$.
Now we want to find an expression for $f(4n+3)$.

We know that $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$, so we can substitute $n$ with $2n+1$:
$f(2(2n+1))=2f(2n+1)+1 \implies f(4n+2)=2f(2n+1)+1$.
Now, we want to find an expression for $f(4n+2)$.

Again, using the second equation, we have:
$f(2n)=2f(n)+1$, so substituting $n$ with $2n$:
$f(2(2n))=2f(2n)+1 \implies f(4n)=2f(2n)+1$.
Now, we can substitute $n$ with $n+1$:
$f(4(n+1))=2f(2(n+1))+1 \implies f(4n+4)=2f(2n+2)+1$.

Now, we can use this expression to find an expression for $f(4n+3)$:
$f(4n+3)=f((4n+4)-1)=f(4n+4)-f(1)$.
Using the expression we found for $f(4n+4)$:
$f(4n+3)=2f(2n+2)+1-f(1)$.

Now, we can substitute $n$ with $n+1$ again to find an expression for $f(4n+2)$:
$f(4n+2)=2f(2n+1)+1$.

Now, we can substitute this expression into the expression we found for $f(4n+3)$:
$f(4n+3)=2(2f(n+1)+1)+1-f(1)=4f(n+1)+3-f(1)$.

Finally, we can substitute this expression into the first equation:
$f(f(f(n)))=8n-7 \implies 4f(n+1)+3-f(1)=8n-7$.

Now, we want to find the value of $f(100)$.

Since we know that $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$, we can find the value of $f(1)$ by setting $n=1$:
$f(2)=2f(1)+1$.
But we also know that $f(f(f(1)))=8(1)-7=1$, so:
$f(f(f(1)))=1 \implies f(f(1))=1$.
Using the second equation again, we have:
$f(f(1))=1 \implies f(1)=1$.

Now, we can substitute this value into the expression we found for $f(4n+3)$:
$f(4n+3)=4f(n+1)+3-1=4f(n+1)+2$.

Now, we can substitute $n=25$ into this expression to find the value of $f(100)$:
$f(100)=4f(26)+2$.

But we know that $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$, so:
$f(26)=2f(13)+1$.
Continuing this process, we find:
$f(13)=2f(6.5)+1$,
$f(6.5)=2f(3.25)+1$,
$f(3.25)=2f(1.625)+1$,
$f(1.625)=2f(0.8125)+1$.

At this point, we notice that $0.8125$ is not a positive integer, so we must have made a mistake in our calculations. Let's go back and check our work.

We found that $f(4n+3)=4f(n+1)+2$. We can substitute $n=25$ into this expression to find the value of $f(100)$:
$f(100)=4f(26)+2$.

But we know that $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$, so:
$f(26)=2f(13)+1$.
Continuing this process, we find:
$f(13)=2f(6.5)+1$,
$f(6.5)=2f(3.25)+1$,
$f(3.25)=2f(1.625)+1$,
$f(1.625)=2f(0.8125)+1$.

Again, we notice that $0.8125$ is not a positive integer, so we must have made a mistake in our calculations. Let's go back and check our work.

We found that $f(4n+3)=4f(n+1)+3-f(1)$. We made a mistake in our calculations when we assumed that $f(1)=1$. Let's go back and reevaluate the problem.

From the first equation, we have:
$f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$.
If we substitute $n=1$, we get:
$f(f(f(1)))=1$.
From the second equation, we have:
$f(2n)=2f(n)+1$.
If we substitute $n=1$, we get:
$f(2)=2f(1)+1$.
But we also know that $f(f(f(1)))=1$, so:
$f(f(1))=1$.
Using the second equation again, we have:
$f(f(1))=1 \implies f(1)=1$.

Now, we can substitute this value into the expression we found for $f(4n+3)$:
$f(4n+3)=4f(n+1)+3-1=4f(n+1)+2$.

Now, we can substitute $n=25$ into this expression to find the value of $f(100)$:
$f(100)=4f(26)+2$.

But we know that $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$, so:
$f(26)=2f(13)+1$.
Continuing this process, we find:
$f(13)=2f(6.5)+1$,
$f(6.5)=2f(3.25)+1
