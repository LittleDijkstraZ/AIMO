Interesting, let's analyze step by step:



The equation is $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + (\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + (\vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$. The only way for the product of two factors to be 0 is if at least one of the factors is 0. Hence we have two sets of conditions:

1) $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0 \Rightarrow \vert x + y \vert = 10$, and 

2) $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0 \Rightarrow \vert x - y \vert = 10$, and 

3) $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0 \Rightarrow \vert x \vert = 8$, and 

4) $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0 \Rightarrow \vert y \vert = 8$.

Solving the above conditions we get:

1) $x + y = \pm 10$ and 

2) $x - y = \pm 10$ and 

3) $x = \pm 8$ and 

4) $y = \pm 8$.

From 1) and 2) we get four lines: $y = -x \pm 10$, $y = x \pm 10$. And from 3) and 4) we get four lines: $x = \pm 8$, $y = \pm 8$. The intersection points of these lines are the vertices of the polygon. By calculating the intersection points we find that they form a square with side length 16. Hence the area of the polygon is $16^2 = 256$.

```python

def polygon_area():
    """The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"""
    side_length = 16
    area = side_length ** 2
    return area

result = polygon_area()
print(result)
```

CODE RESULTS 256

INTERMEDIATE OUT :
```output
256
```
The area of the polygon is 256. Since the area is a positive integer, the problem is solved correctly.
The answer is: $256$.

Interesting, let's analyze step by step:



1. The given equation is: $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$.

This equation is equal to zero if either of the two terms inside the product is equal to zero. This implies that either of the following two sets of equations must be satisfied:

Set 1: $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ and $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ and $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$.
Set 2: $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ and $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ and $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$.

2. In Set 1, we have $\vert x + y \vert = 10$, $\vert x \vert = 8$, and $\vert y \vert = 8$. These equations imply that $-10 \leq x + y \leq 10$, $-8 \leq x \leq 8$, and $-8 \leq y \leq 8$. This forms a rectangle with vertices at $(8,8)$, $(-8,8)$, $(-8,-8)$, and $(8,-8)$.

3. In Set 2, we have $\vert x - y \vert = 10$, $\vert x \vert = 8$, and $\vert y \vert = 8$. These equations imply that $-10 \leq x - y \leq 10$, $-8 \leq x \leq 8$, and $-8 \leq y \leq 8$. This also forms a rectangle with vertices at $(8,8)$, $(-8,8)$, $(-8,-8)$, and $(8,-8)$.

4. Since both Set 1 and Set 2 describe the same rectangle, the convex polygon enclosed by the points satisfying the given equation is a rectangle with vertices at $(8,8)$, $(-8,8)$, $(-8,-8)$, and $(8,-8)$.

5. The area of this rectangle can be calculated as the product of its length and width. The length is $16$ (from $-8$ to $8$ along the x-axis) and the width is $16$ (from $-8$ to $8$ along the y-axis). So, the area is $16 \times 16 = 256$.

The answer is: $256$

Interesting, let's analyze step by step:



The problem states that the points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. This means that either $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$.

If $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$, then $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. This means that $x + y = \pm 10$ and $x - y = \pm 10$, which gives us four lines: $x + y = 10$, $x + y = -10$, $x - y = 10$, and $x - y = -10$. The intersection points of these lines are: $(5,5)$, $(5,-5)$, $(-5,5)$, and $(-5,-5)$.

If $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$, then $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$, which means that $x = \pm 8$ and $y = \pm 8$. This gives us four more lines: $x = 8$, $x = -8$, $y = 8$, and $y = -8$. The intersection points of these lines are: $(8,8)$, $(8,-8)$, $(-8,8)$, and $(-8,-8)$.

So the convex polygon is a square with side length 10. The area of this square is $10^2 = 100$. Therefore, the area of the convex polygon is 100.

The problem asks for the area of the convex polygon, and we've found that it's 100. It's a positive integer, so it checks out.

The answer is: $100$.

Interesting, let's analyze step by step:



The given equation is $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + (\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + (\vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$.

Since the product of two numbers is zero if and only if at least one of the numbers is zero, the equation is equivalent to the system of equations:

1. $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$,
2. $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$,
3. $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$,
4. $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$.

From equation 3 and 4, we have $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$. This means $x = \pm 8$ and $y = \pm 8$.

From equation 1 and 2, we have $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$.

For $x = 8$ and $y = 8$, we have $\vert x + y \vert = 16$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 0$, which doesn't satisfy the equations.

For $x = 8$ and $y = -8$, we have $\vert x + y \vert = 0$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 16$, which doesn't satisfy the equations.

For $x = -8$ and $y = 8$, we have $\vert x + y \vert = 0$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 16$, which doesn't satisfy the equations.

For $x = -8$ and $y = -8$, we have $\vert x + y \vert = 16$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 16$, which satisfies the equations.

Therefore, the vertices of the polygon are $(8, 8)$, $(8, -8)$, $(-8, 8)$, and $(-8, -8)$.

This is a square with side length $16$, so its area is $16^2 = 256$.

Therefore, the area of the convex polygon is $256$.

To summarize, we used the properties of absolute value and the equation to find the vertices of the polygon, then calculated the area of the square formed by these vertices. The final answer is a positive integer, as expected.
The answer is: $256$
