Interesting, let's analyze step by step:



The equation involves absolute values and squares, which means that some expressions inside absolute values must be equal to zero. 

The points that satisfy $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ are the vertices of the polygon.

For $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$, we have $\vert x + y \vert = 10$, which implies $x + y = \pm 10$.

For $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$, we have $\vert x - y \vert = 10$, which implies $x - y = \pm 10$.

For $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$, we have $\vert x \vert = 8$, which implies $x = \pm 8$.

For $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$, we have $\vert y \vert = 8$, which implies $y = \pm 8$.

The intersection points of these lines are the vertices of the polygon:

1. $(8, 0)$, $(0, 8)$, $(-8, 0)$, $(0, -8)$.
2. $(8, 2)$, $(0, 18)$, $(-8, -2)$, $(0, -18)$.
3. $(18, 8)$, $(2, 0)$, $(-18, -8)$, $(-2, 0)$.
4. $(18, -2)$, $(2, 0)$, $(-18, 2)$, $(-2, 0)$.

These points form a square with side length 16.

Therefore, the area of the square is $16^2 = 256$.

The answer is $\boxed{256}$.

Interesting, let's analyze step by step:



Since the product of two numbers is zero if and only if at least one of them is zero, we have the following two cases to consider:

1. $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ and $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$.
2. $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ and $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$.

Case 1:
For $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$, we have $\vert x + y \vert = 10$, which implies $x + y = 10$ or $x + y = -10$.
For $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$, we have $\vert x - y \vert = 10$, which implies $x - y = 10$ or $x - y = -10$.
Solving these systems of equations, we find that the points satisfying Case 1 are $(10, 0)$, $(0, 10)$, $(-10, 0)$, and $(0, -10)$.

Case 2:
For $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$, we have $\vert x \vert = 8$, which implies $x = 8$ or $x = -8$.
For $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$, we have $\vert y \vert = 8$, which implies $y = 8$ or $y = -8$.
Solving these systems of equations, we find that the points satisfying Case 2 are $(8, 8)$, $(8, -8)$, $(-8, 8)$, and $(-8, -8)$.

The convex polygon is formed by the union of the points satisfying Case 1 and Case 2. Plotting these points, we find that the convex polygon is a square with side length 16.

The area of the square is given by the formula $s^2$, where $s$ is the side length. So the area of the square is $16^2 = 256$.

Since the problem asks for the positive numerical answer, the area of the convex polygon is 256. The answer is: $256$

Interesting, let's analyze step by step:



The condition for the entire product to be zero is that at least one of the terms must be zero. So we have two cases to consider:

1. $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2) = 0$.
2. $((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$.

In the first case, we have $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$.
This means that $x + y = 10$ or $x + y = -10$, and $x - y = 10$ or $x - y = -10$.
By solving these four systems of equations, we get the vertices of the square as: $(0,10), (0,-10), (20,0), (-20,0)$.

In the second case, we have $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$, which means $x = 8$ or $x = -8$, and $y = 8$ or $y = -8$.
By combining these conditions, we get the vertices of the square as: $(8,8), (8,-8), (-8,8), (-8,-8)$.

The intersection of these two squares forms a larger square with side length 20, so the area of the polygon is $20^2 = 400$.

The positive integer area of the polygon is 400. The answer is: $400$.

Interesting, let's analyze step by step:



The equation $A \cdot B = 0$ implies that at least one of the factors $A$ or $B$ must be zero. Therefore, the given equation is satisfied if at least one of the following two conditions is true:
1. $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$
2. $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$

From condition 1, we have $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. This implies that $x + y = \pm 10$ and $x - y = \pm 10$. Solving these four equations, we get the vertices of the polygon as $(0, 10)$, $(0, -10)$, $(10, 0)$, and $(-10, 0)$.

From condition 2, we have $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$. This implies that $x = \pm 8$ and $y = \pm 8$. Solving these four equations, we get the vertices of the polygon as $(8, 8)$, $(8, -8)$, $(-8, 8)$, and $(-8, -8)$.

Combining all the vertices, we get the polygon with vertices $(0, 10)$, $(0, -10)$, $(10, 0)$, $(-10, 0)$, $(8, 8)$, $(8, -8)$, $(-8, 8)$, and $(-8, -8)$. This polygon is a square with side length 10.

The area of this square is side length squared, which is $10^2 = 100$.
The answer is: $100$

Interesting, let's analyze step by step:


The product of two numbers is zero if and only if at least one of the numbers is zero. So the equation is satisfied if:

1) $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0 \text{ or } (\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$
2) $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0 \text{ or } (\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$

For the first case, we have:
1.1) $\vert x + y \vert = 10$
1.2) $\vert x - y \vert = 10$

For the second case:
2.1) $\vert x \vert = 8$
2.2) $\vert y \vert = 8$

Now let's analyze these equations:

From 1.1 and 1.2, we have four cases to consider:
- $x + y = 10$ and $x - y = 10$
- $x + y = 10$ and $x - y = -10$
- $x + y = -10$ and $x - y = 10$
- $x + y = -10$ and $x - y = -10$

From 2.1 and 2.2, we have four more cases to consider:
- $x = 8$ and $y = 8$
- $x = 8$ and $y = -8$
- $x = -8$ and $y = 8$
- $x = -8$ and $y = -8$

By solving these equations, we find that the points $(x, y)$ that satisfy the conditions are:

- $(5, 5)$
- $(5, -5)$
- $(-5, 5)$
- $(-5, -5)$
- $(8, 8)$
- $(8, -8)$
- $(-8, 8)$
- $(-8, -8)$

These points form a square with side length $10$. The area of this square is $10^2 = 100$.

So the area of the convex polygon is 100 square units. To verify that this number is indeed positive, we can note that the area of any geometric figure cannot be negative. Thus, our answer is $\boxed{100}$.
The answer is: $100$

Interesting, let's analyze step by step:



First, let's recognize that the product of two terms is zero if and only if at least one of the terms is zero. Therefore, the original equation is equivalent to the system of equations:

1. $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$
2. $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$

For equation 1, we have:

- $\vert x + y \vert - 10 = 0$ which gives $\vert x + y \vert = 10$
- $\vert x - y \vert - 10 = 0$ which gives $\vert x - y \vert = 10$

For equation 2, we have:

- $\vert x \vert - 8 = 0$ which gives $\vert x \vert = 8$
- $\vert y \vert - 8 = 0$ which gives $\vert y \vert = 8$

Solving these absolute value equations, we obtain the following vertices of the polygon:

- $(8, 8)$, $(-8, 8)$, $(8, -8)$, $(-8, -8)$
- $(8, 2)$, $(8, -2)$, $(-8, 2)$, $(-8, -2)$
- $(2, 8)$, $(-2, 8)$, $(2, -8)$, $(-2, -8)$

The vertices of the polygon are the intersections of these lines, which form a square with side length $8\sqrt{2}$. Therefore, the area of the polygon is $(8\sqrt{2})^2 = 128$. The answer is $\boxed{128}$.

- List the variables and known values from the problem.
- Outline the steps using sympy to solve the problem:

  * Implement these functions step-by-step, commenting each line for clarity.
- Calculate the final answer and verify it's a positive integer.
- Output the result within \boxed{}.

Assistant:

Interesting, let's analyze step by step:



1. We have two absolute values, which are defined as:
   \[ |x| = \begin{cases} x & \text{if } x \geq 0 \\ -x & \text{if } x < 0 \end{cases} \]
   So in this case, $|x+y|$ and $|x-y|$ will equal to $x+y$ or $-x-y$, and $|x|$ and $|y|$ will equal to $x$ or $-x$ and $y$ or $-y$ respectively.

2. The equation $AB = 0$ implies that either $A = 0$ or $B = 0$. Therefore, the given equation is equivalent to either $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2) = 0$ or $((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$.

3. Each of these equations is a square, so in order for them to equal to zero, their arguments must be equal to zero. Therefore, we get four systems of equations:
   - $x + y - 10 = 0$ and $x - y - 10 = 0$,
   - $x + y - 10 = 0$ and $x - y + 10 = 0$,
   - $x - 8 = 0$ and $y - 8 = 0$,
   - $x - 8 = 0$ and $y + 8 = 0$.

4. Solving these systems of equations, we find the vertices of the polygon:
   - For the first system, we get $x = 10$ and $y = 10$.
   - For the second system, we get $x = 10$ and $y = -10$.
   - For the third system, we get $x = 8$ and $y = 8$.
   - For the fourth system, we get $x = 8$ and $y = -8$.

5. The polygon is a square with side length 20, so its area is $20^2 = 400$.

Now let's calculate the area of the polygon using Python:

```python

Assistant:

Interesting, let's analyze step by step:



The problem is asking for the area of a polygon formed by the points $(x, y)$ that satisfy the equation
\[((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0.\]

This equation equals zero if either of the two factors equals zero. Therefore, we have two cases to consider:

Case 1: $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$. This means that $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. This implies that $x$ and $y$ are both $5$ or both $-5$. So, the points in this case form a square with side length $10$.

Case 2: $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$. This means that $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$. This implies that $x$ is in the interval $[-8, 8]$ and $y$ is in the interval $[-8, 8]$. So, the points in this case form a square with side length $16$.

The intersection of the two cases is the point $(0,0)$, which we can ignore because it's not in the polygon we are interested in. 

The area of the polygon is the area of the square formed by case 1 plus the area of the square formed by case 2 minus the overlapping area.

The side length of the square from case 1 is $10$, so its area is $10^2 = 100$.
The side length of the square from case 2 is $16$, so its area is $16^2 = 256$.
The overlapping area is the area of a square with side length $8$ (the intersection of the squares from case 1 and case 2), which is $8^2 = 64$.

Therefore, the area of the polygon is $100 + 256 - 64 = 300$.
The answer is: $300$.

Interesting, let's analyze step by step:


1. The expression inside the first parentheses will be zero if and only if $\vert x+y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x-y \vert = 10$. This implies $x+y = \pm 10$ and $x-y = \pm 10$, which results in $x = \pm 10$ and $y = 0$ or $x = 0$ and $y = \pm 10$. These are four points: $(10, 0), (0, 10), (-10, 0), (0, -10)$.
2. The expression inside the second parentheses will be zero if and only if $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$. This implies $x = \pm 8$ and $y = \pm 8$. These are four points: $(8, 8), (8, -8), (-8, 8), (-8, -8)$.
3. The intersection of these two sets of points is the set of vertices of the polygon: $(8, 8), (8, -8), (-8, 8), (-8, -8), (10, 0), (0, 10), (-10, 0), (0, -10)$.
4. To find the area of the polygon, we can use the Shoelace formula. The Shoelace formula takes the coordinates of the vertices of a polygon, in order, and calculates its area. If the polygon vertices are $(x_1, y_1), (x_2, y_2), \ldots, (x_n, y_n)$, the formula is given by:
$$A = \frac{1}{2} \vert (x_1y_2 + x_2y_3 + \cdots + x_ny_1) - (y_1x_2 + y_2x_3 + \cdots + y_n x_1) \vert.$$
5. Applying the Shoelace formula to the eight vertices of the polygon, we obtain the area as:
$$A = \frac{1}{2} \vert (8 \cdot 8 + 8 \cdot (-8) + (-8) \cdot 8 + (-8) \cdot (-8) + 10 \cdot 0 + 0 \cdot 10 + (-10) \cdot 0 + 0 \cdot (-10) - (0 \cdot 8 + 10 \cdot (-8) + 0 \cdot 8 + 0 \cdot (-8) + 8 \cdot 0 + (-8) \cdot 10 + 8 \cdot 0 + (-8) \cdot (-10))) \vert = \frac{1}{2} \vert (64 - 64 - 64 + 64 + 0 + 0 - 0 + 0 - (0 - 80 + 0 - 80 + 0 - 80 + 0 + 80)) \vert = \frac{1}{2} \vert 0 - (-320) \vert = \frac{1}{2} \cdot 320 = 160.$$
The area of the convex polygon is $160$. This is a positive integer, so the answer is: $160$. The answer is: $160$

Interesting, let's analyze step by step:



The equation $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + (\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ has only one solution: $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. So, it defines a square with side length 20. The area of this square is $20^2 = 400$.

The equation $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + (\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ also has only one solution: $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$. So, it defines a square with side length 16. The area of this square is $16^2 = 256$.

The intersection of these two squares is a square with side length 8 (the smaller one), and the area of this square is $8^2 = 64$.

Finally, the area of the convex polygon (the intersection of the two squares) is the difference between the area of the first square and the area of the second square: $400 - 256 = 144$. This is a positive integer, so the answer is correct.
The answer is $\boxed{144}$.

Interesting, let's analyze step by step:



If a product equals zero, then at least one of its factors must be zero. Thus, either $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$, $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$, $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$, or $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$.

For $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$, we have $\vert x + y \vert = 10$.
For $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$, we have $\vert x - y \vert = 10$.
For $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$, we have $\vert x \vert = 8$.
For $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$, we have $\vert y \vert = 8$.

By the definition of absolute value, these equations split into four cases:

1. $x + y = 10$ or $x + y = -10$.
2. $x - y = 10$ or $x - y = -10$.
3. $x = 8$ or $x = -8$.
4. $y = 8$ or $y = -8$.

These cases define the vertices of a polygon:

1. $(x, y) = (5, 5), (-5, -5), (5, -5), (-5, 5)$.
2. $(x, y) = (10, 0), (-10, 0), (0, 10), (0, -10)$.
3. $(x, y) = (8, 0), (-8, 0), (0, 8), (0, -8)$.
4. $(x, y) = (0, 8), (0, -8), (8, 0), (-8, 0)$.

The polygon formed by these vertices is a square with side length $10$, so its area is $10^2 = 100$.
The answer is: $100$

Interesting, let's analyze step by step:



- The given equation is a product of two terms equal to zero. This means that either the first term equals zero, or the second term equals zero, or both.
- The first term is $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)$, and this equals zero if and only if both $\vert x + y \vert - 10 = 0$ and $\vert x - y \vert - 10 = 0$. This simplifies to $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. The solutions to these equations are the lines $x + y = 10$, $x + y = -10$, $x - y = 10$, and $x - y = -10$.
- The second term is $((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2)$, and this equals zero if and only if both $\vert x \vert - 8 = 0$ and $\vert y \vert - 8 = 0$. This simplifies to $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$. The solutions to these equations are the lines $x = 8$, $x = -8$, $y = 8$, and $y = -8$.
- The intersection of the lines $x + y = 10$, $x + y = -10$, $x - y = 10$, $x - y = -10$, $x = 8$, $x = -8$, $y = 8$, and $y = -8$ forms a square with side length 6. The area of this square is $6^2 = 36$.

Therefore, the area of the convex polygon is 36. To solve this problem using sympy, you can create the equations and solve them manually.

Let's now solve the problem using sympy:

```python


INTERMEDIATE OUT :

from sympy import symbols, Eq, solve

def calculate_area():
    x, y = symbols('x y')

    # Equations
    eq1 = Eq(abs(x + y) - 10, 0)
    eq2 = Eq(abs(x - y) - 10, 0)
    eq3 = Eq(abs(x) - 8, 0)
    eq4 = Eq(abs(y) - 8, 0)

    # Solve the equations
    solutions1 = solve((eq1, eq3), (x, y))
    solutions2 = solve((eq2, eq4), (x, y))

    # Calculate the distance between the points
    distance = abs(solutions1[0][0] - solutions2[0][0])

    # Calculate the area of the square
    area = distance**2

    return area

result = calculate_area()
