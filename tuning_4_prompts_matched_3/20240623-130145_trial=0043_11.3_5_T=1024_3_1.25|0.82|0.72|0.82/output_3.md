"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"

Approach:

 The equation $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ implies that either of the two factors must be zero for the equation to hold true.
The first factor is zero when $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. These two conditions imply that both $x + y = \pm 10$ and $x - y = \pm 10$ must hold true. Solving these equations, we find that the four points that satisfy these conditions are $(8, 2)$, $(-8, -2)$, $(8, -2)$, and $(-8, 2)$.
The second factor is zero when $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$. These two conditions imply that $x = \pm 8$ and $y = \pm 8$. Solving these equations, we find that the four points that satisfy these conditions are $(8, 8)$, $(-8, 8)$, $(8, -8)$, and $(-8, -8)$.
The set of all these points forms a square with side length 16. The area of this square is $16^2 = 256$. So, the area of the convex polygon enclosed by the points is 256.
The answer is: 256

Approach:



The expression is equal to 0 when either of the terms inside the product is equal to 0. So we have two sets of equations:

1) $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$
2) $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$

For the first set of equations, both terms inside the square are non-negative, so for the sum to be 0, both terms must be 0. That gives us:

$\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$

For the second set of equations, similarly, both terms inside the square are non-negative, so for the sum to be 0, both terms must be 0. That gives us:

$\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$

The solutions from the first set of equations are all the points that are at a distance of 10 from the origin in the $x+y$ and $x-y$ directions. This forms a square with side length of 20 (since the square root of $(10^2+10^2)$ is 10*sqrt(2), and the square root of $(8^2+8^2)$ is 8*sqrt(2)). The area of this square is $20^2 = 400$.

The solutions from the second set of equations are all the points that are at a distance of 8 from the origin in the $x$ and $y$ directions. This forms a square with side length of 16 (since the square root of $(8^2+8^2)$ is 8*sqrt(2)). The area of this square is $16^2 = 256$.

The intersection of these two sets of solutions is the set of points that satisfy both sets of equations, which is the set of points that form the convex polygon. These points form a smaller square inside the larger square.

The side length of the smaller square is the difference of the side lengths of the two squares, which is $20 - 16 = 4$. The area of the smaller square is $4^2 = 16$.

Therefore, the area of the convex polygon is the area of the larger square minus the area of the smaller square, which is $400 - 256 + 16 = 160$. The answer is: 160

Solve the following problem with a Python Script (positive numerical answer):
"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"

Approach:



The equation $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + (\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + (\vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ is true if and only if at least one of the factors is zero.

Setting each factor to zero gives us:

1. $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0 \Rightarrow \vert x + y \vert = 10$
2. $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0 \Rightarrow \vert x - y \vert = 10$
3. $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0 \Rightarrow \vert x \vert = 8$
4. $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0 \Rightarrow \vert y \vert = 8$

The equations $\vert x + y \vert = 10$, $\vert x - y \vert = 10$, $\vert x \vert = 8$, and $\vert y \vert = 8$ describe a square with side length $10$ and vertices at $(\pm8, \pm8)$. Therefore, the area of the convex polygon is $10^2 = 100$.

Solution: The area of the convex polygon is $\boxed{100}$.
The answer is: $100$

Approach:

 The equation $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ is satisfied when either of the two factors is equal to zero.

For the first factor to be zero, we must have $\vert x + y \vert - 10 = 0$ and $\vert x - y \vert - 10 = 0$, which implies $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. These equations describe a square with side length 20 centered at the origin.

For the second factor to be zero, we must have $\vert x \vert - 8 = 0$ and $\vert y \vert - 8 = 0$, which implies $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$. These equations describe a square with side length 16 centered at the origin.

The intersection of these two squares is the convex polygon we are looking for. The side length of the smaller square is 16, so the area of the smaller square is $16^2 = 256$. The side length of the larger square is 20, so the area of the larger square is $20^2 = 400$.

The convex polygon we are looking for is the intersection of these two squares, which is a square with side length 16. Therefore, the area of this convex polygon is $16^2 = 256$. The answer is: $256$

Assistant:

Approach:


The given equation is of the form $f(x, y) g(x, y) = 0$. This implies that either $f(x, y) = 0$ or $g(x, y) = 0$. So, the points satisfying the equation are those that satisfy either $f(x, y) = 0$ or $g(x, y) = 0$. The solutions to $f(x, y) = 0$ and $g(x, y) = 0$ are two squares with side length 16 centered at the origin. The intersection of these two squares forms a square with side length 8. The area of this square is $8^2 = 64$.

The Python code to calculate the area of the square is as follows:

```python


INTERMEDIATE OUT :

def square_area():
    side_length = 8
    area = side_length ** 2
    return area

result = square_area()
print(result)
```

CODE RESULTS 64

INTERMEDIATE OUT :
```output

```
The area of the convex polygon is $64$. The answer is $\boxed{64}$.

Solve the following problem with a Python Script (positive numerical answer):
"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"

Approach:

 The equation $A \cdot B = 0$ is equivalent to either $A=0$ or $B=0$. Therefore, the given equation is satisfied if either $ ((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2) = 0$ or $ ((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$.

The first equation is satisfied if $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$, which gives four lines in the coordinate plane: $x + y = 10$, $x + y = -10$, $x - y = 10$, and $x - y = -10$. These lines form a square with side length $10\sqrt{2}$.

The second equation is satisfied if $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$, which gives four lines in the coordinate plane: $x = 8$, $x = -8$, $y = 8$, and $y = -8$. These lines form a square with side length $16$.

Therefore, the points that satisfy the given equation form the union of two squares: one with side length $10\sqrt{2}$ and the other with side length $16$.

To find the area of the convex polygon, we simply add the areas of the two squares. The area of a square is given by the square of its side length, so the area of the first square is $(10\sqrt{2})^2 = 200$, and the area of the second square is $16^2 = 256$. Adding these areas gives the total area of the convex polygon: $200 + 256 = 456$.
The answer is: 456

Approach:


The equation involves absolute values, so we need to consider the different cases for the absolute values to be equal to zero. The equation is equal to zero when either of the factors is zero. The factors are:
1. $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2) = 0$
2. $((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$

From the first factor being zero, we have:
1. $\vert x + y \vert - 10 = 0 \implies \vert x + y \vert = 10$
2. $\vert x - y \vert - 10 = 0 \implies \vert x - y \vert = 10$

From the second factor being zero, we have:
3. $\vert x \vert - 8 = 0 \implies \vert x \vert = 8$
4. $\vert y \vert - 8 = 0 \implies \vert y \vert = 8$

From 3 and 4, we get the vertices of the square as $(8,8), (8,-8), (-8,8), (-8,-8)$. Now, from 1 and 2, we can have the following cases:
Case 1: $x + y = 10$ and $x - y = 10$ which gives $x = 10$ and $y = 0$.
Case 2: $x + y = 10$ and $x - y = -10$ which gives $x = 0$ and $y = 10$.
Case 3: $x + y = -10$ and $x - y = 10$ which gives $x = 0$ and $y = -10$.
Case 4: $x + y = -10$ and $x - y = -10$ which gives $x = -10$ and $y = 0$.

So, the vertices of the square are also $(10,0), (0,10), (0,-10), (-10,0)$.

The side length of the square is the distance between any two adjacent vertices, which can be found using the distance formula $\sqrt{(x_2-x_1)^2 + (y_2-y_1)^2}$. For example, the distance between $(10,0)$ and $(0,10)$ is $\sqrt{(0-10)^2 + (10-0)^2} = \sqrt{100 + 100} = \sqrt{200} = 10\sqrt{2}$.

The area of a square is side length squared, so the area of the square is $(10\sqrt{2})^2 = 200$.
The answer is: $200$

Approach:

 The expression is equal to zero if and only if both $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2$ and $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2$ are zero, or both $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2$ and $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2$ are zero. This gives us four cases to consider:

1. $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$.
2. $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x \vert = 8$.
3. $\vert x - y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x \vert = 8$.
4. $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$.

Case 1 gives us $x = 0, y = \pm 10$ and $x = \pm 10, y = 0$, forming a square with side length 20. The area is $20^2 = 400$.

Case 2 gives us $x = \pm 8, y = 0$.

Case 3 gives us $x = 0, y = \pm 8$.

Case 4 gives us the points $(\pm 8, \pm 8)$.

However, these additional points do not change the shape of the polygon, so the area remains the same. Therefore, the area of the convex polygon is 400 square units. The answer is: $400$

Approach:


The equation is of the form $(A)(B) = 0$, which means that either $A = 0$ or $B = 0$. 

So we have two cases:

1) $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$.

This equation is satisfied only if $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. This implies that the points $(x, y)$ are on a square with side length $10\sqrt{2}$ centered at the origin.

2) $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$.

This equation is satisfied only if $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$, which implies that the points $(x, y)$ are on a square with side length $16$ centered at the origin.

The intersection of these two regions gives us a square with side length $10\sqrt{2}$ inside a square with side length $16$. The area of the convex polygon is therefore the area of the smaller square, which is $(10\sqrt{2})^2 = 200$.

So the area of the convex polygon is $200$.
The answer is: $200$

Approach:



The expression $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ if and only if $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. This means that $x + y = \pm 10$ and $x - y = \pm 10$. Solving these four systems of equations gives us the vertices of the square.

Similarly, the expression $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ if and only if $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$. This means that $x = \pm 8$ and $y = \pm 8$. Solving these four systems of equations gives us the vertices of the square.

The side length of the outer square is 16 (since the distance between the points (8,0) and (-8,0) is 16), and the side length of the inner square is 20 (since the distance between the points (5,5) and (-5,-5) is 20).

The area of the outer square is $16^2 = 256$, and the area of the inner square is $20^2 = 400$. The area of the convex polygon is the difference of these two areas, which is $256 - 400 = -144$. However, the area of a polygon cannot be negative. This suggests that there might be an error in our calculations.

Let's re-examine our steps:

For the first equation $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$, we found that $x + y = \pm 10$ and $x - y = \pm 10$. Solving these four systems of equations gives us the vertices of the square: $(5,5), (5,-5), (-5,5), (-5,-5)$.

For the second equation $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$, we found that $x = \pm 8$ and $y = \pm 8$. Solving these four systems of equations gives us the vertices of the square: $(8,0), (0,8), (-8,0), (0,-8)$.

The side length of the outer square is 16, and the side length of the inner square is 10 (the distance between the points (5,5) and (-5,-5)).

The area of the outer square is $16^2 = 256$, and the area of the inner square is $10^2 = 100$. The area of the convex polygon is the difference of these two areas, which is $256 - 100 = 156$.

However, we made a mistake in our calculations. Let's re-examine our steps:

For the first equation $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$, we found that $x + y = \pm 10$ and $x - y = \pm 10$. Solving these four systems of equations gives us the vertices of the square: $(5,5), (5,-5), (-5,5), (-5,-5)$.

For the second equation $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$, we found that $x = \pm 8$ and $y = \pm 8$. Solving these four systems of equations gives us the vertices of the square: $(8,0), (0,8), (-8,0), (0,-8)$.

The side length of the outer square is 16, and the side length of the inner square is 20 (the distance between the points (5,5) and (-5,-5)).

The area of the outer square is $16^2 = 256$, and the area of the inner square is $20^2 = 400$. The area of the convex polygon is the difference of these two areas, which is $400 - 256 = 144$.

This is still not the correct answer. Let's re-examine our steps:

For the first equation $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$, we found that $x + y = \pm 10$ and $x - y = \pm 10$. Solving these four systems of equations gives us the vertices of the square: $(5,5), (5,-5), (-5,5), (-5,-5)$.

For the second equation $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$, we found that $x = \pm 8$ and $y = \pm 8$. Solving these four systems of equations gives us the vertices of the square: $(8,0), (0,8), (-8,0), (0,-8)$.

The side length of the outer square is 16, and the side length of the inner square is 20 (the distance between the points (5,5) and (-5,-5)).

The area of the outer square is $16^2 = 256$, and the area of the inner square is $20^2 = 400$. The area of the convex polygon is the difference of these two areas, which is $400 - 256 = 144$.

This is the correct answer.

Approach:


The expression $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + (\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2$ is equal to zero if and only if $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. This implies that $x + y = \pm 10$ and $x - y = \pm 10$. Solving these equations gives us the vertices of the polygon: $(8, 2), (8, -2), (-8, 2), (-8, -2)$.
Similarly, $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + (\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ if and only if $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$. This implies that $x = \pm 8$ and $y = \pm 8$. Solving these equations gives us the same vertices of the polygon.
Therefore, the vertices of the polygon are $(8, 2), (8, -2), (-8, 2), (-8, -2)$.
The polygon is a square with side length $16$. The area of the square is $16^2 = 256$.

The equation is satisfied when either of the factors is equal to zero. So we need to find the solutions to each factor separately and then find the intersection points. The intersection points of the solutions will form the vertices of the polygon. Finally, we can find the area of the polygon.

1. For $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$, we have $\vert x + y \vert = 10$. This gives us two lines: $x + y = 10$ and $x + y = -10$.
2. For $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$, we have $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. This gives us two lines: $x - y = 10$ and $x - y = -10$.
3. For $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$, we have $\vert x \vert = 8$. This gives us two lines: $x = 8$ and $x = -8$.
4. For $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$, we have $\vert y \vert = 8$. This gives us two lines: $y = 8$ and $y = -8$.

Solving the system of equations formed by the intersections of these lines gives us the vertices of the polygon. Then we can find the area of the polygon.

After calculating, we find that the vertices of the polygon are $(-8, -8), (-8, 8), (8, 8), (8, -8)$. These points form a square with side length 16. The area of a square is side length squared, so the area of this square is $16^2 = 256$.
The answer is: $256$.
