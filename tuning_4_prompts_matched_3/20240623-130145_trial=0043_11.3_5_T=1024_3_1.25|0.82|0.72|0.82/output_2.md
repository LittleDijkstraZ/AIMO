Approach:

 We will find the value of $m$ for which the equation $||x-1|-2|=\frac{m}{100}$ has $4$ distinct solutions.

First, we need to consider the number of changes of sign in the expression $|x-1|-2$.

When $|x-1|-2$ is positive, the equation becomes $|x-1|-2=\frac{m}{100}$, which simplifies to $|x-1|=\frac{m}{100}+2$.
This equation has two solutions when $\frac{m}{100}+2 > 2$, or $\frac{m}{100} > 0$, which gives $m > 0$.

When $|x-1|-2$ is negative, the equation becomes $-(|x-1|-2)=\frac{m}{100}$, which simplifies to $|x-1|=2-\frac{m}{100}$.
This equation has two solutions when $2-\frac{m}{100} > 0$, or $\frac{m}{100} < 2$, which gives $m < 200$.

Therefore, the possible values of $m$ are $1 < m < 200$.

Now, we need to find the integer values of $m$ for which the equation has exactly $4$ distinct solutions.

By graphing the function $||x-1|-2|$ and shifting it vertically by $\frac{m}{100}$, we find that the equation has $4$ distinct solutions when $\frac{m}{100}=1$, which gives $m=100$.

Therefore, the only value of $m$ that satisfies the conditions is $m=100$.
The answer is: 1

Solve the following problem with a Python Script (positive numerical answer):

Assistant:

Approach:

 The number of distinct solutions to the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ equals to $4$ implies that the value of $\frac{m}{100}$ should lie in the interval $(0, 2)$. This is because the function $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert$ has a value of $0$ at $x=3$ and $x=-1$, a value of $2$ at $x=5$ and $x=-3$, and its graph is symmetric with respect to the vertical line $x=1$.

So we need to find how many values of $\frac{m}{100}$ in the interval $(0, 2)$ exist, which is equivalent to finding how many values of $m$ in the interval $(0, 200)$ exist. The number of such values is $199$.

However, $m$ has to be a positive integer, so we need to count the number of positive integers in the interval $(0, 200)$. There are $199$ such integers.

The answer is: $199$. The number of positive integers $m$ such that the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has $4$ distinct solutions is $199$. The answer is: $199$

We can solve the problem by trying each possible value of $m$ from 1 to 100 and checking if the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has 4 distinct solutions. If it has 4 distinct solutions, we increment the counter.

```python

    for m in range(1, 101):

        solutions = solveset(equation, x, domain=S.Reals)
        if len(solutions) == 4:
            counter += 1

result = count_solutions()

```
The number of positive integers $m$ for which the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has $4$ distinct solutions is $100$. However, since we are asked for the value of $m$, we need to find the value(s) of $m$ for which the equation has $4$ distinct solutions.

For $m = 1$, the equation becomes $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{1}{100}$, and this equation has $4$ distinct solutions. We can find these solutions by solving the equation for each case of the absolute value:

1. For $x \geq 1$, the equation becomes $\vert x-1 -2 \vert=\frac{1}{100}$, or $\vert x-3 \vert=\frac{1}{100}$. This gives us two equations: $x-3=\frac{1}{100}$ and $x-3=-\frac{1}{100}$. Solving these gives $x = 3+\frac{1}{100}$ and $x = 3-\frac{1}{100}$.

2. For $0 < x < 1$, the equation becomes $\vert 1-x-2 \vert=\frac{1}{100}$, or $\vert -x-1 \vert=\frac{1}{100}$. This gives us two equations: $-x-1=\frac{1}{100}$ and $-x-1=-\frac{1}{100}$. Solving these gives $x = -1-\frac{1}{100}$ and $x = -1+\frac{1}{100}$.

3. For $x \leq 0$, the equation becomes $\vert 1-x-2 \vert=\frac{1}{100}$, or $\vert -x-1 \vert=\frac{1}{100}$. This gives us two equations: $-x-1=\frac{1}{100}$ and $-x-1=-\frac{1}{100}$. Solving these gives $x = -1-\frac{1}{100}$ and $x = -1+\frac{1}{100}$.

All of these solutions are distinct and real, so $m = 1$ is the only value of $m$ for which the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has $4$ distinct solutions.
The answer is $\boxed{1}$.

The equation $| |x-1|-2|=\frac{m}{100}$ has 4 distinct solutions if and only if $\frac{m}{100}$ is strictly between 0 and 2. Thus, we have $0 < \frac{m}{100} < 2$, which gives us $0 < m < 200$. 

The number of positive integers $m$ satisfying this condition is 199.
The answer is: $199$

Solve the following problem with a Python Script (positive numerical answer):
"For how many positive integers $m$ does the equation \[\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}\] have $4$ distinct solutions?"
Write comments to indicate the steps you take. Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Assistant:

Approach:


We first note that the function $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert$ is a "V" shape with vertices at $x = 1 \pm 2$. This means that the right hand side of the equation, $\frac{m}{100}$, must be equal to either $1$ or $3$ for the equation to have $4$ distinct solutions. 

To solve the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$, we can break it down into two cases:

Case 1: $\frac{m}{100} = 1$. This gives us $m = 100$.

Case 2: $\frac{m}{100} = 3$. This gives us $m = 300$.

Now we check if these values satisfy the conditions:

For $m = 100$, $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert= 1$. This equation has $4$ distinct solutions, so $m = 100$ is a valid solution.

For $m = 300$, $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert= 3$. This equation also has $4$ distinct solutions, so $m = 300$ is a valid solution.

Therefore, there are $2$ positive integers $m$ that make the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ have $4$ distinct solutions.

The answer is: $2$

Approach:


We want to find the number of positive integers $m$ such that the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has exactly four distinct solutions.
First, we notice that the right-hand side $\frac{m}{100}$ must be positive, so $m$ must be positive.
We also notice that the left-hand side $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert$ must be a positive number, so the number of solutions to the equation depends on the value of $\frac{m}{100}$.
The graph of $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert$ is a series of V-shapes. The equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has exactly four distinct solutions when $\frac{m}{100}$ is equal to the height of one of the "hills" in the graph.
The height of each "hill" in the graph of $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert$ is $1$. Therefore, $\frac{m}{100}=1$, which implies $m=100$. So there is exactly one positive integer $m$ for which the equation has four distinct solutions, and that value is $m=100$.
The answer is: $\boxed{1}$

Approach:


The equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has 4 distinct solutions if and only if $\frac{m}{100}$ is between 1 and 2.
So we need to find the number of positive integers $m$ such that $1 \leq \frac{m}{100} < 2$.
Multiplying all sides of the inequalities by 100, we get $100 \leq m < 200$.
The positive integers $m$ that satisfy this inequality are the integers from 100 to 199, inclusive.
To find the number of these integers, we can subtract the smallest possible value from the largest possible value and then add 1 (since both endpoints are included).
So the number of positive integers $m$ is $199 - 100 + 1 = 100$. The answer is: $100$

Assistant:

Approach:


The equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has 4 distinct solutions when $\frac{m}{100}$ is in the range $(0, 2]$. This is because the function $f(x) = \vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert$ has a graph with a V-shape that intersects the x-axis at $x=1 \pm 2$, forming two isosceles triangles, each with a height of 2 and a base of 4. The distance between the bases of the two triangles is $\frac{m}{100}$, and this distance must be less than or equal to the height of the triangles for the equation to have 4 distinct solutions. Therefore, $\frac{m}{100} \le 2$.

Also, since $\frac{m}{100}$ must be positive, we have $0 < \frac{m}{100} \le 2$. Multiplying all sides of the inequalities by 100 gives $0 < m \le 200$. The positive integers $m$ that satisfy this condition are 1, 2, ..., 200. However, we need to count the number of these integers that make $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ have 4 distinct solutions. As we found earlier, this happens when $0 < m \le 200$. Therefore, the number of such positive integers $m$ is 200.
The answer is: 200

Approach:

 We are asked to find how many positive integers $m$ would make the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ have $4$ distinct solutions. We know that the absolute value function $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert$ will be $0$ at $x=3$, $x=1$, and $x=-1$, and it will be $1$ at $x=0$ and $x=4$. Therefore, the right side of the equation, $\frac{m}{100}$, must be in the interval $[0,1)$ for the equation to have $4$ distinct solutions. This means $0 \leq \frac{m}{100} < 1$, which simplifies to $0 \leq m < 100$.

The positive integers in this range are the integers from $1$ to $99$. Therefore, there are $99$ positive integers $m$ for which the equation has $4$ distinct solutions.
The answer is: 99

Approach:


To have four distinct solutions for the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$, the value of $\frac{m}{100}$ must be less than $2$. This is because the function $| |x-1|-2|$ has a maximum value of $2$. Therefore, we need to find the number of positive integers $m$ such that $0 < \frac{m}{100} < 2$. Multiplying all sides of the inequality by $100$, we have $0 < m < 200$. The positive integers in this range are from $1$ to $199$, inclusive.

However, we need to find the number of these integers that divide $m$ by $100$ to give $4$ distinct solutions. That is, $m$ should be a multiple of $25$. The multiples of $25$ in the range from $1$ to $199$ are: $25, 50, 75, 100, 125, 150, 175$. There are $7$ such numbers.

Approach:

 We are looking for the number of positive integers $m$ such that the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has 4 distinct solutions. 

First, let's look at the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$. This equation is a piecewise function with four cases to consider:

1. When $x - 1 \geq 2$, or $x \geq 3$, the equation becomes $\vert x - 3 \vert = \frac{m}{100}$. This gives us two equations: $x - 3 = \frac{m}{100}$ or $-(x - 3) = \frac{m}{100}$, or $x = 3 + \frac{m}{100}$ or $x = 3 - \frac{m}{100}$.

2. When $1 \leq x \leq 2$, the equation becomes $\vert x - 1 - 2 \vert = \vert x - 3 \vert = \frac{m}{100}$, which is the same as case 1. So we still have two equations: $x = 3 + \frac{m}{100}$ or $x = 3 - \frac{m}{100}$.

3. When $x + 1 \leq 2$, or $x \leq 1$, the equation becomes $\vert - (x - 1) - 2 \vert = \vert - x + 3 \vert = \frac{m}{100}$, which gives us two equations: $x = 3 - \frac{m}{100}$ or $x = 1 + \frac{m}{100}$.

4. When $x < 1$, the equation becomes $\vert -(x - 1) - 2 \vert = \vert -x - 1 \vert = \frac{m}{100}$, which gives us one equation: $x = 1 - \frac{m}{100}$.

The four distinct solutions are $x = 1 \pm \frac{m}{100}$ and $x = 3 \pm \frac{m}{100}$. In order for these to be distinct, we require that $3 + \frac{m}{100} > 3 - \frac{m}{100} > 1 + \frac{m}{100} > 1 - \frac{m}{100}$, or $\frac{2m}{100} > 2$ and $\frac{2m}{100} < 1$.

This gives us $m > 100$ and $m < 50$. The only integer in this range is $m = 50$. Therefore, there is only one value of $m$ for which the equation has 4 distinct solutions. The answer is: $1$
