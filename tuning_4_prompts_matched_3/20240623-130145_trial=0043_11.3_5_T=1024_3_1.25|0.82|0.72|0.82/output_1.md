Approach:



First, we need to observe that the expression $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ can be written as $\frac{5}{2}[(x-y)^2 + (x-2y)^2]$.

This is a sum of squares and is always non-negative. Therefore, the minimum value of this expression occurs when $(x-y)^2 + (x-2y)^2 = 0$. This implies $x = y = \frac{40}{4} = 10$.

Now, we substitute $x = y = 10$ into the expression $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ to find its minimum value.

We have $5(10)^2 + 5(10)^2 - 8(10)(10) = 500 + 500 - 800 = 200$.

However, we also need to satisfy the condition $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$.

Substituting $x = y = 10$ into this equation, we indeed have $|10 - 2(10)| + |10 - 2(10)| = | -10 | + | -10 | = 20$, which is not equal to 40.

So we made a mistake. Let's reconsider the expression $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$.

Notice that $5x^2+5y^2-8xy = \frac{5}{2}[(x-y)^2 + (x-2y)^2] = \frac{5}{2}[(x-y)^2 + 4(y-x)^2] = \frac{5}{2}[(-3)(x-y)^2]$.

The expression is minimized when $(x-y)^2 = 0$, which implies $x = y$.

So we need to solve the equation $|x-2x| + |x-2x| = 40$, which simplifies to $| -x | + | -x | = 40$, or $2|x| = 40$, which gives $|x| = 20$. So $x = \pm 20$.

When $x = 20$, $y = 20$, the minimum value of the expression is $5(20)^2 + 5(20)^2 - 8(20)(20) = 200$.

When $x = -20$, $y = -20$, the minimum value of the expression is also $200$.

So the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ is $200$. The answer is: $200$

First, let's rewrite the given equation $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$. Notice that $|x-2y| = |-(2x-y)| = |2x-y|$ and $|y-2x| = |-(2y-x)| = |2y-x|$. So we have $|2x-y| + |2y-x| = 40$. Now, let's set $u = 2x-y$ and $v = 2y-x$, then we have $|u| + |v| = 40$.

Since $|u| + |v| = 40$ implies that $u^2 + v^2 = 40^2 = 1600$, which is a circle with radius 40 in the uv-plane.

Now, let's substitute $u = 2x-y$ and $v = 2y-x$ back into the expression $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$:
\[5x^2+5y^2-8xy = \frac{5}{2}(u^2+v^2) = \frac{5}{2} \cdot 1600 = 4000.\]

So the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ is 4000 when $x$ and $y$ satisfy $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$. The answer is: $4000$

Approach:



The problem is to find the minimum value of the expression $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ given the condition $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$. This is a constrained optimization problem. We can solve it by first expressing the constraint in a simpler form and then using the method of Lagrange multipliers.

Step 1: Simplify the constraint
The given constraint is $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$. We can simplify this by using the property $|a - b| = |b - a|$. So we have:
$$|x-2y| + |2y-x| = 40.$$
Now we can replace $2y - x$ with $- (x - 2y)$, which gives:
$$|x-2y| - |x-2y| = 40.$$
This simplifies to $0 = 40$, which is a contradiction. So the given constraint must be wrong. Let's correct it.

The correct constraint is $|x-2y| + |2x-y| = 40$. Now we can replace $2x - y$ with $- (y - 2x)$, which gives:
$$|x-2y| - |y-2x| = 40.$$
This simplifies to:
$$|x-2y| - |2y-x| = 40.$$
Now we can replace $2y - x$ with $- (x - 2y)$, which gives:
$$|x-2y| + |x-2y| = 40.$$
This simplifies to $2|x-2y| = 40$, so $|x-2y| = 20$.

Step 2: Use the method of Lagrange multipliers
Now we can use the method of Lagrange multipliers to solve the problem. Let's define a new function:
$$F(x, y, \lambda) = 5x^2 + 5y^2 - 8xy + \lambda (x - 2y - 20).$$
To find the minimum value of the expression, we need to find the critical points of $F(x, y, \lambda)$ by setting its partial derivatives with respect to $x$, $y$, and $\lambda$ equal to zero:
$$\frac{\partial F}{\partial x} = 10x - 8y + \lambda = 0,$$
$$\frac{\partial F}{\partial y} = 10y - 8x - 2\lambda = 0,$$
$$\frac{\partial F}{\partial \lambda} = x - 2y - 20 = 0.$$
Solving this system of equations, we find:
$$x = 4, y = 6.$$

Step 3: Find the minimum value
Now we can substitute $x = 4$ and $y = 6$ into the expression $5x^2 + 5y^2 - 8xy$:
$$5(4)^2 + 5(6)^2 - 8(4)(6) = 80 + 180 - 96 = 164.$$
So the minimum value of $5x^2 + 5y^2 - 8xy$ is 164.

The answer is: $164$

Approach:



First, we recognize that the given equation $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$ is always true.

So, we can ignore this equation and focus on minimizing the expression $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$.

Let's denote $S = 5x^2+5y^2-8xy$. We want to find the minimum value of $S$.

To do this, we can complete the square for $S$:

\[S = 5(x^2- \frac{8}{5}xy + y^2) = 5[(x^2 - \frac{8}{5}xy + \frac{16}{25}y^2) - \frac{16}{25}y^2 + y^2] = 5[(\sqrt{x}-\frac{4}{5}y)^2 + \frac{9}{25}y^2]\]

Now we can see that the square part is always non-negative, i.e., $(\sqrt{x}-\frac{4}{5}y)^2 \geq 0$ and $\frac{9}{25}y^2 \geq 0$.

So the minimum value of $S$ is achieved when both these square parts are zero, which means $x = \frac{4}{5}y$.

Substitute $x = \frac{4}{5}y$ into the expression $S$, we get:

\[S = 5[(\frac{4}{5}y - \frac{4}{5}y)^2 + \frac{9}{25}y^2] = 5 \cdot \frac{9}{25}y^2 = \frac{9}{5}y^2.\]

Since $y$ can be any real number, the minimum value of $S$ is achieved when $y = 0$, and we get $S_{min} = 0$.

Therefore, the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ when $x$ and $y$ range over all real numbers is $0$. The answer is: $0$

Write comments to indicate the steps you take. Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Assistant:

Approach:


The first step is to recognize that the expression $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ can be rewritten as $5(x^2-1.6xy+y^2)$. Then, we complete the square inside the parentheses to get $5((x-0.8y)^2 + 0.36y^2)$. This expression is always non-negative, because the square of a real number is always non-negative, and the sum of two non-negative numbers is also non-negative. Therefore, the minimum value of this expression is 0, which occurs when $x = 0.8y$.

The second step is to solve the equation $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$. We know that $x = 0.8y$, so we substitute this into the equation to get $|0.8y - 2y| + |y - 1.6y| = 40$. Simplifying this gives $| -1.2y | + | -0.6y | = 40$, which further simplifies to $1.8y = 40$. Solving for $y$ gives $y = \frac{40}{1.8} = \frac{200}{9}$.

Finally, substituting $y = \frac{200}{9}$ into the equation $x = 0.8y$ gives $x = 0.8 \cdot \frac{200}{9} = \frac{160}{9}$.

So the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ when $x$ and $y$ satisfy $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$ is 0.
The answer is: $0$

Assistant:

Approach:


To find the minimum value of the expression $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ under the constraint $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$, we can use the method of Lagrange multipliers. We introduce a new variable $\lambda$ and form the function $F(x, y, \lambda) = 5x^2 + 5y^2 - 8xy + \lambda(|x-2y| + |y-2x| - 40)$.

Now, we take the partial derivatives of $F$ with respect to $x$, $y$, and $\lambda$, and set them equal to zero:

$\frac{\partial F}{\partial x} = 10x - 8y + \lambda(-1 + 2\text{sgn}(x - 2y)) = 0$,
$\frac{\partial F}{\partial y} = 10y - 8x + \lambda(2 - 1\text{sgn}(y - 2x)) = 0$,
$\frac{\partial F}{\partial \lambda} = |x - 2y| + |y - 2x| - 40 = 0$.

Here, $\text{sgn}(u)$ denotes the sign of $u$.

Solving these equations simultaneously can be quite challenging. However, we can simplify the problem by observing that the constraint equation implies that $x = 2y$ or $y = 2x$. If $x = 2y$, then $|x - 2y| = 0$, and $|y - 2x| = |-x| = |x|$. So, $|x - 2y| + |y - 2x| = |x| + |-x| = 2|x| = 40$, which implies $|x| = 20$. Similarly, if $y = 2x$, we get $|y - 2x| = 0$ and $|x - 2y| = |-y| = |y|$, so $|x - 2y| + |y - 2x| = |y| + |-y| = 2|y| = 40$, which implies $|y| = 20$.

Now, we can substitute $x = 2y$ or $y = 2x$ into the expression $5x^2 + 5y^2 - 8xy$ and simplify:

If $x = 2y$, then $5x^2 + 5y^2 - 8xy = 5(2y)^2 + 5y^2 - 8(2y)y = 20y^2 + 5y^2 - 16y^2 = 9y^2$.
If $y = 2x$, then $5x^2 + 5y^2 - 8xy = 5x^2 + 5(2x)^2 - 8x(2x) = 5x^2 + 20x^2 - 16x^2 = 9x^2$.

In both cases, the expression simplifies to $9x^2$ or $9y^2$. Since $|x| = 20$ or $|y| = 20$, we have $x^2 = y^2 = 400$, and so the expression becomes $9(400) = 3600$.

Therefore, the minimum value of $5x^2 + 5y^2 - 8xy$ under the given constraint is $3600$.

The value is 3600. The answer is: $3600$

This is a problem of optimization with a constraint. To solve it, we can use the method of Lagrange multipliers. We introduce a new variable $\lambda$ and form the function:
\[F(x, y, \lambda) = 5x^2 + 5y^2 - 8xy + \lambda (|x-2y| + |y-2x| - 40).\]
We then find the partial derivatives of $F$ with respect to $x$, $y$, and $\lambda$, and set them equal to zero:
\[\frac{\partial F}{\partial x} = 10x - 8y + \lambda(-1 + 2\text{sgn}(x-2y)) = 0,\]
\[\frac{\partial F}{\partial y} = 10y - 8x + \lambda(1 - 2\text{sgn}(y-2x)) = 0,\]
\[\frac{\partial F}{\partial \lambda} = |x-2y| + |y-2x| - 40 = 0.\]
Here, $\text{sgn}(u)$ is the sign function, which is equal to 1 if $u > 0$, -1 if $u < 0$, and 0 if $u = 0$.

The constraint equation $\frac{\partial F}{\partial \lambda} = 0$ gives us $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$.

The other two equations give us two equations for $x$ and $y$ in terms of $\lambda$:
\[10x - 8y = \lambda(1 - 2\text{sgn}(x-2y)),\]
\[10y - 8x = \lambda(1 - 2\text{sgn}(y-2x)).\]

By solving these equations, we can find the critical points of the function $5x^2 + 5y^2 - 8xy$ subject to the constraint $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$. We then evaluate the function at these critical points to find the minimum value.

Solution:

We will solve the equations
\[10x - 8y = \lambda(1 - 2\text{sgn}(x-2y)),\]
\[10y - 8x = \lambda(1 - 2\text{sgn}(y-2x)).\]

First, consider the case when $x > 2y$. Then $\text{sgn}(x-2y) = 1$ and $\text{sgn}(y-2x) = -1$. The equations become
\[10x - 8y = \lambda(1 - 2),\]
\[10y - 8x = \lambda(1 + 2).\]
Simplifying, we get
\[10x - 8y = -\lambda,\]
\[10y - 8x = 3\lambda.\]
Solving these equations simultaneously, we get
\[x = \frac{4}{3}y.\]
Substituting this into the constraint equation $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$, we get
\[|y - \frac{6}{3}y| + |\frac{4}{3}y - 2y| = 40,\]
\[|-\frac{2}{3}y| + |\frac{-2}{3}y| = 40,\]
\[\frac{2}{3}y + \frac{2}{3}y = 40,\]
\[40y = 40 \Rightarrow y = 1.\]
Then $x = \frac{4}{3}$. Substituting these values into the function $5x^2 + 5y^2 - 8xy$, we get
\[5(\frac{4}{3})^2 + 5(1)^2 - 8(\frac{4}{3})(1) = \frac{80}{9} + 5 - \frac{32}{3} = \frac{80 - 240 + 135}{9} = -\frac{25}{9}.\]

Now, consider the case when $x < 2y$. Then $\text{sgn}(x-2y) = -1$ and $\text{sgn}(y-2x) = 1$. The equations become
\[10x - 8y = \lambda(1 + 2),\]
\[10y - 8x = \lambda(1 - 2).\]
Simplifying, we get
\[10x - 8y = 3\lambda,\]
\[10y - 8x = -\lambda.\]
Solving these equations simultaneously, we get
\[x = \frac{3}{4}y.\]
Substituting this into the constraint equation $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$, we get
\[|\frac{5}{4}y| + |\frac{-5}{4}y| = 40,\]
\[\frac{5}{4}y + \frac{5}{4}y = 40,\]
\[10y = 40 \Rightarrow y = 4.\]
Then $x = 3$. Substituting these values into the function $5x^2 + 5y^2 - 8xy$, we get
\[5(3)^2 + 5(4)^2 - 8(3)(4) = 45 + 80 - 96 = 29.\]

Finally, consider the case when $x = 2y$. Then the constraint equation becomes
\[|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 0,\]
which implies $x = y = 0$. But this gives us $0$ when we substitute into the function $5x^2 + 5y^2 - 8xy$.

Therefore, the minimum value of $5x^2 + 5y^2 - 8xy$ subject to the constraint $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$ is $-\frac{25}{9}$, which occurs at $(x, y) = (\frac{4}{3}, 1)$.

So the minimum value of $5x^2 + 5y^2 - 8xy$ is $-\frac{25}{9}$.

The answer is: $-\frac{25}{9}$.

Solve the following problem with a Python Script (positive numerical answer):
"What is the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ when $x$ and $y$ range over all real numbers such that $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$?"

Approach:



This problem requires a bit of clever algebraic manipulation and recognizing the expression as a perfect square. We are given the equation $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$. We can rewrite this as $|x-2y| + |2y-x| = 40$. By the property of absolute value, $|a| = |-a|$, we know that $|x-2y| = |2y-x|$. So we can simplify the equation to $2|x-2y| = 40$, or $|x-2y| = 20$.

Now let's consider the expression $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$. We can rewrite this as $5(x^2 + y^2 - \frac{8}{5}xy)$. Now, we recognize that the term in the parentheses is similar to the square of a binomial, except for the $-\frac{8}{5}xy$. To complete the square, we need to add and subtract $(\frac{4}{5}y)^2$ inside the parentheses. So we get:
\[5(x^2 + y^2 - \frac{8}{5}xy + (\frac{4}{5}y)^2 - (\frac{4}{5}y)^2) = 5[(x-\frac{4}{5}y)^2 - (\frac{4}{5}y)^2].\]
Now we can see that the expression inside the square brackets is minimized when $(x-\frac{4}{5}y)^2$ is minimized, since the square of a real number is always non-negative, and the term $-(\frac{4}{5}y)^2$ is just a constant. The minimum value of $(x-\frac{4}{5}y)^2$ is achieved when $x=\frac{4}{5}y$, which is exactly the condition we derived from the given equation $|x-2y| = 20$.

Substituting $x=\frac{4}{5}y$ into the expression inside the square brackets, we get:
\[5[(\frac{4}{5}y-\frac{4}{5}y)^2 - (\frac{4}{5}y)^2] = -(\frac{16}{5}y)^2 = -\frac{256}{25}y^2.\]
Since $y^2$ is always non-negative, the minimum value of $-\frac{256}{25}y^2$ is achieved when $y^2 = 0$, which implies $y=0$. Substituting $y=0$ into $x=\frac{4}{5}y$, we get $x=0$.

Now substituting $x=0$ and $y=0$ into the expression $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$, we get:
\[5(0)^2 + 5(0)^2 - 8(0)(0) = 0.\]
So the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ under the given condition is 0. The answer is: $0$
