Interesting, let's analyze step by step:



The equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has 4 distinct solutions. The right-hand side of the equation is a fraction with denominator 100, and the absolute value function makes it difficult to directly solve for $x$. However, we can consider the cases for the inner absolute value function, $\vert x-1 \vert -2$.

Case 1: $\vert x-1 \vert -2 > 0$. Then $\vert x-1 \vert > 2$, which implies $x-1 > 2$ or $x-1 < -2$. This gives us $x > 3$ or $x < -1$.

Case 2: $\vert x-1 \vert -2 = 0$. Then $\vert x-1 \vert = 2$, which implies $x-1 = 2$ or $x-1 = -2$. This gives us $x = 3$ or $x = -1$.

Case 3: $\vert x-1 \vert -2 < 0$. Then $\vert x-1 \vert < 2$, which implies $-2 < x-1 < 2$. This gives us $-1 < x < 3$.

Now, we consider the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$. For this equation to have 4 distinct solutions, the value of $\frac{m}{100}$ must be equal to the distance between the critical points in each case.

In Case 1, the distance between $x > 3$ and $x < -1$ is 4. So, $\frac{m}{100} = 2$. This gives us $m = 200$.

In Case 3, the distance between $-1 < x < 3$ and the endpoints $x = -1$ and $x = 3$ is 2. So, $\frac{m}{100} = 1$. This gives us $m = 100$.

Therefore, the possible values of $m$ are 100 and 200. However, we are asked for the number of positive integer solutions, so we only consider $m = 200$. Thus, there is only one positive integer value of $m$ that satisfies the given condition.

The answer is: $1$

Interesting, let's analyze step by step:



The equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has 4 distinct solutions. This means that the right side of the equation, $\frac{m}{100}$, must be equal to 2. This is because the absolute value function $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert$ will be equal to 2 only for 4 distinct values of $x$.

So, we have $\frac{m}{100} = 2$, which gives $m = 200$.

Now, we need to check if $m = 200$ is a positive integer. It is, so the number of positive integers $m$ for which the equation has 4 distinct solutions is 1.

The answer is: $1$

Interesting, let's analyze step by step:



The equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has 4 distinct solutions. The right side of the equation, $\frac{m}{100}$, must be positive, so $m$ must be positive.

The number of solutions of the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=k$ depends on the value of $k$. Specifically, it has 4 distinct solutions when $k=1$. Therefore, we need $\frac{m}{100}=1$, which gives $m=100$.

So, the value of $m$ that makes the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ have 4 distinct solutions is $100$. Since $100$ is a positive integer, the answer is:

\[100\]
The answer is: $100$

Interesting, let's analyze step by step:



1. The equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has four distinct solutions. This means that the right side of the equation, $\frac{m}{100}$, must be equal to $2$. 

2. If we set $\frac{m}{100} = 2$, we can solve for $m$ to get $m = 200$.

Now, let's verify that this value of $m$ indeed gives us four distinct solutions. Substitute $m = 200$ into the equation, we get $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{200}{100}=2$.

This simplifies to $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=2$.

The equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=2$ has four distinct solutions: $x = -1, 1, 5, 7$.

Therefore, the value of $m$ that gives four distinct solutions is $m = 200$. Since $200$ is a positive integer, our solution is valid.

So, the number of positive integers $m$ for which the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has four distinct solutions is $1$. The answer is: $1$
