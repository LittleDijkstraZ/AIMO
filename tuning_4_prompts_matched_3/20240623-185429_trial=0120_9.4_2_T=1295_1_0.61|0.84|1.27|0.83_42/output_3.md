Interesting, let's analyze step by step:



The equation is $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + (\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + (\vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$.

For this equation to equal zero, either one of the terms must equal zero. This means either:

1. $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$, which implies $\vert x + y \vert = 10$.
2. $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$, which implies $\vert x - y \vert = 10$.
3. $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$, which implies $\vert x \vert = 8$.
4. $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$, which implies $\vert y \vert = 8$.

From 3 and 4, we have $-8 \leq x, y \leq 8$.

From 1 and 2, we have two cases:

Case 1: $x + y = 10$ or $x + y = -10$.
Case 2: $x - y = 10$ or $x - y = -10$.

By solving these four equations, we find that the points that satisfy the conditions are:

$(5, 5), (5, -5), (-5, 5), (-5, -5), (8, 2), (8, -2), (-8, 2), (-8, -2), (2, 8), (2, -8), (-2, 8), (-2, -8)$.

These points form a square with side length 10, so the area of the square is $10^2 = 100$.

The answer is: $100$

Interesting, let's analyze step by step:



The equation is given as:
\[((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0\]

This equation is equal to zero if either of the two factors is zero. Therefore, we have two sets of equations:

1. $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ and $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$
2. $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ and $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$

From the first set of equations, we have:

1. $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$
2. $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$

From the second set of equations, we have:

1. $\vert x - y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$
2. $\vert x - y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$

The solutions to these equations are the vertices of the polygon. The polygon is a square with side length 16 (since $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$ means that the distance from the origin to the vertices is 8 in both the x and y directions).

The area of the square is therefore $16^2 = 256$. So the area of the polygon is 256 square units.

The answer is: $256$

Interesting, let's analyze step by step:



The equation is $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + (\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + (\vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$.

The only way this equation can be equal to zero is if either of the two terms equals zero. So we have two cases:

1. $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ and $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + (\vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$.
2. $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ and $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + (\vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$.

From the first case, we have $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x \vert = 8$, $\vert y \vert = 8$. This gives us a square with side length 16.

From the second case, we have $\vert x - y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x \vert = 8$, $\vert y \vert = 8$. This also gives us a square with side length 16.

Therefore, the area of the convex polygon is the area of one of these squares. The area of a square is side length squared, so the area is $16^2 = 256$.

So the area of the convex polygon is 256 square units.
The answer is: $256$

Interesting, let's analyze step by step:



The given equation is a product of two terms equal to zero. Therefore, either the first term is zero or the second term is zero.

The first term is $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)$. This term equals zero if and only if both $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. This means that the sum of the absolute values of x and y is always 10, and the absolute value of the difference of x and y is always 10. This is the condition for a square with side length 10.

The second term is $((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2)$. This term equals zero if and only if both $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$. This means that the absolute values of x and y are always 8. This is the condition for a square with side length 8.

Therefore, the points satisfying the given equation are the vertices of two squares: one with side length 10 and the other with side length 8.

The area of a square is given by the square of its side length. Therefore, the area of the square with side length 10 is $10^2 = 100$, and the area of the square with side length 8 is $8^2 = 64$.

The convex polygon formed by the points satisfying the given equation is the union of these two squares. Therefore, its area is the sum of the areas of these two squares, which is $100 + 64 = 164$.

So, the area of the convex polygon is 164. This is a positive integer, as required. The answer is: $164$

The equation given is $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$.

This equation equals to zero if either of the two factors equals zero. So we have two cases:

1. $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$. This can only happen if $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. This means $x + y = \pm 10$ and $x - y = \pm 10$. Solving these equations gives us the vertices of the polygon: $(0, 10), (0, -10), (10, 0), (-10, 0)$.

2. $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$. This can only happen if $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$. This means $x = \pm 8$ and $y = \pm 8$. Solving these equations gives us the vertices of the polygon: $(8, 0), (-8, 0), (0, 8), (0, -8)$.

So the vertices of the polygon are $(0, 10), (0, -10), (10, 0), (-10, 0), (8, 0), (-8, 0), (0, 8), (0, -8)$.

To find the area of the polygon, we can use the Shoelace formula. The Shoelace formula takes the coordinates of the vertices of a polygon, in order, and computes the area of the polygon. If the vertices are $(x_1, y_1), (x_2, y_2), \dots, (x_n, y_n)$, the area is given by:

$$\frac{1}{2} \left| (x_1y_2 + x_2y_3 + \dots + x_ny_1) - (y_1x_2 + y_2x_3 + \dots + y_nx_1) \right|.$$

Applying the Shoelace formula to the vertices $(0, 10), (0, -10), (10, 0), (-10, 0), (8, 0), (-8, 0), (0, 8), (0, -8)$, we get:

$$\frac{1}{2} \left| (0 \cdot (-10) + 0 \cdot 0 + 10 \cdot 0 + (-10) \cdot 0 + 8 \cdot 0 + 0 \cdot (-8) + 0 \cdot 10 + 0 \cdot 0) - (10 \cdot 0 + 0 \cdot (-10) + 0 \cdot 10 + 0 \cdot (-10) + 0 \cdot 8 + (-8) \cdot 0 + 0 \cdot 0 + 0 \cdot 10) \right| = \frac{1}{2} \left| 0 - 0 \right| = 0.$$

However, the area of the polygon is 0, which is not possible. This means we must have made a mistake in our calculations. Let's retrace our steps and check for errors.

Upon reexamination, we realize that the second case, $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$, leads to the vertices $(8, 0), (-8, 0), (0, 8), (0, -8)$, which form a square with side length 16. The area of this square is $16^2 = 256$.

However, we made a mistake in the first case. The correct equations from the first case are $x + y = \pm 10$ and $x - y = \pm 10$. Solving these equations gives us the vertices of the polygon: $(5, 5), (5, -5), (-5, 5), (-5, -5)$. These vertices form a square with side length 10. The area of this square is $10^2 = 100$.

Now, we add the areas of the two squares to find the total area of the polygon: $100 + 256 = 356$.

However, we made another mistake. The vertices from the first case, $(5, 5), (5, -5), (-5, 5), (-5, -5)$, do not form a square but a rhombus. The diagonals of this rhombus are $10\sqrt{2}$ and $10$, and the area is $\frac{1}{2} \cdot 10 \cdot 10\sqrt{2} = 50\sqrt{2}$. The area of the square from the second case is still 256.

Adding these two areas, we get $50\sqrt{2} + 256$. However, this is not a positive integer. We must have made another mistake.

Upon reexamination, we realize that we made a mistake in the Shoelace formula. The correct Shoelace formula for a polygon with vertices $(x_1, y_1), (x_2, y_2), \dots, (x_n, y_n)$ is:

$$\frac{1}{2} \left| (x_1y_2 + x_2y_3 + \dots + x_ny_1) - (y_1x_2 + y_2x_3 + \dots + y_nx_1) \right|.$$

However, when we apply this formula to the vertices $(5, 5), (5, -5), (-5, 5), (-5, -5)$, we get:

$$\frac{1}{2} \left| (5 \cdot (-5) + 5 \cdot 5 + (-5) \cdot (-5) + (-5) \cdot 5) - (5 \cdot 5 + (-5) \cdot (-5) + 5 \cdot (-5) + (-5) \cdot 5) \right| = \frac{1}{2} \left| 0 - 0 \right| = 0.$$

This means we must have made another mistake. Let's retrace our steps again.

Upon reexamination, we realize that we made a mistake in the first case. The correct equations from the first case are $x + y = \pm 10$ and $x - y = \pm 10$. Solving these equations gives us the vertices of the polygon: $(5, 5), (5, -5), (-5, 5), (-5, -5)$. These vertices form a square with side length 10.

Interesting, let's analyze step by step:



The equation is given as:

$$((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0.$$

This equation equals zero if either of the two factors equals zero. So, we have two cases:

1. $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$.
2. $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$.

For the first case, we have $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. This implies that $x + y = \pm 10$ and $x - y = \pm 10$. Solving these equations gives us the vertices of the square.

For the second case, we have $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$. This implies that $x = \pm 8$ and $y = \pm 8$. Solving these equations gives us the vertices of the square.

The vertices of the square are:

$$(8, 8), (8, -8), (-8, 8), (-8, -8).$$

The side length of the square is 16. The area of the square is the side length squared, so the area is $16^2 = 256$.

Therefore, the area of the convex polygon is 256.

Since 256 is a positive integer, we can conclude that the area of the convex polygon is 256. The answer is: $256$

Assistant:

Interesting, let's analyze step by step:



1. The given equation is a product of two terms equal to zero. This means that either the first term is zero or the second term is zero.
2. Each term is a sum of squares, which means that each term is non-negative. Therefore, for the product to be zero, both terms must be zero.
3. The first term gives us $\vert x + y \vert - 10 = 0$ and $\vert x - y \vert - 10 = 0$, which simplifies to $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$.
4. The second term gives us $\vert x \vert - 8 = 0$ and $\vert y \vert - 8 = 0$, which simplifies to $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$.
5. Solving these equations, we find that the points that satisfy the equations are $(8,8)$, $(-8,8)$, $(8,-8)$, and $(-8,-8)$.
6. These points form a square with side length 16.
7. The area of this square is $16^2 = 256$.

Now, let's verify that the answer is a positive integer:

```python
