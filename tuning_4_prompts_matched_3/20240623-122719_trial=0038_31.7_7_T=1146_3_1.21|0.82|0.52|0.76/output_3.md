Solve the following problem with a Python Script (positive numerical answer):
"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"

Approach:



The equation $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ is satisfied if either of the two factors is zero. This means that either $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$.

The first equation is only satisfied when $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. These conditions represent a square with side length 10, centered at the origin.

The second equation is only satisfied when $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$. These conditions represent a square with side length 16, centered at the origin.

Therefore, the region enclosed by the points satisfying the given equation is the intersection of these two squares, which is a smaller square with side length 10.

The area of a square is given by the square of the side length. Therefore, the area of the enclosed region is $10^2 = 100$.

So, the area of the convex polygon is 100 square units. The answer is: $100$

Solve the following problem with a Python Script (positive numerical answer):
"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"

Approach:


The expression $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ is equal to zero if and only if at least one of the factors is equal to zero.
This means that either $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$.

For $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$, we have $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. This gives us a square with side length $20$.

For $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$, we have $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$. This gives us a square with side length $16$.

The area of the convex polygon formed by the union of these two squares is the sum of their areas: $20^2 + 16^2 = 400 + 256 = 656$.

So the area of the convex polygon is $656$.

The answer is: $656$

Solve the following problem with a Python Script (positive numerical answer):
"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"

Assistant:

Approach:

 The expression $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ is true if either of the two expressions in the product equals zero. This gives us two sets of equations to solve:
1. $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ and $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$.
2. $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ and $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$.
For each set of equations, we have:
1. $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x \vert = 8$.
2. $\vert x - y \vert = 10$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$.
This results in a square with side length 16, as shown in the figure below:
[asy]
unitsize(1 cm);

draw((-8,-8)--(8,-8)--(8,8)--(-8,8)--cycle);

label("$16$", (0,-8), S);
label("$16$", (8,0), E);
label("$16$", (0,8), N);
label("$16$", (-8,0), W);
[/asy]
The area of the square is therefore $16^2 = 256$. So the area of the convex polygon is 256. The answer is: $256$

"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"

Approach:


The equation $f(x,y) = 0$ implies that either $f_1(x,y) = (\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ or $f_2(x,y) = (\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$.
If $f_1(x,y) = 0$, then $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$, which implies that $x + y = \pm 10$ and $x - y = \pm 10$. Solving these equations gives the vertices of the polygon: $(0, 10)$, $(0, -10)$, $(10, 0)$, $(-10, 0)$, $(8, 8)$, $(-8, 8)$, $(8, -8)$, and $(-8, -8)$.
If $f_2(x,y) = 0$, then $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$, which implies that $x = \pm 8$ and $y = \pm 8$.
The vertices of the polygon are the intersection points of the equations $x + y = \pm 10$ and $x - y = \pm 10$, and the equations $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$.
To find the area of the polygon, we can divide it into four triangles: one with vertices at $(0, 10)$, $(0, -10)$, and $(10, 0)$, another with vertices at $(0, 10)$, $(0, -10)$, and $(-10, 0)$, a third with vertices at $(8, 8)$, $(8, -8)$, and $(0, 10)$, and the fourth with vertices at $(8, 8)$, $(8, -8)$, and $(0, -10)$.
The area of each triangle can be found using the formula for the area of a triangle given by coordinates: $\frac{1}{2} \vert x_1(y_2 - y_3) + x_2(y_3 - y_1) + x_3(y_1 - y_2)\vert$, where $(x_1, y_1)$, $(x_2, y_2)$, and $(x_3, y_3)$ are the coordinates of the vertices of the triangle.
The area of each triangle is 100 square units. Since there are four triangles, the total area of the polygon is $4 \times 100 = 400$ square units. The answer is: $400$

Solve the following problem with a Python Script (positive numerical answer):

Approach:



The equation $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + (\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + (\vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ equals zero if either $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + (\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + (\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$.

For the first case, we have $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$, which implies $x + y = \pm 10$ and $x - y = \pm 10$. Solving these four equations, we get the vertices of the polygon as $(0, 10), (0, -10), (10, 0), (-10, 0)$.

For the second case, we have $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$, which implies $x = \pm 8$ and $y = \pm 8$. Solving these four equations, we get the vertices of the polygon as $(8, 8), (8, -8), (-8, 8), (-8, -8)$.

The vertices obtained from the first case and the second case form a square with side length $10$. Therefore, the area of the square is $10^2 = 100$. The answer is: $100$

Approach:



The equation given is a product of two expressions equal to zero. This means that either the first expression is zero or the second expression is zero. 

Let's consider the two cases:

1. $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$:

This implies that $\vert x + y \vert - 10 = 0$ and $\vert x - y \vert - 10 = 0$, which further simplifies to $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. This means that the points $(x, y)$ lie on the lines $x + y = 10$ and $x - y = 10$.

2. $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$:

This implies that $\vert x \vert - 8 = 0$ and $\vert y \vert - 8 = 0$, which further simplifies to $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$. This means that the points $(x, y)$ lie on the lines $x = 8$ and $y = 8$.

Putting these together, the points $(x, y)$ that satisfy the equation lie on the lines $x + y = 10$, $x - y = 10$, $x = 8$, and $y = 8$. These lines enclose a square with side length $20$. The area of the square is therefore $20^2 = 400$. The answer is: $400$

Approach:


The given equation is a product of two expressions equal to zero, which means either one of the expressions must be zero. So we have two cases to consider:
Case 1: $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$
Case 2: $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$

For Case 1, both $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2$ and $( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2$ must be zero. This means $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. This results in a square with side length 10, centered at the origin.

For Case 2, both $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2$ and $( \vert y \vert - 8)^2$ must be zero. This means $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$. This results in a square with side length 16, centered at the origin.

The intersection of these two squares is the convex polygon we are looking for. The area of this polygon is the area of the smaller square, which is $(10)^2 = 100$.

So the area of the convex polygon is 100 square units. The answer is: $100$

Write comments to indicate the steps you take. Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Assistant:

Approach:

 The given equation is a product of two terms being equal to zero, so either one of the terms should be zero. This implies that either $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$.

The solutions to each of these equations are as follows:

1. $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0 \implies \vert x + y \vert = 10 \implies x + y = \pm 10$. This gives us two lines $x + y = 10$ and $x + y = -10$.

2. $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0 \implies \vert x - y \vert = 10 \implies x - y = \pm 10$. This gives us two lines $x - y = 10$ and $x - y = -10$.

3. $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0 \implies \vert x \vert = 8 \implies x = \pm 8$. This gives us two lines $x = 8$ and $x = -8$.

4. $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0 \implies \vert y \vert = 8 \implies y = \pm 8$. This gives us two lines $y = 8$ and $y = -8$.

These lines form a rectangle with side lengths 16 and 20. The area of this rectangle is $16 \times 20 = 320$. Therefore, the area of the convex polygon is 320 square units. The answer is: $320$

Approach:


The given equation is of the form $AB=0$, which implies either $A=0$ or $B=0$. 
The first term, $A=(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2$, equals zero when $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. This results in a square with side length 10 and vertices at $(0, 0)$, $(0, 20)$, $(20, 0)$, and $(-20, 0)$.
The second term, $B=(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2$, equals zero when $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$. This results in a square with side length 16 and vertices at $(8, 8)$, $(-8, 8)$, $(-8, -8)$, and $(8, -8)$.
The intersection of these two squares forms a smaller square with side length 8 and vertices at $(4, 4)$, $(-4, 4)$, $(-4, -4)$, and $(4, -4)$.
The area of this smaller square is $8^2 = 64$. So the area of the convex polygon is 64 square units.
The answer is: 64

Solve the following problem with a Python Script (positive numerical answer):
"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"
Write comments to indicate the steps you take. Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Assistant:

Approach:


The equation is satisfied if either $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$.
For the first two cases, we have $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. This means that either $x + y = 10$ or $x + y = -10$ and either $x - y = 10$ or $x - y = -10$. Solving these four equations, we get the vertices of the polygon: $(0, 10), (0, -10), (10, 0), (-10, 0)$.
For the last two cases, we have $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$. This means that either $x = 8$ or $x = -8$ and either $y = 8$ or $y = -8$. Solving these four equations, we get the vertices of the polygon: $(8, 0), (-8, 0), (0, 8), (0, -8)$.
Now we can plot these eight points and connect them to form the convex polygon.
The polygon is a square with side length 10. The area of a square is given by side length squared, so the area of this polygon is $10^2 = 100$. The answer is: $100$
