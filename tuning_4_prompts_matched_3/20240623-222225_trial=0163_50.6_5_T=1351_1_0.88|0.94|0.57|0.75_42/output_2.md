Interesting, let's analyze step by step:



Step 1: List the variables and known values from the problem
The problem asks for how many positive integers $m$ the equation \[\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}\] has $4$ distinct solutions. We are given that the number of distinct solutions is $4$.

Step 2: Outline the steps using sympy to solve the problem

- Identify the sympy functions required for each step.
- Implement these functions step-by-step, commenting each line for clarity.

To solve this problem, we can use the property of absolute values and solve the equation step-by-step. 

First, we rewrite the equation as two separate cases:

Case 1: $\vert x-1 \vert -2 = \frac{m}{100}$
This implies $\vert x-1 \vert = \frac{m}{100} + 2$
So, we have two subcases:

Subcase 1.1: $x-1 = \frac{m}{100} + 2$ which implies $x = \frac{m}{100} + 3$.
Subcase 1.2: $x-1 = -(\frac{m}{100} + 2)$ which implies $x = 1 - \frac{m}{100} - 2 = - \frac{m}{100} - 1$.

Case 2: $\vert x-1 \vert -2 = -\frac{m}{100}$
This implies $\vert x-1 \vert = 2 - \frac{m}{100}$
So, we have two subcases:

Subcase 2.1: $x-1 = 2 - \frac{m}{100}$ which implies $x = 3 - \frac{m}{100}$.
Subcase 2.2: $x-1 = - (2 - \frac{m}{100})$ which implies $x = -1 + \frac{m}{100}$.

Step 3: Calculate the final answer and verify it's a positive integer
Now, we need to find for how many positive integers $m$ the equation has $4$ distinct solutions. 

By analyzing the solutions obtained above, we can see that:
- Subcase 1.1 and Subcase 1.2 have a solution if and only if $\frac{m}{100} + 3 > 0$ and $- \frac{m}{100} - 1 > 0$, which gives $0 < m < 200$.
- Subcase 2.1 and Subcase 2.2 have a solution if and only if $3 - \frac{m}{100} > -1 + \frac{m}{100}$, which gives $m < 100$.

Combining these conditions, we find that $m$ must be in the range $0 < m < 100$. 

Now we need to count the number of positive integers in this range. The number of positive integers from $1$ to $100$ is $100$. 

Step 4: Output the result
So the answer is $\boxed{100}$. However, this doesn't seem right. Let's reevaluate our work.

Upon reevaluation, we realize that our conditions for the subcases are not accurate. Let's reconsider and reevaluate our work.

Case 1: $\vert x-1 \vert -2 = \frac{m}{100}$
This implies $\vert x-1 \vert = \frac{m}{100} + 2$.
For this to have two distinct solutions, $\frac{m}{100} + 2 > 0$ and $\frac{m}{100} + 2 > \vert x-1 \vert \geq 0$, which gives $m > -200$ and $m < 200$.

Case 2: $\vert x-1 \vert -2 = -\frac{m}{100}$
This implies $\vert x-1 \vert = 2 - \frac{m}{100}$.
For this to have two distinct solutions, $2 - \frac{m}{100} > 0$ and $2 - \frac{m}{100} > \vert x-1 \vert \geq 0$, which gives $m < 200$ and $m > -100$.

Combining these conditions, we find that $m$ must be in the range $-100 < m < 100$.

Now we need to count the number of positive integers in this range. The number of positive integers from $1$ to $100$ and from $-1$ to $-100$ is $100$. So the total number of positive integers in this range is $200$.

However, we are asked for the number of positive integers $m$ for which the equation has exactly $4$ distinct solutions, not at least $4$ distinct solutions.

Let's reconsider our subcases and reevaluate our work.

For Case 1, Subcase 1.1 and Subcase 1.2 to have two distinct solutions, $\frac{m}{100} + 2 > 0$ and $\frac{m}{100} + 2 > \vert x-1 \vert \geq 0$, which gives $m > -200$ and $m < 200$.

For Case 2, Subcase 2.1 and Subcase 2.2 to have two distinct solutions, $2 - \frac{m}{100} > 0$ and $2 - \frac{m}{100} > \vert x-1 \vert \geq 0$, which gives $m < 200$ and $m > -100$.

Combining these conditions, we find that $m$ must be in the range $-100 < m < 100$.

Now we need to count the number of positive integers in this range for which the equation has exactly $4$ distinct solutions. The number of positive integers from $1$ to $100$ and from $-1$ to $-100$ is $100$. However, it is not straightforward to count the number of such $m$ values.

Let's consider the equation $\vert x-1 \vert = \frac{m}{100} + 2$. For this equation to have exactly $4$ distinct solutions, the absolute value on the left side must "cross" the right side exactly twice. This occurs when the slope of the right side, $-\frac{1}{100}$, is less than the minimum slope of the left side, which occurs at $x=1$. At $x=1$, the slope of the left side is $1$, so we have $-\frac{1}{100} < 1$, which gives $m > -100$.

Similarly, for the equation $\vert x-1 \vert = 2 - \frac{

Interesting, let's analyze step by step:



For the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ to have four distinct solutions, the value of $\frac{m}{100}$ must be the value which makes the expression $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert$ transition from having two solutions to having four solutions. This happens when $\frac{m}{100} = 2$. Thus, $m = 200$.

Now, we need to check if $m = 200$ is a positive integer. If it is, then the number of positive integers $m$ for which the equation has four distinct solutions is 1.

So, $m = 200$ is a positive integer. 

Therefore, the number of positive integers $m$ for which the equation has four distinct solutions is 1. The answer is: $1$.
The answer is: 1

Interesting, let's analyze step by step:



We want to find the values of $m$ such that the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has exactly 4 distinct solutions. This equation is equivalent to a piecewise function with four cases, depending on the value of $x$. We will solve it step by step:

Step 1: Set up the piecewise function

We first set up the piecewise function based on the absolute value:

- If $x \geq 1$, then $\vert x-1 \vert = x-1$. So the equation becomes $\vert x-1-2 \vert = \vert x-3 \vert = \frac{m}{100}$.
- If $0 \leq x < 1$, then $\vert x-1 \vert = 1-x$. So the equation becomes $\vert 1-x-2 \vert = \vert -x-1 \vert = \vert x+1 \vert = \frac{m}{100}$.

Step 2: Solve the piecewise function for each case

- For $x \geq 1$, the equation becomes $\vert x-3 \vert = \frac{m}{100}$. This gives us two cases: $x-3 = \frac{m}{100}$ and $3-x = \frac{m}{100}$. Solving these equations gives $x = 3 + \frac{m}{100}$ and $x = 3 - \frac{m}{100}$, respectively.
- For $0 \leq x < 1$, the equation becomes $\vert x+1 \vert = \frac{m}{100}$. This gives us two cases: $x+1 = \frac{m}{100}$ and $-x-1 = \frac{m}{100}$. Solving these equations gives $x = \frac{m}{100} - 1$ and $x = -1 - \frac{m}{100}$, respectively.

Step 3: Find the values of $m$ that result in 4 distinct solutions

To have 4 distinct solutions, we need the solutions from the two cases (for $x \geq 1$ and $0 \leq x < 1$) to intersect at exactly one point. This means that the sum of the distances between the two pairs of solutions must be equal to 1. So we have:

\[(3 + \frac{m}{100}) - (3 - \frac{m}{100}) = 1 + (-1 - \frac{m}{100}) - (\frac{m}{100} - 1)\]

Simplifying this gives $\frac{2m}{100} = 1$, so $m = 50$.

Step 4: Verify that the value of $m$ is a positive integer

We have found that $m = 50$, which is a positive integer. Therefore, the number of positive integers $m$ for which the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has 4 distinct solutions is 1.
The answer is: 1

Interesting, let's analyze step by step:



The equation $| |x - 1| - 2 | = \frac{m}{100}$ has 4 distinct solutions. This means that the expression $|x - 1| - 2 = \pm \frac{m}{100}$ has 4 distinct solutions.

We can solve this equation step by step:

Step 1: Solve $|x - 1| - 2 = \frac{m}{100}$. This equation can be rewritten as $|x - 1| = 2 + \frac{m}{100}$.

Step 2: This equation splits into two cases: $x - 1 = 2 + \frac{m}{100}$ or $-(x - 1) = 2 + \frac{m}{100}$.

Step 3: For the first case, we have $x = 3 + \frac{m}{100}$.

Step 4: For the second case, we have $x = -1 + \frac{m}{100}$.

Step 5: The original equation has 4 distinct solutions when the distance between the two solutions (3 + $\frac{m}{100}$ and -1 + $\frac{m}{100}$) is equal to 4. This gives us $4 = 4 + \frac{2m}{100}$, which simplifies to $\frac{2m}{100} = 0$.

Solving for $m$, we get $m = 0$. However, $m$ cannot be zero because the equation would become $|x - 1| - 2 = 0$ or $|x - 1| = 2$, which only has two distinct solutions. 

This means that there must be an error in our steps. Let's go back and check.

Step 1: Solve $|x - 1| - 2 = \frac{m}{100}$. This equation can be rewritten as $|x - 1| = 2 + \frac{m}{100}$.

The error is in this step. The correct equation should be $|x - 1| - 2 = \pm \frac{m}{100}$. This splits into two cases:

Case 1: $|x - 1| - 2 = \frac{m}{100}$, which can be rewritten as $|x - 1| = 2 + \frac{m}{100}$. This gives us the solutions $x = 3 + \frac{m}{100}$ and $x = -1 + \frac{m}{100}$.

Case 2: $|x - 1| - 2 = -\frac{m}{100}$, which can be rewritten as $|x - 1| = 2 - \frac{m}{100}$. This gives us the solutions $x = 1 + 2 - \frac{m}{100}$ and $x = 1 - 2 + \frac{m}{100}$, which simplifies to $x = 3 - \frac{m}{100}$ and $x = -1 + \frac{m}{100}$.

Step 6: The original equation has 4 distinct solutions when the distance between the two solutions in each case is equal to 4. This gives us two equations:

Case 1: $4 = 4 + \frac{2m}{100}$, which simplifies to $\frac{2m}{100} = 0$, leading to $m = 0$.

Case 2: $4 = 4 - \frac{2m}{100}$, which simplifies to $\frac{2m}{100} = 0$, leading to $m = 0$.

Both cases lead to the same value of $m$, which is 0. However, we already discarded this solution because it does not give us distinct solutions. 

Let's try another approach. We know that the distance between the two solutions in each case should be 4. For case 1, the distance is $|3 + \frac{m}{100} - (-1 + \frac{m}{100})| = 4$. Simplifying, we get $4 = 4$, which is true for all values of $m$. For case 2, the distance is $|3 - \frac{m}{100} - (-1 + \frac{m}{100})| = 4$. Simplifying, we get $4 = 4$, which is also true for all values of $m$.

This means that any positive value of $m$ will give us 4 distinct solutions. However, we want to find the number of positive integers $m$ that will give us 4 distinct solutions. 

The problem states that $m$ should be a positive integer. The smallest positive integer value for $m$ is 1 and the largest positive integer value for $m$ is 100. Therefore, the number of positive integers $m$ that will give us 4 distinct solutions is 100.

So, the number of positive integers $m$ for which the equation $| |x-1| - 2 | = \frac{m}{100}$ has 4 distinct solutions is 100. The answer is: $100$

The equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has 4 distinct solutions. We want to find out for how many positive integers $m$ this is true.

Step 1: Simplify the equation
We can simplify the equation by setting $\frac{m}{100}$ to a new variable $k$, so the equation becomes $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=k$.

Step 2: Find the values of $k$ for which the equation has 4 distinct solutions
The equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=k$ has 4 distinct solutions when $k=1$. 

Step 3: Solve for $m$
Now we can set $k=\frac{m}{100}$ and solve for $m$. We get $m=100$.

Step 4: Verify the result
The value we found for $m$ is a positive integer, so we can conclude that the number of positive integers $m$ for which the equation has 4 distinct solutions is 1. The answer is: $1$

We need to find the number of positive integers $m$ for which the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has four distinct solutions. 

First, let's simplify the equation a bit:

We want the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ to have four distinct solutions. This equation will have four solutions if the right side of the equation $\frac{m}{100}$ falls into a certain range.

The graph of $y = \vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert$ is a V-shape with three "humps": one from $-2$ to $0$, one from $0$ to $2$, and one from $2$ to $4$. The value of $y$ reaches its minimum of $0$ at $x=1$, and its maximum value of $4$ at $x=3$. So the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has four solutions when $\frac{m}{100}$ falls into the interval $(0, 4)$.

This means $\frac{m}{100} \in (0, 4)$, or equivalently, $0 < \frac{m}{100} < 4$. Multiplying all sides of the inequalities by $100$, we get $0 < m < 400$. So $m$ is any positive integer from $1$ to $399$.

Now, we want to count how many of these $m$ are integers. The number of integers from $1$ to $399$ is $399 - 1 + 1 = 399$.

So the number of positive integers $m$ for which the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has four distinct solutions is 399. However, this is not a positive integer.

We must have made a mistake somewhere. Let's go back and check our work.

Upon reexamination, we realize that we made a mistake in our interpretation of the problem. The problem asks for the number of positive integers $m$ such that the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has four distinct solutions. We interpreted this to mean that $\frac{m}{100}$ must fall into the interval $(0, 4)$, but this is not the correct interpretation.

The correct interpretation is that the right side of the equation, $\frac{m}{100}$, must be equal to the $y$-values of the graph of $y = \vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert$. These $y$-values are the "humps" of the graph, which are $0$, $2$, and $4$.

So we need to find the number of positive integers $m$ such that $\frac{m}{100}$ equals $0$, $2$, or $4$. 

For $\frac{m}{100}=0$, we have $m=0$. But $m$ cannot be $0$, so this case is not valid.

For $\frac{m}{100}=2$, we have $m=200$. This is a positive integer.

For $\frac{m}{100}=4$, we have $m=400$. This is a positive integer.

So the only positive integers $m$ that work are $200$ and $400$. Therefore, there are only two positive integers $m$ for which the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has four distinct solutions.

However, this still does not give us a positive integer as the answer.

Upon reexamination, we realize that we made another mistake. The problem asks for the number of positive integers $m$ such that the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has four distinct solutions. We interpreted this to mean that $\frac{m}{100}$ must be equal to the $y$-values of the graph of $y = \vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert$, but this is not the correct interpretation either.

The correct interpretation is that the right side of the equation, $\frac{m}{100}$, must fall into the interval between the $y$-values of the graph of $y = \vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert$. These $y$-values are the "humps" of the graph, which are $0$, $2$, and $4$.

So we need to find the number of positive integers $m$ such that $0 < \frac{m}{100} < 2$ or $2 < \frac{m}{100} < 4$.

For $0 < \frac{m}{100} < 2$, we have $0 < m < 200$. The number of positive integers $m$ in this range is $200 - 1 = 199$.

For $2 < \frac{m}{100} < 4$, we have $200 < m < 400$. The number of positive integers $m$ in this range is $400 - 200 - 1 = 199$.

So the total number of positive integers $m$ for which the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has four distinct solutions is $199 + 199 = 398$. This is still not a positive integer.

Upon reexamination, we realize that we made one more mistake. The problem asks for the number of positive integers $m$ such that the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has four distinct solutions. We interpreted this to mean that $\frac{m}{100}$ must fall into the interval between the $y$-values of the graph of $y = \vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert$, but this is not the correct interpretation either.

The correct interpretation is that the right side of the equation, $\frac{m}{100}$, must fall into the interval $(0, 4)$, as this is the range of the $y$-values of the graph of $y = \vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert$.

So we need to find the number of positive integers $m$ such that $0 < \frac{m}{100} < 4$.

For $0 < \frac{m}{100} < 4$, we have $0 < m < 400$. The number of positive integers $m$ in this range is $400 - 1 = 399$.

So the number of positive integers $m$ for which the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has four

Interesting, let's analyze step by step:



The number of distinct solutions to the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ is 4.

We know that the function $| |x - 1| - 2|$ is piecewise linear with 3 breakpoints at $x = -1, x = 3,$ and $x = 5$. It takes the value $3 - \frac{m}{100}$ on the interval $x \in (-\infty, 1)$, the value $|x - 1 - 2| = |x - 3|$ on the interval $x \in [1, 3)$, the value $3 - 2 + \frac{m}{100} = 1 + \frac{m}{100}$ on the interval $x \in [3, 5)$, and the value $|x - 1 - 2| = |x - 3|$ on the interval $x \in [5, \infty)$.

The equation has 4 distinct solutions if and only if one of the following inequalities is satisfied:

$$3 - \frac{m}{100} = 1 + \frac{m}{100} \implies m = 50,$$ or
$$1 + \frac{m}{100} = \frac{m}{100} \implies m = 0,$$ or
$$\frac{m}{100} = 3 - 1 - \frac{m}{100} \implies m = 50.$$

Since $m$ cannot be 0 (otherwise the equation would become $| |x - 1| - 2| = 0$, which has only 3 solutions), the only possible value for $m$ is $50$. This is a positive integer, so the answer is $1$. The value $m = 50$ is the only value that makes the equation have 4 distinct solutions. The answer is: $1$
