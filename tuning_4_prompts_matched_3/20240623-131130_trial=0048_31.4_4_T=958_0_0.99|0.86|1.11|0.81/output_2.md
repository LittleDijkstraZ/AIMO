 The problem asks for the number of positive integers $m$ such that the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has 4 distinct solutions.

The equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ represents a family of piecewise linear functions, where the number of pieces is determined by the number of times the absolute value function is applied. In this case, the function has 4 pieces, which means the right-hand side of the equation, $\frac{m}{100}$, must be equal to 2.

Setting $\frac{m}{100}=2$, we can solve for $m$ to get $m=200$.

So, there is only one positive integer $m$ that makes the equation have 4 distinct solutions, and that is $m=200$. The answer is: $1$

To find the value of $m$ for which the equation $||\lvert x-1 \rvert - 2\rvert = \frac{m}{100}$ has 4 distinct solutions, we need to analyze the properties of the absolute value function.

The equation $||\lvert x-1 \rvert - 2\rvert = \frac{m}{100}$ can be broken down into two cases:

Case 1: $| \lvert x-1 \rvert - 2 | = \frac{m}{100}$
Case 2: $| \lvert x-1 \rvert - 2 | = - \frac{m}{100}$

For Case 1, we have four distinct solutions if $\frac{m}{100} = 2$. So $m = 200$.

For Case 2, we have no solutions if $- \frac{m}{100} > 2$, two solutions if $- \frac{m}{100} = 2$, and four solutions if $- \frac{m}{100} < 2$.

Since we are looking for the value of $m$ that gives four distinct solutions, we can conclude that $m = 200$.

```python

def find_m():
    """Find the value of m for which the equation $||\lvert x-1 \rvert - 2\rvert = \frac{m}{100}$ has 4 distinct solutions."""

    return m

result = find_m()
print(result)
```

The number of positive integers $m$ for which the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has $4$ distinct solutions is $1$.
However, the problem asks for the number of positive integers $m$ for which the equation has $4$ distinct solutions.
After analyzing the problem, we found that the correct number of positive integers $m$ is actually $100$.

This discrepancy arose from misunderstanding the problem. The question asks for the number of positive integers $m$ such that the equation has $4$ distinct solutions. We initially interpreted the question to mean that we needed to find a single value of $m$ for which the equation has $4$ distinct solutions.

However, the question actually asks for the number of possible values of $m$ for which the equation has $4$ distinct solutions. In other words, we are looking for the number of positive integers $m$ such that the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has $4$ distinct solutions.

To solve this problem, we need to analyze the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ for different values of $m$ and count the number of distinct solutions for each value of $m$. From the analysis, we found that the equation has $4$ distinct solutions for $100$ different values of $m$.

Therefore, the number of positive integers $m$ for which the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has $4$ distinct solutions is $100$.
The answer is $\boxed{100}$.

Below is a math problem you are to solve (positive numerical answer!):
"For how many positive integers $m$ does the equation \[\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}\] have $4$ distinct solutions?"

Assistant:

 The problem asks for the number of positive integers $m$ such that the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has exactly 4 distinct solutions. 

The equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ is a piecewise function that can be split into cases based on the value of $x$. The function will have 4 distinct solutions when the right side of the equation $\frac{m}{100}$ falls into the range where the function has 4 distinct solutions.

The piecewise function $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert$ will have 4 distinct solutions when its value is between 1 and 2, inclusive. This corresponds to the range of $\frac{m}{100}$ being between 1 and 2, inclusive. 

To find the corresponding range of $m$, we can multiply the range of $\frac{m}{100}$ by 100: $1 \leq \frac{m}{100} \leq 2$. Multiplying through by 100 gives $100 \leq m \leq 200$. 

So the positive integers $m$ that make the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ have exactly 4 distinct solutions are the integers from 100 to 200, inclusive. The number of such integers is $200 - 100 + 1 = 101$.

Therefore, the number of positive integers $m$ that satisfy the given condition is 101.

```python

def number_of_m():
    """For how many positive integers $m$ does the equation \[\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}\] have $4$ distinct solutions?"""
    # The range of m is from 100 to 200
    lower_bound = 100
    upper_bound = 200

    # The number of such integers is the difference between the upper and lower bounds plus 1
    number_of_m = upper_bound - lower_bound + 1

    return number_of_m

result = number_of_m()
print(result)
```

The number of positive integers $m$ that satisfy the given condition is $101$. The answer is: $101$

"For how many positive integers $m$ does the equation \[\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}\] have $4$ distinct solutions?"

Assistant:

 The equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has $4$ distinct solutions if and only if $\frac{m}{100} = 1$. This is because the function $f(x) = \vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert$ has a graph that forms a "V" shape with the "valleys" of the "V"s being $1$ unit apart. For the equation to have $4$ distinct solutions, the height of each "V" must be $\frac{m}{100} = 1$. 

So we have $\frac{m}{100} = 1$, which gives us $m = 100$. Therefore, there is only $1$ positive integer $m$ for which the equation has $4$ distinct solutions. The answer is: $1$

Assistant:

 The number of distinct solutions of the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ is equal to 4 when $\frac{m}{100}$ is equal to 2.
Therefore, we need to find the value of $m$ such that $\frac{m}{100}=2$.
Solving for $m$, we have $m=2*100=200$.
So the value of $m$ is 200.
The answer is: $200$

Assistant:

 The number of distinct solutions of the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ is equal to 4 when $\frac{m}{100}=2$. This is because the expression inside the absolute value, $\vert x-1 \vert -2$, can only be equal to 2 or -2. 

To solve for $m$, we multiply both sides of the equation $\frac{m}{100}=2$ by 100 to get $m=200$.

So, the number of positive integers $m$ for which the equation has 4 distinct solutions is 1, since there is only one positive integer $m$ that satisfies the condition. The answer is: 1

The number of positive integers $m$ for which the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has $4$ distinct solutions is $\boxed{1}$.

However, after further inspection of the problem, we realize that we misunderstood the problem. The problem asks for the number of positive integers $m$ for which the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has exactly $4$ distinct solutions. We have mistakenly counted all possible values of $m$ that result in a total of $4$ solutions. 

To solve this problem correctly, we need to analyze the properties of the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$. The equation has $4$ distinct solutions when the value of $\frac{m}{100}$ is such that it splits the piecewise function $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert$ into $4$ distinct intervals. 

By analyzing the piecewise function $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert$, we find that it splits into $4$ distinct intervals when $\frac{m}{100}$ is strictly greater than $1$ but strictly less than $2$. This happens when $1 < \frac{m}{100} < 2$, which simplifies to $100 < m < 200$. 

So, the number of positive integers $m$ for which the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has exactly $4$ distinct solutions is the number of integers in the range $(100, 200)$. This is $200 - 100 - 1 = 99$. 

However, this result contradicts the original output of $1$. The mistake in the original solution was assuming that the number of solutions for a given value of $m$ would always be $4$. Upon further inspection, we realize that the number of solutions depends on the value of $\frac{m}{100}$, and not all values of $m$ will result in exactly $4$ solutions. 

To correct the original solution, we need to find the values of $m$ for which the equation has exactly $4$ solutions. After analyzing the piecewise function $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert$, we find that it splits into $4$ distinct intervals when $\frac{m}{100}$ is strictly greater than $1$ but strictly less than $2$. This happens when $1 < \frac{m}{100} < 2$, which simplifies to $100 < m < 200$. The number of positive integers $m$ in this range is indeed $99$.

Therefore, the correct number of positive integers $m$ for which the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has exactly $4$ distinct solutions is $99$.

So, the final numerical answer is $99$.
The answer is: $99$
