Below is a math problem you are to solve (positive numerical answer!):
"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"

 The given equation is a product of two expressions equal to zero, so either one of the expressions must be zero for the product to be zero. That is, we have two cases:

1. $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$
2. $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$

For the first case, both $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2$ and $( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2$ must be zero. This implies that $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$, which means $x + y = \pm 10$ and $x - y = \pm 10$. Solving these equations gives us four lines: $x + y = 10$, $x + y = -10$, $x - y = 10$, and $x - y = -10$. These lines form a rectangle with vertices at $(10, 0)$, $(-10, 0)$, $(0, 10)$, and $(0, -10)$.

For the second case, both $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2$ and $( \vert y \vert - 8)^2$ must be zero. This implies that $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$, which means $x = \pm 8$ and $y = \pm 8$. This gives us four lines: $x = 8$, $x = -8$, $y = 8$, and $y = -8$. These lines form a square with vertices at $(8, 8)$, $(8, -8)$, $(-8, 8)$, and $(-8, -8)$.

The intersection of the two sets of lines forms a square with side length 10 (the rectangle formed by the first case has side lengths 20 and 10, and the square formed by the second case has side length 16, so the square formed by the intersection has side length 10). The area of this square is $10^2 = 100$. Therefore, the area of the convex polygon is 100 square units. The answer is: $100$

"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"

 The given equation is a product of two terms equal to zero. Therefore, either the first term is zero or the second term is zero. 

The first term is zero when $|\pm x \pm y| - 10 = 0$, which simplifies to $|\pm x \pm y| = 10$. The four equations this can represent are:
1. $x + y = 10$
2. $x + y = -10$
3. $x - y = 10$
4. $x - y = -10$

The second term is zero when $|\pm x| - 8 = 0$ or $|\pm y| - 8 = 0$, which simplifies to $|\pm x| = 8$ or $|\pm y| = 8$. The four equations this can represent are:
5. $x = 8$
6. $x = -8$
7. $y = 8$
8. $y = -8$

The solutions to these eight equations are the vertices of the polygon.

To find the area of the polygon, we can find the length and width and multiply them together. The length is the distance between the points $(8,0)$ and $(-8,0)$, which is $16$. The width is the distance between the points $(0,8)$ and $(0,-8)$, which is $16$. Therefore, the area of the polygon is $16 \times 16 = 256$.

So the area of the convex polygon is 256 square units. The answer is: $256$

Below is a math problem you are to solve (positive numerical answer!):
"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"

The equation is satisfied if either $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$.
This means either $\vert x + y \vert = 10$, $\vert x - y \vert = 10$, $\vert x \vert = 8$, or $\vert y \vert = 8$.
The absolute value equations can be rewritten as:
1. $x + y = 10$ or $x + y = -10$
2. $x - y = 10$ or $x - y = -10$
3. $x = 8$ or $x = -8$
4. $y = 8$ or $y = -8$
These equations represent lines and circles in the coordinate plane.
By graphing these lines and circles, we find that the enclosed region is a square with side length 16.
The area of the square is $16^2 = 256$.
So the area of the convex polygon is 256. The answer is: $256$

This problem is a bit complex and requires some understanding of absolute value functions and how they relate to the coordinate plane.

The expression $A = ((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2)$ is equal to zero if and only if at least one of the factors is zero.

The factor $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2$ is zero if and only if $\vert x + y \vert = 10$, which means $x + y = 10$ or $x + y = -10$. These are two lines in the plane.

Similarly, the factor $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2$ is zero if and only if $\vert x - y \vert = 10$, which means $x - y = 10$ or $x - y = -10$. These are also two lines in the plane.

The factor $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2$ is zero if and only if $\vert x \vert = 8$, which means $x = 8$ or $x = -8$. These are two vertical lines in the plane.

The factor $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2$ is zero if and only if $\vert y \vert = 8$, which means $y = 8$ or $y = -8$. These are two horizontal lines in the plane.

The intersection of these lines form a rectangle with side lengths 16 and 20. The area of this rectangle is $16 \times 20 = 320$.

So, the area of the convex polygon is 320 square units.

Here is a Python code to calculate the area:
```python


INTERMEDIATE OUT :

def polygon_area():
    """The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"""
    side_length_1 = 16
    side_length_2 = 20
    area = side_length_1 * side_length_2
    return area

result = polygon_area()
print(result)
```

CODE RESULTS 320

INTERMEDIATE OUT :
```output
320
```
The area of the convex polygon is 320 square units. The answer is: $320$

 The given equation is a product of two terms equal to zero, so either the first term is zero or the second term is zero.
The first term is zero when either $|x+y| - 10 = 0$ or $|x-y| - 10 = 0$, which simplifies to $|x+y| = 10$ or $|x-y| = 10$. These are the equations of two lines.
The second term is zero when either $|x| - 8 = 0$ or $|y| - 8 = 0$, which simplifies to $|x| = 8$ or $|y| = 8$. These are the equations of four lines.
The intersection points of these lines are the vertices of the polygon. By plotting these lines, we can see that the polygon is a square with side length 16. The area of a square is side length squared, so the area of this polygon is $16^2 = 256$. The answer is: $256$

"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"

 The given equation is a product of two expressions equal to zero, so the equation is satisfied if either of the expressions is zero.
The expression $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ implies that $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$.
This means that $x + y = \pm 10$ and $x - y = \pm 10$.
Solving these equations, we get four lines: $x + y = 10$, $x + y = -10$, $x - y = 10$, and $x - y = -10$.
The expression $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ implies that $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$.
This means that $x = \pm 8$ and $y = \pm 8$.
So we have a square with vertices at $(8,8)$, $(8,-8)$, $(-8,-8)$, and $(-8,8)$.
The side length of the square is 16, so the area of the square is $16^2 = 256$.
Therefore, the area of the convex polygon is 256. The answer is: $256$
