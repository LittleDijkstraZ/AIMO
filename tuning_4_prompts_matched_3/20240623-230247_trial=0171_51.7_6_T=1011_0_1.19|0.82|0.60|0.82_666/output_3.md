"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"

 The expression $A \cdot B = 0$ is true if and only if at least one of the expressions $A$ or $B$ is equal to $0$. Therefore, the given equation is satisfied if either $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2) = 0$ or $((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$.

If $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2) = 0$, then both $|x+y| - 10 = 0$ and $|x-y| - 10 = 0$, which implies $|x+y| = 10$ and $|x-y| = 10$. This means $x+y = \pm 10$ and $x-y = \pm 10$, which are the equations of four lines.

If $((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$, then both $|x| - 8 = 0$ and $|y| - 8 = 0$, which implies $|x| = 8$ and $|y| = 8$. This means $x = \pm 8$ and $y = \pm 8$, which are the equations of four lines.

The intersection of these lines form a square with side length $10$ (the distance from $(-10, 0)$ to $(10, 0)$ or from $(0, -10)$ to $(0, 10)$). Therefore, the area of the convex polygon is $10^2 = 100$. The answer is: $100$

Below is a math problem you are to solve (positive numerical answer!):
"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"
Analyze this problem and think step by step to come to a solution with programs. After solving the problem, output the final numerical answer within \boxed{}.

Assistant:

 The equation given is a product of two expressions equal to zero, so either one of the expressions must be zero. This means that the points that satisfy the equation are those that satisfy either $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$, $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$, $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$, or $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$.

From $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$, we have $\vert x + y \vert = 10$, which gives us two lines: $x + y = 10$ and $x + y = -10$.
From $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$, we have $\vert x - y \vert = 10$, which gives us two more lines: $x - y = 10$ and $x - y = -10$.
From $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$, we have $\vert x \vert = 8$, which gives us two lines: $x = 8$ and $x = -8$.
From $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$, we have $\vert y \vert = 8$, which gives us two more lines: $y = 8$ and $y = -8$.

The eight lines intersect at the points (8,8), (8,-8), (-8,8), and (-8,-8), which form a square with side length 16.

The area of this square is $16^2 = 256$.

Therefore, the area of the convex polygon is 256.
The answer is: $256$

Below is a math problem you are to solve (positive numerical answer!):
"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"

 To solve this problem, we need to analyze the given equation and find the conditions that make the equation equal to zero.
The equation is given by: $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$.

The product of two factors is zero if and only if at least one of the factors is zero. So we have two cases:

Case 1: $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$.
This means that $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. These two equations imply that the points lie on a square with side length 20.

Case 2: $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$.
This means that $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$. These two equations imply that the points lie on a square with side length 16.

The intersection of these two cases is the smaller square, which is the convex polygon we are interested in. The area of this square is the square of the side length, so the area is $16^2 = 256$. Therefore, the area of the convex polygon is 256 square units. The answer is: $256$

Below is a math problem you are to solve (positive numerical answer!):
"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"

This problem is asking for the area of a polygon formed by the set of points $(x, y)$ that satisfy the given equation. The equation involves absolute values, so we first need to break down the absolute values into cases based on the sign of the expressions inside the absolute value.

The equation is:
$$((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0.$$

This equation is equal to zero if either of the two factors is zero. The first factor is zero if either $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ or $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. The second factor is zero if either $\vert x \vert = 8$ or $\vert y \vert = 8$.

Now let's analyze the possible cases for the absolute values:

1. If $\vert x + y \vert = 10$, then $x + y = 10$ or $x + y = -10$.
2. If $\vert x - y \vert = 10$, then $x - y = 10$ or $x - y = -10$.
3. If $\vert x \vert = 8$, then $x = 8$ or $x = -8$.
4. If $\vert y \vert = 8$, then $y = 8$ or $y = -8$.

These equations form a square with side length 20. The vertices of the square are $(8,8), (8,-8), (-8,8),$ and $(-8,-8)$. The area of the square is $20 \times 20 = 400$.

So, the area of the convex polygon formed by the set of points $(x, y)$ that satisfy the given equation is 400 square units. The answer is: $400$

"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"

The equation $AB = 0$ implies that $A = 0$ or $B = 0$. In this problem, the equation is $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + (\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + (\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$.
The first equation implies $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. These two equations represent two squares with side length 10 centered at the origin. Their intersection forms a square with side length 10.
The second equation implies $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$. These two equations represent two squares with side length 8 centered at the origin. Their intersection forms a square with side length 8.
The area of the square formed by the intersection of the two squares is the area of the larger square minus the area of the smaller square. The area of a square is side length squared, so the area of the larger square is $10^2 = 100$ and the area of the smaller square is $8^2 = 64$. Therefore, the area of the convex polygon is $100 - 64 = 36$. The answer is: $36$

"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"

 The equation is equivalent to $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$.
For the first equation, either $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ or $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. This means that the points $(x, y)$ lie on the lines $x + y = 10$ or $x + y = -10$ or $x - y = 10$ or $x - y = -10$. These lines form a rectangle with vertices at $(10, 0), (-10, 0), (0, 10)$ and $(0, -10)$.
For the second equation, either $\vert x \vert = 8$ or $\vert y \vert = 8$. This means that the points $(x, y)$ lie on the lines $x = 8$ or $x = -8$ or $y = 8$ or $y = -8$. These lines form a square with vertices at $(8, 8), (-8, 8), (-8, -8)$ and $(8, -8)$.
The intersection of the two sets of points is the set of vertices of the square. The area of the square is $8^2 = 64$. The answer is: 64

Analyze this problem and think step by step to come to a solution with programs. After solving the problem, output the final numerical answer within \boxed{}.

Assistant:


The given equation is a product of two terms equal to zero, which means that either one of the terms is zero. This gives us two separate systems of equations to solve:

1. $|x+y| - 10 = 0$ and $|x-y| - 10 = 0$
2. $|x| - 8 = 0$ and $|y| - 8 = 0$

For the first system, we have $|x+y| = 10$ and $|x-y| = 10$. This implies that $x+y = \pm 10$ and $x-y = \pm 10$. Solving these equations, we get the vertices of the first system as $(5,5)$, $(5,-5)$, $(-5,5)$, and $(-5,-5)$.

For the second system, we have $|x| = 8$ and $|y| = 8$. This implies that $x = \pm 8$ and $y = \pm 8$. Solving these equations, we get the vertices of the second system as $(8,8)$, $(8,-8)$, $(-8,8)$, and $(-8,-8)$.

The convex polygon formed by these vertices is a square with side length 10. The area of a square is side length squared, so the area of this square is $10^2 = 100$. Therefore, the area of the convex polygon is 100 square units. The answer is: $100$

Assistant:

 To solve this problem, we first need to analyze the given equation and find out when it equals to zero.

The equation is of the form $(A)(B) = 0$, so it equals to zero when either $A = 0$ or $B = 0$. 

Thus, the equation is equal to zero when either:
1. $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$, which implies $\vert x + y \vert = 10$, or
2. $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$, which implies $\vert x - y \vert = 10$, or
3. $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$, which implies $\vert x \vert = 8$, or
4. $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$, which implies $\vert y \vert = 8$.

These equations represent four lines in the coordinate plane: $x + y = \pm10$, $x - y = \pm10$, $x = \pm8$, and $y = \pm8$.

The points satisfying these equations form a square with side length $20$. The area of this square is $20^2 = 400$.

So the area of the convex polygon enclosed by the points is $400$.

Therefore, the area of the convex polygon is $400$. The answer is: $400$

Assistant:


The given equation is a product of two terms, and it equals to zero. This means that at least one of the terms must be zero for the equation to hold. 

We can analyze the two terms separately:

1. The first term: $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2) = 0$
This implies that $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$.
This forms a square with side length 20, with vertices at $(10,0)$, $(0,10)$, $(-10,0)$, and $(0,-10)$.

2. The second term: $((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$
This implies that $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$.
This forms a square with side length 16, with vertices at $(8,0)$, $(0,8)$, $(-8,0)$, and $(0,-8)$.

The intersection of the two squares forms a smaller square with side length 10, because the intersection of the two squares is the square with side length 10 inscribed in the square with side length 16.

The area of the convex polygon (the smaller square) can be found by squaring the side length, so the area is $10^2 = 100$.

So, the area of the convex polygon is 100.
The answer is: $100$

The given equation is $0$ if and only if both $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2$ and $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2$ and $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2$ and $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2$ are $0$.
This means $\vert x + y \vert = 10$, $\vert x \vert = 8$, $\vert x - y \vert = 10$, and $\vert y \vert = 8$.
The solutions to these equations are the points where $x + y = \pm 10$, $x = \pm 8$, $x - y = \pm 10$, and $y = \pm 8$.
These points are the vertices of a square with side length $10$.
The area of this square is $10^2 = 100$.
Therefore, the area of the convex polygon is $100$. The answer is: $100$
