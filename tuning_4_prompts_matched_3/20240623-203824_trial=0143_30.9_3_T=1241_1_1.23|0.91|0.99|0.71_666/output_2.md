Interesting, let's analyze step by step:



1. Let's start with $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$, which can be rewritten as $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$. Since the absolute value of any real number is always non-negative, we have the inequality $0 \leq \frac{m}{100} \leq 2$, which gives $0 \leq m \leq 200$. Also, the number of distinct solutions of this equation is 4.

2. To find the value of $m$, we can start by analyzing the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$. For this equation to have four distinct solutions, the value of $\frac{m}{100}$ must make the equation $\vert y - 2 \vert = \frac{m}{100}$ have two intervals of values for $y = |x - 1|$. In other words, we need to find $m$ such that $2 - \frac{m}{100} > \frac{m}{100}$ and $2 + \frac{m}{100} - 1 > \frac{m}{100}$. Simplifying the inequalities gives us $m < 50$ and $m > 0$.

3. Therefore, the value of $m$ that satisfies the conditions is $m = 1, 2, ..., 50$. However, the number of such $m$ is $50$.

4. But the question asks for the positive integers $m$, so we need to check if $m$ is a positive integer in the list $1, 2, ..., 50$. We can see that all the values in the list are indeed positive integers.

5. Therefore, the number of positive integers $m$ for which the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has four distinct solutions is $50$. The answer is $\boxed{50}$.

Interesting, let's analyze step by step:



1. The number of distinct solutions to the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ is 4.
2. For the absolute value equations, we have four cases: $\vert x-1 \vert -2 = \frac{m}{100}$, $\vert x-1 \vert -2 = -\frac{m}{100}$, $-( \vert x-1 \vert -2) = \frac{m}{100}$ and $-( \vert x-1 \vert -2) = -\frac{m}{100}$.
3. Simplifying the above equations, we get: $\vert x-1 \vert = 2 + \frac{m}{100}$, $\vert x-1 \vert = 2 - \frac{m}{100}$, $\vert x-1 \vert = 2 - \frac{m}{100}$, and $\vert x-1 \vert = -2 + \frac{m}{100}$.
4. For each of these absolute value equations, we further get two linear equations by removing the absolute value: $x-1 = 2 + \frac{m}{100}$, $x-1 = -2 - \frac{m}{100}$, $x-1 = -2 + \frac{m}{100}$, and $x-1 = 2 - \frac{m}{100}$.
5. Solving these equations for $x$, we get: $x = 3 + \frac{m}{100}$, $x = -1 - \frac{m}{100}$, $x = -1 + \frac{m}{100}$, and $x = 3 - \frac{m}{100}$.
6. For these equations to have 4 distinct solutions, we need the ranges of $x$ in these equations to be different. This happens when $2 - \frac{m}{100} > 0$ and $-2 + \frac{m}{100} < 0$, which implies $m = 200$.

Therefore, the number of positive integers $m$ for which the equation has 4 distinct solutions is 1, and that integer is 200.
The answer is: $1$

Interesting, let's analyze step by step:



We are asked to find how many positive integers $m$ the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has 4 distinct solutions. This equation has a value of $\frac{m}{100}$ that equals to the distance between two "hinges" in the graph of the function $||x-1|-2|$.

There are 4 intervals of $x$ where the expression $|x-1|-2$ changes its sign: $x<-1$, $-1\le x\le 3$, $x>3$. In these intervals, the left part of the equation becomes:
1. $-(x-1) - 2 = x-3$ if $x<-1$
2. $(x-1) - 2 = x-3$ if $-1\le x\le 3$
3. $(x-1) - 2 = x-3$ if $x>3$

The graph of the function $||x-1|-2|$ forms two "hinges", at $x=3$ and $x=-1$, with a distance of 4 between them. So, for the equation to have 4 distinct solutions, $\frac{m}{100}$ must be a value between 0 and 4 (both included).

This means $0 \le \frac{m}{100} \le 4$, and by multiplying all terms of the inequality by 100, we get $0 \le m \le 400$. The positive integer solutions for $m$ are the integers from 0 to 400. The total number of these solutions is $401$. However, $m=0$ results in only 2 solutions, not 4, so we need to subtract 1 from the total number. The number of positive integers $m$ is therefore $400$. However, since the question asks for the number of positive integers, the correct answer is $399$.

To solve this problem using Python, we would do the following:

```python


INTERMEDIATE OUT :

def number_of_positive_integers():
    # Calculate the number of positive integers m
    m_values = list(range(1, 401))
    number_of_values = len(m_values)
    # Subtract 1 for m=0 which gives only 2 solutions
    number_of_positive_integers = number_of_values - 1
    return number_of_positive_integers

result = number_of_positive_integers()
print(result)
```

CODE RESULTS 399

INTERMEDIATE OUT :
```output
399
```
The number of positive integers $m$ for which the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has 4 distinct solutions is 399. Thus, the answer is $\boxed{399}$.

Interesting, let's analyze step by step:



Problem: For how many positive integers $m$ does the equation \[\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}\] have $4$ distinct solutions?

We know that the given equation has four distinct solutions, so we are looking for a value of $m$ that will make the equation true.

Since the right side of the equation is always positive, the absolute value of the left side must also be positive, which means that the inner absolute value $\vert x-1 \vert -2$ must be between $- \frac{m}{100}$ and $\frac{m}{100}$.

So we have two cases:
1) $\vert x-1 \vert -2 \geq - \frac{m}{100}$ and $\vert x-1 \vert -2 \leq \frac{m}{100}$.
2) $\vert x-1 \vert -2 \leq - \frac{m}{100}$ and $\vert x-1 \vert -2 \geq \frac{m}{100}$.

Solving these two cases, we get the possible values of $m$:
1) $- \frac{m}{100} + 2 \leq \vert x-1 \vert \leq \frac{m}{100} + 2$.
2) $2 - \frac{m}{100} \leq \vert x-1 \vert \leq 2 - \frac{m}{100}$.

For case 1) to have 4 distinct solutions, $\frac{m}{100} + 2 - (-(\frac{m}{100} + 2)) = \frac{2m}{100} + 4 = \frac{m}{50} + 4$ must be greater than 1 (to avoid the trivial solution $x=1$). This gives us $m > 50$.

For case 2) to have 4 distinct solutions, $2 - \frac{m}{100} - (2 - \frac{m}{100}) = \frac{2m}{100} = \frac{m}{50}$ must be less than 1 (to avoid the trivial solution $x=1$). This gives us $m < 50$.

So the only possible value of $m$ is 50. To verify that it's a positive integer, we can see that it's greater than zero and a whole number. Therefore, the value of $m$ that makes the equation have four distinct solutions is 50. The answer is: $1$

Interesting, let's analyze step by step:



The equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has 4 distinct solutions. This implies that the value of right side $\frac{m}{100}$ is the "boundary" value that splits the four solutions from the three solutions of $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert$.

When the right side is small (say 0 < $\frac{m}{100}$ < 1), there will be only one solution.

When the right side is exactly 1, there will be three solutions.

When the right side is large enough (say greater than 2), there will be five solutions.

Therefore, in order to have 4 solutions, $\frac{m}{100}$ must equal exactly to 1. Thus $m = 100$.

This value of $m$ makes the right side of the equation equal to 1, resulting in the four solutions.

Let's check this result: The equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=1$ has four distinct solutions: $x = -1, 1, 3, 5$. Thus, $m = 100$ is a valid value.

So, the number of positive integers $m$ for which the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has four distinct solutions is 1, namely 100. The answer is: $\boxed{1}$

Interesting, let's analyze step by step:


The equation is $| |x-1| - 2 | = \frac{m}{100}$ and we want the number of $m$ for which this equation has 4 distinct solutions.

In the innermost absolute value, we need to consider the cases where $x-1$ is positive and negative separately.

If $x-1 \geq 0$, the equation becomes $|x-1-2| = \frac{m}{100}$ or $|x-3| = \frac{m}{100}$, which simplifies to $x-3 = \frac{m}{100}$ or $x-3 = -\frac{m}{100}$.

If $x-1 < 0$, the equation becomes $|-(x-1)-2| = \frac{m}{100}$ or $|-x+1-2| = \frac{m}{100}$ or $|-x-1| = \frac{m}{100}$, which simplifies to $-x-1 = \frac{m}{100}$ or $-x-1 = -\frac{m}{100}$.

Now, let's solve these equations for $x$:

For $x-3 = \frac{m}{100}$, we get $x = \frac{m}{100} + 3$.
For $x-3 = -\frac{m}{100}$, we get $x = 3 - \frac{m}{100}$.
For $-x-1 = \frac{m}{100}$, we get $x = -1 - \frac{m}{100}$.
For $-x-1 = -\frac{m}{100}$, we get $x = -1 + \frac{m}{100}$.

Now we need to find for which $m$ these four expressions give us 4 distinct solutions. This can be done by setting each of the expressions equal to each other and solving for $m$, but this is a complicated task and requires a computer algebra system (CAS). We can use Python's sympy library to help us out.

Listing all the cases would be too long, so let's start with an initial approach:

First, let's assume that $m$ is positive and solve for the intersection points of the expressions for $x$. 

To find the intersection of two expressions for $x$, we can set them equal to each other and solve for $m$:

1. Intersection of $\frac{m}{100} + 3$ and $3 - \frac{m}{100}$:
\[\frac{m}{100} + 3 = 3 - \frac{m}{100}\]
\[2\frac{m}{100} = 0\]
\[m = 0\]
This does not result in a valid solution as $m$ cannot be $0$.

2. Intersection of $\frac{m}{100} + 3$ and $-1 + \frac{m}{100}$:
\[\frac{m}{100} + 3 = -1 + \frac{m}{100}\]
\[4 = 0\]
This is not possible.

3. Intersection of $3 - \frac{m}{100}$ and $-1 + \frac{m}{100}$:
\[3 - \frac{m}{100} = -1 + \frac{m}{100}\]
\[4 = \frac{2m}{100}\]
\[m = 200\]
This is a valid solution as $m$ is a positive integer.

So, we found one value of $m$ for which the four expressions for $x$ give us 4 distinct solutions. We can use the sympy library to verify that $m = 200$ indeed gives 4 distinct solutions.

```python


INTERMEDIATE OUT :

from sympy import symbols, solve

def find_m():
    m = symbols('m')

    # Intersection of expressions for x
    intersection1 = solve((m/100 + 3) - (3 - m/100), m)
    intersection2 = solve((m/100 + 3) - (-1 + m/100), m)
    intersection3 = solve((3 - m/100) - (-1 + m/100), m)

    return intersection1, intersection2, intersection3

result = find_m()
print(result)
```

CODE RESULTS ([0], [], [200])

INTERMEDIATE OUT :
```output
([0], [], [200])
```
So, we find that $m = 200$ is the only positive integer value for which the equation has 4 distinct solutions. We can verify that $m = 200$ indeed gives 4 distinct solutions by plugging it into the original equation and solving for $x$.

Since we have found a value of $m$ for which the equation has 4 distinct solutions, the number of such $m$ is 1. The problem asks for the number of such $m$, which is a positive integer, so the answer is $\boxed{1}$.
The answer is: $1$
