Below is a math problem you are to solve (positive numerical answer!):
"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"
Analyze this problem and think step by step to come to a solution with programs. After solving the problem, output the final numerical answer within \boxed{}.

Assistant:

 The equation given is:
$$((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0.$$
This equation is equal to zero if and only if either one of the following two conditions is true:
1. $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$, or
2. $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$.

From condition 1, we have $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. This implies that the points lie on the lines $x + y = 10$ and $x - y = 10$.

From condition 2, we have $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$. This implies that the points lie on the lines $x = 8$ and $y = 8$.

The four lines intersect at the points $(8, 2), (8, -2), (-8, 2),$ and $(-8, -2)$. These points form a rectangle with sides of length 8 and 4. The area of this rectangle is $8 \times 4 = 32$.
So the area of the convex polygon is 32.

def polygon_area():
    """The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"""
    # The sides of the rectangle
    length = 8
    width = 4

    # Calculate the area of the rectangle
    area = length * width

    return area

result = polygon_area()
print(result)
```

The area of the convex polygon is $32$. The answer is $\boxed{32}$.

Below is a math problem you are to solve (positive numerical answer!):
"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"
Analyze this problem and think step by step to come to a solution with programs. After solving the problem, output the final numerical answer within \boxed{}.

Assistant:

 The given equation is $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$.
This equation is satisfied if either of the two factors is equal to zero.
The first factor is zero if $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ or $\vert x - y \vert = 10$.
The second factor is zero if $\vert x \vert = 8$ or $\vert y \vert = 8$.
These conditions define a square with side length 16.
The area of this square is $16^2 = 256$.
Therefore, the area of the convex polygon is 256.
The answer is: $256$

"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"
Analyze this problem and think step by step to come to a solution with programs. After solving the problem, output the final numerical answer within \boxed{}.

Assistant:

 The given equation is equivalent to the product of two equations being zero, so either $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$.
The first equation implies that $|x + y| = 10$ and $|x - y| = 10$. This means that the points must lie on a square with side length 10, centered at the origin.
The second equation implies that $|x| = 8$ and $|y| = 8$, so the points must lie on a square with side length 16, centered at the origin.
Therefore, the convex polygon is the intersection of these two squares, which is a square with side length 10.
The area of this square is $10^2 = 100$. The answer is: $100$

 The expression equals zero if either of the factors equals zero.
Let's consider each factor:
1. $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$
This expression equals zero if both $\vert x + y \vert - 10 = 0$ and $\vert x - y \vert - 10 = 0$. This means that $x + y = 10$ and $x - y = 10$ or $x + y = 10$ and $x - y = -10$. The first case gives $x = 5, y = 5$, and the second case gives $x = 0, y = 10$ or $x = 10, y = 0$. These points form a square with side length 10, and its area is $10^2 = 100$.
2. $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$
This expression equals zero if both $\vert x \vert - 8 = 0$ and $\vert y \vert - 8 = 0$. This means that $x = \pm 8$ and $y = \pm 8$. These points form a square with side length 16, and its area is $16^2 = 256$.
However, the intersection of the two regions is the square formed by the points $(5, 5)$, $(5, -5)$, $(-5, 5)$, and $(-5, -5)$, which has side length 10 and area $10^2 = 100$. So, the area of the convex polygon formed by the union of the two regions is the sum of the areas of the two squares minus the area of the smaller square, which is $256 + 100 - 100 = 256$.

So the area of the convex polygon is 256.
The answer is: $256$

Below is a math problem you are to solve (positive numerical answer!):
"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"

 The given equation is a product of two terms equal to zero. Therefore, either the first term is zero or the second term is zero. 

For the first term, we have $|x + y| - 10 = 0$ and $|x - y| - 10 = 0$, which implies $|x + y| = 10$ and $|x - y| = 10$. The solutions to these equations are the lines $x + y = 10$, $x + y = -10$, $x - y = 10$, and $x - y = -10$. These lines form a rectangle.

For the second term, we have $|x| - 8 = 0$ and $|y| - 8 = 0$, which implies $|x| = 8$ and $|y| = 8$. The solutions to these equations are the lines $x = 8$, $x = -8$, $y = 8$, and $y = -8$. These lines also form a rectangle.

Therefore, the points that satisfy the given equation are the intersection points of these two rectangles. The resulting polygon is a square with side length 16 (since the distance between the lines $x + y = 10$ and $x + y = -10$ is 20, and we only consider the positive distance of 10 in the absolute value, and the same applies to the lines $x - y = 10$ and $x - y = -10$).

The area of a square is side length squared, so the area of this square is $16^2 = 256$.

    side_length = 16
    area = side_length ** 2
    return area

result = area_of_square()
print(result)
```

The area of this convex polygon is 256 square units. The answer is $\boxed{256}$.
