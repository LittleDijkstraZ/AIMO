Interesting, let's analyze step by step:



The expression is equal to zero if either of the two terms is equal to zero. This gives us two systems of equations:

1. $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ and $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + (\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$.
2. $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ and $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + (\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$.

From the first system, we have $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$. This implies that $x = -8, 8$ and $y = -8, 8$. So the vertices of the polygon are:

$$A = (-8, -8), B = (-8, 8), C = (8, 8), D = (8, -8).$$

From the second system, we have $\vert x - y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$. This implies that $x = -8, 8$ and $y = -8, 8$. So the vertices of the polygon are also:

$$E = (-8, -8), F = (-8, 8), G = (8, 8), H = (8, -8).$$

So the polygon is a square with side length 16. The area of the square is $16^2 = 256$.

Now let's verify that the area is a positive integer:

```python


INTERMEDIATE OUT :

from sympy import symbols, Rational, simplify

def calculate_area():
    # Side length of the square
    side_length = 16

    # Area of the square
    area = side_length**2

    return area

result = calculate_area()
print(result)
```

CODE RESULTS 256

INTERMEDIATE OUT :
```output
256
```
The area of the convex polygon is 256, which is a positive integer. The answer is: $256$

Interesting, let's analyze step by step:



The equation is a product of two terms equal to zero, which means either the first term is zero or the second term is zero. Let's consider these two cases separately.

Case 1: $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$. This implies $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ or $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. The solutions to these equations are all points on the lines $x + y = 10$, $x + y = -10$, $x - y = 10$, and $x - y = -10$. These lines form a rectangle.

Case 2: $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$. This implies $\vert x \vert = 8$ or $\vert y \vert = 8$. The solutions to these equations are all points on the lines $x = 8$, $x = -8$, $y = 8$, and $y = -8$. These lines form a square.

The intersection of the two cases is a square with side length 10 (the maximum of 8 and 10), so the area of the convex polygon is $10^2 = 100$.

The answer is: $100$

Interesting, let's analyze step by step:



The expression $A \cdot B = 0$ is equivalent to $A = 0$ or $B = 0$. So, the given equation is satisfied if either of the following two conditions is met:

1. $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$
2. $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$

For the first condition to be true, we need both $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. This means that $x + y = \pm 10$ and $x - y = \pm 10$. Solving these equations, we get the vertices of the polygon: $(0, 10)$, $(0, -10)$, $(10, 0)$, $(-10, 0)$, $(8, 8)$, $(8, -8)$, $(-8, 8)$, and $(-8, -8)$.

For the second condition to be true, we need both $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$, which means $x = \pm 8$ and $y = \pm 8$.

Now, let's plot these points on a coordinate plane and connect them to form the polygon. The polygon is a square with side length 16. To find its area, we simply square the side length: $16^2 = 256$.

So, the area of the convex polygon is 256 square units. The answer is: $256$

Interesting, let's analyze step by step:



The equation given is $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$.

This equation equals zero if either of the two factors equals zero. Therefore, we have two cases:

1. $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$
2. $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$

For the first case, either $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ or $( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$. This implies that $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. The solutions to these equations are all points on a square with side length 10.

For the second case, either $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ or $( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$. This implies that $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$. The solutions to these equations are all points on a square with side length 16.

The intersection of the solutions to these two cases is the convex polygon we are looking for. This polygon is the intersection of the two squares, which is another square with side length 8.

The area of a square with side length $s$ is $s^2$. Therefore, the area of the convex polygon is $8^2 = 64$.

So the area of the convex polygon is 64. The answer is: $64$

Interesting, let's analyze step by step:



1. The equation given is a product of two expressions equal to zero. This means that either the first expression is zero or the second expression is zero.

2. The first expression is $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)$. This expression is zero if and only if both $\vert x + y \vert - 10 = 0$ and $\vert x - y \vert - 10 = 0$, which implies $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$.

3. The second expression is $((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2)$. This expression is zero if and only if both $\vert x \vert - 8 = 0$ and $\vert y \vert - 8 = 0$, which implies $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$.

4. From $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$, we can deduce that $x$ and $y$ must be in the range of $[-10, 10]$.

5. From $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$, we can deduce that $x$ and $y$ must be in the range of $[-8, 8]$.

6. Combining these two conditions, we find that the points $(x, y)$ that satisfy the equation are those that lie in the intersection of the two ranges, which forms a square with side length 8.

7. The area of this square is $8^2 = 64$.

So the area of the convex polygon is 64. The answer is: $64$

Interesting, let's analyze step by step:



1. The problem states that the points $(x, y)$ that satisfy the equation $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. The polygon is formed by the set of all points $(x, y)$ that satisfy the equation.

2. The equation is equal to zero if and only if either the first factor or the second factor is zero. This gives us two conditions:

   a) $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$
   b) $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$

3. For the first condition, $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$, both terms must be zero. This implies that $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. This gives us the equation of two squares, each with side length 10. The resulting figure is a square with side length 10.

4. For the second condition, $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$, both terms must be zero. This implies that $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$. This gives us the equation of two circles, each with radius 8. The resulting figure is a square with side length 16 (since the square's side length is twice the radius of the circles).

5. The convex polygon formed by the intersection of the two figures is a square with side length 10.

6. To find the area of this square, we simply square the side length: $Area = 10^2 = 100$.

The area of the convex polygon is 100 square units. The answer is: $100$

Interesting, let's analyze step by step:



The equation is: $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$.

This equation equals zero if either of the two factors equals zero. Therefore, we have two sets of equations:

1. $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ and $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$.
2. $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ and $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$.

From the first set of equations, we get:

1. $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x \vert = 8$.
2. $\vert y \vert = 8$.

From the second set of equations, we get:

1. $\vert x - y \vert = 10$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$.
2. $\vert x \vert = 8$.

Now, let's analyze the absolute value equations:

1. For $\vert x + y \vert = 10$, the solutions are $x + y = 10$ and $x + y = -10$.
2. For $\vert x - y \vert = 10$, the solutions are $x - y = 10$ and $x - y = -10$.
3. For $\vert x \vert = 8$, the solutions are $x = 8$ and $x = -8$.
4. For $\vert y \vert = 8$, the solutions are $y = 8$ and $y = -8$.

By combining these solutions, we get the vertices of the polygon:

$(8, 2), (8, -2), (-8, 2), (-8, -2), (2, 8), (2, -8), (-2, 8), (-2, -8)$.

Now, let's calculate the area of the polygon. The polygon is a square with side length 16. The area of a square is side length squared, so the area is $16^2 = 256$.

The answer is: $256$
