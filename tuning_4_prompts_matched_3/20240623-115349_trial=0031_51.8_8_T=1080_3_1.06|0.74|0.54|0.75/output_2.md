Approach:


We know that the absolute value function $|\cdot|$ makes the function "bounce" at the x-axis. So, the equation $|\vert x-1 \vert -2|=m/100$ will have 4 distinct solutions if the right side $m/100$ is equal to the difference between the values where the function "bounces" up and down.

The function $\vert x-1 \vert -2$ "bounces" up at $x=1+2=3$ and "bounces" down at $x=1-2=-1$. So the difference between these two values is $3-(-1)=4$.

This means that $m/100=4$, so $m=400$. Therefore, there is only one positive integer $m$ that makes the equation have 4 distinct solutions, and that is $m=400$.
The answer is: $1$

Approach:


We need to find the number of positive integers $m$ such that the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has $4$ distinct solutions.

The equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ is equivalent to a piecewise function. We consider three cases based on the value of $x$:

1. If $x \leq 1$, then $\vert x-1 \vert = 1-x$. So the equation becomes $\vert 1-x-2 \vert = \frac{m}{100}$, or $\vert -x-1 \vert = \frac{m}{100}$. This simplifies to $\vert x+1 \vert = \frac{m}{100}$.

2. If $1 < x \leq 3$, then $\vert x-1 \vert = x-1$. So the equation becomes $\vert x-1-2 \vert = \frac{m}{100}$, or $\vert x-3 \vert = \frac{m}{100}$.

3. If $x > 3$, then $\vert x-1 \vert = x-1$. So the equation becomes $\vert x-1-2 \vert = \frac{m}{100}$, or $\vert x-3 \vert = \frac{m}{100}$.

Now, we need to find the number of positive integers $m$ such that each of these cases has $2$ distinct solutions.

For the first case, $\vert x+1 \vert = \frac{m}{100}$, this has $2$ distinct solutions if $\frac{m}{100} < 1$, or $m < 100$.

For the second case, $\vert x-3 \vert = \frac{m}{100}$, this has $2$ distinct solutions if $0 < \frac{m}{100} < 2$, or $0 < m < 200$.

For the third case, $\vert x-3 \vert = \frac{m}{100}$, this has $2$ distinct solutions if $\frac{m}{100} > 2$, or $m > 200$.

So, we need to find the number of positive integers $m$ that satisfy $100 < m < 200$. This is the range of positive integers from $101$ to $199$, inclusive. The number of integers in this range is $199 - 101 + 1 = 99$.

So, the number of positive integers $m$ such that the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has $4$ distinct solutions is $99$.

The answer is: $99$

The given equation is $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$. The number of distinct solutions of this equation is equal to the number of times the graph of $y = \vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert$ intersects the horizontal line $y = \frac{m}{100}$.

The graph of $y = \vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert$ is a V-shaped graph that starts at $(1-2, 0) = (-1, 0)$, goes up to $(1, 2)$, and then back down to $(1+2, 0) = (3, 0)$. The graph is symmetric about the vertical line $x = 1$.

The horizontal line $y = \frac{m}{100}$ intersects the graph of $y = \vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert$ at exactly 4 distinct points if and only if $0 < \frac{m}{100} < 2$. This is because the maximum value of $y = \vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert$ is 2, and the minimum value is 0.

So, we have $0 < \frac{m}{100} < 2$, which simplifies to $0 < m < 200$. The positive integers $m$ that satisfy this inequality are the integers from 1 to 199, inclusive.

So, the number of positive integers $m$ for which the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has 4 distinct solutions is the number of integers from 1 to 199, inclusive. This is equal to 199.

The answer is: $199$

Approach:



1. First, let's understand the structure of the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$. This equation has four distinct solutions if and only if $\frac{m}{100}$ is strictly between $1$ and $2$. This is because the function $f(x) = \vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert$ has a maximum value of $2$ and a minimum value of $1$, and it attains these values exactly once in the interval $(1, 2)$.

2. Multiplying both sides of the inequality $1 < \frac{m}{100} < 2$ by $100$ gives $100 < m < 200$.

3. Now we need to count the number of positive integers $m$ in the interval $(100, 200)$. This is simply the number of integers from $101$ to $199$, which can be found by subtracting the smallest integer in the interval from the largest and then adding $1$. So the number of such integers is $199 - 101 + 1 = 99$.

So the number of positive integers $m$ for which the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has four distinct solutions is $99$. The answer is: $\boxed{99}$

Approach:



1. The equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has 4 distinct solutions means that the expression inside the absolute value, $\vert x-1 \vert -2$, takes the value $\frac{m}{100}$, $0$, $-\frac{m}{100}$ in four different ways.

2. This means that $\vert x-1 \vert -2$ is greater than $\frac{m}{100}$ and less than $-\frac{m}{100}$ once, and between $0$ and $\frac{m}{100}$ or $-\frac{m}{100}$ and $0$ twice.

3. This means that the distance from $2$ to the nearest integer is greater than $\frac{m}{100}$. Thus, $m$ must be less than $200$.

4. We also know that the distance from $2$ to the nearest integer is less than $\frac{m}{100}$ twice. This means that $m$ must be greater than $100$.

5. Combining these two conditions, we find that $m$ must be in the range $100 < m < 200$.

6. The number of positive integers in this range is $100$.

Therefore, the number of positive integers $m$ for which the equation has $4$ distinct solutions is $100$. The answer is: $100$

Assistant:

Approach:


The number of distinct solutions to the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ is equal to 4 when $\frac{m}{100} = 2$. This is because the function $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert$ oscillates between 0 and 4, and it equals 2 exactly 4 times. Therefore, we need to solve the equation $\frac{m}{100} = 2$ for $m$.

Solution:
To solve for $m$, we multiply both sides of the equation $\frac{m}{100} = 2$ by 100 to get $m = 200$.

Therefore, the value of $m$ for which the equation has 4 distinct solutions is 200.
The answer is: 200

The equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has $4$ distinct solutions. This means that the right-hand side $\frac{m}{100}$ must be equal to either $1$ or $3$.

If $\frac{m}{100} = 1$, then $m = 100$.

If $\frac{m}{100} = 3$, then $m = 300$.

Therefore, there are $2$ possible values for $m$.

The answer is: $2$

First, let's understand the problem. The equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has 4 distinct solutions. We need to find the number of positive integer values of $m$ for which this is true.

We know that $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert$ is a piecewise function that takes on different forms depending on the value of $x$. Specifically, it can be written as:

\[
\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert =
\begin{cases}
(1-x)-2 = -x-1, & \text{if } x<1 \\
(x-1)-2 = x-3, & \text{if } 1 \le x < 3 \\
(x-1)-2 = -x+3, & \text{if } x \ge 3
\end{cases}
\]

This gives us three different cases to consider:

1. For $x<1$, the equation becomes $-x-1=\frac{m}{100}$.
2. For $1 \le x < 3$, the equation becomes $x-3=\frac{m}{100}$.
3. For $x \ge 3$, the equation becomes $-x+3=\frac{m}{100}$.

We need to find the number of positive integer values of $m$ for which each of these cases has 4 distinct solutions.

For each case, we need to solve the equation and find the number of distinct solutions. Then, we sum up the number of positive integer values of $m$ found in each case.

Solution:

1. For $x<1$, the equation $-x-1=\frac{m}{100}$ becomes $x=-1-\frac{m}{100}$. This has 4 distinct solutions if $-1-\frac{m}{100}$ is less than 1, greater than or equal to 1, and less than 3. This gives us the range $0 \le m < 200$. So, there are 200 positive integer values of $m$ in this case.

2. For $1 \le x < 3$, the equation $x-3=\frac{m}{100}$ becomes $x=3+\frac{m}{100}$. This has 4 distinct solutions if $3+\frac{m}{100}$ is less than 3, greater than or equal to 3, and less than 5. This gives us the range $0 \le m < 200$. So, there are 200 positive integer values of $m$ in this case as well.

3. For $x \ge 3$, the equation $-x+3=\frac{m}{100}$ becomes $x=3-\frac{m}{100}$. This has 4 distinct solutions if $3-\frac{m}{100}$ is less than 3, greater than or equal to 1, and greater than 1. This gives us the range $0 \le m < 200$. So, there are 200 positive integer values of $m$ in this case as well.

Adding up the number of positive integer values of $m$ from each case, we find that there are $200+200+200=600$ positive integer values of $m$ for which the equation has 4 distinct solutions. However, we are only interested in the number of positive integer values of $m$ in the range $0 < m \le 100$, as the problem states that $m$ is a positive integer. So, we need to find the number of positive integer values of $m$ in the range $0 < m \le 100$.

In the range $0 < m \le 100$, the number of positive integer values of $m$ is simply 100.

Therefore, the number of positive integer values of $m$ in the range $0 < m \le 100$ for which the equation has 4 distinct solutions is 100. The answer is: 100

We want to find the number of positive integers $m$ such that the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has 4 distinct solutions.

Let's first analyze the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$.

The expression $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert$ is equal to a constant $\frac{m}{100}$. The number of solutions to this equation will depend on the value of $\frac{m}{100}$.

If $\frac{m}{100} < 2$, then the equation has no solutions, since the left-hand side is always at least 2.

If $\frac{m}{100} = 2$, then the equation has 2 solutions, since the left-hand side is equal to 2 for two disjoint intervals of $x$.

If $2 < \frac{m}{100} < 4$, then the equation has 4 solutions, since the left-hand side is equal to $\frac{m}{100}$ for four disjoint intervals of $x$.

If $\frac{m}{100} \geq 4$, then the equation has no solutions, since the left-hand side is always less than 4.

So, we need to find the number of positive integers $m$ such that $2 < \frac{m}{100} < 4$.

This is equivalent to finding the number of positive integers $m$ in the range $200 < m < 400$.

The number of positive integers in this range is $400 - 200 - 1 = 199$.

So, there are 199 positive integers $m$ for which the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has 4 distinct solutions.

The answer is: $199$.

Approach:



The equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has $4$ distinct solutions, it means that $\frac{m}{100}$ is the value of the "gap" between the two parts of the absolute value function. This gap is what splits the graph of the absolute value function into $4$ distinct parts. 

Let's denote the "gap" as $g$, so $g=\frac{m}{100}$. The absolute value function $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert$ will be split into $4$ parts when $g=1$. Therefore, we have $g=1$ or $\frac{m}{100}=1$, from which we can solve for $m$ as follows:

\[m = 100.\]

Therefore, there is only $1$ positive integer $m$ for which the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has $4$ distinct solutions. The answer is: $1$

We are given the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ and we want to find out how many values of $m$ will result in 4 distinct solutions.

The equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ can be rewritten as $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=0.01m$.

The equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=0$ has 4 distinct solutions: $x=3, x=1, x=-1, x=-3$.

So, we want to find the values of $m$ such that the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=0.01m$ has the same number of solutions as the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=0$.

This means that $0.01m$ must be a number between 0 and 2 (the range of $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert$), but not equal to 0 or 2.

So, we have $0 < 0.01m < 2$, which simplifies to $0 < m < 200$.

The possible values of $m$ are the integers from 1 to 199.

Therefore, there are 199 possible values of $m$.

However, we need to exclude the cases where $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=0.01m$ has less than 4 distinct solutions.

For $m=0$, the equation has only 2 distinct solutions.

For $m=200$, the equation has only 2 distinct solutions.

So, we need to exclude these two cases.

Therefore, the number of positive integers $m$ for which the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has 4 distinct solutions is 199 - 2 = 197.
The answer is: $197$

We need to find the number of positive integers $m$ for which the equation $| |x - 1| - 2| = \frac{m}{100}$ has exactly 4 distinct solutions.

Let's first consider the equation $| |x - 1| - 2| = \frac{m}{100}$. This equation has 4 distinct solutions if and only if the right side $\frac{m}{100}$ is in the interval $(0, 2)$. This is because the left side $| |x - 1| - 2|$ takes all values in the interval $[0, 2]$ and only in this interval.

So we have $0 < \frac{m}{100} < 2$, which gives $0 < m < 200$. The positive integers $m$ that satisfy this inequality are the integers from $1$ to $199$.

Now we need to find how many of these integers make the equation $| |x - 1| - 2| = \frac{m}{100}$ have exactly 4 distinct solutions. This happens if and only if $\frac{m}{100}$ is in the interval $(0, 2)$. This is true for all $m$ in the interval $(0, 200)$. However, we are only interested in the positive integers $m$, so we need to count the number of positive integers in the interval $(0, 200)$. This is simply the number of integers from $1$ to $199$, which is $199$.

So the number of positive integers $m$ for which the equation $| |x - 1| - 2| = \frac{m}{100}$ has exactly 4 distinct solutions is $199$.
The answer is: 199

The equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has $4$ distinct solutions if and only if $\frac{m}{100} \in (0,2)$. This is because the expression on the left side of the equation, $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert$, can take on any value from $0$ to $2$ and only in this range will it have $4$ distinct solutions.

To find the number of positive integers $m$ in the interval $(0,200)$, we simply need to count the number of integers from $1$ to $200$. However, we should subtract $1$ from the count because $0$ is not an integer. So the number of positive integers $m$ is $200 - 1 = 199$.

But we are asked to find the number of positive integers $m$ such that $\frac{m}{100} \in (0,2)$, which means $m \in (0,200)$. So we need to count the number of integers in this interval. Again, we should subtract $1$ from the count because $0$ is not an integer. So the number of positive integers $m$ is $200 - 1 = 199$.

Therefore, the number of positive integers $m$ for which the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has $4$ distinct solutions is $199$. The answer is: $199$
