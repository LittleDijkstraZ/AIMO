Interesting, let's analyze step by step:



The given equation is a product of two expressions equal to zero. This means that either the first expression is zero or the second expression is zero.

The first expression is $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)$ and the second expression is $((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2)$.

Setting each expression equal to zero, we get:

1. $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ which implies $\vert x + y \vert = 10$.
2. $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ which implies $\vert x - y \vert = 10$.
3. $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ which implies $\vert x \vert = 8$.
4. $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ which implies $\vert y \vert = 8$.

From 3 and 4, we get $-8 \leq x \leq 8$ and $-8 \leq y \leq 8$.

From 1 and 2, we get all points $(x, y)$ that are at a distance of 10 from the lines $x + y = 10$, $x + y = -10$, $x - y = 10$, and $x - y = -10$. These lines form a square with side length 16 (from $-8$ to $8$ in each direction).

So the points that satisfy the given equation are the points enclosed by this square.

The area of this square is side length squared, which is $16^2 = 256$.

Therefore, the area of the convex polygon is 256 square units. The answer is: $256$

Interesting, let's analyze step by step:



The given equation is a product of two expressions equal to zero. This means that either the first expression is zero or the second expression is zero. Let's denote these two expressions as $A$ and $B$:

$$A = ((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)$$
$$B = ((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2)$$

For the product $AB$ to be zero, either $A = 0$ or $B = 0$.

1. If $A = 0$, then we have:
$$(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$$
This can only happen if $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. This means that $x + y = \pm 10$ and $x - y = \pm 10$. Solving these equations, we get the vertices of the polygon: $(0, 10)$, $(0, -10)$, $(10, 0)$, $(-10, 0)$.

2. If $B = 0$, then we have:
$$(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$$
This can only happen if $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$. This means that $x = \pm 8$ and $y = \pm 8$. Solving these equations, we get the vertices of the polygon: $(8, 8)$, $(8, -8)$, $(-8, 8)$, $(-8, -8)$.

Now, we can plot these points on a coordinate plane and connect them to form the polygon. The polygon is a square with side length 10 units. To find the area of the square, we use the formula $A = s^2$, where $s$ is the side length of the square. So, the area of the polygon is $10^2 = 100$.

The answer is: $100$

Interesting, let's analyze step by step:



The equation is $ ((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$.

This equation is equal to zero if and only if at least one of the two factors is zero. Therefore, either $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$.

If $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$, then $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$, which means $x + y = \pm 10$ and $x - y = \pm 10$. Solving these equations gives us the lines $x + y = 10$, $x + y = -10$, $x - y = 10$, and $x - y = -10$.

If $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$, then $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$, which means $x = \pm 8$ and $y = \pm 8$. Solving these equations gives us the lines $x = 8$, $x = -8$, $y = 8$, and $y = -8$.

The four lines $x + y = 10$, $x + y = -10$, $x - y = 10$, and $x - y = -10$ form a rectangle with side lengths 20. The four lines $x = 8$, $x = -8$, $y = 8$, and $y = -8$ form a square with side length 16.

Therefore, the convex polygon enclosed by these lines is a rectangle with side lengths 20 and 16. The area of this rectangle is $20 \times 16 = 320$.

So, the area of the convex polygon is 320.

To verify this is a positive integer, we can simply calculate it: $320$ is a positive integer.

The answer is: $320$.

Interesting, let's analyze step by step:



The equation involves absolute values, which can be challenging to deal with directly. However, we can rewrite the absolute values as piecewise functions:

$\vert x \vert = \begin{cases} x & \text{if } x \geq 0 \\ -x & \text{if } x < 0 \end{cases}$

$\vert y \vert = \begin{cases} y & \text{if } y \geq 0 \\ -y & \text{if } y < 0 \end{cases}$

$\vert x + y \vert = \begin{cases} x + y & \text{if } x + y \geq 0 \\ -(x + y) & \text{if } x + y < 0 \end{cases}$

$\vert x - y \vert = \begin{cases} x - y & \text{if } x - y \geq 0 \\ -(x - y) & \text{if } x - y < 0 \end{cases}$

Now, we can analyze the equation $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$.

This equation equals zero if and only if both $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2) = 0$ and $((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$.

From the first equation, we have $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. This implies that either $x + y = 10$ or $x + y = -10$, and either $x - y = 10$ or $x - y = -10$. Solving these four systems of equations, we find that the points $(x, y)$ lie on a square with side length $20$ centered at the origin.

From the second equation, we have $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$. This implies that either $x = 8$ or $x = -8$, and either $y = 8$ or $y = -8$. Solving these four systems of equations, we find that the points $(x, y)$ lie on a square with side length $16$ centered at the origin.

The intersection of these two regions is the square with side length $20$ centered at the origin, which is the convex polygon we are interested in.

The area of this square is $20^2 = 400$.

Therefore, the area of the convex polygon is $400$.
The answer is: $400$

Interesting, let's analyze step by step:



The equation $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + (\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + (\vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ equals to zero if and only if at least one of the two terms equals zero. Thus, either $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + (\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + (\vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$.

For the first term to be zero, it requires $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. This implies that the points must lie on a square with side length 10 and diagonals of length $10\sqrt{2}$.

For the second term to be zero, it requires $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$, which implies that the points must lie on a square with side length 8 and diagonals of length $8\sqrt{2}$.

The intersection of these two squares forms a smaller square with side length 6 and diagonals of length $6\sqrt{2}$. The area of this square is $36$.

So the area of the convex polygon is 36. The answer is: $36$.

Interesting, let's analyze step by step:



First, we have a condition: $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$. For the product of two numbers to be zero, either one of them must be zero. Therefore, we have two separate conditions:

1. $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$
2. $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$

From the first condition, we have $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. This implies that $x + y = \pm 10$ and $x - y = \pm 10$. Solving these equations gives us the vertices of the polygon.

From the second condition, we have $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$. This implies that $x = \pm 8$ and $y = \pm 8$. Solving these equations gives us the vertices of the polygon.

Now, we can plot these points and find the vertices of the polygon. The polygon is a square with side length 16. To find the area, we simply square the side length: $16^2 = 256$.

So, the area of the polygon is 256. Since the problem asks for a positive numerical answer, the answer is $\boxed{256}$.

Note: In general, solving absolute value equations can be tricky. However, in this case, the absolute value equations are straightforward to solve because the absolute value equals a constant (10 or 8). In more complex cases, you might need to consider different cases based on the value of the expression inside the absolute value being positive or negative.

Interesting, let's analyze step by step:



The equation $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + (\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ implies that $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$.
This means that $x + y = \pm 10$ and $x - y = \pm 10$.
The solutions to these equations are: $(x, y) = (5, 5), (5, -5), (-5, 5), (-5, -5)$.

Similarly, the equation $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + (\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ implies that $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$.
This means that $x = \pm 8$ and $y = \pm 8$.
The solutions to these equations are: $(x, y) = (8, 8), (8, -8), (-8, 8), (-8, -8)$.

The intersection of these two sets of points is the set of points $(x, y) = (8, 8), (8, -8), (-8, 8), (-8, -8), (5, 5), (5, -5), (-5, 5), (-5, -5)$.

These points form a square with side length 10, so the area of the square is $10^2 = 100$.

The area of the convex polygon is 100.
The answer is: 100

Interesting, let's analyze step by step:



The equation is defined as: 

$$((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0.$$

For the product of two factors to be zero, either the first factor or the second factor must be zero. Therefore, we have two cases to consider:

Case 1: $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$
Case 2: $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$

For Case 1, both $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2$ and $( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2$ must be zero. This implies that $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. This is the equation of a square with side length 10, centered at the origin.

For Case 2, both $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2$ and $( \vert y \vert - 8)^2$ must be zero. This implies that $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$. This is the equation of a square with side length 16, centered at the origin.

The intersection of these two squares is the convex polygon we are looking for. The side length of the smaller square (Case 1) is 10, and the side length of the larger square (Case 2) is 16. The intersection of these two squares forms a square with side length 8.

To find the area of this square, we simply square the side length: $8^2 = 64$. So the area of the convex polygon is 64 square units. The answer is: $64$

The equation is:

$$((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$$

This equation equals zero if and only if at least one of the two factors equals zero. Thus, we have four cases to consider:

1. $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ and $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ and $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$.
2. $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ and $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ and $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$.
3. $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ and $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ and $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$.
4. $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$, $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ and $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$.

For each case, we set the variables equal to their possible values:

1. $x = \pm 8$ and $y = \pm 8$.
2. $x = \pm 8$ and $y = \pm 8$.
3. $x = \pm 8$ and $y = \pm 8$.
4. $x = \pm 8$ and $y = \pm 8$.

In all cases, the points are the same, so the convex polygon is a square with side length $16$. The area of this square is $16^2 = 256$.

So, the area of the convex polygon is $256$. The answer is: $256$.

Interesting, let's analyze step by step:



The equation $AB = 0$ implies that either $A = 0$ or $B = 0$. So the given equation is equivalent to either $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2) = 0$ or $((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$.

The first equation implies $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. The second equation implies $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$. 

This gives us the vertices of the polygon: $(8,0)$, $(0,8)$, $(-8,0)$, $(0,-8)$, $(0,10)$, $(10,0)$, $(-10,0)$, $(0,-10)$. 

Now, we can calculate the area of the polygon. The polygon is a square with side length 10, so its area is $10^2 = 100$. 

Therefore, the area of the convex polygon is 100. The answer is: $100$

The expression $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ implies that $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. This is only possible when $x = \pm 10$ and $y = \pm 10$.

- $(8, 8)$, $(-8, -8)$, $(8, -8)$, and $(-8, 8)$ from the second equation.

These points form a square with side length 20 (the maximum of $10+10$ and $8+8$), so its area is $20^2 = 400$.

The area of the convex polygon formed by these points is 400. The answer is: $400$

## QUESTION 3 - 11 
- TIME_SPENT : 966 secs

11_User:

Below is a math problem you are to solve (positive numerical answer):
"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"

To accomplish this:
- List the variables and known values from the problem.
- Outline the steps using sympy to solve the problem:
  * Identify the sympy functions required for each step.
  * Implement these functions step-by-step, commenting each line for clarity.
- Calculate the final answer and verify it's a positive integer.
- Output the result within \boxed{}.

Assistant:

Interesting, let's analyze step by step:



1. We have a product of two expressions equal to zero: $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$. This implies that either the first expression is zero or the second expression is zero.

2. If the first expression is zero, then both $\vert x + y \vert - 10 = 0$ and $\vert x - y \vert - 10 = 0$, which means $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. Solving these absolute value equations gives us the lines $x + y = 10$, $x + y = -10$, $x - y = 10$, and $x - y = -10$. These lines form a square with side length 10.

3. If the second expression is zero, then both $\vert x \vert - 8 = 0$ and $\vert y \vert - 8 = 0$, which means $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$. Solving these absolute value equations gives us the lines $x = 8$, $x = -8$, $y = 8$, and $y = -8$. These lines form a square with side length 16.

4. The convex polygon is the intersection of the two squares, which is another square with side length 10.

5. The area of a square with side length $s$ is $s^2$. So the area of the convex polygon is $10^2 = 100$.

The positive integer area of the convex polygon is 100. The answer is: $100$
