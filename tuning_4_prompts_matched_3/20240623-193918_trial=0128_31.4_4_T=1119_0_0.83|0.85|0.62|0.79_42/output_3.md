Below is a math problem you are to solve (positive numerical answer!):
"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"
Analyze this problem and think step by step to come to a solution with programs. After solving the problem, output the final numerical answer within \boxed{}.

Assistant:

 The equation given in the problem, $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$, is satisfied only when at least one of the factors is zero. This means that either $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$.
For the first factor to be zero, we must have $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. This gives us four lines: $x + y = 10$, $x + y = -10$, $x - y = 10$, and $x - y = -10$.
For the second factor to be zero, we must have $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$. This gives us four lines: $x = 8$, $x = -8$, $y = 8$, and $y = -8$.
The intersection points of these lines are the vertices of the polygon. By plotting these lines, we find that the polygon is a square with side length 16.
The area of this square is $16^2 = 256$.
So, the area of the convex polygon is 256. The answer is: $256$

"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"

Assistant:

 The equation given in the problem is a product of two expressions equal to zero, which means that either the first expression is zero or the second expression is zero.

The first expression is $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)$, and this equals to zero if and only if both $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. This implies that the points $(x, y)$ are on the lines $x + y = 10$ and $x - y = 10$. These lines intersect at $(5,5)$ and form a cross shape.

The second expression is $((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2)$, and this equals to zero if and only if both $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$. This implies that the points $(x, y)$ are on the lines $x = 8$ and $y = 8$, which form a square with side length 16.

The convex polygon formed by the intersection of these two shapes is a square with side length 10 (the smaller square inscribed in the larger square). So the area of the convex polygon is $10^2 = 100$.

The answer is: $100$

"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"

The given equation is equal to zero if and only if both of the factors are equal to zero. The factors are:
\[((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)\] and \[((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2).\]
The first factor equals zero if and only if both $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. This means that the points $(x, y)$ lie on the lines $x + y = 10$ and $x - y = 10$. These lines intersect at $(5, 5)$.
The second factor equals zero if and only if both $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$. This means that the points $(x, y)$ lie on the lines $x = 8$ and $y = 8$. These lines intersect at $(8, 8)$.
Therefore, the points $(x, y)$ that satisfy the given equation are those that lie on the lines $x + y = 10$, $x - y = 10$, $x = 8$, and $y = 8$. These lines form a square with side length $10$, and the area of this square is $10^2 = 100$. The answer is: $100$

Below is a math problem you are to solve (positive numerical answer!):
"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"
Analyze this problem and think step by step to come to a solution with programs. After solving the problem, output the final numerical answer within \boxed{}.

Assistant:

 The given equation is equal to zero if and only if both $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ and $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ and $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$.
This implies that $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x \vert = 8$ or $\vert x - y \vert = 10$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$.
The solutions to these equations are the vertices of the polygon.
The vertices are $(8,0)$, $(0,8)$, $(-8,0)$, $(0,-8)$, $(8,18)$, $(18,8)$, $(-8,-18)$, and $(-18,-8)$.
To find the area of the polygon, we can divide it into four right triangles with vertices at $(0,0)$, $(8,0)$, and $(0,8)$, $(0,0)$, $(0,-8)$, and $(8,0)$, $(0,0)$, $(18,8)$, and $(8,18)$, and $(0,0)$, $(-8,0)$, and $(-8,-18)$.
The area of each triangle is $\frac{1}{2} \cdot 8 \cdot 8 = 32$.
So the total area of the polygon is $4 \cdot 32 = 128$. The answer is: $128$

Analyze this problem and think step by step to come to a solution with programs. After solving the problem, output the final numerical answer within \boxed{}.

Assistant:

 The given equation is equal to zero if and only if both factors are equal to zero. Therefore, we have two sets of equations to solve:

1. $\vert x + y \vert - 10 = 0$ and $\vert x - y \vert - 10 = 0$
2. $\vert x \vert - 8 = 0$ and $\vert y \vert - 8 = 0$

Solving the first set of equations, we get:

1. $\vert x + y \vert = 10 \Rightarrow x + y = \pm 10$ or $x + y = 0$
2. $\vert x - y \vert = 10 \Rightarrow x - y = \pm 10$ or $x - y = 0$

Solving the second set of equations, we get:

1. $\vert x \vert = 8 \Rightarrow x = \pm 8$
2. $\vert y \vert = 8 \Rightarrow y = \pm 8$

The solutions to these equations give us the vertices of the polygon: $(8,8)$, $(8,-8)$, $(-8,8)$, and $(-8,-8)$. These points form a square with side length 16. The area of a square is given by the square of the length of its side, so the area of the polygon is $16^2 = 256$.
The answer is: $256$

"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"
Analyze this problem and think step by step to come to a solution with programs. After solving the problem, output the final numerical answer within \boxed{}.

Assistant:

 The expression $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ is equal to zero if and only if at least one of the factors is zero. This means that either $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$, $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$, $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$, or $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$.
For $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$, we have $\vert x + y \vert = 10$. This is the equation of a square with side length 20.
Similarly, for $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$, we have $\vert x - y \vert = 10$, which is also the equation of a square with side length 20.
And for $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ and $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$, we have $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$, which are the equations of squares with side length 16.
The intersection of these squares forms a convex polygon, which is a square with side length 10.
To find the area of this square, we simply square the length of its side, so the area is $10^2 = 100$.
The answer is: $100$

"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"

 The given equation is a product of two expressions equal to zero. This means that either the first expression is zero or the second expression is zero. 

The first expression is $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)$. This expression is zero if and only if both $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. These are the equations of two squares with side length 10 centered at the origin.

The second expression is $((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2)$. This expression is zero if and only if both $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$, which means the point is in a square with side length 16 centered at the origin.

The points that satisfy both conditions are the points where the two squares intersect. This intersection forms a smaller square with side length 8 (since the side length of the smaller square is the difference of the side lengths of the larger squares divided by 2).

The area of a square is given by the square of its side length, so the area of the convex polygon is $8^2 = 64$.

Therefore, the area of the convex polygon is 64. The answer is: $64$

Below is a math problem you are to solve (positive numerical answer!):
"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"
Analyze this problem and think step by step to come to a solution with programs. After solving the problem, output the final numerical answer within \boxed{}.

Assistant:

 The equation $A \cdot B = 0$ implies that either $A = 0$ or $B = 0$. Therefore, the given equation is satisfied if either of the following two equations is satisfied:
1. $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$
2. $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$

For equation 1 to be satisfied, we must have $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. This means that the points $(x, y)$ lie on the lines $x + y = 10$ and $x - y = 10$ or their opposites. These lines form a square with side length 10.

For equation 2 to be satisfied, we must have $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$. This means that the points $(x, y)$ lie on the lines $x = 8$ and $y = 8$ or their opposites. These lines form a square with side length 16.

The convex polygon enclosed by the points satisfying the given equation is the intersection of the two squares, which is another square with side length 10.

The area of this square is $10^2 = 100$. Therefore, the area of the convex polygon is 100 square units. The answer is: $100$
