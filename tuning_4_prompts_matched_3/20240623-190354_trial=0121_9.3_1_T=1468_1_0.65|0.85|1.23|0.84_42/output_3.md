Interesting, let's analyze step by step:



The expression $A \cdot B = 0$ is true if either $A = 0$ or $B = 0$. Thus, the given equation is satisfied if either of the following two conditions hold:

1. $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$
2. $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$

From condition 1, we have $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. This implies that the points $(x, y)$ lie on a square with side length 10 and diagonals of length $10\sqrt{2}$.

From condition 2, we have $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$. This implies that the points $(x, y)$ lie on a square with side length 8 and diagonals of length $8\sqrt{2}$.

The intersection of these two squares is a smaller square with side length 6 and diagonals of length $6\sqrt{2}$. The area of this square is $6^2 = 36$. So the area of the convex polygon is 36 square units. The answer is: $36$

Interesting, let's analyze step by step:



1. The equation given is a product of two expressions equal to zero. This means that either the first expression is zero or the second expression is zero.
2. The first expression is $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)$, and this equals zero if and only if both $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. This means that the points $(x, y)$ must lie on the lines $x + y = 10$ and $x - y = 10$ or their opposites. These lines form a square with side length 10.
3. The second expression is $((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2)$, and this equals zero if and only if both $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$. This means that the points $(x, y)$ must lie on the lines $x = 8$ and $y = 8$ or their opposites. These lines form a square with side length 16.
4. The intersection of the two squares is the convex polygon we are looking for. The area of this convex polygon is the area of the smaller square, which is $10 \times 10 = 100$.

So the area of the convex polygon is 100. The answer is: $100$.

Interesting, let's analyze step by step:



The equation $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ is satisfied only when both $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ and $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ and $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$.

From the first two equations, we have $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. This means that the points $(x, y)$ lie on the lines $x + y = 10$ and $x - y = 10$.

From the second set of equations, we have $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$. This means that the points $(x, y)$ lie on the lines $x = 8$ and $y = 8$.

The intersection of these lines forms a square with side length 8. The area of this square is $8^2 = 64$.

So, the area of the convex polygon is 64.

The answer is: $64$

Interesting, let's analyze step by step:



1. The problem involves absolute values and square of absolute values. We can use the property $|x|^2 = x^2$ to simplify the problem.

2. We can start by solving the equations $|x + y| - 10 = 0$ and $|x - y| - 10 = 0$ separately, and then $|x| - 8 = 0$ and $|y| - 8 = 0$ separately.

3. From $|x + y| - 10 = 0$, we get $|x + y| = 10$, which implies $x + y = 10$ or $x + y = -10$. Similarly, from $|x - y| - 10 = 0$, we get $|x - y| = 10$, which implies $x - y = 10$ or $x - y = -10$. From $|x| - 8 = 0$, we get $|x| = 8$, which implies $x = 8$ or $x = -8$. Similarly, from $|y| - 8 = 0$, we get $|y| = 8$, which implies $y = 8$ or $y = -8$.

4. By solving these equations, we find the vertices of the polygon are $(8,8)$, $(8,-8)$, $(-8,8)$, and $(-8,-8)$.

5. To find the area of the polygon, we can use the formula for the area of a rectangle and subtract the areas of the four right triangles formed by the sides of the rectangle. The rectangle has side lengths $16$ and $16$, so its area is $256$. Each right triangle has legs of length $16$ and $16$, so its area is $1/2 * 16 * 16 = 128$. Since there are four such triangles, the total area of the triangles is $4 * 128 = 512$.

6. The area of the polygon is then the area of the rectangle minus the area of the triangles, which is $256 - 512 = -256$. However, the area cannot be negative. We must have made a mistake in our calculations.

7. Upon reexamination, we realize that we should not have subtracted the areas of the triangles from the area of the rectangle. Instead, we should have simply calculated the area of the rectangle, which is indeed $256$.

8. The area of the polygon is therefore $256$.

Now let's verify that the area is a positive integer:

```python


INTERMEDIATE OUT :

from sympy import Rational

def area_of_polygon():
    """The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"""
    # Calculate the side lengths of the rectangle
    side_length_x = 16
    side_length_y = 16

    # Calculate the area of the rectangle
    area = side_length_x * side_length_y

    return area

result = area_of_polygon()
print(result)
```

CODE RESULTS 256

INTERMEDIATE OUT :
```output
256
```
The area of the polygon is $256$, which is a positive integer. Therefore, the area of the convex polygon is $256$. The answer is: $256$.

Interesting, let's analyze step by step:



1. The equation is given as: $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$.
2. This equation is equal to zero if either of the two factors is zero. So we have two cases:
   a. $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$.
   b. $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$.
3. For the first case, either $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$ or $\vert x + y \vert = 0$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 0$. The only possibility that gives a non-trivial solution is $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. This forms a square with side length 10.
4. For the second case, either $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$ or $\vert x \vert = 0$ and $\vert y \vert = 0$. The only possibility that gives a non-trivial solution is $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$. This forms a square with side length 16.
5. The intersection of these two squares forms a smaller square with side length 8.
6. The area of the convex polygon is the area of the smaller square, which is $8^2 = 64$.

The answer is: $64$

Interesting, let's analyze step by step:



The expression $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ is true only when either of the two expressions is zero. This gives us four cases to consider:

1. $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ and $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ and $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$.
2. $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ and $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ and $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 \neq 0$.
3. $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ and $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 \neq 0$ and $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$.
4. $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ and $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 \neq 0$ and $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 \neq 0$.

Case 1 gives us $x = y = 8$.
Case 2 gives us $x = 8$ and $y$ can be any value.
Case 3 gives us $y = 8$ and $x$ can be any value.
Case 4 gives us a square with side length 16.

So, the points that satisfy the equation are the vertices of a square with side length 16. The area of this square is $16^2 = 256$. The answer is: $256$

Interesting, let's analyze step by step:



1. The equation is $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + (\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + (\vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$. For the product of two numbers to be zero, either one of them has to be zero. This gives us two cases:

   Case 1: $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + (\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2) = 0$. This implies that $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$.
   
   Case 2: $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + (\vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$. This implies that $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$.

2. From case 1, we have $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. This implies that the points $(x, y)$ lie on a square with side length 10.

3. From case 2, we have $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$. This implies that the points $(x, y)$ lie on a square with side length 16.

4. The intersection of the two squares gives us the convex polygon that encloses the points $(x, y)$ that satisfy the original equation. The area of this convex polygon is the area of the smaller square minus the area of the larger square.

5. The area of the larger square is $16^2 = 256$, and the area of the smaller square is $10^2 = 100$.

6. Therefore, the area of the convex polygon is $100 - 256 = -156$. But this is not possible, as the area of a polygon cannot be negative.

7. Let's re-evaluate the steps. We made a mistake in step 4: The intersection of the two squares does not give us the convex polygon we are looking for. The points that satisfy both cases simultaneously are the vertices of the larger square that are also in the smaller square. This means we need to find the points that are in both squares.

8. The vertices of the larger square with side length 16 that are also in the smaller square with side length 10 are the points $(5, 5)$, $(5, -5)$, $(-5, 5)$, and $(-5, -5)$.

9. The area of the convex polygon is the area of the square formed by these vertices, which is $10^2 = 100$.

So, the area of the convex polygon is 100. The answer is: $100$

Interesting, let's analyze step by step:



The equation given is:
$$((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0.$$

This equation is equal to zero if either of the two factors is equal to zero. Therefore, we have two sets of equations to solve:

1. $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ and $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$.
2. $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ and $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$.

For the first set of equations, we have:
$$\vert x + y \vert = 10$$ and $$\vert x \vert = 8.$$
This implies that $-10 \leq x + y \leq 10$ and $-8 \leq x \leq 8$.

For the second set of equations, we have:
$$\vert x - y \vert = 10$$ and $$\vert y \vert = 8.$$
This implies that $-10 \leq x - y \leq 10$ and $-8 \leq y \leq 8$.

The solutions to these inequalities form a square with side length 16 in the coordinate plane. The area of this square is $16^2 = 256$.

So, the area of the convex polygon is 256. The answer is: $256$
