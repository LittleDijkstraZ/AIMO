Below is a math problem you are to solve (positive numerical answer!):
"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"
Analyze this problem and think step by step to come to a solution with programs. After solving the problem, output the final numerical answer within \boxed{}.

Assistant:

 The given equation is a product of two terms equal to zero, so either the first term is zero, the second term is zero, or both are zero.
The first term is zero when $\vert x + y \vert - 10 = 0$ or $\vert x - y \vert - 10 = 0$, which simplifies to $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$.
The second term is zero when $\vert x \vert - 8 = 0$ or $\vert y \vert - 8 = 0$, which simplifies to $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$.
The solutions to these equations are the vertices of the polygon:
- For $\vert x + y \vert = 10$, the vertices are $(5, 5)$, $(5, -5)$, $(-5, 5)$, and $(-5, -5)$.
- For $\vert x - y \vert = 10$, the vertices are $(5, -5)$, $(-5, 5)$, $(-5, -5)$, and $(5, 5)$.
- For $\vert x \vert = 8$, the vertices are $(8, 0)$, $(-8, 0)$, $(0, 8)$, and $(0, -8)$.
- For $\vert y \vert = 8$, the vertices are $(0, 8)$, $(0, -8)$, $(8, 0)$, and $(-8, 0)$.

From these vertices, we can see that the polygon is a square with side length 10.
The area of a square is given by side length squared, so the area of this polygon is $10^2 = 100$. The answer is: $100$

Below is a math problem you are to solve (positive numerical answer!):
"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"

Assistant:

 The problem involves two absolute value expressions, which makes it challenging to solve directly. However, we know that the product of two numbers is zero if and only if at least one of the numbers is zero. This gives us two cases to consider:

1. $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$
2. $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$

For the first case, this means that either $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ or $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. The solutions to these equations are the lines $x + y = 10$, $x + y = -10$, $x - y = 10$, and $x - y = -10$.

For the second case, this means that either $\vert x \vert = 8$ or $\vert y \vert = 8$. The solutions to these equations are the lines $x = 8$, $x = -8$, $y = 8$, and $y = -8$.

The points that satisfy both cases are the intersections of these lines. By drawing these lines, we find that the points form a square with side length 16. The area of this square is $16^2 = 256$. The answer is: $\boxed{256}$.

Below is a math problem you are to solve (positive numerical answer!):
"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"

Assistant:

 The given equation is $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$. For the product of two numbers to be zero, either one of the numbers must be zero. So either $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$.

The first equation holds only when $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$, which are the equations of two lines. The second equation holds only when $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$, which are the equations of four lines.

The points that satisfy these equations are the intersections of these lines, which form a square with side length 16. The area of this square is $16^2 = 256$. So the area of the convex polygon is 256.

Here is a Python program that calculates the area:

```python


INTERMEDIATE OUT :

def polygon_area():
    """The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"""
    side_length = 16
    area = side_length ** 2
    return area

result = polygon_area()
print(result)
```

CODE RESULTS 256

INTERMEDIATE OUT :
```output
256
```
The area of the convex polygon is $\boxed{256}$. The answer is $\boxed{256}$.

 The given equation is $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$. This equation is satisfied if either of the following conditions is met:
1. $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$, which implies that $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. This gives us four lines: $x + y = 10$, $x + y = -10$, $x - y = 10$, and $x - y = -10$.
2. $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$, which implies that $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$. This gives us four lines: $x = 8$, $x = -8$, $y = 8$, and $y = -8$.
These lines form a square with side length $10$ (the distance between the lines $x + y = 10$ and $x + y = -10$ or $x - y = 10$ and $x - y = -10$), so the area of the convex polygon is $10^2 = 100$. The answer is: $100$

The given equation is a product of two expressions equal to zero. This means that either the first expression is zero or the second expression is zero. Let's consider these two cases separately.

Case 1: $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$. This can only happen if $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. This means that $x + y = \pm 10$ and $x - y = \pm 10$. Solving these four equations, we find that the points satisfying this case are $(0, 10)$, $(0, -10)$, $(10, 0)$, and $(-10, 0)$.

Case 2: $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$. This can only happen if $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$. This means that $x = \pm 8$ and $y = \pm 8$. Solving these four equations, we find that the points satisfying this case are $(8, 8)$, $(8, -8)$, $(-8, 8)$, and $(-8, -8)$.

Combining the points from both cases, we see that the convex polygon is a square with side length 10 units. The area of this square is $10^2 = 100$ square units. The answer is: $100$

"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"

 This problem is quite complex and requires a deep understanding of absolute values and inequalities. However, it is important to note that the expression will be equal to zero if either of the two terms inside the parentheses is zero.
The first term inside the parentheses will be zero if $|\pm x \pm y| = 10$. This forms a square with side length 20.
The second term inside the parentheses will be zero if $|\pm x| = 8$ or $|\pm y| = 8$. This forms a square with side length 16.
The convex polygon formed by the intersection of these two squares is a smaller square with side length 8. The area of this square is $8^2 = 64$.
Therefore, the area of the convex polygon is 64 square units. The answer is: $64$

"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"

This problem is a mathematical problem that requires a deep understanding of absolute value and how it operates in equations. The equation is given as:
\[((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0\]
The equation equals zero if either of the two products is zero. This implies that either:
\[(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0 \text{ or } (\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0 \text{ or } (\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0 \text{ or } (\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0.\]
Each of these equations implies that the absolute value of a quantity is equal to 10 or 8. The absolute value of a quantity equals a certain value if the quantity is either positive or negative the value. This gives us a system of equations to solve:

1. $x + y = \pm 10$
2. $x - y = \pm 10$
3. $x = \pm 8$
4. $y = \pm 8$

By solving these equations, we find that the points that satisfy the conditions are:

$(8, 2)$, $(8, -2)$, $(-8, 2)$, $(-8, -2)$, $(2, 8)$, $(-2, 8)$, $(2, -8)$, and $(-2, -8)$.

Plotting these points in the coordinate plane, we see that they form a square with side length 16. The area of this square is $16^2 = 256$. Therefore, the area of the convex polygon is 256. The answer is: $256$
