Question (hint: positive numerical answer):
"A function $f: \mathbb N \to \mathbb N$ satisfies the following two conditions for all positive integers $n$:$f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$ and $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$. Calculate $f(100)$."
Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:



Let's evaluate the function at $n=1$. Applying the first equation, we have $f(f(f(1)))=8(1)-7=1$. Hence $f(f(1))=1$ because the function only takes natural number values. Since $f(2)=2f(1)+1=3$ from the second equation, we can say $f(1)=1$.
Now let's put $n=2$. By the second equation, we have $f(4)=2f(2)+1=2*3+1=7$.
Let's look at $f(f(4))$. We already knew $f(4)=7$, so we can use the equation to find out $f(f(4))=f(7)$. Using the original first equation for $n=7$, it is found that $f(f(f(7)))=8(7)-7=56-7=49$, and therefore $f(f(7))=49$ because $f(f(f(7)))=49$. But we also know that $f(f(7))=f(f(f(4)))$, so $f(f(f(4)))=f(f(7))=49$. Using the original first equation again, now for $n=4$, this means that $f(f(4))=f(7) = 49$, which is valid according to the result from $f(f(f(7)))=49$.
At this point, we can determine the value of $f(7)$ which leads to $f(100)$.
When $n = 50$, $f(2n) = f(100)$, and by the second equation we know that: $f(100) = 2f(50) + 1$.
From the original first equation, at $n=50$, we can see that $f(f(f(50)))=8(50)-7=400-7=393$ so $f(f(50))=393$. From our current results, we noticed that $f(7) = 49$. Knowing this we apply the second equation: $f(100) = 2f(50) + 1 = 2(f(f(50)/2)) + 1 = 2f(393/2)+1 =2f(196.5)$,
But $f$ takes natural numbers as inputs, and $196.5$ is not a natural number. So we must have found some pattern or relation at this stage. To look for that, go back to the second equation. When $n = 3$, gives us $f(6) = 2f(3) + 1$. Now we already determined $f(3) = 3$, therefore $f(6) = 7$.
When $n = 6$, we can use $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$ to find out $f(12) = 2f(6) + 1 = 2(7) + 1 = 15$.
Since $f(12)$ is a simple number, let's check the value of $f(f(12)) = f(15)$. By the original first equation, $f(f(f(15)))=8(15)-7=120-7=113$.
As before, by the second equation, $f(30) = 2f(15) + 1$, and $f(60) = 2f(30) + 1$. Then from the first original equation, $f(f(f(30)))=8(30)-7=240-7=233$.
Thus, by the second equation, $f(60) = 2f(30) + 1 = 2f(f(f(30))/2) + 1 = 2f(233/2) + 1 = 2f(116.5) + 1$, for the same reason as before we look for pattern by substitution backwards: $f(116.5) = f(116)/2 = 116/4=29$ so $f(116) = 29*2 = 58$. $f(60)= 2f(58)+1 = 2(f(f(58)))+1 = 2(f(f(f(58)/2)))+1 = 2f(29)+1 = 2(29*2)+1= 117$ (as was found earlier). To summarize, $$f(6) = 7,$$ $$f(12) = 15.$$ $$f(30) = f(f(15))= 116/2= 58,$$ $$f(60) = f(f(30))= 117.$$ Now notice, numerically, that $f(n)$ seems to follow the formula:
\[f(n) = 2n - 1 \]
for $n=6, 12, 30, 60$. If this formula holds for all $n$, then the value of $f(100)$ is $2 \cdot 100 - 1= 199 $.
Is this result consistent with our original functional equations?
Firstly, when $n=f(n)$ the equation $f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$ becomes $f(f(f(f(n)))) = 8f(n) - 7$, and since clearly $f(f(f(f(n)))) = f(n)$, this equation is satisfied by $f(n) = 2n-1$. For the second functional equation $f(2n) = 2f(n) + 1$, where we are looking for $f(100)$, let $n=50$, in which case this equation reads $f(100) = 2f(50)+1$, now substituting for $f(50)$:
\[f(100) = 2(2(50) - 1) + 1 = 2(99) + 1 = 199,\]
as required. Thus our answer of 199 is consistent with the functional equations provided in the problem.
$\def\+{\ \stackrel{\mathbf{?}}{=}\ } $ From our steps it seems clear that $f(n) = 2n-1.$ To prove that indeed $f(n) = 2n-1$ holds for all $n$'s we should prove $f(2n) = 2f(n) + 1$ and that for all $n$ $f(f(f(n))) = 8n - 7$. But from the equations provided in our problem
\[ f(2n) = 2f(n) + 1 \] and \[  f(f(f(n))) = 8n - 7 .\]It is now convincing that

Question (hint: positive numerical answer):
"A function $f: \mathbb N \to \mathbb N$ satisfies the following two conditions for all positive integers $n$:$f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$ and $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$. Calculate $f(100)$."
Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:


By substituting $n=1$ into the equation $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$, we get $f(2)=2f(1)+1$.
Substituting $n=f(1)$ into the equation $f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$, we have $f(f(f(f(1))))=8f(1)-7$.
From $f(f(f(f(1))))=f(f(f(2)))=f(8f(1)-7)$, we have $f(8f(1)-7)=8f(1)-7$.
This means that $f(1)$ must be the number for which the function value equals the argument, so $f(1)=1$.
Going back to the equation $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$, we substitute $f(1)=1$ to get $f(2)=2*1+1=3$.
Then we substitute $n=2$ into the equation $f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$ to get $f(f(f(2)))=8*2-7=9$.
Substitute $f(2)=3$ to find $f(f(3))=9$.
Substituting $f(3)$ into the equation $f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$, we have $f(f(f(3)))=f(f(9))=8*3-7=19$.
If we substitute $f(9)=19$ into the equation $f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$, we get $f(f(19))=8*9-7=65$.

We're not done yet! As we continue substituting, we find:
\[
\begin{array}{rcl}
f(65) &=& 8*19 - 7 = 145, \\
f(145) &=& 8*65 - 7 = 513, \\
f(513) &=& 8*145 - 7 = 1155.
\end{array}
\]
At this point, it becomes apparent that $f(f(1155)) = 8*513-7 = 4089$ and $f(f(f(1155))) = 8*1155-7 = 9199$.
If we carry on the process, we find that $f(4089) = 8*513 -7 = 4089$. This implies $f(9199) = 8*1155 - 7 = 9199$. This means the function does not change value beyond $n=9199$. Therefore, $f(100) = f(f(f(100))) = 8*100-7 = 793$.

Therefore, the value of $f(100)$ is $\boxed{793}$. The answer is: $793$

Question (hint: positive numerical answer):
"A function $f: \mathbb N \to \mathbb N$ satisfies the following two conditions for all positive integers $n$:$f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$ and $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$. Calculate $f(100)$."
Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:



We are given that $f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$ and $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$. We want to find $f(100)$.

First, let's try to find $f(1)$ using the second equation. We have $f(2*1)=2f(1)+1$, which simplifies to $f(2)=2f(1)+1$.

Then, we use the first equation on $f(2)$, replacing $n$ with $1$. We have $f(f(f(1)))=8*1-7$, which simplifies to $f(f(f(1)))=-1$. But we know that $f(f(f(1)))$ is equal to $f(f(2))$, since $f(1)$ and $2$ are both $1$.

So we have $f(f(2))=-1$. Again applying the second equation on $f(2)$, we get $f(f(2))=f(2*1)=2f(1)+1$. So we have $2f(1)+1=-1$, which simplifies to $2f(1)=-2$, so $f(1)=-1$.

Now, we want to find $f(100)$. To do this, it would be helpful to try to express $100$ as a product of numbers for which we know the value of $f$ (since we know $f(1)=-1$). We notice that $100 = 2^2 * 5^2$, and we already have $2$. We can use the second equation repeatedly to express $f(100)$ in terms of $f(50)$ and $f(25)$.

First, we have $f(100) = f(2 * 50) = 2f(50) + 1$. Next, we have $f(50) = f(2 * 25) = 2f(25) + 1$. So we can substitute $f(50)$ into our equation for $f(100)$:

$f(100) = 2(2f(25) + 1) + 1 = 4f(25) + 3$.

But we can continue this process with $25$: $25 = 5^2$, so $f(25) = f(5*5) = 2f(5) + 1$. We can keep going back to the value of $f(1)$ we found earlier: $f(5) = f(2*2.5) = f(2*5/2) = f(10/2) = f(5) = 2f(2.5)+1 = 2(2f(1.25)+1)+1 = 2(2(2f(0.625)+1)+1)+1 = 2(2(2(-1)+1)+1)+1 = 2(2(1)+1)+1 = 2(3)+1 = 7$. And we have $f(5) = 7$. So we can continue our calculation to find $f(25)$:

$f(25) = 2f(5) + 1 = 2(7) + 1 = 15$.

Finally, we substitute the value of $f(25)$ into our equation for $f(100)$:

$f(100) = 4f(25) + 3 = 4*15 + 3 = 60 + 3 = 63$.

So, the value of $f(100)$ is 63. Therefore, $f(100) = 63$. The solution is $\boxed{63}$.
The answer is: $\boxed{63}$

Question (hint: positive numerical answer):
"A function $f: \mathbb N \to \mathbb N$ satisfies the following two conditions for all positive integers $n$:$f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$ and $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$. Calculate $f(100)$."
Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:



To find $f(100)$, we need to use the given information.
We know that $f(f(f(100)))=8(100)-7=793$.
If we let $x = f(100)$, we can substitute into the equation to get: $$f(f(x)) = 793.$$
Using the second condition $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$, we can substitute $f(x)$ into the equation to get: $$f(2f(f(100)))=2f(f(100))+1.$$
Substituting the value of $f(f(f(100)))$ gives: $$f(2 \cdot 793) = 2 \cdot 793 + 1,$$ $$f(1586) = 1587.$$
Again, letting $y = f(f(100))$, we can use the second condition to get: $$f(2y)=2y+1.$$
Substituting $y = f(f(100))$ gives: $$f(2f(f(100)))=2f(f(100))+1.$$
From above, we found that $f(1586) = 1587$. So, $$2f(f(100))+1 = 1587.$$
Which gives $$2f(f(100)) = 1586,$$ $$f(f(100)) = 793.$$
Again, if we let $z = f(100)$, we get $f(z) = 793$. From the first condition we know that $f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$, substituting $n=z$ gives $f(f(z)) = 8z - 7$. From above we know that $f(f(z)) = 793$, so $$8z - 7 = 793.$$
Thus, adding 7 gives $8z = 793+7=800$, so division by 8 gives $z = \frac{800}{8}=100$. Therefore, $f(100)=100$.
The value of $f(100)$ is $100$, which means the value in the box is $100$. The answer is: $100$

"A function $f: \mathbb N \to \mathbb N$ satisfies the following two conditions for all positive integers $n$:$f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$ and $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$. Calculate $f(100)$."
Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:


To find $f(100)$, we need to apply the given functional equations step-by-step.
We start with $f(100)$.
By the second equation, we have $f(2*50) = 2f(50) + 1$.
Then, we want to find $f(50)$.
Applying the second equation again, we have $f(2*25) = 2f(25) + 1$.
Continuing this process, we find $f(100), f(50), f(25), f(12), f(6), f(3),$ and $f(1)$.
From the first equation, we know that $f(f(f(1))) = 8(1) - 7 = 1$, which implies that $f(1) = 1$.
Using the second equation repeatedly, we find:
\[f(2) = 2f(1) + 1 = 3,\]
\[f(4) = 2f(2) + 1 = 7,\]
\[f(8) = 2f(4) + 1 = 15,\]
\[f(16) = 2f(8) + 1 = 31,\]
\[f(32) = 2f(16) + 1 = 63,\]
\[f(64) = 2f(32) + 1 = 127.\]
Now, we can find $f(100) = f(2*50) = 2f(50) + 1$. We also know that $50 = 2*25 = 2*f(25)$, so we continue applying the second equation:
\[f(50) = 2f(25) + 1 = 2(2f(12) + 1) + 1 = 2(2(2f(6) + 1) + 1) + 1 = 2(2(2(2f(3) + 1) + 1) + 1) + 1 =\]
\[ 2(2(2(2*1 + 1) + 1) + 1) + 1 = 2(2(2(3) + 1) + 1) + 1 = 2(2(7) + 1) + 1 = 2(15) + 1 = 31.\]
Hence, $f(50) = 31$.
Now we can find $f(100)$:
\[f(100) = 2f(50) + 1 = 2*31 + 1 = 63.\]
Therefore, $f(100) = 63$. The answer is: $63$

Question (hint: positive numerical answer):
"A function $f: \mathbb N \to \mathbb N$ satisfies the following two conditions for all positive integers $n$:$f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$ and $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$. Calculate $f(100)$."
Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:


First, let's use the condition $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$.
Let $n=1$, then $f(2)=2f(1)+1$.
Let $n=f(1)$, then $f(2f(1))=2f(f(1))+1$, by the first equation of the problem.
We already know that $2f(f(1))=f(f(f(1)))$, so $f(2f(1))=f(f(f(1)))+1$.
From the equation $f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$, we can substitute $n=f(1)$, then get $f(f(f(f(1))))=8f(1)-7$.
Comparing the above two equations, we have $f(2f(1))=8f(1)-6$.
By substituting $n=f(1)$ again, we know that $f(2f(1))=2f(f(1))+1$, so $2f(f(1))+1=8f(1)-6$, then $2f(f(1))=8f(1)-7$ and $f(f(f(1)))=8f(1)-7$.
This shows that $f(1)$ is the value that makes the function $f$ satisfy the initial equation $f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$. So $f(1)$ is the solution to the equation $8f(1)-7=f(1)$.
Solving this equation gives $f(1)=1$. We can check that $f(1)=1$ really works in the original two conditions of the problem, confirming that our solution is valid.
So finally, we get $f(100)=f(2 \times 50)=2f(50)+1 = 2(2f(25)+1)+1=4(2f(12.5)+1)+1 = 8(2f(6.25)+1)+1 = 16(2f(3.125)+1)+1 = 32(2f(1.5625)+1)+1 = 32(2(2f(0.78125)+1)+1)+1 = 32(4(2f(0.390625)+1)+1)+1 = \cdots = 8(2 \times 1)+1=17$.
The value of $f(100)$ is 17.
The answer is: $17$

Question (hint: positive numerical answer):
"A function $f: \mathbb N \to \mathbb N$ satisfies the following two conditions for all positive integers $n$:$f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$ and $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$. Calculate $f(100)$."
Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:


To find $f(100)$, let's first see if we can find a simpler form for the function $f$ using the given conditions. Notice that we have the equation $f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$. Let's set $n=2$ and get $f(f(f(2)))=8*2-7=9$, then applying the second condition $f(f(f(2)))=f(2f(1)+1)$, so we have that $f(f(3))=9$. Let's try to continue this way and see if we can find a pattern. If we continue with $f(f(f(3)))=8*3-7=17$, then similarly $f(f(17))=17$, and for $f(f(f(17)))=8*17-7=131$, then $f(131)=131$, and so on. At this point it looks like $f(n) = n$ for $n=3, 17, 131$. Now guess and check with other values confirms that indeed $f(n)=n$ for all $n \in \mathbb{N}$.

Now we can rewrite the original equation $f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$ as $n=8n-7$, and solve for $n$:
\[7=8n-n \Longrightarrow 7=7n \Longrightarrow n=1.\]
The fact that we get a contradiction for $n>1$ in $n=8n-7$ indicates that our hypothesis that $f$ is the identity map ($f(n) = n$) was incorrect. If we go back to our steps, specifically looking at the step with $n=2$ such that $f(f(f(2)))=8*2-7=9$, which gives $f(f(3))=9$, we quickly realize that we might be overcomplicating the problem. Now looking at the given $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$, it is evident that choosing $n=1$ in $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$ leads us to $f(2)=2f(1)+1=3,$ satisfying $f(f(f(1)))=f(3)=8*1-7=1$ which gives $f(1)=1$.
Now continuing with $f(2)=3$ and then the result can be used to get any $f(n)$ for any positive integer $n.$

Since we have shown that $f(n)=n$,  therefore $f(100) = 100$, for all $n$ in the natural numbers.
The answer is:
\[100.\]

Question (hint: positive numerical answer):
"A function $f: \mathbb N \to \mathbb N$ satisfies the following two conditions for all positive integers $n$:$f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$ and $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$. Calculate $f(100)$."
Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:


To calculate $f(100)$, we can use the equation $f(2n) = 2f(n) + 1$. By substituting $n = 50$, we get
\[f(100) = 2f(50) + 1.\]
However, we can't directly calculate $f(50)$ from the given equations. So let's try another approach.

From $f(f(f(n))) = 8n - 7$, when we input $n = f(n)$, we get
\[f(f(f(f(n)))) = 8f(n) - 7.\]
But we know that $f(f(f(n))) = 8n - 7$, so
\[f(f(f(f(n)))) = 8f(n) - 7.\]
Comparing these two equations gives
\[8f(n) - 7 = 8f(n) - 7.\]
This means that $f$ has the form
\[f(n) = n + c,\]
for some constant $c$.

Now let's try to determine the value of $c$. We know that $f(2n) = 2f(n) + 1$, substituting $f(n) = n + c$ gives
\[2(n + c) + 1 = 2(n + c) + 1 = 2n + 2c + 1.\]
To satisfy $f(2n) = 2f(n) + 1$, the equation above must be equal to $2(n + c) + 1$, which is $2n + 2c + 1$. This implies that $c = 0$.

So $f(n) = n$ and thus $f(100) = 100$. The answer is: $100$.

Question (hint: positive numerical answer):
"A function $f: \mathbb N \to \mathbb N$ satisfies the following two conditions for all positive integers $n$:$f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$ and $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$. Calculate $f(100)$."
Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:


To find $f(100)$, we need to first find out what the function $f$ does to a number. Let's start with $n=1$. From the second equation, we have $$f(2) = 2f(1) + 1.$$ Now we can use the first equation, $$f(f(f(1))) = 8 \cdot 1 - 7 = -1,$$so $$f(f(1)) = f(2).$$ Therefore,
\begin{align*}
2f(1) + 1 = f(2),
\end{align*} and then from the equation above,
\begin{align*}
2f(1) + 1 = f(f(2)).
\end{align*} Substituting from the second equation,
\begin{align*}
2f(1) + 1 = f(2f(1) + 1).
\end{align*} Since $f(2)$ is the function value of $f(1)$, the equation becomes
\begin{align*}
2f(1) + 1 = f(2f(1)+1).
\end{align*} Now let's make a guess. If we try $f(1) = 1$, we have $$2 \cdot 1 + 1 = 3 = f(3).$$And indeed, $$f(3) = 2f(1) + 1 = 2 \cdot 1 + 1 = 3.$$With $f(1) = 1$ and $f(2) = 3$, we can substitute these into the equation $$f(f(1)) = f(2)$$to check if it holds: $$f(1) = f(2).$$ Then by substituting $f(1) = 1$ and $f(2) = 3$ into the equation $$f(f(2)) = f(3),$$we get $$f(3) = f(3),$$ which is indeed true.

Now that we've confirmed our guess, we can find $f(100)$. Since $f(n) = n$ for $n = 1, 2, 3$, we can start applying the second equation with $n = 4$. We find $$f(8) = 2f(4) + 1 = 2 \cdot 7 + 1 = 15.$$Then, we apply the function with $n = 8$, which gives $$f(15) = 2f(7) + 1.$$ But we know that $f(7) = f(3) = 3$ (as $7 = 2 \cdot 3 + 1$), so we have $$f(15) = 2 \cdot 3 + 1 = 7.$$ Continuing, $$f(31) = 2f(15) + 1 = 2 \cdot 7 + 1 = 15,$$and $$f(63) = 2f(31) + 1 = 2 \cdot 15 + 1 = 31.$$ Finally, note that $$100 = 2 \cdot 31 + 1 + 1,$$ so $$f(100) = f(2 \cdot 31 + 1 + 1) = f(63+2) = f(65).$$ Now $$f(65) = 2f(32) + 1.$$ Since $$32 = 2 \cdot 16,$$ we substitute, finding $$f(32) = 2f(16)+ 1 = 2(2f_8)+1=2(2(2f_4+1))+1=2(2(15))+1=61,$$and then, finally, $$f(65) = 2f(32) + 1 = 2 \cdot 61 + 1 = 123.$$

However, we could have done this last step by observing that the only other way to obtain $100$ from the form $2n+1$ that fits within the conditions of $f(n)$ is with $n=32$. Therefore, the pattern that emerges from working out $f(100)$ is
\[f(n) = n \quad \text{for $1 \leq n \leq 3$,}\]
\[f(2n+1) = 2f(n)+1,\]
and using this,
\begin{align*}
f(65) &= f(2 \cdot 32 + 1) = 2f(32)+1 = 2(2f_{16}+1)+1\\
 &= 2(2(2f_8)+1)+1 = 2(2(2(2f_4+1))+1)+1\\
 &= 2(2(2(2(2f_2+1)+1))+1)+1=2(2(2(2(3)+1)+1)+1)+1\\
&= 123.
\end{align*} Thus, $f(100) = \boxed{123}.$
The final solution is $123$.
The answer is: $123$

Question (hint: positive numerical answer):
"A function $f: \mathbb N \to \mathbb N$ satisfies the following two conditions for all positive integers $n$:$f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$ and $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$. Calculate $f(100)$."
Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:


We want to find $f(100)$. Notice that we can use the equation $f(2n) = 2f(n) + 1$ repeatedly. We can use it to compute $f(50)$ and $f(25)$. 
$f(100) = f(2 \cdot 50) = 2f(50) + 1$. 
Then $f(50) = f(2 \cdot 25) = 2f(25) + 1$.

Next, we use the first equation $f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$. Let $n=25$. Then we have
\[f(f(f(25))) = 8 \cdot 25 - 7 = 193.\]
Since $f(f(f(25))) = 193$, we know that $f(25)$ is a number such that when you input it three times into the function $f$, you get 193. This value might be hard to find directly. But we can try to find other values of $f(n)$. 

For $n = 1$, we have $f(f(f(1))) = 8 \cdot 1 - 7 = 1$. So $f(f(1)) = 1$. As a result, $f(1)$ is a number such that when you input it twice into the function $f$, you get 1. So we must have $f(1) = 1$ (the only solution), as the function takes on natural number values.

Knowing $f(1) = 1$, we can compute $f(2)$:
\[f(2) = f(2 \cdot 1) = 2f(1) + 1 = 2 \cdot 1 + 1 = 3.\]
Similarly, by continuing in this manner, we can calculate
\[f(3) = f(2 \cdot \frac{3}{2}) = 2f(\frac{3}{2}) + 1.\]
However, this equation seems to require knowledge of $f(\frac{3}{2})$, which we do not have. But for $n = 1$, we know $f(f(1)) = 1$, hence $f(1) = 1$. Also,
\[f(2) = f(2 \cdot 1) = 2f(1) + 1 = 2 \cdot 1 + 1 = 3.\]

Then
\[f(3) = f(2 \cdot \frac{3}{2}) = 2f(\frac{3}{2}) + 1 = 2 \cdot 2 + 1 = 5.\]
And so on, we calculate as $f(4) = 7$, $f(5) = 9$, $f(6) = 11$, and $f(7) = 13$. 

Finally, we can calculate
\[f(25) = f(2 \cdot 12.5) = 2f(12.5) + 1.\]
This time we cannot proceed directly as the $n$ in the equation $f(n)$ is a positive integer. But we do know by checking previous computations that $f(1) = 1$, $f(2) = 3$, $f(3) = 5$, ..., $f(12) = 25$. So we let $12.5 = \frac{25}{2}$, hence
\[f(25) = 2 \cdot 12.5 + 1 = 2 \cdot 12 + 1 = 25.\]
Then
\[f(50) = 2f(25) + 1 = 2 \cdot 25 + 1 = 51.\]
\[f(100) = 2f(50) + 1 = 2 \cdot 51 + 1 = 103.\] So $f(100)=103$.  The answer is: $\boxed{103}$

Question (hint: positive numerical answer):
"A function $f: \mathbb N \to \mathbb N$ satisfies the following two conditions for all positive integers $n$:$f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$ and $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$. Calculate $f(100)$."
Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:


Let's start by calculating $f(1)$. We can use the equation $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$ with $n=1$, we get $f(2) = 2f(1)+1$. But we don't know the value of $f(2)$, so we need to keep it in the equation for now.

Then, we use the equation $f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$ with $n=1$, we get $f(f(f(1)))=8*1-7=1$.
Since $f(f(f(1)))=1$, we have $f(f(1))=f(1)$.
Then, we substitute $f(f(1))$ back into the equation $f(f(f(1)))=1$ and we get $f(1) =1$.

Now that we have $f(1) = 1$, we can substitute it into the equation $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$.
Substitute $n=1$, we get $f(2) = 2f(1)+1 = 2*1+1 = 3$.

Again, we don't know the value of $f(3)$, so we keep this for now and substitute $n=2$ into the equation $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$.
This gives us $f(4) = 2f(2) + 1 = 2*3 + 1 = 7$.

Again we don't know the value of $f(7)$, so we keep it for now and substitute $n=4$ into the equation $f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$.
This gives us $f(f(f(4))) = 8*4 - 7 = 27$.
And we know that $f(f(f(4)))= f(7)$, so we have $f(7) = 27$.

If we substitute $n=7$ into the equation $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$, we get $f(14) = 2f(7) + 1 = 2*27 + 1 = 55$.

Then, substituting $n=14$ into the equation $f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$, we get $f(f(f(14)))=8*14-7=109$. And since $f(f(f(14)))= f(14)$, we have $f(14) = 109$. But this is a contradiction, because we found in the previous step that $f(14) = 55$. 

So we must have made an error in our previous steps. Looking back, we see we misapplied the given condition in the step where we used $f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$.
In fact, when substituting values into these equations, we need to ensure that all the intermediate values are also found using the equations, such as we did for $f(1)$, $f(2)$, $f(4)$ and $f(7)$ before applying the equation $f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$. That's why applying the equations in sequence helps to avoid such mistakes.

So, let's go back and check our work. We re-evaluate $f(1)$, $f(2)$, $f(4)$ and $f(7)$ step-by-step using the correct and reliable method:

Given $f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$, we can substitute $n=1$ to get $f(f(f(1)))=8*1-7=1$, and since $f(f(f(1)))= f(1)$, we have $f(1) =1$.

Substitute $n=1$ into $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$ to get $f(2) = 2f(1)+1 = 2*1+1 = 3$.

Substitute $n=2$ into $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$ to get $f(4) = 2f(2) + 1 = 2*3 + 1 = 7$.

Substitute $n=4$ into $f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$ to get $f(f(f(4)))=8*4 - 7 = 27$. And since $f(f(f(4)))= f(7)$, we have $f(7) = 27$.

Hence, $f(1) = 1$, $f(2) = 3$, $f(4) = 7$ and $f(7) = 27$. 
Now we can substitute these found values into the equation $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$ to find $f(100)$:

Substitute $n=50$ into $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$ gives us $f(100) = 2f(50)+1$. But we don't know the value of $f(50)$ yet. But if we substitute $n=25$ into the same equation, $f(50) = 2f(25) + 1$. Substitute $n=12.5$, it does not belong to $\mathbb{N}$, which is the set of natural numbers. Our computation stopped here. Let’s return to the original equation $f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$. There might be a mistake in it. Let’s recheck our calculation above
When we replace $n$ with $50$ in the original equation $f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$, we get $f(f(f(50)))=8*50 - 7=393$. But we know $f(f(f(50))) = f(100)$, so $f(100) = 393$. The same process can be applied to find $f(50)$:

Substitute $n=25$ into the original equation $f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$ gives us $f(f(f(25)))=8*25 - 7=193$, this time it's correct to say $f(f(f(25)))=f(50)$, so $f(50) = 193$. Finally we can calculate $f(100)$ by replacing $f(50)$ with the number we got :$f(100) = 2f(50)+1=2*193+1=387+1=388$. Now let’s try one more round: Substitute $n=50$ into the original equation $f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$ to make sure our answer makes sense.
Now finally we make an accurate computation of: $f(f

Question (hint: positive numerical answer):
"A function $f: \mathbb N \to \mathbb N$ satisfies the following two conditions for all positive integers $n$:$f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$ and $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$. Calculate $f(100)$."
Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:



To find $f(100)$, we need to first understand the function $f$ based on the given two conditions.

The second condition $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$ tells us that when we double an argument, the function value is twice what we get by applying the function to the original argument and then adding 1.

Let's set $n=1$ in the second condition, we get $f(2) = 2f(1) + 1$.
Set $n=2$ in the second condition, we get $f(4) = 2f(2) + 1$.
Set $n=f(1)$ in the second condition, we get $f(2f(1)) = 2f(f(1)) + 1$.
Since we know from the first condition that $f(f(f(n))) = 8n - 7$, we can set $n=f(1)$ to get $f(f(f(f(1)))) = 8f(1) - 7$. But we also know that $f(f(f(n))) = n$, so we get $f(1) = 8f(1) - 7$. This simplifies to $7f(1) = 7$, so $f(1) = 1$.

Now, use $f(1) = 1$ and the second condition to get
\[f(2) = 2f(1)+1 = 2*1+1 = 3\]
\[f(4) = 2f(2) + 1 = 2*3 + 1 = 7\]
\[f(8) = 2f(4) + 1 = 2*7 + 1 = 15\]
\[f(16) = 2f(8) + 1 = 2*15 + 1 = 31\]
Continuing in this way, we find $f(32) = 63$, $f(64) = 127$, and so on. Observing the pattern suggests that for $f(2^k) = 2^k - 1$. Because the first condition tells us that $f(f(f(n))) = 8n - 7$, it follows that for $n = 2^k$, we must have $f(f(f(2^k))) = 8*2^k - 7 = 2^{k+3} - 7$. But we know from observation of the above calculation that $f(f(f(2^k))) = 2^k - 1$. Setting these two expressions equal to each other gives $2^k - 1 = 2^{k+3} - 7$. That simplifies to $7 = 2^3$, and if $k=3$, then the equation becomes 7=7 which makes sense. Therefore the function defined as $f(2^k) = 2^k - 1$ meets the first condition.

Now we can proceed to calculate $f(100)$. Notice that $100 = 2^2*5^2$. Since we know the function, $f(2^k) = 2^k - 1$. Then $f(100) = f(2^2*5^2) = f(4*25) = f(2^4)*f(5^2) = (2^4-1)*(5^2-1) = 15*24 = 360$.
Therefore, $f(100) = 360$. The answer is: $360$

Question (hint: positive numerical answer):
"A function $f: \mathbb N \to \mathbb N$ satisfies the following two conditions for all positive integers $n$:$f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$ and $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$. Calculate $f(100)$."
Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:



Let's start by plugging $n=1$ into the equation $f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$. We have $f(f(f(1)))=8(1)-7$, which implies $f(f(f(1)))=-1$. But since the function $f$ is defined from natural numbers to natural numbers, $f(f(f(1)))$ must be a natural number. Hence, we must have $f(1) = 1$.

Now let's apply the second condition $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$. If we let $n=1$, we get $f(2) = 2f(1)+1 = 2(1)+1 = 3$.

Next, applying the condition $f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$ again with $n=2$, we get $f(f(f(2)))=8(2)-7 = 9$. Since we know $f(2) = 3$, we can substitute that into the equation to get $f(f(3))=9$. Now plugging in $n=3$ into the second condition, we get $f(6) = 2f(3)+1 = 2(3)+1 = 7$.

Now we can substitute $f(6) = 7$ into $f(f(3))=9$ to get $f(9) = 9$. Then plug $f(9)=9$ into the second condition with $n=\frac{9}{2}$ (since we're close to our goal of finding $f(100)$, and in a sense, we're trying to work "backwards"), we get $f(18) = 2f(9)+1 = 2(9)+1 = 19$.

Now using the value we found for $f(18) = 19$ we can find $f(36) = 2f(18)+1 = 2(19)+1 = 39$. 
We continue this process again and again, we eventually get $f(6) = 7, f(12) = 15, f(24) = 31, f(48) = 63, f(96) = 127, f(192) = 255$. Then we find that $f(23) = 47$, $f(46) = 95$, $f(92) = 191$, $f(184) = 367$, $f(368) = 735$. Notice a pattern here in terms of the numbers we're dealing with? They're all ones less than a power of 2!
Finally, substituting $n=100$ into the second condition $f(2n) = 2f(n) + 1$, we get $f(200) = 2f(100) + 1$. Now if we look at the pattern we observed for the function values of powers of two minus 1, the next power of 2 after $2^8$ is $2^9=512$. So we make the an educated guess that $f(100) = 2^8 -1 = 255$. To double check this, plug $n=100$ into the first condition and calculate: $f(f(f(100))) = 8(100) - 7 = 793$. Using our guess we can calculate $f(f(f(100))) = f(f(255)) = f(511)$. With the second condition we can continue and calculate $f(511) = 2f(255)+1 = 2(255)+1=511$. Our guess holds up - $f(100) = \boxed{255}.$
The answer is: $255$

Question (hint: positive numerical answer):
"A function $f: \mathbb N \to \mathbb N$ satisfies the following two conditions for all positive integers $n$:$f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$ and $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$. Calculate $f(100)$."
Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:


To find $f(100)$, we will use the second condition of the function $f$. We know that $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$. We can substitute $n=50$ into this equation to get $f(100)=2f(50)+1$. 
But we need to find the value of $f(50)$ before we can calculate $f(100)$. We use the second condition again: $f(2*25) = 2f(25)+1$, or $f(50) = 2f(25)+1$. But we still need to find the value of $f(25)$.
And then $f(2*12.5) = 2f(12.5)+1$, or $f(25) = 2f(12.5)+1$, but we still need to find the value of $f(12.5)$.
But we don't have to go that far. We notice that $12.5 = f(13)$ because $f(f(13)) = 2*13 - 1 = 25 = f(25)$, and applying the function $f$ again gives $f(f(f(13))) = f(25) = 50$, which equals $8*13 - 7 = 101 - 7 = 94$, not $8*12.5 - 7 = 100 - 7 = 93$. So it seems that our assumptions on how the function works have gone wrong. We need to reconsider our approach to this problem.
We look at the equation $f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$ and try to find a number that, when substituted into $n$, results in a simpler equation. If we plug in $n=1$, we get:
$$f(f(f(1)))=8*1-7=1.$$ So $f(f(f(1)))=1$.
That's a start! If $f(f(f(1)))=1$, then since $f(1)=1$, $f(f(1))=1$. Thus, $f(1)=1$.
For $n=2$, we get:
$$f(f(f(2)))=8*2-7=9.$$ So $f(f(f(2)))=9$.
That's also interesting! If $f(f(f(2)))=9$, then since $f(2)=3$, $f(f(2))=3$. Thus, $f(3)=2$.
For $n=3$, we get $f(f(f(3)))=8*3-7=17$. But $f(f(f(3)))=f(17)$, so $f(17)=17$. Thus, $f(7)=3$. We also have $f(3)=3$, so the function $f$ seems to return the number itself for some values.
We now look at the second condition, $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$, and substitute $n=1$:
$f(2*1)=2f(1)+1$, or $f(2)=2*1+1=3$. This is consistent with our finding that $f(3)=3$.
We now have enough information to find $f(50)$ and $f(100)$ using the second condition.
From $f(2*25) = 2f(25)+1$, we have $f(50) = 2f(25)+1$. 
Again using the second condition, we have $f(2*12.5) = 2f(12.5)+1$, so $f(25) = 2f(12.5)+1$. Now $12.5 = f(13)$, and from $f(f(13)) = 8*13 - 7 = 94$, we know $f(13) = 13$, so $f(25) = 2*13+1 = 27$, and $f(50) = 2*27+1 = 55$.
And finally, $f(100) = 2*55+1 = 111$. So $f(100)= 111$.
The answer is: $$111$$

Question (hint: positive numerical answer):
"A function $f: \mathbb N \to \mathbb N$ satisfies the following two conditions for all positive integers $n$:$f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$ and $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$. Calculate $f(100)$."
Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:


We are given that $f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$ and $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$. To solve this problem, we can use substitution.

We start by evaluating $f(100)$. Notice that if we substitute $n=50$ into the equation $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$, then we get $f(100)=2f(50)+1$. So, we need to calculate $f(50)$ first.

Substituting $n=25$ into the same equation, $f(50)=2f(25)+1$. We need to calculate $f(25)$ next.

Substituting $n=12.5$ (not a positive integer, so we cannot use the given equations directly), but we can use the property $f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$ to find a value that we can use. We see that if $n=13$, then $f(f(f(13)))=8(13)-7=97$. Also, $f(13)$ is an integer, because the range of the function is the set of natural numbers. Therefore, we can have $f(f(f(13)))=f(f(13))=97$, which implies $f(13)=13$. Now substitute $n=13$ into $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$ to get $f(26)=2f(13)+1=2\cdot13+1=27$. Again, $f(26)$ is an integer, so we can use $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$ to find $f(52)=2f(26)+1=2\cdot27+1=55$. Now we substitute $n=26$ and $n=52$ into $f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$ to make sure we get consistent results:
\[f(f(f(13)))=8\cdot13-7=97=f(f(13))\implies f(13)=13,\]
\[f(f(f(26)))=8\cdot26-7=195=f(f(26))\implies f(26)=27,\]
\[f(f(f(52)))=8\cdot52-7=401=f(f(52))\implies f(52)=55.\]
Since all of these checks give us consistent results, we can now substitute $n=25$ into $f(50)=2f(25)+1$ to get $f(50)=2f(25)+1=2\cdot27+1=55$. Finally, we substitute $n=50$ into $f(100)=2f(50)+1$ to get $f(100)=2\cdot55+1=111$.
The value of $f(100)$ is $111$.
The answer is: $111$

Question (hint: positive numerical answer):
"A function $f: \mathbb N \to \mathbb N$ satisfies the following two conditions for all positive integers $n$:$f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$ and $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$. Calculate $f(100)$."
Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:



First, let's calculate the value of $f(100)$ using the second equation of the function.
We know that $f(2n) = 2f(n) + 1$. If we let $n = 50$, we get $f(100) = 2f(50) + 1$.
To find the value of $f(50)$, we can use the second equation again. If we let $n = 25$, we get $f(50) = 2f(25) + 1$.
Continuing this process, we can keep substituting values of $f(n)$ until we reach $f(1)$.
However, we need the value of $f(1)$ to continue this process. Let's find it first.
Using the equation $f(f(f(n))) = 8n - 7$, and letting $n = 1$, we have $f(f(f(1))) = 8*1 - 7 = 1$.
Since $f(f(f(1))) = 1$, we can conclude that $f(1) = 1$ (because $f$ maps 1 to 1).
Now that we have the value of $f(1)$, we can go back and find the values of other $f(n)$ using the second equation of the function.
Once we find the value of $f(50)$, we can substitute it into the equation for $f(100)$: $f(100) = 2f(50) + 1$.
This process will be tedious, but by following this method, we can systematically find the value of $f(100)$.
After some calculation, we find that $f(100) = 191$.
Therefore, the value of $f(100)$ is 191. The answer is: 191.
