Question (hint: positive numerical answer):
"For how many positive integers $m$ does the equation \[\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}\] have $4$ distinct solutions?"
Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:



First, we graph $f(x) = \vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert$. If we solve for each of the two absolute values separately, we get the graph:

\[\vert x-1 \vert - 2 =
\begin{cases}
-(x-1) - 2 = -x + 1 - 2 = -x - 1, \quad \text{if } x<1 \\
(x-1) - 2 = x - 1 - 2 = x - 3, \quad \text{if } x \geq 1
\end{cases}\]
This gives us two linear equations:
\[f(x) = 
\begin{cases}
-x - 1, \quad \text{if } x<1 \\
x - 3, \quad \text{if } x \geq 1
\end{cases}\]
We can see from this graph that $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert= \frac m {100}$ has $4$ distinct solutions if $\frac m {100}$ falls between $1$ and $2$. Therefore, $1 < \frac m {100} < 2$, and multiplying through by $100$ tells us $100 < m < 200$. Now we just need to count the number of positive integers in this range. They are $101, 102, \dots, 199$, so there are $199 - 101 + 1 = 99$. However, we have an error in our reasoning so far. The graph of $f(x)$ shows that $f(x)$ is increasing on the interval $(1,3)$, but the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert= \frac m {100}$ has $4$ distinct solutions only if $\frac m {100} = 1$ or $\frac m {100} = 2$. So we must consider the value of $m$ separately for $\frac m {100} = 1$ and $\frac m {100} = 2$. For $\frac m {100} = 1$, we have $m = 100$, and for $\frac m {100} = 2$, we have $m = 200$. There are only two values of $m$, not 99, that make the equation have four distinct solutions.
The error in our reasoning comes from confusing the number of solutions to the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert= \frac m {100}$ with the number of positive integers in the range $1 < \frac m {100} < 2$. The equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert= \frac m {100}$ has $4$ distinct solutions only if $\frac m {100} = 1$ or $\frac m {100} = 2$, and there are only two positive integers, $100$ and $200$, that fall into this range.
To determine the value of $m$, we substitute these values back into the equation and solve for $m$:
If $\frac m {100} = 1$, then $m = 100$.
If $\frac m {100} = 2$, then $m = 200$.
So the valid values for $m$ are 100 and 200, and the only possible positive integer values that satisfy this condition are 100 and 200.
Therefore, there are two positive integers $m$ that make the equation have four distinct solutions. The answer is: $\boxed{2}$

Question (hint: positive numerical answer):
"For how many positive integers $m$ does the equation \[\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}\] have $4$ distinct solutions?"
Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:


The number of distinct solutions to the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ is determined by the value of $\frac{m}{100}$.

For $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ to have four distinct solutions, the absolute value expression on the left hand side must equal a value that has three transition points in the domain of $x$.

The expression $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert$ is equal to some value $k$ when $k = \vert x-1 \vert -2$ or $k = 2-\vert x-1 \vert$. This expression has three transition points when $k=0$, $k=2$, and $k=\frac{m}{100}$.

Setting $k = 0$ gives $\vert x-1 \vert = 2$, so $x = 3$ or $x = -1$.
Setting $k = 2$ gives $\vert x-1 \vert = 0$, so $x = 1$.
Setting $k = \frac{m}{100}$, we must choose $\frac{m}{100}$ such that it falls strictly between $0$ and $2$. That means $0 < \frac{m}{100} < 2$, which gives $0 < m < 200$. The positive integers $m$ satisfying this condition are $1, 2, ..., 199$.

However, not all values of $m$ in this range give four distinct solutions. For example, if $m = 100$, then $\frac{m}{100} = 1$, and the absolute value expression would be equal to $1$ at $x = 0$, $x = 2$, and $x = 1 \pm 1$, which gives only three distinct solutions.

To obtain four distinct solutions, we need to choose $m$ such that $\frac{m}{100}$ divides the interval $(0, 2)$ into three equal parts. This is achieved when $\frac{m}{100} = \frac{2}{3}$, which gives $m = \frac{200}{3} \approx 66.67$. Since $m$ must be an integer, we conclude that $m$ must be an integer of the form $m = \frac{200}{3} n$, where $n$ is a positive integer. The least such $n$ which makes $m$ an integer less than 200 is $n = 3$. So we find that the first such $m$ which gives four distinct solutions is $m = \frac{200}{3} \cdot 3 = 200$.

Therefore, the only $m$ that solves the problem is $m = 200$. So there is only one positive integer $m$ that makes the equation have four distinct solutions, i.e., there is only one positive integer $m$ for which $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has four distinct solutions. The value of $m$ is 200. The answer is: $1$

Question (hint: positive numerical answer):
"For how many positive integers $m$ does the equation \[\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}\] have $4$ distinct solutions?"
Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:


The equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has four distinct solutions means that the number of 'jumps' that the absolute value function makes is two.
This is only possible when $\frac{m}{100}=2$ or $\frac{m}{100}=3$.
Therefore, we have $2=\frac{m}{100}$, which implies $m=200$.
And $3=\frac{m}{100}$, which implies $m=300$.
Thus, the only possible values for $m$ are $200$ and $300$.
The value of $m$ can only be one of the two numbers, so there are $2$ possibilities.
The answer is: $2$.
The value of m is 2. The answer is: 2

Question (hint: positive numerical answer):
"For how many positive integers $m$ does the equation \[\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}\] have $4$ distinct solutions?"
Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:


The equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has $4$ distinct solutions. 
The inner absolute value gives two cases: $\vert x - 1 \vert - 2 = \pm \frac{m}{100}$.
For the case $\vert x - 1 \vert - 2 = \frac{m}{100}$:
$\vert x - 1 \vert = 2 + \frac{m}{100}$.
This gives us two sub-cases:
$x - 1 = 2 + \frac{m}{100}$ or $x - 1 = - \left(2 + \frac{m}{100}\right)$.
Simplifying the equations, we get $x = 3 + \frac{m}{100}$ or $x = -1 - \frac{m}{100}$.
For the case $\vert x - 1 \vert - 2 = -\frac{m}{100}$:
$\vert x - 1 \vert = 2 - \frac{m}{100}$.
This gives us two sub-cases:
$x - 1 = 2 - \frac{m}{100}$ or $x - 1 = - \left(2 - \frac{m}{100}\right)$.
Simplifying the equations, we get $x = 3 - \frac{m}{100}$ or $x = -1 + \frac{m}{100}$.
For the equations $x = 3 + \frac{m}{100}$ and $x = 3 - \frac{m}{100}$ to have distinct solutions,
$\frac{m}{100}$ must be positive, which means $m > 0$.
Similarly, for the equations $x = -1 - \frac{m}{100}$ and $x = -1 + \frac{m}{100}$ to have distinct solutions,
$\frac{m}{100}$ must also be positive, which means $m > 0$.
Therefore, $m$ must be a positive integer for these four equations to have distinct solutions.
However, to ensure that the absolute values are non-negative, we need to consider the range of $m$.
$2 + \frac{m}{100} \ge 0$ gives $m \ge -200$, but since $m$ is a positive integer, $m \ge 1$.
On the other hand, $2 - \frac{m}{100} \ge 0$ gives $m \le 200$.
Therefore, $1 \le m \le 200$.
But, we need to find the value of $m$ such that these four equations have exactly four distinct solutions.
By considering the graphs of these equations, or by testing some values of $m$, it turns out that $m = 200$ works, as it gives exactly four distinct solutions: $x = 3 \pm \frac{\sqrt{399}}{10}, -1 \pm \frac{\sqrt{399}}{10}$.
We can check that for any other value of $m$ in the range $1 \le m \le 200$, the four equations do not yield exactly four distinct solutions.
Therefore, the only positive integer $m$ such that the equation has four distinct solutions is $m=200$. The value of $m$ is $\boxed{200}$. The answer is: 200

"For how many positive integers $m$ does the equation \[\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}\] have $4$ distinct solutions?"
Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:


The equation $| |x-1| - 2 | = \frac{m}{100}$ has 4 distinct solutions when the right side is equal to 2. That is, we need to solve the equation $\frac{m}{100} = 2$.

By multiplying both sides by 100, we get $m = 200$.
Therefore, the value of $m$ that makes the equation have 4 distinct solutions is 200. This leads to one positive integer: 200. The answer is: $1$

Question (hint: positive numerical answer):
"For how many positive integers $m$ does the equation \[\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}\] have $4$ distinct solutions?"
Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:


The equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has 4 distinct solutions. 
The expression on the left-hand side, $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert$, is a piecewise function.
We consider different cases:
1. If $\vert x-1 \vert -2 > 0$, then $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\vert x-1 \vert -2$. So the equation becomes: $\vert x-1 \vert -2=\frac{m}{100}$. This implies $\vert x-1 \vert =2+\frac{m}{100}$. Further splitting into cases gives $x-1=2+\frac{m}{100}$ or $x-1=-(2+\frac{m}{100})$. Solving these gives us $x=3+\frac{m}{100}$ or $x=-1+\frac{m}{100}$, respectively.
2. If $\vert x-1 \vert -2 < 0$, then $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=-\vert x-1 \vert +2$. So the equation becomes: $-\vert x-1 \vert +2=\frac{m}{100}$. This implies $\vert x-1 \vert =2-\frac{m}{100}$. Further splitting into cases gives $x-1=2-\frac{m}{100}$ or $x-1=-(2-\frac{m}{100})$. Solving these gives us $x=1+\frac{m}{100}$ or $x=-1+\frac{2m}{100}$, respectively.

For the first case to have 4 distinct solutions, two of the solutions must be greater than 3 and the other two must be less than -1. This happens if and only if $2+\frac{m}{100} > 3$ and $-1+\frac{m}{100} < -1$, or equivalently, $100 < m < 100$. This is a contradiction, so the first case does not give us any solutions.

For the second case to have 4 distinct solutions, one of the solutions must be greater than 1 and the other must be less than -1. This happens if and only if $2-\frac{m}{100} > 1$ and $-1+\frac{2m}{100} < -1$, or equivalently, $0 < m < 100$. This is consistent with the condition for the second case.

Therefore, the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ with 4 distinct solutions must satisfy $0 < m < 100$. The number of positive integers $m$ in this range is $99$.
The answer is: $99$

Question (hint: positive numerical answer):
"For how many positive integers $m$ does the equation \[\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}\] have $4$ distinct solutions?"
Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:


To have 4 distinct solutions for the equation $| | x - 1 | -2 | = \frac{m}{100}$, the value of $\frac{m}{100}$ must be equal to 2. This is because a modulus function $|u|$ has a value of $a$ only when $u = a$ or $u = -a$. Hence we can break down the equation into two cases:

Case 1: $| x - 1 | -2 = \frac{m}{100} = 2$. Which gives $| x - 1 | = 2 + 2 = 4$. To simplify this further, we split this into two sub-cases: $x - 1 = 4$ or $x - 1 = -4$. Solving these we get $x = 5$ or $x = -3$.

Case 2: $| x - 1 | -2 = -\frac{m}{100} = -2$. This simplifies to $| x - 1 | = 2 - 2 = 0$. The only solution for this is $x = 1$. 

So from these two cases, we have 3 distinct solutions $x = -3$, $x = 1$, and $x = 5$ for $| | x - 1 | -2 | = 2$.

Therefore, $m = 2 \times 100 = 200$ and there is $\boxed{1}$ positive integer $m$ such that the equation $| | x - 1 | -2 | = \frac{m}{100}$ has 4 distinct solutions. The answer is: 1
