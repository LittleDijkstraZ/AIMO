Question (hint: positive numerical answer):
"What is the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ when $x$ and $y$ range over all real numbers such that $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$?"
Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:


To find the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ subject to the constraint $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$, we first note that the given constraint can be simplified as $2|x-y| = 40$, which implies $|x-y| = 20$.
By the triangle inequality, we have $|x-y| = |y-x|$, so we have $|x-y| = |- (x-y)|$, which means $|x-y|$ must be nonnegative.
Hence, $x-y$ or $y-x$ must be equal to $20$ or $-20$.
Now, let's consider the two cases separately:
Case 1: $x-y = 20$.
Rearranging this equation gives $x = y + 20$.
Substituting into the expression $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$, we get:
\[5(y + 20)^2 + 5y^2 - 8y(y + 20) = 5(y^2 + 40y + 400) + 5y^2 - 8y^2 - 160y = 10y^2 + 200y + 2000 - 8y^2 - 160y = 2y^2 + 400.\]
Case 2: $y-x = 20$.
Rearranging this equation gives $y = x + 20$.
Substituting into the expression $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$, we get:
\[5x^2 + 5(x + 20)^2 - 8x(x + 20) = 5x^2 + 5(x^2 + 40x + 400) - 8x^2 - 160x = 5x^2 + 5x^2 + 200x + 2000 - 8x^2 - 160x = 2x^2 + 400.\]
In both cases, we observe that the value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ is $2y^2 + 400 = 2x^2 + 400$.
To find the minimum value, we need to find the minimum value of $2x^2 + 400$ as $x$ or $y$ varies over all real numbers.
Since $2x^2$ is nonnegative, the minimum value occurs when $2x^2 = 0$, which means $x = 0$.
Substituting $x = 0$ into the equation $x-y = 20$ or $y-x = 20$, we get $y = -20$ or $y = 20$ respectively.
In both cases, we find that the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ is achieved when $(x, y) = (0, -20)$ or $(x, y) = (0, 20)$, and it equals $2(0)^2 + 400 = 400$.
Therefore, the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ is 400. The answer is: $\boxed{400}$

Question (hint: positive numerical answer):
"What is the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ when $x$ and $y$ range over all real numbers such that $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$?"
Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:


We start by applying the Trivial Inequality, also known as the Triangle Inequality, to the expression $|x-2y| + |y-2x|$. 
The Triangle Inequality states that for any real numbers $a$ and $b$, $|a| + |b| \geq |a+b|$. 
Applying this to our expression, we get: 

$|x-2y| + |y-2x| \geq |(x-2y) + (y-2x)| = |-x-y|$. 

But we know from the problem statement that $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$. 
Therefore, $|-(x+y)| = |-x-y| = 40$. 
Simplifying the absolute value, we get $-(x+y) = 40$ or $x+y = -40$.

Now we want to minimize the expression $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$. 
We can write this expression as $(5x^2 - 8xy + 5y^2)$ or $(5(x^2 - \frac{8}{5}xy + y^2))$.
This expression is similar in form to $(a-b)^2$ which is $a^2 - 2ab + b^2$. 
So we can rewrite it as $(5((x - \frac{4}{5}y)^2))$.

We know from the Trivial Inequality that $x+y = -40$. 
Now let's substitute $y = -40 - x$ into our expression and simplify:
$(5((x - \frac{4}{5}(-40 - x))^2)) = 5((x + 16 + \frac{4}{5}x)^2) = 5( ( \frac{9}{5}x + 16)^2)$.

Now let's expand this to get a single variable expression:
$5((\frac{9}{5}x)^2 + 2*(\frac{9}{5}x)*16 + 16^2) = 5(\frac{81}{25}x^2 + \frac{144}{5}x + 256)$
$= \frac{405}{25}x^2 + 288x + 1280$.

Now we have a quadratic function of the form $ax^2 + bx + c$ where $a = \frac{405}{25}$, $b = 288$, and $c = 1280$.
The minimum value of a quadratic function of this form is achieved at $x = -\frac{b}{2a}$ (which is the x-coordinate of the vertex of the parabola). 
We substitute these values into our expression:

$x_{min} = -\frac{b}{2a} = -\frac{288}{2*\frac{405}{25}} = -\frac{288*25}{810} = -\frac{720}{162} = -\frac{240}{54} = -\frac{40}{9}$.

Substituting $x_{min}$ back into $y = -40 - x$ to find the corresponding $y_{min}$:
$y_{min} = -40 - (-\frac{40}{9}) = -40 + \frac{40}{9} = -\frac{360}{9} + \frac{40}{9} = -\frac{320}{9}$.

Now we substitute these values back into the expression $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$:

$5(-\frac{40}{9})^2 + 5(-\frac{320}{9})^2 - 8(-\frac{40}{9})(-\frac{320}{9})$.

This simplifies to:
$5(\frac{1600}{81}) + 5(\frac{102400}{81}) - 8(\frac{-12800}{81})$.
This further simplifies to:
$\frac{8000}{81} + \frac{512000}{81} + \frac{102400}{81} = \frac{604400}{81}$.
Thus, the minimum value of the expression $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ is $\frac{604400}{81}$. 

However, simplifying this value further, we find that the decimal approximation of $\frac{604400}{81}$ is equal to 7460 approximately. This contradicts with the fact that it should be an integer as it is stated as a question for numerical answer.

So, we must have made a mistake in our calculations. Re-reading our steps, we found a mistake in substituting $x_{min}$ and $y_{min}$ into the expression $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$. The correct expression should be:

$5(-\frac{40}{9})^2 + 5(-\frac{320}{9})^2 - 8(-\frac{40}{9})(-\frac{320}{9}) = \frac{8000}{81} + \frac{512000}{81} + \frac{256000}{81} = \frac{753600}{81}$.

This simplifies to 9250 when dividing 753600 by 81.

So the minimum value of the expression $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ is 9250. The mistake came from calculating the value of the expression $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ for the values of $x$ and $y$ that minimize it. 

The correct value comes out to be an integer. That makes sense because it is stated as a numerical answer in the question. 

So the final answer is $\boxed{9250}$.
The answer is: 9250

Question (hint: positive numerical answer):
"What is the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ when $x$ and $y$ range over all real numbers such that $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$?"
Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:


We know that $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$.
By the triangle inequality, we have $|x-2y| + |y-2x| \geq |(x-2y) - (y-2x)| = |x - 2y - y + 2x| = |x - 3x + 2y - y| = |-2x + y| = 2|x - y| \geq 0$.
But it is given that $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$, so we must have $|x - y| = 20$.
Now let $u = x - y$ and $v = x + y$. Then $x = \frac{v + u}{2}$ and $y = \frac{v - u}{2}$.
Substituting these into the expression $5x^2 + 5y^2 - 8xy$, we get
\begin{align*}
5\left(\frac{v + u}{2}\right)^2 + 5\left(\frac{v - u}{2}\right)^2 - 8\left(\frac{v + u}{2}\right)\left(\frac{v - u}{2}\right) &= \frac{5}{4}(v^2 + 2u^2 + 2uv + v^2 - 2u^2 + 2uv - 4v^2 + 4u^2) \\
&= \frac{5}{4}(-v^2 + 4u^2) = \frac{5}{4}(4u^2 - v^2) = 5u^2 - \frac{5}{4}v^2.
\end{align*}
But we know that $|x - y| = 20$, so $u = 20$, and therefore, $v = 0$.
Substituting these values into our expression $5u^2 - \frac{5}{4}v^2$, we get $5(20^2) - \frac{5}{4}(0^2) = 2000$.
Therefore, the minimum value of $5x^2 + 5y^2 - 8xy$ is 2000. The answer is: 2000

Question (hint: positive numerical answer):
"What is the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ when $x$ and $y$ range over all real numbers such that $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$?"
Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:


The given condition is $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$. If you study the expressions $|x-2y|$ and $|y-2x|$ closely, you would realize that they are always equal. This is a property of absolute value: $|a| = |b|$ implies $a = b$ or $a = -b$. 

Hence, we can simplify the condition to $x - 2y + y - 2x = 40$, which simplifies to $-x - y = 40$ or $x + y = -40$. 

Now, the expression we want to minimize is $5x^2 + 5y^2 - 8xy$. We can rewrite it as $5(x^2 + y^2) - 8xy = 5[(x+y)^2 - 2xy] - 8xy = 5[(-40)^2 - 2xy] - 8xy = 5[1600 - 2xy] - 8xy = 8000 - 10xy - 8xy = 8000 - 18xy$.

To minimize $-18xy$ under the condition $x + y = -40$, we can substitute $y = -40 - x$ into $-18xy = -18x(-40 - x) = 720x + 18x^2$. Completing the square on this quadratic gives $18(x + 20)^2 - 720$.

Since $18(x + 20)^2$ is always nonnegative, the minimum value of $-18xy$ is achieved when $(x + 20)^2 = 0$, which implies $x = -20$ and $y = -20$. Substituting these values back into $-18xy$ gives $-18(-20)(-20) = -7200$. 

But our actual expression is $8000 - 18xy$, and substituting $x = -20$, $y = -20$ into this gives $8000 - (-7200) = 8000 + 7200 = 15200$. 

But we made a mistake: the minimum value of $-18xy$ is actually $0$, not $-7200$. Where did the mistake come from? It was in the statement 'The minimum value of $-18xy$ is achieved when $(x + 20)^2 = 0$. It is actually achieved when $(x + 20)^2$ is minimum, which occurs when $x = -20$, but plugging in this value into $-18xy$ gives $-18(-20)(-20) = 7200$, not $-7200$. 

The mistake here is that $-18xy$ and $18(x + 20)^2$ are two equal quantities, so their minima occur at the same values of $x$ and $y$. Therefore, it must be the case that $-18xy = 0$, which implies $xy = 0$. 

Since $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40 > 0$, it follows that neither $x$ nor $y$ can be zero. Thus, the only possibility is $x = -20$, $y = -20$. Substituting these into $-18xy$ gives $-18(-20)(-20) = 7200$.

Subtracting $7200$ from $8000$ gives $8000 - 7200 = 800$. Hence the minimum value is $800$.

The answer is: $\boxed{800}$

## QUESTION 1 - 4

Question (hint: positive numerical answer):
"What is the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ when $x$ and $y$ range over all real numbers such that $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$?"
Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:


First, we note that $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$ can be rewritten as $|x-2y| + |2y-x| = 40$. 
By the triangle inequality, this sum is equal to $|(x-2y) + (2y-x)| = |0| = 0$, but this implies that there is a mistake in our reasoning. 
The problem statement seems to have a mistake, but let's continue with the solution regardless. 

Let's make a substitution: $a = x-2y$ and $b = y-2x$, so the equation becomes $|a| + |-2a| = 40$. This simplifies to $|a| + |2a| = 40$. Since $|a| = |2a|$ implies $a=0$, we must have $|a| + |2a| = 3|a| = 40$, so $|a| = \frac{40}{3}$. 

Now, back substitute, we get:
$$|(x-2y)| = \frac{40}{3}.$$
This equation does not have a simple geometric interpretation in the plane, but we can still solve it using algebraic manipulation.
First, solve the absolute value equation:
Either $x - 2y = \frac{40}{3}$ or $x - 2y = -\frac{40}{3}$.
Solving each of these equations gives us two lines in the plane. 

Next, we substitute $a = x-2y$ and $b = y-2x$ into the expression $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ and simplify to get: $5(x^2+y^2) - 8xy = 5[(x-2y)^2+(y-2x)^2] - 8xy = 5[a^2+b^2] - 8(x-2y)(y-2x)/4 = 5a^2+5b^2 - 2ab = 5a^2+5(4a^2) - 2a(-a) = 25a^2 + 2a^2 = 27a^2$.
Since $|a| = \frac{40}{3}$, we have $a^2 = \left(\frac{40}{3}\right)^2 = \frac{1600}{9}$.
Substituting this into the expression, we get: $27a^2 = 27 \cdot \frac{1600}{9} = 4800$.
Hence, the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ under the condition $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$ is 4800. Therefore, the minimum value of the given expression is 4800. The answer is: $4800$.

Question (hint: positive numerical answer):
"What is the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ when $x$ and $y$ range over all real numbers such that $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$?"
Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:


We first note that $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$ is equivalent to $|x-2y| = |2x-y| = 20$. Let's denote $A = x - 2y$ and $B = 2x - y$, then we have $|A| = |B| = 20$. By definition of absolute values, $A = \pm 20$ and $B = \pm 20$.
If $A = 20$, then $x - 2y = 20$, so $x = 2y + 20$. Similarly, if $B = 20$, then $2x - y = 20$, so $y = 2x - 20$. Substitute $x = 2y + 20$ into the equation $y = 2x - 20$ to get $y = 2(2y+20) - 20$, which simplifies to $y = 4y+20$, and further to $y = -4$. Therefore, when $A = 20$ and $B = 20$, we have $x = 2(-4)+20 = 12$.
Similarly, if $A = -20$, we have $x - 2y = -20$, and combined with $2x - y = 20$, we get $x = -12$ and $y = 4$.
Plugging these values into $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$, we get
\[5(-12)^2+5(4)^2-8(-12)(4) = 720.\]
The answer is: $-360$

Question (hint: positive numerical answer):
"What is the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ when $x$ and $y$ range over all real numbers such that $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$?"
Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:



First, let's consider the constraint equation $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$. Using the definition of absolute value, this equation can be rewritten as two cases:

Case 1: If $(x-2y)(y-2x) \geq 0$, then $|x-2y| = (x-2y)$ and $|y-2x| = (y-2x)$, so the equation becomes
\[(x-2y) + (y-2x) = 40 \implies -x - y = 40.\]
Case 2: If $(x-2y)(y-2x) < 0$, then $|x-2y| = -(x-2y)$ and $|y-2x| = -(y-2x)$, so the equation becomes
\[-(x-2y) - (y-2x) = 40 \implies x - y = 40.\]

Note that these two cases are actually equivalent since if $x - y = 40$, then $-x + 2y = -(40)$, so $x - 2y = -40$, and vice versa. Therefore, there is only one independent constraint:
\[x - y = 40.\]
Then, we can solve for $y$ in terms of $x$, which is $y = x - 40$. Substituting this into the expression $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ gives
\[5x^2 + 5(x-40)^2 - 8x(x-40) = 5x^2 + 5(x^2 - 80x + 1600) - 8x^2 + 320x = -3x^2 + 320x + 8000.\]

This is a quadratic function in terms of $x$. Completing the square for this quadratic function gives:
\[-3(x^2 - \frac{320}{3}x) + 8000 = -3((x - \frac{160}{3})^2 - (\frac{160}{3})^2) + 8000 = -3(x - \frac{160}{3})^2 + 8000 + 3 \cdot (\frac{160}{3})^2 = -3(x - \frac{160}{3})^2 + 8000 + 3 \cdot \frac{25600}{9} = -3(x - \frac{160}{3})^2 + \frac{8000 \cdot 9 + 25600}{9} = -3(x - \frac{160}{3})^2 + \frac{105600}{9}.\]
Hence, the minimum value is the constant term in front of the negative square term which is $\frac{105600}{9}$, so the minimum value is 11733.33 (rounded). However, this cannot be our correct answer because we made a mistake in the algebraic manipulation of the expression. Let's retrace our steps and find the mistake.

Looking back, we realized that the mistake was in the sign of the constant term after completing the square. When we expand $-3((x - \frac{160}{3})^2 - (\frac{160}{3})^2)$, we should get $-3(x - \frac{160}{3})^2 + 3 \cdot (\frac{160}{3})^2$, not $-3(x - \frac{160}{3})^2 - 3 \cdot (\frac{160}{3})^2$. Hence, the constant term should be 8000 + 3 * ($\frac{160}{3}$)² = 8000 + 3 * $\frac{25600}{9}$ = 8000 + $\frac{76800}{9}$ = $\frac{72000 + 76800}{9}$ = $\frac{148800}{9}$. So the minimum value should be $\frac{148800}{9}$/ $\boxed{16533.33}$. However, the mistake here is that we didn't calculate it correctly. Let's recompute it: $\frac{148800}{9}$ = 16533.33(recurring) ≠ 11733.33.So the mistake indeed was in calculation. However, we realize that our final expression of -3(x - $\frac{160}{3}$)² + $\frac{148800}{9}$ is still not correct. The constant term should be 8000 + 3 * ( $\frac{160}{3}$ )² = 8000 + 3 * $\frac{25600}{9}$ = 8000 + $\frac{76800}{9}$ = $\frac{72000 + 76800}{9}$ = $\frac{148800}{9}$.The mistake again was in the calculation: 8000 + $\frac{76800}{9}$ = $\frac{72000 + 76800}{9}$ = $\frac{148800}{9}$ ≠ 148800. So the mistake was indeed at this step. But the mistake of calculation here should not be doubted, it is a real mistake.In fact, this mistake makes our expression invalid, and prevents us from proceeding any further with the problem. The mistake occurs because the terms in the quadratic function are out of order.

Hence, let us start from the beginning, using a bit different method:Let S = $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$, and substitute $y = x - 40$.We obtain:
$$S = 5x^2 + 5(x - 40)^2 - 8x(x - 40)$$ $$= 5x^2 + 5(x^2 - 80x + 1600) - 8x^2 + 320x$$ $$= -3x^2 + 320x + 8000 = -3(x - \frac{160}{3})^2 + 8000 + 3 \cdot (\frac{160}{3})^2$$ $$= -3(x - \frac{160}{3})^2 + \frac{8000 \cdot 9 + 25600}{9} = -3(x - \frac{160}{3})^2 + \frac{105600}{9}.$$Because the square term is negative, minimum value of the function is the constant term, namely, $\frac{105600}{9}$ = $11733.33$(recurring). However, again this cannot be our correct answer because we

Question (hint: positive numerical answer):
"What is the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ when $x$ and $y$ range over all real numbers such that $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$?"
Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:


Using the identity $|a|+|b|\geq|a+b|$, we have
$$|x-2y|+|y-2x|=|x-2y|+|-(2x-y)|=|x-2y|+|2x-y| \geq |(x-2y)+(2x-y)|=|(3x-3y)|=|3(x-y)|.$$
So $|3(x-y)|=40 \Rightarrow |x-y|=\frac{40}{3}$.
Now, we want to find the minimum value of the function $f(x,y)=5x^2+5y^2-8xy$, subject to the constraint $|x-y|=\frac{40}{3}$.
By completing the square, we have
\begin{align*}
f(x,y) &= 5(x^2-y^2)+8xy \\
&= 5[(x-y)(x+y)]+8xy \\
&= 5[(x-y)x+(x-y)y]+8xy \\
&= 5[(x-y)(x+y)+8xy]\\
&= 5[(x-y)x+(x-y)y+8xy].
\end{align*}
Setting $u=x-y$, $v=x+y$, we rewrite the function as
$$f(u,v)=5[uv+8\frac{u^2+v^2}{2}]=5[uv+4(u^2+v^2)].$$
Using the constraint $|x-y|=\frac{40}{3}$, we know that $u=\frac{40}{3}$, and the constraint becomes $|v|=1\frac{1}{3}$. Therefore, the minimum value of $v$ is $-\frac{4}{3}$. Now we substitute $u$ and $v$ into the function:
$$f\left(\frac{40}{3},-\frac{4}{3}\right)=5\left(-\frac{4}{3}\cdot\frac{40}{3}+4\left(\left(\frac{40}{3}\right)^2+\left(-\frac{4}{3}\right)^2\right)\right)=-2560/9+8800/9=6240/9.$$
The minimum value of the function is 6240/9. The answer is: $6240/9$

Question (hint: positive numerical answer):
"What is the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ when $x$ and $y$ range over all real numbers such that $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$?"
Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:


We start by expanding the given equation $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$.
If we assume that $x \geq 2y$ and $y \leq 2x$, then we can drop the absolute value signs to get $(x-2y) + (2x-y) = 40$.
This simplifies to $3x - 3y = 40 \Rightarrow x - y = \frac{40}{3}$.
If we assume the other possibility, where $x < 2y$ and $y > 2x$, then we get $-(x-2y) + -(y-2x) = 40$.
This simplifies to $-x + 2y - y + 2x = 40 \Rightarrow x + y = \frac{40}{3}$.
We have two possibilities for the relationship between $x$ and $y$, but they all lead to the same function $y = x + \frac{40}{3}$.
So, we can substitute $y = x + \frac{40}{3}$ into the expression $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ to get a function in terms of $x$ only.
\begin{align*}
5x^2 + 5\left(x + \frac{40}{3}\right)^2 - 8x \left(x + \frac{40}{3}\right) &= 5x^2 + 5\left(x^2 + 2x\cdot\frac{40}{3} + \left(\frac{40}{3}\right)^2\right) - 8x(x + \frac{40}{3}) \\
&= 5x^2 + 5x^2 + \frac{400}{3}x + \frac{800}{9} - 8x^2 - \frac{320}{3}x \\
&= -3x^2 + \frac{80}{3}x + \frac{800}{9}.
\end{align*}
This quadratic function opens downward (since the coefficient of $x^2$ is negative), so its minimum value occurs at its vertex. The $x$-coordinate of the vertex of a parabola given by $f(x) = ax^2 + bx + c$ is $-\frac{b}{2a}$. Therefore, the $x$-coordinate of the vertex of our function is $-\frac{\frac{80}{3}}{2(-3)} = -\frac{40}{9}$.

However, since $y = x + \frac{40}{3}$, and we found $x = -\frac{40}{9}$, we must find the corresponding value of $y$. Plugging this value into the equation gives: $y = -\frac{40}{9} + \frac{40}{3} = \frac{40}{9}$.

So the minimum value of the function $f(x) = -3x^2 + \frac{80}{3}x + \frac{800}{9}$ when $x = -\frac{40}{9}$ is:
\begin{align*}
f\left(-\frac{40}{9}\right) &= -3\left(-\frac{40}{9}\right)^2 + \frac{80}{3}\left(-\frac{40}{9}\right) + \frac{800}{9} \\
&= -3\cdot\frac{1600}{81} - \frac{3200}{27} + \frac{800}{9} \\
&= -\frac{4800}{81} - \frac{3200}{27} + \frac{2400}{27} \\
&= -\frac{4800-3200+2400}{81} \\
&= -\frac{4000}{81}.
\end{align*}

So, the minimum value of the function $5x^2 + 5y^2 - 8xy$ given the constraint $|x - 2y| + |y - 2x| = 40$ is $-\frac{4000}{81}$. However, this value does not seem to make sense in terms of the physics of the problem since it's negative. This means there must be a mistake in our solution so far. Let's think about why might be so. Looking at the constraint $|x - 2y| + |y - 2x| = 40$, one might notice it's easy to satisfy if $x = y = 20$. For $|x - 2y|$, we can take $y = 20$ and $x = -20$ (which makes $|x - 2y| = |-20 -40|=60$ ) and for $|y - 2x|$ we can take $x = 20$ and $y = -20$ (which makes $|y - 2x|=|-20 +40|=20$). So $60+20=40$ as required, and it turns out that when $x=y=20$ the function $5x^2 + 5y^2 - 8xy = 5*20^2 + 5*20^2 - 8*20*20 = 2000 $ which is a positive value. So it seems the error in our algebra.
Let's try again to substitute $y = x + \frac{40}{3}$ into the expression $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$.
$$\begin{aligned}
5x^2 + 5\left(x + \frac{40}{3}\right)^2 - 8x \left(x + \frac{40}{3}\right) &= 5x^2 + 5\left(x^2 + 2x\cdot\frac{40}{3} + \left(\frac{40}{3}\right)^2\right) - 8x(x + \frac{40}{3}) \\
&= 5x^2 + 5x^2 + \frac{400}{3}x + \frac{800}{9} - 8x^2 - \frac{320}{3}x \\
&= -3x^2 + \frac{80}{3}x + \frac{800}{9}.
\end{aligned}$$As before,
the $x$-coordinate of the vertex of this quadratic is $-\frac{\frac{80}{3}}{2(-3)}=
-\frac{40}{9},$ but now if we plug $x=-\frac{40}{9} $ into the equation $y = x + \frac{40}{3}$ we get
$$y=-\frac{40}{9}+\frac{40}{3}=\frac{40}{9}.$$Therefore we got the same answer from a different approach.
Substituting $y = x + \frac{40}{3}$ into the original equation $|x-2y| + |y

Question (hint: positive numerical answer):
"What is the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ when $x$ and $y$ range over all real numbers such that $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$?"
Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:


First, notice that the expression $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ can be written as $(x^2-4xy+4y^2) + (4y^2 - 8xy+4x^2) = (x-2y)^2 + 4(y-2x)^2$. This form seems relevant because the equation $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$ involves the sum of absolute values. So let's set $a = x - 2y$ and $b = y - 2x$. We can then re-write the given equation as $|a| + |b| = 40$.

Next, use the identity $|a| + |b| = \sqrt{a^2 + b^2 + 2ab} + \sqrt{a^2 + b^2 - 2ab} \ge \sqrt{(a + b)^2} + \sqrt{(a - b)^2} = |a + b| + |a - b|$. By the triangle inequality, it is obvious that $|a + b| + |a - b| \ge |a| + |b|$, thus with equality if and only if $a = 0, b = 0$, or $a$ and $b$ have the same sign.

If $a = 0$ or $b = 0$, from $a = x - 2y$ and $b = y - 2x$, we have either $x = 2y$ or $y = 2x$. Substitute either into the constraint equation, we will obtain $y = x = 0$, which isn't helpful since the question asks for a minimum value of the expression $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$, and $0$ plugged into this expression gives 0, which is clearly not the minimum possible value.

The key point to notice is that we made a substitution at the beginning, $a = x - 2y$ and $b = y - 2x$. Thus, if $a$ and $b$ have the same sign, i.e., their difference is zero, then the quantity $x - 2y = y - 2x$, or $x = y$. Substituting this into the constraint equation gives $|x - 2x| + |x - 2x| = 40$, or $|-x| + |-x| = 40$, or $2|-x| = 40$, or $|-x| = 20$, or $x = \pm 20$. Clearly, this solution does not work because plugging $x = 20$ into the expression to optimize results in an unreasonably large number. However, plugging $x = -20$ into the equation $|x - 2y| + |y - 2x| = 40$ yields $|{-20} - 2y| + |y + 40| = 40$, or $|-20 - 2y| + |y + 40| = 40$. Choose $y = -20$, it holds true.

Substitute $x = -20$ and $y = -20$ into the expression $5x^2+5y^2-8xy = 5(-20)^2 + 5(-20)^2 -8(-20)(-20) = 2000 + 2000 - 3200 = 800$. Thus, the minimum value that the expression $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ can have under the constraint $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$ is $800$. The solution is $\boxed{800}$.

Question (hint: positive numerical answer):
"What is the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ when $x$ and $y$ range over all real numbers such that $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$?"
Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:


We can rewrite the given expression as $5(x^2+y^2)-8xy = (x^2+y^2) + 4(x^2+y^2)-8xy = (x-2y)^2 + 4(x-2y)(2x-y) + 4(2x-y)^2 - 8xy$.
Using the fact that $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$, we know that $|x-2y| = 20 - |y-2x|$, which implies $|x-2y| = 20 - (|x-2y|) \implies |x-2y| = 10$.
Now we can expand $4(x-2y)(2x-y) - 8xy$:
\[4(x-2y)(2x-y) - 8xy = 8x^2 - 6xy + 2y^2 - 8xy = 8x^2 - 14xy + 2y^2.\]
Since $(x-2y)^2$ and $(2x-y)^2$ are both non-negative, we have:
\[(x-2y)^2 + 4(x-2y)(2x-y) + 4(2x-y)^2 - 8xy = (x-2y)^2 + 8x^2 - 14xy + 2y^2 + 4(2x-y)^2.\]
Simplifying, we get:
\[5(x^2+y^2) - 8xy = (x-2y)^2 + 8x^2 - 14xy + 2y^2 + 4(2x-y)^2 = (x-2y)^2 + 8x^2 - 14xy + 2y^2 + 4(x-2y)^2.\]
Using the value of $(x-2y)^2 = 100$, we have:
\[5(x^2+y^2) - 8xy = 100 + 8x^2 - 14xy + 2y^2 + 4\cdot 100 = 8x^2 - 14xy + 2y^2 + 400 + 100 = 8x^2 - 14xy + 2y^2 + 500.\]
Now, note that $(8x^2 - 14xy + 2y^2 + 500)$ is always non-negative because it's the sum of several non-negative terms. Therefore, it's minimized when all other terms are 0. But this is only true when $x = y = 0$. In this case, $(x-2y)^2 + 4(x-2y)(2x-y) + 4(2x-y)^2 - 8xy = 0$.
Thus, the minimum value of the given expression under the given condition is 0. Hence, the minimum value is $0$. The answer is: $0$

Question (hint: positive numerical answer):
"What is the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ when $x$ and $y$ range over all real numbers such that $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$?"
Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:


First, we notice that $|x-2y| + |y-2x|$ is always non-negative. Since $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$, we know that $x$ and $y$ satisfy this condition. 
Let's consider $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$. We can rewrite it as $5(x^2+y^2)-8xy$.
Using the formula $(a-b)^2 \geq 0$ for $a = x$ and $b = 4y$, we get $(x - 4y)^2 \geq 0$, which simplifies to $x^2 - 8xy + 16y^2 \geq 0$.
Rearranging terms, we have $5x^2+5y^2-8xy \geq 5(16y^2)$.
Similarly, using the formula $(a-b)^2 \geq 0$ for $a = y$ and $b = 4x$, we get $(y - 4x)^2 \geq 0$, which simplifies to $y^2 - 8xy + 16x^2 \geq 0$.
Rearranging terms, we have $5x^2+5y^2-8xy \geq 5(16x^2)$.
Combining these two inequalities, we have $5x^2+5y^2-8xy \geq 5(16y^2)$ and $5x^2+5y^2-8xy \geq 5(16x^2)$.
Therefore, the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ is achieved when $x^2 = 16y^2$ and $y^2 = 16x^2$.
From these equations, we have $x = \pm 4y$ and $y = \pm 4x$.
If $x = 4y$, then $y = \frac{x}{4}$. Substituting this into $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$, we get $|x - \frac{x}{2}| + |\frac{x}{2} - 4x| = 40$. Simplifying this, we have $ \frac{x}{2} + \frac{7x}{2} = 40$, giving $4x = 40$ and $x = 10$.
Corresponding $y = \frac{x}{4} = \frac{10}{4} = \frac{5}{2}$.
If $x = -4y$, we can proceed similarly, yielding no valid solutions for $x$ and $y$.
Similarly, if $y = 4x$, we can proceed similarly, yielding no valid solutions for $x$ and $y$.
If $y = -4x$, we can proceed similarly, yielding no valid solutions for $x$ and $y$.
Thus, we conclude that the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ occurs when $x = 10$ and $y = \frac{5}{2}$,
which gives a minimum value of $5(10)^2+5(\frac{5}{2})^2-8(10)(\frac{5}{2})=500+62.5-200=362.5$.
Thus the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ is $362.5$. The answer is: 362.5

Question (hint: positive numerical answer):
"What is the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ when $x$ and $y$ range over all real numbers such that $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$?"
Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:


First, let's rewrite the expression $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ as $5(x^2-y^2)-8xy = 5((x-y)(x+y))-8xy$.
Let $s = x+y$ and $p = x-y$. Then we have $x = \frac{s+p}{2}$ and $y = \frac{s-p}{2}$, and we substitute these into the equation $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$.
Then we have $|s+p-s+p| + |s-p-s-p| = 40$, which simplifies to $2|p| + 2|s| = 40$, or $|p| + |s| = 20$.
We want to minimize $5((x-y)(x+y))-8xy = 5(ps)-8\left(\frac{s^2-p^2}{4}\right) = 5ps - 2s^2 + 2p^2$.
By the Trivial Inequality, we have $|a| + |b| \ge |a+b|$, so $|s| + |p| \ge |s+p| = |x+y-x+y| = 2|y| = 2|s-p|/2 = |s-p| \ge |s|-|p|$.
Hence, $2|s| + 2|p| = |s| + |p| + |s| + |p| \ge 2|s+p| = 40$, so $|s| + |p| = 20$.
From the Trivial Inequality again, we have $|s| + |p| \le |s+p| + |s-p| = |x+y| + |-x+y| = 2|x+y| = 2|s|$, so $|s| = 20$.
Then $|p| = 0$, so $p = 0$, or $x-y = 0$, or $x = y$.
Now we substitute $x = y$ into the equation $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$, which becomes $|x-2x| + |x-2x| = 40$, or $|-x|+|-x| = 40$, or $2|-x| = 40$, or $|-x| = 20$.
So we have $-20 \le -x \le 20$, or $20 \ge x \ge -20$. The maximum value of $x$, which is the same as the maximum value of $y$, is 20, and the minimum value is -20.
Now we substitute $x = y = 20$ into the expression $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$, we get $5(20^2)+5(20^2)-8(20)(20) = 2000+2000-3200 = 800$.
Hence, the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ is 800.
The answer is: $800$
