Question (hint: positive numerical answer):
"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"
Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:



The product of two quantities is zero if and only if at least one of the quantities is zero. Therefore, the given equation is satisfied if either of the following equations is satisfied:
\[((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2) = 0,\]
\[((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0.\]

If $ (\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$, then both $\vert x + y \vert - 10 = 0$ and $\vert x - y \vert - 10 = 0$, which imply that $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. These equations are satisfied only by the points in the square formed by the lines $x+y=10$, $x+y=-10$, $x-y=10$, and $x-y=-10$ in the coordinate plane.

Similarly, if $ (\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$, then both $\vert x \vert - 8 = 0$ and $\vert y \vert - 8 = 0$, which imply that $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$. These equations are satisfied only by the points in the square formed by the lines $x=8$, $x=-8$, $y=8$, and $y=-8$ in the coordinate plane.

Therefore, the points satisfying the given equation are those that lie in the intersection of these two squares, which is a square with side length 10. The area of this square is $10^2=100$. The answer is: $100$

Question (hint: positive numerical answer):
"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"
Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:


If the product of two numbers is $0$, then either one of them must be $0$. Therefore, either $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + (\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + (\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$. From the first equation, we have $\vert x + y\vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$, which imply $x + y = \pm 10$ and $x - y = \pm 10$. Adding these two equations, we have $2x = \pm 20$, hence $x = \pm 10$. Subtracting the second equation from the first, we get $2y = \pm 20$, hence $y = \pm 10$. Therefore, the points satisfying $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + (\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ are $(10, 10)$, $(10, -10)$, $(-10, 10)$, and $(-10, -10)$.
From the second equation, we have $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$, which imply $x = \pm 8$ and $y = \pm 8$. Therefore, the points satisfying $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + (\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ are $(8, 8)$, $(8, -8)$, $(-8, 8)$, and $(-8, -8)$.
The points $\left(x, y\right) = (10, 10)$, $(10, -10)$, $(-10, 10)$, $(-10, -10)$, $(8, 8)$, $(8, -8)$, $(-8, 8)$, and $(-8, -8)$ form a square with side length $20$. Hence, the area of the square is $20^2 = 400$.
The solution is therefore $\boxed{400}$.
The value of the variable in the equation is 400. The answer is: $400$

Question (hint: positive numerical answer):
"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"
Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:


The given equation is of the form $ab = 0$, where $a$ and $b$ are functions of $x$ and $y$. This means that either $a = 0$ or $b = 0$.

In this case, the "a" part consists of the expressions $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2$ and the "b" part consists of the expressions $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2$. 

Setting $a = 0$, we get:
\[(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0.\]
Both of the squares of absolute values are always non-negative, so the only way this equation could be true is if both absolute value expressions are equal to zero, i.e. $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. The solutions to these equations are the lines $y = -x + 10$ and $y = x + 10$.

Setting $b = 0$, we get:
\[(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0.\]
Similarly, the only way this equation could be true is if both absolute value expressions are equal to zero, i.e. $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$. The solutions to these equations are the lines $x = \pm 8$ and $y = \pm 8$.

The intersection points of these lines form a square with side length of 10 units (from $-8$ to $8$ on each axis), so the area of this square is $10 \times 10 = 100$ square units. 
The answer is: $100$

"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"
Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:


The expression $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ is equal to 0 if and only if at least one of the factors is equal to zero.
The factor $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)$ is equal to zero if and only if $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$.
The factor $((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2)$ is equal to zero if and only if $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$.
From the first condition, we have $x + y = \pm 10$ and $x - y = \pm 10$. Solving this system of equations gives $x = 0$ and $y = \pm 10$ or $x = \pm 10$ and $y = 0$.
From the second condition, we have $x = \pm 8$ and $y = \pm 8$.
The resulting points are $(0, 10), (0, -10), (10, 0), (-10, 0), (8, 8), (8, -8), (-8, 8),$ and $(-8, -8)$. These points form a square with side length of 20 units. Therefore, the area of the square is $20^2 = 400$. The answer is: $400$.

Question (hint: positive numerical answer):
"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"
Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:



Since the square of a real number is always non-negative, the product of the two factors equals to zero if and only if both factors equal to zero. Thus the equality in the given equation holds if and only if at least one of the following equalities holds:
\[(\vert x + y \vert - 10) = 0,\]
\[(\vert x - y \vert - 10) = 0,\]
\[(\vert x \vert - 8) = 0,\]
\[(\vert y \vert - 8) = 0.\]

These equalities can be rewritten as
\[\vert x + y \vert = 10,\]
\[\vert x - y \vert = 10,\]
\[\vert x \vert = 8,\]
\[\vert y \vert = 8.\]

The second and the fourth equalities gives that $x = 8$ or $x = -8$, and $y = 8$ or $y = -8$. 
The first and third equalities give that $x + y = \pm 10$ or $x - y = \pm 10$.

If $x = 8$ and $y = 8$, then from $x + y = \pm 10$ we have $16 = \pm 10$, which cannot happen.
The same holds if $x = 8$ and $y = -8$, or if $x = -8$ and $y = 8$, or if $x = -8$ and $y = -8$. 

Thus the coordinate pairs must satisfy either $x + y = 10$, $x + y = -10$, $x - y = 10$ or $x - y = -10$, with $x = 8$ or $x = -8$, and $y = 8$ or $y = -8$. To satisfy the equations $x + y = \pm 10$, the pair must be from the set $\left\{(8, 2), (2, 8), (-8, -2), (-2, -8)\right\}$. To satisfy the equations $x - y = \pm 10$, the pair must be from the set $\left\{(8, -6), (6, 8), (-8, 6), (-6, -8)\right\}$.

All 8 points form the corners of a 8-sided polygon. Taking two opposite vertices of the square with side length 16, e.g. $(8,8)$ and $(-8, -8)$, and finding the midpoints of the 4 adjacent edges, we obtain 4 more vertices: $(8, -8)$, $(-8, 8)$, $(8, 2)$, and $(-8, -2)$. Connecting all these 8 points by line segments results in a regular octagon with side length 8.

Therefore, area of this octagon equals to \[\frac{8^2 \cdot \sqrt{2}}{2} = 32\sqrt{2}.\]
The answer is: \[32\sqrt{2}\]

Question (hint: positive numerical answer):
"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"
Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:

 To find the area enclosed by the given set of points, we first need to fully satisfy the equation that defines the set of points. The equation is as follows:
\[((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0.\]
In order for the product to equal 0, either the first term, the second term, or both must equal 0. 
We set the first term equal to 0:
\[(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0 \text{ and }( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2= 0.\]
This implies that $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$.
This would mean that for any values of $x$ and $y$, they must be equidistant from -10 and 10 (which is equivalent to the $x$-axis in the coordinate plane).
Hence, we get the rectangle with vertices at $(8,8),(8,-8),(-8,8),(-8,-8)$.
Now calculating the area of this rectangle, the length of one side is $16$ (the distance from $8$ to $-8$ on the $x$-axis or $y$-axis), and the width is $16$ as well (the distance from $8$ to $-8$ on the $x$-axis or $y$-axis). Hence, the area is $16 \times 16 = 256$. So, the area of the convex polygon is $256$. The answer is: $\boxed{256}$.

Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:


First, we simplify the given equation. If the product of two numbers is zero, then at least one of the numbers must be zero. Therefore, we have two cases to consider:

1. Either $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + (\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$.

2. Both $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + (\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ and $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + (\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$.

Let's consider the two cases:

Case 1: 
$(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$. This implies that $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. This means that $x + y = \pm 10$ and $x - y = \pm 10$. Adding these two equations, we get that $2x = \pm 20$, so $x = \pm 10$. Subtracting these equations, we get that $2y = \pm 20$, so $y = \pm 10$. Hence, we have four lines $x = 10$, $x = -10$, $y = 10$, and $y = -10$. These lines enclose a square with side length 20. The area of the square is $20 \times 20 = 400$.

Case 2:
$(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + (\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$. This implies that $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$, so $x = \pm 8$ and $y = \pm 8$. Hence, we have four lines $x = 8$, $x = -8$, $y = 8$, and $y = -8$. These lines also enclose a square with side length 16. The area of the square is $16 \times 16 = 256$.

Since both cases lead to valid solutions, the convex polygon enclosed by the points is the intersection of the squares from each case. This means that the area of the convex polygon is the sum of the areas of the two squares, which is $400 + 256 = 656$. Therefore, the area of the convex polygon is $\boxed{656}$. The answer is: 656

"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"
Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:



The equation $AB=0$ is satisfied if and only if $A=0$ or $B=0$. So, the given equation is satisfied if and only if either $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$, $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$, $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$, or $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$. These give us the following system of equations:

1. $\vert x + y \vert = 10$
2. $\vert x - y \vert = 10$
3. $\vert x \vert = 8$
4. $\vert y \vert = 8$

From (3) and (4), we have $x = \pm 8$ and $y = \pm 8$.

1. If $x = 8$ and $y = 8$, equation (1) gives $16 = 10$, which is not true. So this case gives no solutions.
2. If $x = 8$ and $y = -8$, equation (1) gives $0 = 10$, which is not true. So this case gives no solutions.
3. If $x = -8$ and $y = 8$, equation (2) gives $0 = 10$, which is not true. So this case gives no solutions.
4. If $x = -8$ and $y = -8$, equation (2) gives $16 = 10$, which is not true. So this case gives no solutions.

Thus, we have four vertices of the polygon: $(8, 8)$, $(8, -8)$, $(-8, 8)$, and $(-8, -8)$.

From these points, we can draw a square with side length 16 units. The area of this square is $16^2 = 256$ square units. So, the area of the convex polygon is 256 square units.
The answer is: $256$.

Question (hint: positive numerical answer):
"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"
Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:


The given equation is equal to zero, which implies that either the first or the second factor is zero. 

The first factor is $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)$, and it equals 0 if and only if both $\vert x + y \vert - 10 = 0$ and $\vert x - y \vert - 10 = 0$. 
These equations simplify to $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. 
The solutions to these equations give us the vertices of the convex polygon.

The second factor is $((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2)$, and it equals 0 if and only if both $\vert x \vert - 8 = 0$ and $\vert y \vert - 8 = 0$. 
These equations simplify to $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$, 
which gives us the points where the x and y coordinates are 8 or -8. 

The intersections of these equations give us the vertices of the convex polygon:
$(8,8)$, $(8,-8)$, $(-8,8)$, and $(-8,-8)$.

These points form a square with side length 16, so the area of the square is $16^2=256$. The answer is: $256$.

"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"
Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:


The product of two numbers is zero if and only if at least one of the numbers is zero. So, the equation $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ is satisfied when either of the following conditions holds:
1. $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ or 
2. $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$.
The first condition holds if and only if $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. This simplifies to $x + y = \pm 10$ and $x - y = \pm 10$. Solving this system of equations, we get the vertices of the square as $(0, 10), (0, -10), (10, 0), (-10, 0)$.
The second condition holds if and only if $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$. This simplifies to $x = \pm 8$ and $y = \pm 8$. Solving this system of equations, we get the vertices of the square as $(8, 8), (8, -8), (-8, 8), (-8, -8)$.
By examining both conditions, we notice that the two squares share a corner at the origin. The resulting figure is a larger square with side length $10\sqrt{2}$. The area of this square is $(10\sqrt{2})^2 = 200$.
So, the area of the convex polygon is 200.
The value of the area of the convex polygon is $\boxed{200}$. The answer is: $\boxed{200}$

Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:

 The expression $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2)$ is equal to 0 if and only if either

The graphs of these equations are four lines, which form a square with side length 16. The area of this square is $16^2 = 256$. The requested area is thus 256.
