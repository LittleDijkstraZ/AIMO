 The given equation is a product of two expressions equal to zero. Therefore, either the first expression is zero or the second expression is zero. 

If the first expression is zero, then we have:
$$(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0.$$
Since squares of absolute values are always nonnegative, for the sum of two nonnegative numbers to be zero, each number must be zero. Thus, we have:
$$\vert x + y \vert = 10 \quad \text{and} \quad \vert x - y \vert = 10.$$
This implies that $x + y = \pm 10$ and $x - y = \pm 10$. Solving these equations, we find that the points $(x, y)$ satisfying the first expression are $\left(5, 5\right)$, $\left(5, -5\right)$, $\left(-5, 5\right)$, and $\left(-5, -5\right)$.

If the second expression is zero, then we have:
$$(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0.$$
Again, for the sum of two nonnegative numbers to be zero, each number must be zero. Thus, we have:
$$\vert x \vert = 8 \quad \text{and} \quad \vert y \vert = 8.$$
This implies that $x = \pm 8$ and $y = \pm 8$. So the points $(x, y)$ satisfying the second expression are $\left(8, 8\right)$, $\left(8, -8\right)$, $\left(-8, 8\right)$, and $\left(-8, -8\right)$.

The points that satisfy the original equation are the intersection of the points that satisfy the first expression and the points that satisfy the second expression. These points are the vertices of the convex polygon, which are $\left(5, 5\right)$, $\left(5, -5\right)$, $\left(-5, 5\right)$, $\left(-5, -5\right)$, $\left(8, 8\right)$, $\left(8, -8\right)$, $\left(-8, 8\right)$, and $\left(-8, -8\right)$.

The polygon is a square with side length 10. Therefore, its area is $10^2 = 100$. The answer is: $100$

 The equation is satisfied if and only if either $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$.
This means that either $\vert x + y \vert = 10$, $\vert x - y \vert = 10$, $\vert x \vert = 8$, or $\vert y \vert = 8$.
The equations $\vert x + y \vert = 10$, $\vert x - y \vert = 10$, $\vert x \vert = 8$, and $\vert y \vert = 8$ represent a square with side length 16.
The area of this square is $16^2 = 256$. The answer is: $256$

The given equation is of the form $AB = 0$, which implies that either $A = 0$ or $B = 0$. Therefore, the points that satisfy the equation must either satisfy $A = 0$ or $B = 0$.

For $A = 0$, we have $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$, which implies $\vert x + y \vert = 10$. This gives us two lines: $x + y = 10$ and $x + y = -10$.

For $B = 0$, we have $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$, which implies $\vert x \vert = 8$. This gives us two lines: $x = 8$ and $x = -8$. Similarly, for $\vert y \vert = 8$, we get two lines: $y = 8$ and $y = -8$.

The eight lines intersect at the vertices of a square with side length 10. Therefore, the area of the convex polygon is the area of the square, which is $10^2 = 100$.

The answer is: $100$

"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"
Analyze this problem and think step by step to come to a solution with programs. After solving the problem, output the final numerical answer within \boxed{}.

Assistant:

 The equation $AB=0$ is satisfied if and only if $A=0$ or $B=0$. So the given equation is equivalent to either $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$, $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$, $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$, or $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$.

From $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$, we get $\vert x + y \vert = 10$. This gives us two lines: $x + y = 10$ and $x + y = -10$.

From $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$, we get $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. This gives us two more lines: $x - y = 10$ and $x - y = -10$.

From $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$, we get $\vert x \vert = 8$. This gives us two vertical lines: $x = 8$ and $x = -8$.

From $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$, we get $\vert y \vert = 8$. This gives us two horizontal lines: $y = 8$ and $y = -8$.

The intersection points of these lines are: $(8,8)$, $(8,-8)$, $(-8,8)$, and $(-8,-8)$. These points form a square with side length $16$. The area of this square is $16^2 = 256$.

So the area of the convex polygon is $256$. The answer is: $256$

Assistant:

 The equation given is a product of two expressions equal to zero. This means that either the first expression is zero or the second expression is zero.

The first expression is $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)$, and it equals zero if and only if $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. These two equations describe a square with side length 10.

The second expression is $((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2)$, and it equals zero if and only if $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$. These two equations describe a square with side length 16.

The convex polygon is the intersection of these two squares, which is a square with side length 8. The area of this square is $8^2 = 64$. So, the area of the convex polygon is 64 square units. The answer is: $64$

Assistant:


This problem involves the concept of absolute value functions and how they are equal to zero. The absolute value of a number is equal to zero only if the number itself is zero. So, the equation $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ implies that $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. Similarly, the equation $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ implies that $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$.

From $\vert x + y \vert = 10$, we get $x + y = \pm 10$ and from $\vert x - y \vert = 10$, we get $x - y = \pm 10$. These four equations represent the sides of the square.

From $\vert x \vert = 8$, we get $x = \pm 8$ and from $\vert y \vert = 8$, we get $y = \pm 8$. These four equations represent the sides of the square.

The intersection of these two squares gives a square with side length 8, so the area of the convex polygon is $8^2 = 64$. The answer is: $64$

"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"
Analyze this problem and think step by step to come to a solution with programs. After solving the problem, output the final numerical answer within \boxed{}.

Assistant:

 The given equation is equal to zero if and only if both of the factors are equal to zero. This gives us two systems of equations to solve:

1. $|x + y| - 10 = 0$ and $|x - y| - 10 = 0$.
2. $|x| - 8 = 0$ and $|y| - 8 = 0$.

For the first system, we have $|x + y| = 10$ and $|x - y| = 10$. This implies that $x + y = \pm 10$ and $x - y = \pm 10$. Solving these equations gives us the vertices of the square: $(5, 5)$, $(5, -5)$, $(-5, 5)$, and $(-5, -5)$.

For the second system, we have $|x| = 8$ and $|y| = 8$. This implies that $x = \pm 8$ and $y = \pm 8$. Solving these equations gives us the vertices of the square: $(8, 8)$, $(8, -8)$, $(-8, 8)$, and $(-8, -8)$.

The convex polygon formed by the union of these two squares is a 8x8 square. The area of this square is $8^2 = 64$. So the area of the convex polygon is 64. The answer is: $64$

Assistant:

 The given equation is a product of two terms equal to zero. Therefore, either the first term is zero or the second term is zero. 

The first term is zero when either $|x+y| = 10$ or $|x-y| = 10$. These are the equations of two sets of parallel lines in the $xy$-plane, each set being 20 units apart. 

The second term is zero when either $|x| = 8$ or $|y| = 8$, which are the equations of two sets of parallel lines in the $xy$-plane, each set being 16 units apart. 

The intersection of these lines forms a square with side length 20 units. The area of this square is $20^2 = 400$. 

So, the area of the convex polygon is 400 square units. The answer is: $400$

For the first factor to be zero, we must have $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$.
This means that $x + y = \pm 10$ and $x - y = \pm 10$.
Solving these equations, we find that the points $(x, y)$ that satisfy the first factor are the vertices of a square with side length 10 and centered at the origin.
For the second factor to be zero, we must have $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$.
This means that $x = \pm 8$ and $y = \pm 8$.
Solving these equations, we find that the points $(x, y)$ that satisfy the second factor are the vertices of a square with side length 16 and centered at the origin.
The convex polygon enclosed by the points satisfying the original equation is the intersection of these two squares, which is another square with side length 10.
The area of this square is $10^2 = 100$. The answer is: $100$

"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"
Analyze this problem and think step by step to come to a solution with programs. After solving the problem, output the final numerical answer within \boxed{}.

Assistant:

 The given equation is $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$.
For the product of two factors to be zero, either one of the factors must be zero.
So, we have two cases to consider:

Case 1: $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$. This implies that $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. This gives us four lines: $x + y = 10$, $x + y = -10$, $x - y = 10$, and $x - y = -10$. These lines form a square with side length 10.

Case 2: $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$. This implies that $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$. This gives us four lines: $x = 8$, $x = -8$, $y = 8$, and $y = -8$. These lines form a square with side length 16.

The convex polygon enclosed by the points satisfying the given equation is the intersection of these two squares. The intersection is a square with side length 10.

The area of a square with side length $a$ is $a^2$. Therefore, the area of the convex polygon is $10^2 = 100$.

So, the area of the convex polygon is 100. The answer is: $100$
