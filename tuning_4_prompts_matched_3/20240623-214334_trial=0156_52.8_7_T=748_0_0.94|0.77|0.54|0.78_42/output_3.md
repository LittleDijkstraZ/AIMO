Below is a math problem you are to solve (positive numerical answer!):
"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"
Analyze this problem and think step by step to come to a solution with programs. After solving the problem, output the final numerical answer within \boxed{}.

Assistant:


The expression $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2)$ equals to zero if and only if at least one of the factors equals to zero. This happens if and only if either $\vert x + y \vert = 10$, $\vert x - y \vert = 10$, $\vert x \vert = 8$, or $\vert y \vert = 8$. These four conditions describe four lines in the plane, and the intersection of these lines is a square with side length 6. The area of this square is $6^2 = 36$. Therefore, the area of the convex polygon is 36.

Here is a Python code that calculates the area of the square:

```python

def square_area():
    """The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"""
    side_length = 6
    area = side_length ** 2
    return area

result = square_area()
print(result)
```

CODE RESULTS 36

```
The area of the convex polygon is $36$. The answer is $\boxed{36}$.

Assistant:

 The expression $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2$ will be zero if and only if $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. This implies that $x + y = \pm 10$ and $x - y = \pm 10$. Solving these equations, we get the vertices of the polygon as $(0, 10)$, $(0, -10)$, $(10, 0)$, $(-10, 0)$, $(8, 8)$, $(8, -8)$, $(-8, 8)$, and $(-8, -8)$.

The polygon is a square with side length 20. The area of a square is the square of the length of its side. Therefore, the area of the polygon is $20^2 = 400$.

So, the area of the convex polygon is 400. The answer is: $400$.

Below is a math problem you are to solve (positive numerical answer!):
"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"
Analyze this problem and think step by step to come to a solution with programs. After solving the problem, output the final numerical answer within \boxed{}.

Assistant:


The equation $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + (\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + (\vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ is true if and only if at least one of the factors is zero.
The first factor is zero if and only if $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ or $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. These are the equations of two squares with side length 10.
The second factor is zero if and only if $\vert x \vert = 8$ or $\vert y \vert = 8$. These are the equations of two squares with side length 8.
Therefore, the points that satisfy the equation are the vertices of a square with side length 10 and a square with side length 8.
The area of the square with side length 10 is $10^2 = 100$.
The area of the square with side length 8 is $8^2 = 64$.
To find the area of the convex polygon enclosed by these points, we simply add the areas of the two squares: $100 + 64 = 164$.
The answer is: $164$

Below is a math problem you are to solve (positive numerical answer!):
"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"
Analyze this problem and think step by step to come to a solution with programs. After solving the problem, output the final numerical answer within \boxed{}.

Assistant:


The given equation is $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$.
This equation is equal to zero if either of the two factors is equal to zero.
For the first factor to be zero, we need both $\vert x + y \vert - 10 = 0$ and $\vert x - y \vert - 10 = 0$, which implies $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$.
For the second factor to be zero, we need both $\vert x \vert - 8 = 0$ and $\vert y \vert - 8 = 0$, which implies $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$.
The solutions to these equations are the vertices of the convex polygon.
The vertices of the polygon are $(8,8)$, $(8,-8)$, $(-8,8)$, and $(-8,-8)$.
To find the area of the polygon, we can use the formula for the area of a rectangle and subtract the areas of the four right triangles formed by the vertices.
The rectangle has length 16 and width 16, so its area is $16 \times 16 = 256$.
Each right triangle has base and height of 8, so its area is $\frac{1}{2} \times 8 \times 8 = 32$.
Since there are four right triangles, the total area of the triangles is $4 \times 32 = 128$.
Therefore, the area of the convex polygon is $256 - 128 = 128$. The answer is: 128

Analyze this problem and think step by step to come to a solution with programs. After solving the problem, output the final numerical answer within \boxed{}.

Assistant:

 The given equation is equal to zero if and only if both of the factors are equal to zero. Therefore, we have two sets of equations to solve:

1. $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ and $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ and $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ and $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$.

From the first and third equations, we have $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. From the second and fourth equations, we have $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$. 

Solving these equations, we get four points: $(8, 2)$, $(8, -2)$, $(-8, 2)$, and $(-8, -2)$.

2. $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ and $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ and $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ and $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$.

From the first and third equations, we have $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. From the second and fourth equations, we have $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$. 

Solving these equations, we get four points: $(8, 2)$, $(8, -2)$, $(-8, 2)$, and $(-8, -2)$.

The points form a square with side length 16. The area of the square is $16^2 = 256$.

So, the area of the convex polygon is 256. The answer is: $256$

 The equation given in the problem is a product of two expressions equal to zero, which means that either the first expression is zero or the second expression is zero.

The first expression is $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)$. This expression is zero if and only if both $(\vert x + y \vert - 10) = 0$ and $(\vert x - y \vert - 10) = 0$. This implies that $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. Solving these equations, we get that the points must satisfy $x + y = \pm 10$ and $x - y = \pm 10$. These four lines are the sides of a square with side length 10.

The second expression is $((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2)$. This expression is zero if and only if both $(\vert x \vert - 8) = 0$ and $(\vert y \vert - 8) = 0$. This implies that $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$. Solving these equations, we get that the points must satisfy $x = \pm 8$ and $y = \pm 8$. These four lines are the sides of a square with side length 16.

The convex polygon enclosed by the points satisfying the given equation is the intersection of these two squares, which is a smaller square with side length 10. Therefore, the area of this convex polygon is $10^2 = 100$. The answer is: $100$

For $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$, we have $\vert x + y \vert = 10$, which gives us two lines: $x + y = 10$ and $x + y = -10$.
Similarly, for $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$, we have $\vert x - y \vert = 10$, which gives us two more lines: $x - y = 10$ and $x - y = -10$.
For $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$, we have $\vert x \vert = 8$, which gives us two lines: $x = 8$ and $x = -8$.
And for $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$, we have $\vert y \vert = 8$, which gives us two more lines: $y = 8$ and $y = -8$.
These lines form a rectangle with side lengths 16 and 20, so the area of the rectangle is $16 \times 20 = 320$.

 The expression $AB = 0$ is true if and only if $A = 0$ or $B = 0$. So the given equation is equivalent to either $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$, $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$, $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$, or $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$.
The solutions to these equations are:
1. $\vert x + y \vert = 10$, which implies $x + y = \pm 10$.
2. $\vert x - y \vert = 10$, which implies $x - y = \pm 10$.
3. $\vert x \vert = 8$, which implies $x = \pm 8$.
4. $\vert y \vert = 8$, which implies $y = \pm 8$.
These equations represent a square with side length 16, so its area is $16^2 = 256$. The answer is: $256$

 The equation given is a product of two expressions equal to zero. This means that either the first expression is zero or the second expression is zero. 

The first expression is $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)$. This expression equals zero if and only if both $\vert x + y \vert - 10 = 0$ and $\vert x - y \vert - 10 = 0$. This implies that $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. Solving these equations gives $x + y = \pm 10$ and $x - y = \pm 10$. These are the equations of four lines.

The second expression is $((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2)$. This expression equals zero if and only if both $\vert x \vert - 8 = 0$ and $\vert y \vert - 8 = 0$. This implies that $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$. Solving these equations gives $x = \pm 8$ and $y = \pm 8$. These are the equations of four lines.

The intersection of the lines $x + y = \pm 10$ and $x - y = \pm 10$ gives the vertices of a square with side length 10. The intersection of the lines $x = \pm 8$ and $y = \pm 8$ gives the vertices of a square with side length 8.

The area of the square with side length 10 is $10^2 = 100$, and the area of the square with side length 8 is $8^2 = 64$. Therefore, the area of the convex polygon is the sum of the areas of these two squares, which is $100 + 64 = 164$.

Assistant:


The given equation is a product of two expressions equal to zero, so it is equal to zero when either of the expressions is zero. This gives us two sets of equations to solve:

1. $|x + y| - 10 = 0$ and $|x - y| - 10 = 0$.
2. $|x| - 8 = 0$ and $|y| - 8 = 0$.

For the first set of equations, we have $|x + y| = 10$ and $|x - y| = 10$. This implies that $x + y = \pm 10$ and $x - y = \pm 10$. Solving these equations gives us the vertices of the polygon: $(8, 2)$, $(8, -2)$, $(-8, 2)$, and $(-8, -2)$.

For the second set of equations, we have $|x| = 8$ and $|y| = 8$. This implies that $x = \pm 8$ and $y = \pm 8$. Solving these equations gives us the vertices of the polygon: $(8, 8)$, $(8, -8)$, $(-8, 8)$, and $(-8, -8)$.

The polygon formed by these vertices is a square with side length 16. The area of a square is given by the square of the length of its side, so the area of this square is $16^2 = 256$.
The answer is: $256$

Below is a math problem you are to solve (positive numerical answer!):
"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"
Analyze this problem and think step by step to come to a solution with programs. After solving the problem, output the final numerical answer within \boxed{}.

Assistant:

 The given equation is equal to zero if and only if both factors are equal to zero. Therefore, we have two sets of equations to solve:
1. $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ and $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$
2. $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ and $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$

For the first set of equations, we have:
1. $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x \vert = 8$
2. $\vert y \vert = 8$

From $\vert x + y \vert = 10$, we have four cases:
1. $x + y = 10$
2. $x + y = -10$
3. $-x - y = 10$
4. $-x - y = -10$

From $\vert x \vert = 8$, we have two cases:
1. $x = 8$
2. $x = -8$

From $\vert y \vert = 8$, we have two cases:
1. $y = 8$
2. $y = -8$

Solving all combinations of these cases, we find the following vertices of the polygon:
$(8, 2), (8, -10), (-8, 2), (-8, -10), (2, 8), (-10, 8), (2, -8), (-10, -8)$

To find the area of the polygon, we can use the Shoelace Formula. The Shoelace Formula states that if the vertices of a polygon are $(x_1, y_1), (x_2, y_2), \dots, (x_n, y_n)$ in clockwise order, then the area of the polygon is given by
\[\frac{1}{2} \vert (x_1y_2 + x_2y_3 + \dots + x_ny_1) - (y_1x_2 + y_2x_3 + \dots + y_nx_1) \vert.\]

Applying the Shoelace Formula to the vertices $(8, 2), (8, -10), (-8, 2), (-8, -10), (2, 8), (-10, 8), (2, -8), (-10, -8)$, we find the area to be $256$.

Therefore, the area of the convex polygon is $256$. The answer is: $256$
