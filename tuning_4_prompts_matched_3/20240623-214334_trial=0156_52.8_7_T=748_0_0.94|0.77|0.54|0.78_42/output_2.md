 To solve this problem, we need to analyze the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ and find the values of $m$ for which it has $4$ distinct solutions.

First, let's consider the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=k$, where $k$ is a positive constant. This equation has $4$ distinct solutions if and only if $0<k<1$. This is because the left-hand side of the equation is an integer for all $x$, and it takes on all integer values between $-(|a-b|+1)$ and $|a-b|-1$ inclusive, where $a$ and $b$ are the absolute values inside the absolute values. So, if $0<k<1$, then the left-hand side takes on $4$ distinct integer values.

In our case, $k=\frac{m}{100}$, so we need to find the values of $m$ such that $0<\frac{m}{100}<1$. This simplifies to $0<m<100$.

So, the positive integers $m$ that satisfy the condition are the integers from $1$ to $99$. There are $99$ such integers.

Therefore, the number of positive integers $m$ for which the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has $4$ distinct solutions is $99$. The answer is: $99$

 The number of distinct solutions of the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ is equal to 4 when $\frac{m}{100}=2$. This is because the equation inside the absolute value, $\vert x-1 \vert -2$, changes its sign at $x=1 \pm 2$, which are $x=3$ and $x=-1$. The equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ will have 4 distinct solutions when $\frac{m}{100}=2$, which gives $m=200$. So the only positive integer $m$ for which the equation has 4 distinct solutions is $m=200$. The answer is: $200$

Assistant:

 The equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has $4$ distinct solutions when $\frac{m}{100}$ is equal to $2$. This is because the expression inside the absolute value, $\vert x-1 \vert -2$, will have four distinct values when it equals to $2$ or $-2$. 

So, we need to find the value of $m$ such that $\frac{m}{100} = 2$. 

```python


INTERMEDIATE OUT :

def find_m():
    m = 2 * 100
    return m

m = find_m()
print(m)
```

CODE RESULTS 200

INTERMEDIATE OUT :
```output
200
```
The value of $m$ that makes the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ have $4$ distinct solutions is $200$. The answer is: $200$.

Assistant:

 The equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has $4$ distinct solutions if and only if $\frac{m}{100} = 2$. This is because the expression on the left side of the equation is always between $0$ and $4$, and it equals to $2$ exactly when the equation inside the absolute value signs has $4$ distinct solutions.

So we have $\frac{m}{100} = 2$, which implies $m = 200$. Therefore, there is only one positive integer $m$ that makes the equation have $4$ distinct solutions, and that is $200$. The answer is: $200$
