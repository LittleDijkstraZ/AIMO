 To solve this problem, we can use the method of Lagrange multipliers.
First, let's define the function $F(x, y, \lambda) = 5x^2 + 5y^2 - 8xy - \lambda(|x - 2y| + |y - 2x - 40)$.
We want to find the minimum of $F(x, y, \lambda)$ subject to the constraint $|x - 2y| + |y - 2x| = 40$.
To find the minimum, we need to find the points where the gradient of $F(x, y, \lambda)$ is zero, i.e., $\nabla F(x, y, \lambda) = 0$.

The gradient of $F(x, y, \lambda)$ is given by:
\[\nabla F(x, y, \lambda) = \begin{bmatrix} 10x - 8y - \lambda(-1 + 2\delta_1) \\ 10y - 8x - \lambda(1 - 2\delta_2) \end{bmatrix},\]
where $\delta_1 = \begin{cases} 1 & \text{if } x \geq 2y \\ -1 & \text{if } x < 2y \end{cases}$ and $\delta_2 = \begin{cases} 1 & \text{if } y \geq 2x \\ -1 & \text{if } y < 2x \end{cases}$.

Setting the gradient to zero, we have:
\[\begin{cases} 10x - 8y - \lambda(-1 + 2\delta_1) = 0 \\ 10y - 8x - \lambda(1 - 2\delta_2) = 0 \end{cases}.\]

Now, we need to consider the different cases for the signs of $\delta_1$ and $\delta_2$.
After solving these cases, we find that the minimum occurs at $(x, y) = (20, 10)$.

Substituting these values into the function $5x^2 + 5y^2 - 8xy$, we get:
\[5(20)^2 + 5(10)^2 - 8(20)(10) = 2000 + 500 - 1600 = 1900.\]

Therefore, the minimum value of $5x^2 + 5y^2 - 8xy$ subject to the constraint is 1900. The answer is: $1900$

 This problem is a bit complex to solve directly using Python. However, we can use the AM-GM inequality (Arithmetic Mean - Geometric Mean) to solve it.

The AM-GM inequality states that for any non-negative real numbers $a$ and $b$, we have $\frac{a+b}{2} \geq \sqrt{ab}$, or equivalently, $a+b \geq 2\sqrt{ab}$.

Let's apply the AM-GM inequality to the expression $|x-2y| + |y-2x|$. We have:
$$|x-2y| + |y-2x| \geq 2\sqrt{|x-2y|\cdot|y-2x|}.$$
Given that $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$, we can deduce that $2\sqrt{|x-2y|\cdot|y-2x|} = 40$, so $|x-2y|\cdot|y-2x| = 400$.

Now, let's consider the expression $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$. We can rewrite it as:
$$5x^2+5y^2-8xy = \frac{1}{2}(10x^2+10y^2-16xy) = \frac{1}{2}[(5x^2-8xy+4y^2) + (5y^2-8xy+4x^2)]$$
$$= \frac{1}{2}[(5x-4y)^2 + (5y-4x)^2].$$

Since $(5x-4y)^2 \geq 0$ and $(5y-4x)^2 \geq 0$, we have:
$$(5x-4y)^2 + (5y-4x)^2 \geq 0.$$
So,
$$\frac{1}{2}[(5x-4y)^2 + (5y-4x)^2] \geq 0.$$
Equality holds when $5x-4y = 0$ and $5y-4x = 0$, which gives $x = y$.

Substitute $x = y$ into $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$, we get:
$$|x-2x| + |x-2x| = 40 \Rightarrow |x| + |-x| = 40 \Rightarrow 2|x| = 40 \Rightarrow |x| = 20.$$
So, $x = \pm 20$.

Substitute $x = 20$ into $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$, we get:
$$5\cdot20^2+5y^2-8\cdot20y = 2000+5y^2-160y.$$
To minimize this expression, we take the derivative with respect to $y$ and set it to zero:
$$\frac{d}{dy}(2000+5y^2-160y) = 10y - 160 = 0.$$
Solving this equation gives $y = \frac{160}{10} = 16$.

Substitute $x = -20$ into $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$, we get:
$$5\cdot(-20)^2+5y^2-8\cdot(-20)y = 2000+5y^2+160y.$$
To minimize this expression, we take the derivative with respect to $y$ and set it to zero:
$$\frac{d}{dy}(2000+5y^2+160y) = 10y + 160 = 0.$$
Solving this equation gives $y = -\frac{160}{10} = -16$.

Now we compare the values of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ at $x = 20, y = 16$ and $x = -20, y = -16$. We have:
$$5\cdot20^2+5\cdot16^2-8\cdot20\cdot16 = 2000+1280-2560 = 720,$$
and
$$5\cdot(-20)^2+5\cdot(-16)^2-8\cdot(-20)\cdot(-16) = 2000+1280+2560 = 5840.$$
So, the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ is 720.
The answer is: $720$

 This problem requires the use of the inequality $|a| + |b| \geq |a+b|$ for real numbers $a$ and $b$. 

First, we rewrite the given equation $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$ as $|2y-x| + |2x-y| = 40$. Then, we apply the inequality to get $|(2y-x) + (2x-y)| = |y+x| = 40$.

Next, we express the given expression $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ as $\frac{1}{2}((5x-4y)^2 + (4x-5y)^2)$. 

By the inequality of arithmetic and geometric means (AM-GM), we have $\frac{1}{2}((5x-4y)^2 + (4x-5y)^2) \geq \frac{1}{2} \cdot 2|(5x-4y)(4x-5y)| = |20x^2 - 45xy + 20y^2| = |20(x^2 + y^2) - 45xy|$.

Since $|x+y| = 40$, we have $x^2 + y^2 = (x+y)^2 - 2xy = 40^2 - 2xy = 1600 - 2xy$.

Substitute $x^2 + y^2 = 1600 - 2xy$ into the inequality, we get $|20(x^2 + y^2) - 45xy| = |20(1600 - 2xy) - 45xy| = |-40xy + 32000| = 40|xy - 800|$.

By the AM-GM inequality again, we have $xy \geq \left(\frac{x+y}{2}\right)^2 = \left(\frac{40}{2}\right)^2 = 400$. So $|xy - 800| \geq 800 - xy \geq 800 - 400 = 400$.

Therefore, $40|xy - 800| \geq 40 \cdot 400 = 16000$.

So the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ is $16000$.

 To solve this problem, we can use the method of Lagrange multipliers. First, let's rewrite the constraint equation as $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$. We can then introduce a new variable $\lambda$ and form the following equation:

$$F(x, y, \lambda) = 5x^2 + 5y^2 - 8xy - \lambda(|x - 2y| + |y - 2x| - 40)$$

Now we need to find the critical points of $F(x, y, \lambda)$ by setting its partial derivatives with respect to $x$, $y$, and $\lambda$ to zero:

$$\frac{\partial F}{\partial x} = 10x - 8y - \lambda(-1 - 2) = 0$$
$$\frac{\partial F}{\partial y} = 10y - 8x - \lambda(2 + -2) = 0$$
$$\frac{\partial F}{\partial \lambda} = |x - 2y| + |y - 2x| - 40 = 0$$

From the first two equations, we can express $x$ and $y$ in terms of $\lambda$:

$$x = \frac{4y + \lambda}{5}$$
$$y = \frac{4x + \lambda}{5}$$

Substituting these into the constraint equation, we get:

$$| \frac{4y + \lambda}{5} - 2y | + | \frac{4x + \lambda}{5} - 2x | = 40$$

Solving this equation for $\lambda$ is quite difficult. However, we can use numerical methods to find the value of $\lambda$ that minimizes the original function $5x^2 + 5y^2 - 8xy$. Once we have the value of $\lambda$, we can substitute it back into the equations for $x$ and $y$ to find the minimum point. Finally, we can substitute these values of $x$ and $y$ into the original function to find the minimum value.

Using numerical methods, we find that $\lambda = 20$. Substituting this back into the equations for $x$ and $y$, we get:

$$x = \frac{4y + 20}{5}$$
$$y = \frac{4x + 20}{5}$$

Solving these equations simultaneously, we find that $x = 10$ and $y = 5$. Substituting these values into the original function, we get:

$$5(10)^2 + 5(5)^2 - 8(10)(5) = 500 + 125 - 400 = 225$$

Therefore, the minimum value of $5x^2 + 5y^2 - 8xy$ subject to the constraint $|x - 2y| + |y - 2x| = 40$ is 225. The answer is: $225$

 This problem is a classic optimization problem with an absolute value constraint. To solve it, we can first find the minimum value of the expression $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ under the constraint $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$. 

The constraint equation can be rewritten as $|x-2y| + |2y-x| = 40$, which simplifies to $|x-2y| + |x-2y| = 40$, or $2|x-2y| = 40$. Thus, $|x-2y| = 20$.

Now, let's substitute $u = x - 2y$ and $v = 2x - y$. The constraint equation becomes $|u| + |v| = 40$. We can rewrite this as a system of linear equations:

1. If $u \geq 0$ and $v \geq 0$, then $u + v = 40$.
2. If $u \geq 0$ and $v < 0$, then $u - v = 40$.
3. If $u < 0$ and $v \geq 0$, then $-u + v = 40$.
4. If $u < 0$ and $v < 0$, then $-u - v = 40$.

Solving these systems of equations, we find that the possible values of $(u, v)$ are $(20, 20)$, $(20, -20)$, $(-20, 20)$, and $(-20, -20)$.

Now, we substitute $x = \frac{u+2v}{3}$ and $y = \frac{2u+v}{3}$ into the expression $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$:

\[5x^2+5y^2-8xy = 5\left(\frac{u+2v}{3}\right)^2 + 5\left(\frac{2u+v}{3}\right)^2 - 8\left(\frac{u+2v}{3}\right)\left(\frac{2u+v}{3}\right).\]

Expanding and simplifying, we get:

\[5x^2+5y^2-8xy = \frac{5}{9}(u^2 + 4v^2 + 4uv) + \frac{5}{9}(4u^2 + v^2 - 4uv) - \frac{16}{9}(u^2 + 4v^2 + 4uv).\]

Further simplifying, we obtain:

\[5x^2+5y^2-8xy = \frac{1}{9}(u^2 + v^2).\]

Now, we substitute the possible values of $(u, v)$ into this expression:

1. For $(u, v) = (20, 20)$, we get $\frac{1}{9}(400 + 400) = \frac{800}{9}$.
2. For $(u, v) = (20, -20)$, we get $\frac{1}{9}(400 + 400) = \frac{800}{9}$.
3. For $(u, v) = (-20, 20)$, we get $\frac{1}{9}(400 + 400) = \frac{800}{9}$.
4. For $(u, v) = (-20, -20)$, we get $\frac{1}{9}(400 + 400) = \frac{800}{9}$.

Therefore, the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ under the constraint is $\frac{800}{9}$. The answer is: $\boxed{\frac{800}{9}}$

The problem is a bit complex to be solved directly by programming. However, we can simplify it by making a substitution to simplify the expression. Let $u = x - 2y$ and $v = y - 2x$. Then we have $|u| + |v| = 40$.

Now, we can express $x$ and $y$ in terms of $u$ and $v$:
$$x = \frac{u - 2v}{3}, \quad y = \frac{v - 2u}{3}.$$

Substitute these expressions into the original expression:
$$5x^2+5y^2-8xy = 5\left(\frac{u - 2v}{3}\right)^2 + 5\left(\frac{v - 2u}{3}\right)^2 - 8\left(\frac{u - 2v}{3}\right)\left(\frac{v - 2u}{3}\right).$$

Simplify this expression and we get:
$$\frac{5u^2 + 5v^2 - 8uv}{9}.$$

Now, we want to find the minimum value of this expression under the constraint $|u| + |v| = 40$.

We can use the Cauchy-Schwarz inequality to solve this problem. The Cauchy-Schwarz inequality states that for any real numbers $a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n$ and $b_1, b_2, \ldots, b_n$, we have
$$(a_1^2 + a_2^2 + \cdots + a_n^2)(b_1^2 + b_2^2 + \cdots + b_n^2) \geq (a_1b_1 + a_2b_2 + \cdots + a_nb_n)^2.$$

Applying the Cauchy-Schwarz inequality to the numbers $u$ and $v$ with weights $1$ and $1$, we get
$$(u^2 + v^2)(1^2 + 1^2) \geq (u + v)^2.$$

Since $|u| + |v| = 40$, we have $u + v = \pm 40$. Therefore, we have
$$(u^2 + v^2)(2) \geq (40)^2,$$
which simplifies to
$$u^2 + v^2 \geq \frac{40^2}{2} = 800.$$

Now, we can substitute this back into the expression we simplified:
$$\frac{5u^2 + 5v^2 - 8uv}{9} \geq \frac{5 \cdot 800 - 8uv}{9}.$$

To minimize this expression, we need to maximize $8uv$. By the Cauchy-Schwarz inequality again, we have
$$(u^2 + v^2)(1^2 + (-1)^2) \geq (u - v)^2.$$

This simplifies to
$$u^2 + v^2 \geq (u - v)^2.$$

Since $u + v = \pm 40$, we have $u - v = \pm 20$. Therefore, we have
$$u^2 + v^2 \geq 400.$$

Then we have
$$8uv \leq 8 \cdot \frac{u^2 + v^2}{2} = 4(u^2 + v^2) \leq 4 \cdot 400 = 1600.$$

Therefore, the minimum value of the expression is
$$\frac{5 \cdot 800 - 8uv}{9} \geq \frac{5 \cdot 800 - 1600}{9} = \frac{4000 - 1600}{9} = \frac{2400}{9} = \frac{800}{3}.$$

So the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ is $\frac{800}{3}$. However, this value does not satisfy the constraint $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$. Therefore, we must have made a mistake in our calculations.

Let's go back and re-examine the problem. We noticed that we made a mistake in the substitution. The correct substitution should be $u = x + 2y$ and $v = y + 2x$. Let's correct this and re-do the calculations.

Now, we have $x = \frac{u + 2v}{3}$ and $y = \frac{v + 2u}{3}$.

Substitute these expressions into the original expression:
$$5x^2+5y^2-8xy = 5\left(\frac{u + 2v}{3}\right)^2 + 5\left(\frac{v + 2u}{3}\right)^2 - 8\left(\frac{u + 2v}{3}\right)\left(\frac{v + 2u}{3}\right).$$

Simplify this expression and we get:
$$\frac{5u^2 + 5v^2 + 8uv}{9}.$$

Now, we want to find the minimum value of this expression under the constraint $|u| + |v| = 40$.

Applying the Cauchy-Schwarz inequality to the numbers $u$ and $v$ with weights $1$ and $1$, we get
$$(u^2 + v^2)(1^2 + 1^2) \geq (u + v)^2.$$

Since $|u| + |v| = 40$, we have $u + v = \pm 40$. Therefore, we have
$$(u^2 + v^2)(2) \geq (40)^2,$$
which simplifies to
$$u^2 + v^2 \geq \frac{40^2}{2} = 800.$$

Now, we can substitute this back into the expression we simplified:
$$\frac{5u^2 + 5v^2 + 8uv}{9} \geq \frac{5 \cdot 800 + 8uv}{9}.$$

To minimize this expression, we need to maximize $8uv$. By the Cauchy-Schwarz inequality again, we have
$$(u^2 + v^2)(1^2 + (-1)^2) \geq (u - v)^2.$$

This simplifies to
$$u^2 + v^2 \geq (u - v)^2.$$

Since $u + v = \pm 40$, we have $u - v = \pm 20$. Therefore, we have
$$u^2 + v^2 \geq 400.$$

Then we have
$$8uv \leq 8 \cdot \frac{u^2 + v^2}{2} = 4(u^2 + v^2) \leq 4 \cdot 400 = 1600.$$

Therefore, the minimum value of the expression is
$$\frac{5 \cdot 800 + 8uv}{9

Below is a math problem you are to solve (positive numerical answer!):
"What is the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ when $x$ and $y$ range over all real numbers such that $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$?"
Analyze this problem and think step by step to come to a solution with programs. After solving the problem, output the final numerical answer within \boxed{}.

Assistant:

 To solve this problem, we can use the method of completing the square.

First, let's rewrite the expression $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ as $(x^2 - 4xy + 4y^2) + (y^2 - 4xy + 4x^2) = (x - 2y)^2 + (y - 2x)^2$.

Now, let's consider the constraint $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$. By the triangle inequality, we know that $|x-2y| + |y-2x| \geq |(x-2y) - (y-2x)| = |x-2y-y+2x| = |3x-3y| = 3|x-y|$. So we have $3|x-y| = 40$, which implies $|x-y| = \frac{40}{3}$.

Now, let's express $(x - 2y)^2 + (y - 2x)^2$ in terms of $u = x - y$. We have:
\begin{align*}
(x - 2y)^2 + (y - 2x)^2 &= (x - y - y)^2 + (y - x - y)^2 \\
&= (u - y)^2 + (-u - y)^2 \\
&= u^2 - 2uy + y^2 + u^2 + 2uy + y^2 \\
&= 2u^2 + 2y^2 \\
&= 2(u^2 + y^2).
\end{align*}

Now, we know that $u = \frac{40}{3}$, so we can substitute this into the expression $2(u^2 + y^2)$ to get $2\left(\left(\frac{40}{3}\right)^2 + y^2\right)$.

To minimize this expression, we need to minimize $y^2$. Since $y^2$ is always non-negative, the minimum value occurs when $y^2 = 0$, which means $y = 0$.

Substituting $y = 0$ into the expression $2\left(\left(\frac{40}{3}\right)^2 + y^2\right)$, we get $2\left(\left(\frac{40}{3}\right)^2\right) = \frac{3200}{9}$.

So the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ under the given constraint is $\frac{3200}{9}$. The answer is: $\frac{3200}{9}$

Assistant:

 To solve this problem, we first observe that the expression $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ can be rewritten as $5(x-y)^2 + 3y^2$. This expression is always non-negative, and it is minimized when $(x-y)^2 = 0$ and $y^2 = 0$. This means $x=y$.

Next, we substitute $x=y$ into the equation $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$. We get $|x-2x| + |x-2x| = 40$, which simplifies to $|x| + |-x| = 40$, and further simplifies to $2|x| = 40$. Solving for $x$, we get $|x| = 20$, so $x = \pm 20$.

Substituting $x=20$ into the expression $5(x-y)^2 + 3y^2$, we get $5(20-20)^2 + 3(20)^2 = 1200$. Substituting $x=-20$ into the expression, we get the same result.

So the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ is 1200. The answer is: $1200$

 This problem is a bit tricky, but we can solve it using a bit of mathematical reasoning and clever use of the Cauchy-Schwarz inequality.

First, let's rewrite the given equation $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$ as $|x-2y| + |2y-x| = 40$. By the triangle inequality, we know that $|a| + |b| \geq |a+b|$, so we have $|x-2y| + |2y-x| \geq |(x-2y) + (2y-x)| = |0| = 0$. But we are given that $|x-2y| + |2y-x| = 40$, so this inequality must be an equality. By the triangle inequality equality condition, we know that $(x-2y)$ and $(2y-x)$ must have the same sign. But they have opposite signs, so there must be some cancellation. In fact, we can see that $|x-2y| = |2y-x|$, so $x-2y = -(2y-x)$, which implies $x = 2y$.

Now, substitute $x = 2y$ into the expression $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$, we get $5(2y)^2+5y^2-8(2y)y = 20y^2+5y^2-16y^2 = 9y^2$. Now, we know that $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$ becomes $|y-2(2y)| + |2y-4y| = 40$, which simplifies to $|y-4y| + |2y-4y| = 40$, or $|3y| + |-2y| = 40$, which simplifies to $5|y| = 40$, so $|y| = 8$. Therefore, the minimum value of $9y^2$ is achieved when $y = \pm 8$. Since $y = \pm 8$ gives the same value for $9y^2$, we can choose either $y = 8$ or $y = -8$. Choosing $y = 8$ gives $x = 2y = 16$, so the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ is $9(8^2) = 576$.

So the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ is 576. The answer is: $576$

 This problem is a bit tricky, and it involves understanding the given condition $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$ and how it relates to the expression $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$. 

First, let's rewrite the condition as $|x-2y| + |2y-x| = 40$, which simplifies to $2|x-2y| = 40$. So $|x-2y| = 20$.

Now, let's define a new variable $z = x - 2y$. Then the condition becomes $|z| = 20$. This means $z = 20$ or $z = -20$.

If $z = x - 2y = 20$, then $x = 2y + 20$. Substituting this into the expression $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$, we get:
\[5(2y+20)^2 + 5y^2 - 8y(2y+20) = 20y^2 + 200y + 2000 + 5y^2 - 16y^2 - 160y = -y^2 + 40y + 2000.\]

If $z = x - 2y = -20$, then $x = 2y - 20$. Substituting this into the expression $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$, we get:
\[5(2y-20)^2 + 5y^2 - 8y(2y-20) = 20y^2 - 200y + 2000 + 5y^2 - 16y^2 + 160y = -y^2 - 40y + 2000.\]

Both of these expressions are quadratic functions of $y$, and they have the same shape (a parabola opening downwards). To find the minimum value, we can find the vertex of the parabola. The vertex of a parabola $ay^2 + by + c$ is at $y = -\frac{b}{2a}$.

For $-y^2 + 40y + 2000$, the vertex is at $y = -\frac{40}{-2} = 20$, and the minimum value is $-20^2 + 40*20 + 2000 = -400 + 800 + 2000 = 2400$.

For $-y^2 - 40y + 2000$, the vertex is at $y = -\frac{-40}{-2} = -20$, and the minimum value is $-(-20)^2 - 40*(-20) + 2000 = -400 + 800 + 2000 = 2400$.

So in both cases, the minimum value of the expression $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ is 2400. The answer is: $2400$

 This problem is a bit tricky because it involves two parts: solving the equation $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$ and minimizing the expression $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ under the constraint given by the equation.

First, let's solve the equation $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$. This equation can be rewritten as $|x-2y| + |2y-x| = 40$. By the triangle inequality, $|a| + |b| \geq |a+b|$, so we have $|x-2y| + |2y-x| \geq |(x-2y) + (2y-x)| = 0$, which is a contradiction unless both $|x-2y|$ and $|2y-x|$ are zero. This means $x-2y = 0$ and $2y-x = 0$, which simplifies to $x = 2y$.

Now, substitute $x = 2y$ into the equation $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$, we get $|2y-2y| + |y-4y| = 40$, which simplifies to $|0| + |-3y| = 40$, or $3|y| = 40$. Solving for $y$, we get $|y| = \frac{40}{3}$, so $y = \pm \frac{40}{3}$. Since $x = 2y$, we have $x = \pm \frac{80}{3}$.

Now, let's minimize the expression $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ under the constraint $x = 2y$. Substitute $x = 2y$ into the expression, we get $5(2y)^2 + 5y^2 - 8(2y)y = 20y^2 + 5y^2 - 16y^2 = 9y^2$. Now, substitute $y = \pm \frac{40}{3}$ into the expression $9y^2$, we get $9\left(\frac{40}{3}\right)^2 = 9 \cdot \frac{1600}{9} = 1600$.

So the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ when $x$ and $y$ range over all real numbers such that $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$ is 1600.

Assistant:

 To solve this problem, we first observe that the expression $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ can be rewritten as $5(x^2-y^2)-8xy+10y^2 = 5(x-y)^2 + 2y^2$.

Now, let's consider the constraint $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$. By the triangle inequality, we have $|x-2y| + |y-2x| \geq |(x-2y) - (y-2x)| = |x-2y-y+2x| = |x-3y+2x| = |3x-3y| = 3|x-y|$.

So we have $3|x-y| = 40$, which implies $|x-y| = \frac{40}{3}$.

Now, let $t = x - y$, then $x = y + t$. Substitute this into the constraint equation, we get $|t| = \frac{40}{3}$.

The expression $5(x-y)^2 + 2y^2$ can be rewritten as $5t^2 + 2(y+t)^2 = 5t^2 + 2(y^2 + 2ty + t^2) = 7t^2 + 4ty + 2y^2$.

Substitute $t = \frac{40}{3}$, we get $7(\frac{40}{3})^2 + 4(\frac{40}{3})y + 2y^2 = \frac{7 \cdot 1600}{9} + \frac{160y}{3} + 2y^2$.

To minimize this expression, we take the derivative with respect to $y$ and set it to zero:

$\frac{d}{dy} (\frac{7 \cdot 1600}{9} + \frac{160y}{3} + 2y^2) = \frac{160}{3} + 4y = 0$.

Solving this equation, we get $y = -\frac{40}{3}$.

Substitute $y = -\frac{40}{3}$ into the equation $x = y + t$, we get $x = -\frac{40}{3} + \frac{40}{3} = 0$.

So the minimum value of the expression $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ occurs at $x = 0$ and $y = -\frac{40}{3}$.

Substitute $x = 0$ and $y = -\frac{40}{3}$ into the expression $5(x-y)^2 + 2y^2$, we get $5(0 - (-\frac{40}{3}))^2 + 2(-\frac{40}{3})^2 = 5(\frac{40}{3})^2 + 2(\frac{40}{3})^2 = \frac{7 \cdot 1600}{9} = \frac{11200}{9}$.

So the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ is $\frac{11200}{9}$. The answer is: $\frac{11200}{9}$

 This problem involves the use of the Cauchy-Schwarz inequality and the method of Lagrange multipliers. The given equation $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$ can be rewritten as $|x-2y| = |y-2x| = 20$, which implies $x-2y = \pm 20$ and $y-2x = \pm 20$. Solving these equations gives four possible pairs of $(x, y)$: $(10, 0)$, $(0, 10)$, $(-10, 0)$, and $(0, -10)$.

We substitute these four pairs into the expression $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ and calculate the values:

 To solve this problem, we can use the inequality $|a| + |b| \geq |a + b|$ for all real numbers $a$ and $b$. Applying this inequality to the given equation $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$, we get:

$$|x-2y| + |y-2x| \geq |(x-2y) + (y-2x)| = |-x - y| = |-(x+y)| = |x+y|.$$

So we have $|x+y| = 40$. Now let's consider the expression $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$. We can rewrite it as:

$$5x^2+5y^2-8xy = \frac{1}{2}((5x^2-8xy+8y^2) + (5y^2-8xy+8x^2)) = \frac{1}{2}((5(x-y)^2 + 8(x+y)^2)).$$

Since $|x+y| = 40$, we have:

$$5x^2+5y^2-8xy \geq \frac{1}{2}(5(0)^2 + 8(40)^2) = \frac{1}{2}(8 \cdot 1600) = 6400.$$

Equality occurs when $x = 2y$ and $y = 2x$, which implies $x = y = 0$. Therefore, the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ is $6400$. The answer is: $6400$

 This problem is a bit complex to solve directly using Python, but we can simplify it by using the inequality $|a| + |b| \geq |a + b|$. Applying this inequality to the given equation $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$, we get:

$|x-2y| + |y-2x| \geq |(x-2y) + (y-2x)| = |-x - y| = |-(x+y)| = |x+y|$

So, $|x+y| = 40$. Now, let $A = x+y$, then $x = A - y$. Substituting this into the original equation, we get:

$5(A - y)^2 + 5y^2 - 8(A - y)y = 5A^2 - 10Ay + 5y^2 + 5y^2 - 8Ay + 8y^2 = 5A^2 - 18Ay + 18y^2 = 5A^2 - 18Ay + 9y^2 + 9y^2 = (5A^2 - 18Ay + 9y^2) + 9y^2 = (5A^2 - 18Ay + 9y^2) + \frac{81}{4}A^2 - \frac{81}{4}A^2 + 9y^2 = (\sqrt{5}A - 3y)^2 + \frac{81}{4}A^2 - \frac{81}{4}A^2 + 9y^2 = (\sqrt{5}A - 3y)^2 + \frac{81}{4}A^2 - 9y^2$.

Now, we know that $|x+y| = 40$, so $A = x+y = 40$. Therefore, the minimum value of the original equation is achieved when $(\sqrt{5}A - 3y)^2 = 0$, which implies $\sqrt{5}A = 3y$. Since $A = 40$, we get $y = \frac{\sqrt{5}}{3} \cdot 40 = \frac{40\sqrt{5}}{3}$. Substituting this back into $x = A - y$, we get $x = 40 - \frac{40\sqrt{5}}{3} = \frac{120 - 40\sqrt{5}}{3}$.

Substituting $x = \frac{120 - 40\sqrt{5}}{3}$ and $y = \frac{40\sqrt{5}}{3}$ into the original equation, we get:

$5x^2 + 5y^2 - 8xy = 5\left(\frac{120 - 40\sqrt{5}}{3}\right)^2 + 5\left(\frac{40\sqrt{5}}{3}\right)^2 - 8\left(\frac{120 - 40\sqrt{5}}{3}\right)\left(\frac{40\sqrt{5}}{3}\right)$.

Calculating this value, we get approximately $-2000$. Therefore, the minimum value of the original equation is $-2000$.

So, the answer is $\boxed{-2000}$.

 To solve this problem, we can use the method of completing the square. First, let's rewrite the expression $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ as $(x^2-4xy+4y^2) + (y^2-8xy+16x^2) = (x-2y)^2 + (y-4x)^2$. Now, let's consider the constraint $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$. We can rewrite this as $|x-2y| + |2y-x| = 40$, which implies that $|x-2y| = 40 - |2y-x|$. Since the absolute value function is always non-negative, we can square both sides of the equation to get rid of the absolute values: $(x-2y)^2 = (40 - |2y-x|)^2$. Expanding both sides gives $x^2 - 4xy + 4y^2 = 1600 - 80|2y-x| + (2y-x)^2$. Rearranging terms, we have $5(x^2 - 4xy + 4y^2) = 1600 - 80|2y-x| + (2y-x)^2$. Now, notice that the left side is exactly the expression we are trying to minimize, $(x-2y)^2 + (y-4x)^2$. So, we have $5(x-2y)^2 + 5(y-4x)^2 = 1600 - 80|2y-x| + (2y-x)^2$. Since the left side is always non-negative, we can minimize the right side to minimize the left side. The minimum value of $1600 - 80|2y-x| + (2y-x)^2$ is achieved when $|2y-x| = 0$, which implies $x = 2y$. Substituting this into the constraint equation, we get $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = |x-2x| + |y-4x| = |x| + |-3x| = 40$. This simplifies to $4|x| = 40$, so $|x| = 10$. Thus, $x = \pm 10$. Since $x = 2y$, we have $y = \pm 5$. Now, substituting $x = 2y$ into the expression we are trying to minimize, we get $5(x-2y)^2 + 5(y-4x)^2 = 5(0)^2 + 5(-10)^2 = 500$. Therefore, the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ is 500 when $x = 2y$, $|x| = 10$, and $y = \pm 5$. The answer is: $500$
