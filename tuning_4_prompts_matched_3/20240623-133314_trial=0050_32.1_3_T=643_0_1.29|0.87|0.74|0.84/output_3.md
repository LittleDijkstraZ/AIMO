Assistant:

 The given equation is equal to zero when either $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$, or $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$.
The solutions of these equations are:
- For $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$: $\vert x + y \vert = 10$, which gives us the lines $x + y = 10$ and $x + y = -10$.
- For $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$: $\vert x - y \vert = 10$, which gives us the lines $x - y = 10$ and $x - y = -10$.
- For $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$: $\vert x \vert = 8$, which gives us the lines $x = 8$ and $x = -8$.
- For $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$: $\vert y \vert = 8$, which gives us the lines $y = 8$ and $y = -8$.
The points that satisfy these equations are the vertices of a square with side length 10. The area of this square is $10^2 = 100$. Therefore, the area of the convex polygon is 100 square units. The answer is: $100$

 The equation given is a product of two terms, which must be equal to zero for the entire expression to be zero. Therefore, either the first term is zero, or the second term is zero.

The first term is $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)$, and this equals zero if and only if $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. This implies that $x + y = \pm 10$ and $x - y = \pm 10$. Solving these equations gives us four lines: $x + y = 10$, $x + y = -10$, $x - y = 10$, and $x - y = -10$.

The second term is $((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2)$, and this equals zero if and only if $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$. This implies that $x = \pm 8$ and $y = \pm 8$. Solving these equations gives us four lines: $x = 8$, $x = -8$, $y = 8$, and $y = -8$.

The lines $x + y = 10$, $x + y = -10$, $x - y = 10$, and $x - y = -10$ enclose a square with side length 10. The lines $x = 8$, $x = -8$, $y = 8$, and $y = -8$ enclose a square with side length 16.

The intersection of the two squares is a smaller square with side length 8. Therefore, the area of the convex polygon is the area of the smaller square, which is $8^2 = 64$. The answer is: $64$

"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"

Assistant:

 The given equation is of the form $(A)(B) = 0$. This means that either $A = 0$ or $B = 0$. 

The equation $A = 0$ leads to $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + (\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$. This can only be true if $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. These conditions imply that $x + y = \pm 10$ and $x - y = \pm 10$. Solving these equations, we find that the points that satisfy $A = 0$ are $(5, 5)$, $(5, -5)$, $(-5, 5)$, and $(-5, -5)$. These form a square with side length 10. The area of this square is $10^2 = 100$.

The equation $B = 0$ leads to $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + (\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$. This can only be true if $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$. This implies that $x = \pm 8$ and $y = \pm 8$. Therefore, the points that satisfy $B = 0$ are $(8, 8)$, $(8, -8)$, $(-8, 8)$, and $(-8, -8)$. These also form a square with side length 16. The area of this square is $16^2 = 256$.

Since the given equation is true, either $A = 0$ or $B = 0$. Therefore, the points that satisfy the equation form the union of the two squares we found. The area of the convex polygon formed by these points is the sum of the areas of the two squares, which is $100 + 256 = 356$. 

So the area of the convex polygon is 356 square units. The answer is: $356$.

 The given equation is equal to zero, which implies that one or both of the factors are zero. The factors are $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2$ and $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2$ on the one hand, and $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2$ and $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2$ on the other hand. Each of these factors can be zero only when the expressions inside the absolute value are zero, i.e., $x + y = 0$, $x - y = 0$, $x = \pm 8$, and $y = \pm 8$. Solving these equations, we find the vertices of the polygon to be $(0, 0)$, $(8, 8)$, $(-8, 8)$, $(-8, -8)$, $(8, -8)$, $(8, 0)$. Plotting these points on a coordinate plane, we observe that they form a square with side length 16. The area of this square is $16^2 = 256$.
The answer is: $256$

 The given equation is $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$. For this equation to hold true, either of the two factors must be zero.

The first factor is zero when $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ or $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. These are the equations of two squares, centered at the origin, with side length 20.

The second factor is zero when $\vert x \vert = 8$ or $\vert y \vert = 8$. These are the equations of two squares, also centered at the origin, with side length 16.

The convex polygon enclosed by these points is the intersection of the two squares. This intersection forms a square with side length 8 (the smaller of the two squares' side lengths). The area of this square is $8^2 = 64$.

So the area of the convex polygon is 64. The answer is: $64$

"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"

Assistant:

 The given equation is $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$. The product of two numbers is zero if and only if at least one of the numbers is zero. Therefore, either $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$.
If $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$, then $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$, which means $x + y = \pm 10$ and $x - y = \pm 10$. Solving these equations gives $x = \pm 10, y = 0$ or $x = 0, y = \pm 10$.
If $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$, then $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$, which means $x = \pm 8$ and $y = \pm 8$.
The points that satisfy the conditions are $\left(10, 0\right)$, $\left(-10, 0\right)$, $\left(0, 10\right)$, $\left(0, -10\right)$, $\left(8, 8\right)$, $\left(-8, 8\right)$, $\left(8, -8\right)$, and $\left(-8, -8\right)$. These points form a square with side length 20, so its area is $20^2 = 400$. Therefore, the area of the convex polygon is 400.
The answer is: $400$.

 The equation $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + (\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ implies that $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$.
These conditions are only satisfied when $x = \pm 10$ and $y = \pm 10$.
Similarly, the equation $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + (\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ implies that $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$, which gives $x = \pm 8$ and $y = \pm 8$.

So the points $(x, y)$ that satisfy the equation are the vertices of a square with side length 20. To find the area of the square, we simply square the length of its side, so the area is $20^2 = 400$.

So the area of the convex polygon is $400$.

Here is Python code to calculate the area:

Assistant:

 The problem statement seems to be a bit tricky due to its mathematical jargon. However, by analyzing the problem, it can be seen that for the product of two terms to be zero, at least one of the terms must be zero. Therefore, we have two cases to consider:

Case 1: $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$
This implies that $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ or $\vert x - y \vert = 10$.

Case 2: $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$
This implies that $\vert x \vert = 8$ or $\vert y \vert = 8$.

Now, let's consider each case:

Case 1:
For $\vert x + y \vert = 10$, we have $x + y = 10$ or $x + y = -10$.
For $\vert x - y \vert = 10$, we have $x - y = 10$ or $x - y = -10$.

Case 2:
For $\vert x \vert = 8$, we have $x = 8$ or $x = -8$.
For $\vert y \vert = 8$, we have $y = 8$ or $y = -8$.

The solutions from these cases give us the coordinates of the vertices of the polygon:
(8,8), (8,-8), (-8,8), (-8,-8), (10,0), (-10,0), (0,10), (0,-10).

Now we can plot these points on a coordinate plane to visualize the polygon:
The polygon is a square with side length 16.

The area of the square can be found by squaring the length of one side:
Area = $16^2 = 256$.
The answer is: $256$

Below is a math problem you are to solve (positive numerical answer!):
"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"

 To solve this problem, we need to first understand the properties of absolute values and the given equation, and then analyze the geometry of the points enclosed by the equation.

The equation $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ equals to 0 if and only if either of the two terms equals to 0. This implies that either $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$.

For the first term to equal to 0, we must have $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. This forms a square with side length of 10 units.

For the second term to equal to 0, we must have $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$. This forms a square with side length of 16 units.

Therefore, the points enclosed by the equation are the union of two squares. To find the area of this region, we simply add the areas of the two squares.

The area of a square is given by side length squared. The side length of the first square is 10 units, so its area is $10^2 = 100$ square units. The side length of the second square is 16 units, so its area is $16^2 = 256$ square units.

Adding the areas of the two squares gives the total area of the region: $100 + 256 = 356$ square units. So the area of the convex polygon is $356$ square units. The answer is: $356$

This problem is asking for the area of a polygon formed by the set of points that satisfy the given equation. The equation is $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$. The product of two numbers is zero if and only if one or both of the numbers are zero. So, the given equation is satisfied if either $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$, $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$, $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$, or $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$. Each of these conditions implies that $|x+y|=10$, $|x-y|=10$, $|x|=8$, or $|y|=8$. 

From $|x+y|=10$, we get the lines $x+y=10$ and $x+y=-10$. 
From $|x-y|=10$, we get the lines $x-y=10$ and $x-y=-10$. 
From $|x|=8$, we get the lines $x=8$ and $x=-8$. 
From $|y|=8$, we get the lines $y=8$ and $y=-8$. 

The set of points satisfying any of these conditions forms a square with side length 16. The area of this square is $16^2 = 256$. So, the area of the convex polygon formed by these points is 256 square units.
