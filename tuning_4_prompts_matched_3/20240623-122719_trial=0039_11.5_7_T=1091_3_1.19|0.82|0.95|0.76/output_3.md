"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"

Approach:



The equation $AB = 0$ is satisfied if and only if $A = 0$ or $B = 0$. Therefore, the given equation is equivalent to the following two equations:

1. $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$
2. $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$

For equation 1 to be true, it must be that both $\vert x + y \vert - 10 = 0$ and $\vert x - y \vert - 10 = 0$, which implies $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. This results in a square with side length 10 units, centered at the origin.

For equation 2 to be true, it must be that both $\vert x \vert - 8 = 0$ and $\vert y \vert - 8 = 0$, which implies $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$. This results in a square with side length 16 units, centered at the origin.

However, the square formed by equation 1 has side length 10 units, while the square formed by equation 2 has side length 16 units. Since these two squares have the same center, the intersection of the two squares forms a smaller square that is the convex polygon in question. The side length of this smaller square is the minimum of the side lengths of the two larger squares, which is 10 units.

The area of a square is given by the square of the side length, so the area of the convex polygon is $10^2 = 100$ square units. The answer is: $100$

Solve the following problem with a Python Script (positive numerical answer):
"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"

Approach:


The given equation is a product of two expressions equal to zero, which implies that either of the expressions must be zero for the entire equation to hold true. Therefore, we can break the problem into two cases:

Case 1: $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$
Case 2: $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$

In case 1, the only way for the sum of two squares to be zero is if each square is zero. This implies that $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. Solving these absolute value equations gives us four lines: $x + y = 10$, $x + y = -10$, $x - y = 10$, and $x - y = -10$. These lines form a rectangle with side lengths of 20 units in the x and y directions.

In case 2, the only way for the sum of two squares to be zero is if each square is zero. This implies that $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$. Solving these absolute value equations gives us four lines: $x = 8$, $x = -8$, $y = 8$, and $y = -8$. These lines form a square with side lengths of 16 units.

However, the area of the square formed by case 2 is entirely contained within the rectangle formed by case 1. Therefore, the convex polygon formed by the intersection of the two cases is the square from case 2.

Calculate the area of the square: The area of a square is given by the square of the length of its side. The side length of the square is 16 units, so its area is $16^2 = 256$ square units.

So, the area of the convex polygon is 256 square units.

The answer is: $256$

Approach:



The given equation is a product of two terms being equal to zero. This means that either the first term is zero or the second term is zero. Let's consider each case separately:

1. If $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$, then $\vert x + y \vert = 10$, which implies that $x + y = \pm 10$.
2. If $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$, then $\vert x - y \vert = 10$, which implies that $x - y = \pm 10$.
3. If $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$, then $\vert x \vert = 8$, which implies that $x = \pm 8$.
4. If $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$, then $\vert y \vert = 8$, which implies that $y = \pm 8$.

Now, let's solve these equations for $x$ and $y$:

1. $x + y = \pm 10$.
2. $x - y = \pm 10$.
3. $x = \pm 8$.
4. $y = \pm 8$.

The solutions to these equations are the vertices of the convex polygon. The polygon is a square with side length 16 (since the maximum value of $x$ or $y$ is 8 and the distance between the lines $x = \pm 8$ and $y = \pm 8$ is 16).

The area of the square is side length squared, which is $16^2 = 256$.
The answer is: $256$

Solve the following problem with a Python Script (positive numerical answer):
"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"

Approach:

 The given equation is $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$. For the product of two terms to be zero, either both terms must be zero or one term is zero and the other term is not defined.

1. If $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$, then $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. This gives us a square with side length 10. The area of the square is $10^2 = 100$.

2. If $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$, then $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$. This gives us a square with side length 16. The area of the square is $16^2 = 256$.

However, the points satisfying both conditions are the vertices of the square formed by the intersection of the two squares. The intersection of the two squares is also a square, with side length equal to the smaller of the two side lengths, which is 10. The area of this square is $10^2 = 100$.

So, the area of the convex polygon formed by the points satisfying the given equation is 100 square units. The answer is: $\boxed{100}$

Approach:


The given equation is a product of two terms equals to zero. This means that either one of the terms is zero or both terms are zero. 

Let's consider each term separately:

1. $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ implies $\vert x + y \vert = 10$. This means $x + y = 10$ or $x + y = -10$.
2. $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ implies $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. This means $x - y = 10$ or $x - y = -10$.
3. $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ implies $\vert x \vert = 8$. This means $x = 8$ or $x = -8$.
4. $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ implies $\vert y \vert = 8$. This means $y = 8$ or $y = -8$.

By combining these conditions, we can find the vertices of the polygon:

- If $x = 8$ and $y = 8$, then $x + y = 16$ and $x - y = -8$, which satisfies the conditions $x + y = 10$ and $x - y = -10$. So, one vertex is $(8, 8)$.
- If $x = 8$ and $y = -8$, then $x + y = 0$ and $x - y = 16$, which does not satisfy any of the conditions.
- If $x = -8$ and $y = 8$, then $x + y = 0$ and $x - y = -16$, which does not satisfy any of the conditions.
- If $x = -8$ and $y = -8$, then $x + y = -16$ and $x - y = 16$, which satisfies the conditions $x + y = -10$ and $x - y = 10$. So, another vertex is $(-8, -8)$.

The two vertices of the polygon are $(8, 8)$ and $(-8, -8)$. These two points form a square with side length 16. The area of this square is $16^2 = 256$. 

Therefore, the area of the convex polygon is 256 square units. The answer is: $256$

"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"
Write comments to indicate the steps you take. Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Assistant:

Approach:


The expression is equal to zero if either $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$.
This gives us the following four sets of equations:
1) $\vert x + y \vert = 10$
2) $\vert x - y \vert = 10$
3) $\vert x \vert = 8$
4) $\vert y \vert = 8$

For equations 3 and 4, we get four lines: $x = 8$, $x = -8$, $y = 8$, and $y = -8$.

For equations 1 and 2, we get four more lines: $x + y = 10$, $x + y = -10$, $x - y = 10$, and $x - y = -10$.

These eight lines enclose a rectangle with side lengths of 16 and 20. The area of the rectangle is $16 \times 20 = 320$.
The answer is: $\boxed{320}$

Assistant:

Approach:


The given equation is of the form $(A)(B) = 0$, which means that either $A = 0$ or $B = 0$. Let's analyze each part separately.

For $A = 0$, we have:
$$((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2) = 0.$$
This means that $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. The only way this can happen is if $x = y = 5$ or $x = -y = -5$. This gives us two points $(5,5)$ and $(-5,-5)$.

For $B = 0$, we have:
$$((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0.$$
This means that $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$. The only way this can happen is if $x = 8$ or $x = -8$, and $y = 8$ or $y = -8$. This gives us four points $(8,8)$, $(8,-8)$, $(-8,8)$, and $(-8,-8)$.

These eight points form a square with side length $10$. The area of a square is given by the square of the length of its side. So, the area of this square is $10^2 = 100$.
The answer is: $100$

Approach:

 The expression $A \cdot B = 0$ implies that either $A = 0$ or $B = 0$. Therefore, the given equation is satisfied if either of the following two sets of equations are satisfied:
1. $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ and $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 \neq 0$.
2. $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 \neq 0$ and $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$.

For the first set of equations, both $\vert x + y \vert - 10 = 0$ and $\vert x - y \vert - 10 = 0$ which implies $x + y = \pm 10$ and $x - y = \pm 10$. This results in four lines $x + y = \pm 10$ and $x - y = \pm 10$. The intersection points of these lines are $(10, 0)$, $(0, 10)$, $(-10, 0)$ and $(0, -10)$.

For the second set of equations, both $\vert x \vert - 8 = 0$ and $\vert y \vert - 8 = 0$ which implies $x = \pm 8$ and $y = \pm 8$. This results in four lines $x = \pm 8$ and $y = \pm 8$. The intersection points of these lines are $(8, 8)$, $(8, -8)$, $(-8, 8)$ and $(-8, -8)$.

So the polygon is a square with side length $20$. The area of the square is $20^2 = 400$. The answer is: $400$

"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"
Write comments to indicate the steps you take. Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Approach:

 The given equation implies that either $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$.
If $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$, then $\vert x + y \vert = 10$, which means $x + y = \pm 10$.
Similarly, if $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$, then $\vert x - y \vert = 10$, which means $x - y = \pm 10$.
If $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$, then $\vert x \vert = 8$, which means $x = \pm 8$.
If $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$, then $\vert y \vert = 8$, which means $y = \pm 8$.
Combining these conditions, we can deduce that the points satisfying the equation are the vertices of a square with side length 10.
Therefore, the area of this convex polygon is the area of the square, which is $10 \times 10 = 100$.
The answer is: $\boxed{100}$.
