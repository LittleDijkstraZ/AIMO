Approach:


We can use the Cauchy-Schwarz inequality to solve this problem. The Cauchy-Schwarz inequality states that for any real numbers $a_1, a_2, ..., a_n$ and $b_1, b_2, ..., b_n$, we have
$$(a_1b_1 + a_2b_2 + ... + a_nb_n)^2 \leq (a_1^2 + a_2^2 + ... + a_n^2)(b_1^2 + b_2^2 + ... + b_n^2).$$

In this problem, we can let $a_1 = x - 2y$, $a_2 = y - 2x$, $b_1 = 1$, and $b_2 = 1$. Then, by the Cauchy-Schwarz inequality, we have
$$(a_1b_1 + a_2b_2)^2 \leq (a_1^2 + a_2^2)(b_1^2 + b_2^2) = (x - 2y)^2 + (y - 2x)^2.$$

Also, we know that $|a_1b_1 + a_2b_2| = |x - 2y + y - 2x| = |-x - y| = |x + y| = 20$. So, we have
$$(x + y)^2 = 400.$$
Expanding this, we get
$$x^2 + 2xy + y^2 = 400.$$

Now, we substitute this into the expression $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$:
$$5x^2+5y^2-8xy = 5(x^2 + y^2) - 8xy = 5(400 - 2xy) - 8xy = 2000 - 18xy.$$

To minimize this expression, we need to maximize $xy$. From the equation $x^2 + 2xy + y^2 = 400$, we can express $xy$ in terms of $x^2 + y^2$:
$$xy = \frac{1}{2}(x^2 + y^2 - 400).$$

Substituting this into the expression $2000 - 18xy$, we get
$$2000 - 18xy = 2000 - 18\left(\frac{1}{2}(x^2 + y^2 - 400)\right) = 2000 - 9(x^2 + y^2 - 400) = 2000 - 9x^2 - 9y^2 + 3600 = -9(x^2 + y^2) + 5600.$$

To maximize $-9(x^2 + y^2)$, we need to minimize $x^2 + y^2$. From the equation $x^2 + 2xy + y^2 = 400$, we know that $x^2 + y^2 = 400 - 2xy$. To minimize $x^2 + y^2$, we need to maximize $xy$. By the Cauchy-Schwarz inequality, the maximum value of $xy$ is achieved when $x = 2y$ or $y = 2x$. Without loss of generality, let's consider $x = 2y$. Then, from the equation $x^2 + 2xy + y^2 = 400$, we have
$$(2y)^2 + 2(2y)(y) + y^2 = 400 \Rightarrow 4y^2 + 4y^2 + y^2 = 400 \Rightarrow 9y^2 = 400 \Rightarrow y^2 = \frac{400}{9}.$$
Then, $x^2 = 4y^2 = \frac{1600}{9}$, so $x^2 + y^2 = \frac{2000}{9}$. Substituting this into the expression $-9(x^2 + y^2) + 5600$, we get
$$-9\left(\frac{2000}{9}\right) + 5600 = -2000 + 5600 = 3600.$$

Therefore, the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ is 3600. The answer is: 3600

We can first rewrite the equation $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$ as $|2x-y| + |2y-x| = 40$ by simply rearranging the terms. 

Now, let's substitute $a = 2x - y$ and $b = 2y - x$. Then we have $|a| + |b| = 40$. 

By the triangle inequality, we know that $|a| + |b| \geq |a + b|$. So we have $|a + b| \leq 40$.

Now let's substitute back $a = 2x - y$ and $b = 2y - x$, we have $|2x - y + 2y - x| \leq 40$, which simplifies to $|x + y| \leq 40$.

Now, let's consider the expression $5x^2 + 5y^2 - 8xy = \frac{1}{2}(5x^2 + 5y^2 - 8xy) + \frac{1}{2}(5x^2 + 5y^2 - 8xy) = \frac{1}{2}((5x^2 + 8xy + 5y^2) + (5x^2 - 8xy + 5y^2)) = \frac{1}{2}((5x + 4y)^2 + (3x - 4y)^2)$.

By the Cauchy-Schwarz inequality, we know that $(a^2 + b^2)(c^2 + d^2) \geq (ac + bd)^2$, where $a, b, c, d$ are real numbers. 

Applying this to our expression, we have $((5x + 4y)^2 + (3x - 4y)^2) \geq (|5x + 4y| + |3x - 4y|)^2$.

We know from above that $|5x + 4y| + |3x - 4y| \leq 40$, so $((5x + 4y)^2 + (3x - 4y)^2) \geq 40^2 = 1600$.

Therefore, the minimum value of $5x^2 + 5y^2 - 8xy$ is $\frac{1}{2} \cdot 1600 = 800$.
The answer is: $\boxed{800}$

To minimize the expression $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ under the condition $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$, we first need to express the condition in a simpler form. Let's start by simplifying $|x-2y| + |y-2x|$:

$|x-2y| + |y-2x| = |x-2y| + |2y-x| = |x-2y| - |x-2y| = 0$.

However, this is a contradiction because $0$ is not equal to $40$. To resolve this issue, let's consider the conditions under which the absolute value expressions will be equal to zero. The absolute value of a quantity is zero if and only if the quantity itself is zero. So we have:

1. $x - 2y = 0 \implies x = 2y$.
2. $y - 2x = 0 \implies y = 2x$.

Both conditions lead to the same relationship between $x$ and $y$, namely $x = 2y$ or equivalently $y = \frac{x}{2}$. Now we can substitute this relationship into the expression we want to minimize:

$5x^2+5y^2-8xy = 5x^2+5\left(\frac{x}{2}\right)^2-8x\left(\frac{x}{2}\right) = 5x^2+\frac{5x^2}{4}-4x^2 = \frac{15x^2}{4}$.

To minimize this expression, we need to minimize $x^2$ since it is being multiplied by a positive coefficient. The minimum value of $x^2$ is $0$ (achieved when $x=0$), but we cannot have $x=0$ because then $y=0$ and $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = |0| + |0| = 0$, which is not equal to $40$. So, let's consider the next smallest possible value of $x^2$, which is achieved when $x$ is as close to $0$ as possible but not equal to $0$. This happens when $x$ is very small (or very large but with the same sign as $y$), and in this case, $|x-2y|$ (or $|y-2x|$) is approximately equal to $|x|$. Since $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$, we have $|x| + |2x| = 40$, which simplifies to $3|x| = 40$. Thus, $|x| = \frac{40}{3}$. Now we can substitute this value into the expression we want to minimize:

$\frac{15x^2}{4} = \frac{15\left(\frac{40}{3}\right)^2}{4} = \frac{15\cdot\frac{1600}{9}}{4} = \frac{2400}{9}$.

So the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ is $\frac{2400}{9}$.

However, we made an error in our reasoning: when we substituted $y = \frac{x}{2}$ into the expression we wanted to minimize, we should have considered that the absolute value expressions could potentially change their sign when $x$ and $y$ cross the boundary determined by the relationship $x = 2y$ (or $y = \frac{x}{2}$). To account for this, we should actually consider the case when $y = -\frac{x}{2}$ and repeat the process of minimizing the expression under the condition $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$. After doing this, we find that the minimum value of the expression in both cases is the same, which is $\frac{2400}{9}$.

Therefore, the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ when $x$ and $y$ range over all real numbers such that $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$ is $\frac{2400}{9}$. The answer is: $\boxed{\frac{2400}{9}}$

This problem involves a function of two variables $x$ and $y$, and a constraint equation $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$. To solve this problem, we can use the method of Lagrange multipliers.

Let's define a new function $F(x, y, \lambda) = 5x^2+5y^2-8xy - \lambda(|x-2y| + |y-2x| - 40)$. We want to find the critical points of this function, which means we need to find the points where the gradient of $F$ is zero. That is, $\nabla F(x, y, \lambda) = (0, 0, 0)$.

After taking the gradient of $F$ and setting each component to zero, we can solve the resulting system of equations to find the critical points of $F$. Then we can evaluate the function $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ at each of these critical points to find the minimum value.

After solving the system of equations and evaluating the function at the critical points, we find that the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ is -100.

So, the minimum value of the function $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ subject to the constraint $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$ is -100. The answer is: $-100$

Approach:


We can rewrite the given equation as $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$ and notice that $|x-2y| = |-(2x-y)|$ and $|y-2x| = |-(2x-y)|$. This implies that $|x-2y| = |2x-y|$ and we can square both sides to get $(x-2y)^2 = (2x-y)^2$. Expanding both sides gives $x^2 - 4xy + 4y^2 = 4x^2 - 4xy + y^2$, which simplifies to $3x^2 - 3y^2 = 0$. This further simplifies to $x^2 - y^2 = 0$, which implies $(x+y)(x-y) = 0$. So either $x+y = 0$ or $x-y = 0$.
If $x+y = 0$, then $y = -x$. Substituting this into the given equation $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$ gives $|x+2x| + |-x-2x| = 40$, or $|3x| + |-3x| = 40$, which simplifies to $6x = 40$, or $x = \frac{20}{3}$. So $y = -\frac{20}{3}$.
If $x-y = 0$, then $y = x$. Substituting this into the given equation $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$ gives $|x-2x| + |x-2x| = 40$, or $|-x| + |-x| = 40$, which simplifies to $2|x| = 40$, or $|x| = 20$. So $x = 20$ and $y = 20$.
Now we substitute these values into the expression $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ to find its minimum value. If $x = \frac{20}{3}$ and $y = -\frac{20}{3}$, we get
\[5\left(\frac{20}{3}\right)^2 + 5\left(-\frac{20}{3}\right)^2 - 8\left(\frac{20}{3}\right)\left(-\frac{20}{3}\right) = \frac{2000}{9}.\]
If $x = 20$ and $y = 20$, we get
\[5(20)^2 + 5(20)^2 - 8(20)(20) = 2000.\]
Since $\frac{2000}{9} < 2000$, the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ is $\frac{2000}{9}$. The answer is:
\[
\boxed{\frac{2000}{9}}
\]

Approach:



First, we note that $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$ is equivalent to $|x-2y| = 20$ and $|y-2x| = 20$. This is because the absolute value of a number plus the absolute value of another number is always greater than or equal to the absolute value of their sum, and in this case it is exactly 40. So we have two cases:

Case 1: $x-2y = 20$ and $y-2x = 20$. Solving these equations gives $x = 10$ and $y = -5$.

Case 2: $x-2y = -20$ and $y-2x = -20$. Solving these equations gives $x = -10$ and $y = 5$.

Now, we substitute these values into the expression $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ to find its minimum value. We get:

For case 1: $5(10)^2 + 5(-5)^2 - 8(10)(-5) = 500 + 125 + 400 = 1025$.
For case 2: $5(-10)^2 + 5(5)^2 - 8(-10)(5) = 500 + 125 + 400 = 1025$.

So the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ is 1025. The answer is: $1025$.

Approach:


To find the minimum value of the expression $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ subject to the constraint $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$, we can use the Cauchy-Schwarz inequality. 

First, we rewrite the constraint as $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 2|x-2y| = 40$, so $|x-2y| = 20$. Then, by the Cauchy-Schwarz inequality,
\[(1+4)(x^2+y^2) \geq (x+2y)^2.\]
Substituting $|x-2y| = 20$, we have
\[(x+2y)^2 = (x-2y)^2 + 4(2x)(2y) = 400 + 16xy \leq (1+4)(x^2+y^2) = 5(x^2+y^2).\]
So, $x^2+y^2 \geq \frac{400+16xy}{5}$.

Now, we substitute this into the expression $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$:
\[5x^2+5y^2-8xy = 5(x^2+y^2) - 8xy \geq 5\cdot\frac{400+16xy}{5} - 8xy = 400 + 16xy - 8xy = 400 + 8xy.\]
Since $|x-2y| = 20$, we know that $x-2y$ is either 20 or -20. Without loss of generality, let $x-2y = 20$. Then $x = 2y + 20$. Substituting this into the expression $8xy$, we have
\[8xy = 8(2y+20)y = 16y^2 + 160y.\]
Now, we complete the square:
\[16y^2 + 160y = 16(y^2 + 10y) = 16\left(y^2 + 10y + \left(\frac{10}{2}\right)^2 - \left(\frac{10}{2}\right)^2\right) = 16\left((y+5)^2 - 25\right) = 16(y+5)^2 - 400.\]
So, $8xy = 16(y+5)^2 - 400$. Substituting this into the inequality $5x^2+5y^2-8xy \geq 400 + 8xy$, we have
\[5x^2+5y^2-8xy \geq 400 + 16(y+5)^2 - 400 = 16(y+5)^2.\]
Since $(y+5)^2 \geq 0$, we have $16(y+5)^2 \geq 0$. Therefore, the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ is 0.

Therefore, the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ when $x$ and $y$ range over all real numbers such that $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$ is 0. The answer is: $0$

Assistant:

Approach:


To solve this problem, we first notice that the given equation $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$ is a condition on $x$ and $y$, and the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ is what we want to find.

First, we simplify the condition $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$. We have $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = |x-2y| + |2y-x| = |x-2y| - |x-2y| = 0$, which is a contradiction. So, there must be a mistake in our reasoning.

We then realize that we have made a mistake in the simplification. The correct simplification should be $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = |x-2y| + |2(x-y)| = |x-2y| - 2|x-y| = 0$. This implies $|x-2y| = 2|x-y|$. Squaring both sides, we get $(x-2y)^2 = 4(x-y)^2$. Simplifying, we get $x^2 - 4xy + 4y^2 = 4x^2 - 8xy + 4y^2$, which simplifies to $3x^2 = 4xy$. If $x=0$, then $y$ can be any real number. If $x \neq 0$, then $y = \frac{3}{4}x$.

Substituting $y = \frac{3}{4}x$ into the expression $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$, we get $5x^2+5(\frac{3}{4}x)^2-8x(\frac{3}{4}x) = 5x^2+\frac{225}{16}x^2-6x^2 = \frac{169}{16}x^2$. The minimum value of $\frac{169}{16}x^2$ occurs when $x=0$, and the minimum value is $0$.

Therefore, the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ when $x$ and $y$ range over all real numbers such that $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$ is $0$. The answer is: $0$

Solve the following problem with a Python Script (positive numerical answer):
"What is the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ when $x$ and $y$ range over all real numbers such that $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$?"
Write comments to indicate the steps you take. Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Assistant:

Approach:

 To solve this problem, we first note that the condition $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$ is equivalent to $|x-2y| = |y-2x| = 20$. This can be shown by considering the cases where $x-2y$ and $y-2x$ have the same sign and opposite sign separately.

Next, we use the fact that $|a| = |b|$ implies $a^2 = b^2$. So we have
\[(x-2y)^2 = (y-2x)^2.\]
Expanding and simplifying gives $3x^2 - 12xy + 3y^2 = 0$. We can rewrite this as $x^2 - 4xy + y^2 = 0$.

Now, let's define a new variable $z = x + y$. Then $x = \frac{z+y}{2}$ and $y = \frac{z-x}{2}$. Substituting these into the equation $x^2 - 4xy + y^2 = 0$ gives
\[\left(\frac{z+y}{2}\right)^2 - 4\left(\frac{z+y}{2}\right)\left(\frac{z-y}{2}\right) + \left(\frac{z-x}{2}\right)^2 = 0.\]
Simplifying this gives $z^2 - 4xy = 0$, or $xy = \frac{z^2}{4}$.

We also know that $x^2 + y^2 = (x + y)^2 - 2xy = z^2 - \frac{z^2}{2} = \frac{z^2}{2}$.

Now, we substitute $xy = \frac{z^2}{4}$ into the expression $5x^2 + 5y^2 - 8xy$ to get
\[5\left(\frac{z^2}{2}\right) - 8\left(\frac{z^2}{4}\right) = \frac{5z^2}{2} - \frac{2z^2}{1} = \frac{z^2}{2}.\]

To minimize this expression, we need to minimize $z^2$. Since $|x - 2y| + |y - 2x| = 40$ implies $x^2 + y^2 = 100$, we have $z^2 = (x + y)^2 = (2x)^2 + (2y)^2 = 4(x^2 + y^2) = 400$.

So, the minimum value of $\frac{z^2}{2}$ is $\frac{400}{2} = 200$.
The answer is: 200

Assistant:

Approach:


We can start by using the condition $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$.
By applying the triangle inequality, we know that $|a+b| \leq |a| + |b|$ for all real numbers $a$ and $b$.
So we can rewrite the condition as:
$|x-2y| + |y-2x| = |x-2y| + |2x-y| \leq |(x-2y) + (2x-y)| = |3x-3y| = 3|x-y| = 40$.
This implies $|x-y| = \frac{40}{3}$.
Now let's consider the expression $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$.
We can rewrite it as $5(x^2+y^2) - 8xy = 5[(x-y)^2 + 2xy] - 8xy = 5(x-y)^2 + 3xy$.
We know that $(x-y)^2 \geq 0$, so $5(x-y)^2 \geq 0$.
Also, we know that $|x-y| = \frac{40}{3}$, so $-|x-y| \leq xy \leq |x-y|$.
Therefore, we can find the minimum value of $3xy$ when $xy$ is at its maximum value, which occurs when $xy = |x-y|^2 = \left(\frac{40}{3}\right)^2 = \frac{1600}{9}$.
So the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ is $5(x-y)^2 + 3xy = 5\cdot 0 + 3\cdot \frac{1600}{9} = \frac{4800}{9}$.
The minimum value of the expression $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ when $x$ and $y$ range over all real numbers such that $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$ is $\frac{4800}{9}$.
The answer is: $\frac{4800}{9}$

Approach:

 To solve this problem, we can use the method of completing the square and the inequality $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$. The inequality gives us a restriction on the values of $x$ and $y$. First, we will rewrite the given expression $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ as $\frac{5}{2}(x^2 - \frac{8}{5}xy + y^2) + \frac{5}{2}(y^2 - \frac{8}{5}yx + x^2)$ and then complete the square.

Solution: We start by completing the square for the expression inside the first parentheses:

\[x^2 - \frac{8}{5}xy + y^2 = (x - \frac{4}{5}y)^2 - \frac{16}{25}y^2.\]

Similarly, for the expression inside the second parentheses:

\[y^2 - \frac{8}{5}yx + x^2 = (y - \frac{4}{5}x)^2 - \frac{16}{25}x^2.\]

Substituting these back into the original expression, we get:

\[\frac{5}{2}[(x - \frac{4}{5}y)^2 - \frac{16}{25}y^2] + \frac{5}{2}[(y - \frac{4}{5}x)^2 - \frac{16}{25}x^2] = \frac{5}{2}(x - \frac{4}{5}y)^2 + \frac{5}{2}(y - \frac{4}{5}x)^2 - 8xy.\]

Now we know that $(x - \frac{4}{5}y)^2 \geq 0$ and $(y - \frac{4}{5}x)^2 \geq 0$, so the minimum value of the expression $\frac{5}{2}(x - \frac{4}{5}y)^2 + \frac{5}{2}(y - \frac{4}{5}x)^2$ is 0, which occurs when $x = \frac{4}{5}y$ and $y = \frac{4}{5}x$. Substituting these values into the inequality $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$, we find that they satisfy the inequality.

Therefore, the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ under the condition $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$ is $-8xy$ when $x = \frac{4}{5}y$ and $y = \frac{4}{5}x$.

To find the minimum value of $-8xy$ when $x = \frac{4}{5}y$ and $y = \frac{4}{5}x$, we substitute these values into $-8xy$:

\[-8xy = -8 \cdot \frac{4}{5}y \cdot \frac{4}{5}x = -8 \cdot \frac{16}{25}xy = -\frac{128}{25}xy.\]

Since $x = \frac{4}{5}y$ and $y = \frac{4}{5}x$, we have $x = \frac{4}{5} \cdot \frac{4}{5}x$, so $x = \frac{16}{25}x$. Thus, $x = 0$ or $x = \frac{25}{9}$. But if $x = \frac{25}{9}$, then $y = \frac{20}{9}$, and $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$ is not satisfied. So we must have $x = 0$. Similarly, we find that $y = 0$. But this would make the expression $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ equal to 0, which is not the minimum value.

However, we can substitute $x = \frac{4}{5}y$ into the inequality $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$:

\[| \frac{4}{5}y - 2y | + | y - 2 \cdot \frac{4}{5}y | = | -\frac{6}{5}y | + | -\frac{2}{5}y | = \frac{8}{5}y = 40.\]

So $y = \frac{25}{2}$. Substituting $y = \frac{25}{2}$ into $x = \frac{4}{5}y$, we get $x = 10$. Then, the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ is:

\[5(10)^2 + 5(\frac{25}{2})^2 - 8(10)(\frac{25}{2}) = 500 + \frac{3125}{2} - 1000 = -\frac{25}{2}.\]

However, this is not possible since the minimum value of a quadratic expression should be a real number.

Let's check the value of the expression $-8xy$ when $x = \frac{4}{5}y$ and $y = \frac{4}{5}x$:

\[-8xy = -8 \cdot \frac{4}{5}y \cdot \frac{4}{5}x = -\frac{128}{25}xy.\]

But $x = \frac{4}{5}y$ and $y = \frac{4}{5}x$, so we have $x = \frac{4}{5} \cdot \frac{4}{5}x$, which implies $x = 0$ or $x = \frac{25}{9}$. But if $x = \frac{25}{9}$, then $y = \frac{20}{9}$, and $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$ is not satisfied. So we must have $x = 0$. Similarly, we find that $y = 0$. But this would make the expression $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ equal to 0, which is not the minimum value.

However, we can substitute $x = \frac{4}{5}y$ into the inequality $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$:

\[| \frac{4}{5}y - 2y | + | y - 2 \cdot \frac{4}{5}y | = | -\frac{6}{5}y | + | -\frac{2}{5}y | = \frac{8}{5}y = 40.\]

So $y = \frac{25}{2}$. Substituting $y = \frac{25}{2}$ into $x = \frac{4}{5}y$, we get $x = 10$. Then, the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^

Approach:

 To solve this problem, we will first use the given condition $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$ to simplify it and find a relation between $x$ and $y$. Then we substitute this relation into the expression $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ and use the formula for the square of a real number to find the minimum value.

Step 1: Simplify the condition $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$. We can rewrite the absolute value as:
\[|x-2y| = \begin{cases} x-2y, & \text{if } x \ge 2y \\ -(x-2y), & \text{if } x < 2y \end{cases}\]
and
\[|y-2x| = \begin{cases} y-2x, & \text{if } y \ge 2x \\ -(y-2x), & \text{if } y < 2x \end{cases}\]
By considering all possible combinations of $x$ and $y$ satisfying the inequalities, we can simplify the condition as:
\[(x-2y) + (2x-y) = 40 \Rightarrow 3x - 3y = 40 \Rightarrow x - y = \frac{40}{3}.\]

Step 2: Substitute $x - y = \frac{40}{3}$ into the expression $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$. We have:
\[5x^2+5y^2-8xy = 5(x^2 + y^2 - \frac{8}{5}xy) = 5[(x - y)^2 + \frac{3}{5}xy] = 5[(\frac{40}{3})^2 + \frac{3}{5}\cdot \frac{40}{3}y] = 5[\frac{1600}{9} + \frac{40}{3}y].\]

Step 3: To find the minimum value of the expression, we need to find the minimum value of the expression inside the brackets. Since this is a linear function in $y$, the minimum value occurs at the extreme point of the function. The function is minimized when $y = 0$, at which point the value of the function is $5\cdot \frac{1600}{9} = \frac{8000}{9}$.

So the minimum value of the expression $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ is $\frac{8000}{9}$.

The answer is: $\frac{8000}{9}$

Approach:



First, let's find the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ under the condition $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$.

We can rewrite the condition as $|x-2y| + |2y-x| = 40$, which simplifies to $|x-2y| + |x-2y| = 40$. This gives $2|x-2y| = 40$, or $|x-2y| = 20$.

Now, we can use the fact that $|x-2y|$ is the distance between the points $(x, y)$ and $(2y, y)$ in the $xy$-plane. This means that the set of all points $(x, y)$ satisfying the condition is a line segment with endpoints at $(2y, y) \pm (20, 0)$.

So, $(x, y)$ lies on the line segment with endpoints $(2y+20, y)$ and $(2y-20, y)$.

Now, we substitute $x = 2y \pm 20$ into the expression $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ and simplify.

If $x = 2y + 20$, we get
\begin{align*}
5(2y+20)^2+5y^2-8(2y+20)y &= 5(4y^2+80y+400)+5y^2-16y^2-160y \\
&= 20y^2+400y+2000+5y^2-16y^2-160y \\
&= -y^2+240y+2000.
\end{align*}

If $x = 2y - 20$, we get
\begin{align*}
5(2y-20)^2+5y^2-8(2y-20)y &= 5(4y^2-80y+400)+5y^2-16y^2+160y \\
&= 20y^2-400y+2000+5y^2-16y^2+160y \\
&= -y^2-240y+2000.
\end{align*}

Both of these expressions are quadratic functions in $y$, and their graphs are parabolas opening downwards. Therefore, the minimum value of each expression occurs at the vertex of the parabola.

For $-y^2+240y+2000$, the $y$-coordinate of the vertex is $-\frac{240}{2} = 120$. Substituting this into the expression gives $-120^2+240\cdot120+2000 = 2000$.

For $-y^2-240y+2000$, the $y$-coordinate of the vertex is $-\frac{-240}{2} = 120$. Substituting this into the expression gives $-120^2-240\cdot120+2000 = 2000$.

So, the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ under the condition is 2000.

Therefore, the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ when $x$ and $y$ range over all real numbers such that $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$ is 2000.
The answer is: 2000

Assistant:

Approach:


The given equation is $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$. We can simplify this equation by noting that $|a-b| = |b-a|$, so $|x-2y| = |2x-y|$. Thus, we can rewrite the equation as $|x-2y| + |2x-y| = 40$.

Now, we can use the property of absolute values that $|a| + |b| = |a+b|$ if $a$ and $b$ have the same sign, or $|a| + |b| = |a-b|$ if $a$ and $b$ have opposite signs. Applying this property, we can rewrite the equation as $|x-2y+2x-y| = 40 \Rightarrow |3x-3y| = 40 \Rightarrow |x-y| = \frac{40}{3}$.

Now, we are given the expression $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$. We can rewrite this as $5(x^2+y^2) - 8xy = 5[(x-y)^2 + 2xy] - 8xy$. We know from the equation $|x-y| = \frac{40}{3}$ that $(x-y)^2 \ge 0$ and therefore $(x-y)^2 \ge \left(\frac{40}{3}\right)^2$. Thus, $2xy \ge -\left(\frac{40}{3}\right)^2$.

Substituting this into the expression for $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$, we get $5[(x-y)^2 + 2xy] - 8xy \ge 5\left[\left(\frac{40}{3}\right)^2 - \left(\frac{40}{3}\right)^2\right] - 8\left(-\left(\frac{40}{3}\right)^2\right) = -\left(\frac{40}{3}\right)^2$. Thus, the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ is $-\left(\frac{40}{3}\right)^2$.

However, this is not the correct minimum value. The correct approach is to complete the square for the expression $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$. Completing the square gives us $(3x-4y)^2 - 20y^2$. This is always nonnegative since $(3x-4y)^2 \ge 0$ and $-20y^2 \le 0$. Therefore, the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ is 0.

However, the equation $|x-2y| + |2x-y| = 40$ has no solution if $x=y$. Therefore, the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ when $x=y$ is not 0. To find the minimum value, we need to find the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ when $x \neq y$. We know that $|x-y| = \frac{40}{3}$, so $x-y = \pm \frac{40}{3}$. Without loss of generality, let's assume $x-y = \frac{40}{3}$. Then $y = x - \frac{40}{3}$. Substituting this into the expression $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$, we get $5x^2 + 5\left(x - \frac{40}{3}\right)^2 - 8x\left(x - \frac{40}{3}\right)$.

Now, we can take the derivative of this expression with respect to $x$ and set it equal to 0 to find the minimum value. The derivative is $10x - \frac{80}{3} - 8x + \frac{320}{3} = 2x + \frac{240}{3} = 2x + 80$. Setting this equal to 0, we get $2x + 80 = 0 \Rightarrow x = -40$. Substituting this into the expression $y = x - \frac{40}{3}$, we get $y = -40 - \frac{40}{3} = -\frac{160}{3}$.

Substituting $x = -40$ and $y = -\frac{160}{3}$ into the expression $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$, we get $5(-40)^2 + 5\left(-\frac{160}{3}\right)^2 - 8(-40)\left(-\frac{160}{3}\right) = 0$. Thus, the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ when $x$ and $y$ range over all real numbers such that $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$ is 0.
The answer is: 0
