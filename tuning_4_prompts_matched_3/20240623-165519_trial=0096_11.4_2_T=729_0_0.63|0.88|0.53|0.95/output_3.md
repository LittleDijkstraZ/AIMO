Below is a math problem you are to solve (positive numerical answer!):
"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"
Analyze this problem and think step by step to come to a solution with programs. After solving the problem, output the final numerical answer within \boxed{}.

Assistant:

 The given equation is $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$. For the product of two numbers to be zero, either one of the numbers must be zero. Therefore, we have two cases:

1. $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$. This implies that both $\vert x + y \vert - 10 = 0$ and $\vert x - y \vert - 10 = 0$, which means $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. Solving these equations gives us the lines $x + y = \pm10$ and $x - y = \pm10$.

2. $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$. This implies that both $\vert x \vert - 8 = 0$ and $\vert y \vert - 8 = 0$, which means $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$. Solving these equations gives us the lines $x = \pm8$ and $y = \pm8$.

The four lines $x + y = \pm10$, $x - y = \pm10$, $x = \pm8$, and $y = \pm8$ form a rectangle. The length of the rectangle is $20$ (from $-10$ to $10$ on the $x + y$ or $x - y$ lines) and the width is $16$ (from $-8$ to $8$ on the $x$ or $y$ lines). Therefore, the area of the rectangle is $20 \times 16 = 320$. So the area of the convex polygon is $320$. The answer is: $320$

The given equation is a product of two expressions equal to zero. Therefore, either the first expression is zero or the second expression is zero.

The first expression is $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)$, and it equals zero if and only if both $\vert x + y \vert - 10 = 0$ and $\vert x - y \vert - 10 = 0$. This implies that $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. The only way this can happen is if $x = \pm 10$ and $y = \pm 10$. So the first expression gives us a square with side length 20.

The second expression is $((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2)$, and it equals zero if and only if both $\vert x \vert - 8 = 0$ and $\vert y \vert - 8 = 0$. This implies that $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$. The only way this can happen is if $x = \pm 8$ and $y = \pm 8$. So the second expression gives us a square with side length 16.

The intersection of these two squares is a smaller square with side length 8. The area of a square is given by the square of the side length, so the area of the smaller square is $8^2 = 64$. The area of the convex polygon is the sum of the areas of the two squares minus the area of the smaller square, which is $20^2 + 16^2 - 8^2 = 400 + 256 - 64 = 592$.

So the area of the convex polygon is 592. The answer is: $592$

Below is a math problem you are to solve (positive numerical answer!):
"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"
Analyze this problem and think step by step to come to a solution with programs. After solving the problem, output the final numerical answer within \boxed{}.

Assistant:

 The equation is satisfied if and only if both $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ and $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$, or both $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ and $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$.
The first set of conditions implies $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$, which means $x + y = \pm 10$ and $x - y = \pm 10$.
Solving these equations gives $x = 0$ and $y = \pm 10$ or $x = \pm 10$ and $y = 0$.
The second set of conditions implies $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$, which means $x = \pm 8$ and $y = \pm 8$.
Combining these solutions, we find that the points $(x, y)$ satisfying the equation are $(0, 10), (0, -10), (10, 0), (-10, 0), (8, 8), (8, -8), (-8, 8),$ and $(-8, -8)$.
These points form a square with side length 10, so the area of the convex polygon is $10^2 = 100$.
The answer is: $100$

 The given equation is a product of two expressions equal to zero. This means that either the first expression is zero or the second expression is zero. 

The first expression is $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)$. This expression is zero if and only if both $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. These two equations represent two squares with side length 10, one centered at the origin with its sides parallel to the x and y axes, and the other centered at the origin with its sides parallel to the lines $y = x$ and $y = -x$. The intersection of these two squares forms a square with side length 10 and centered at the origin.

The second expression is $((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2)$. This expression is zero if and only if both $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$, which represents a square with side length 16 and centered at the origin.

The points that satisfy both expressions being zero are the points that lie on the intersection of the two squares, which is a square with side length 8 (since the side length of the square formed by the intersection of the two squares is the difference of the side lengths of the two squares, which is $10 - 2 = 8$).

The area of this square is $8^2 = 64$. Therefore, the area of the convex polygon is 64 square units. The answer is: $64$

 The given equation is a product of two expressions equal to zero, so it is equal to zero when either of the expressions is zero. This means that the points that satisfy the equation are the union of the points that satisfy each expression separately.

The expression $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ implies that $\vert x + y \vert = 10$, which means $x + y = \pm 10$. These are the equations of two lines.

The expression $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ implies that $\vert x - y \vert = 10$, which means $x - y = \pm 10$. These are the equations of two more lines.

The expression $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ implies that $\vert x \vert = 8$, which means $x = \pm 8$. These are the equations of two vertical lines.

The expression $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ implies that $\vert y \vert = 8$, which means $y = \pm 8$. These are the equations of two horizontal lines.

The intersection of these lines form a square with side length 16 (the distance between the lines $x = 8$ and $x = -8$, or $y = 8$ and $y = -8$).

The area of this square is $16^2 = 256$. So, the area of the convex polygon is 256.

Here is a Python code to calculate the area of the square:

```python

 The equation given is a product of two terms equal to zero, which means that either of the terms must be zero. This gives us two sets of equations to solve:

1. $\vert x + y \vert - 10 = 0$ and $\vert x - y \vert - 10 = 0$
2. $\vert x \vert - 8 = 0$ and $\vert y \vert - 8 = 0$

For the first set of equations, we have $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. This implies that $x + y = \pm 10$ and $x - y = \pm 10$. Solving these equations gives us the vertices of the square formed by the lines $x + y = 10$, $x + y = -10$, $x - y = 10$, and $x - y = -10$. The side length of this square is $20\sqrt{2}$, so the area is $(20\sqrt{2})^2 = 800$.

For the second set of equations, we have $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$. This implies that $x = \pm 8$ and $y = \pm 8$. Solving these equations gives us the vertices of the square formed by the lines $x = 8$, $x = -8$, $y = 8$, and $y = -8$. The side length of this square is 16, so the area is $16^2 = 256$.

The convex polygon formed by the union of these two squares is a larger square with side length $20\sqrt{2} + 16$. The area of this larger square is $(20\sqrt{2} + 16)^2$.

However, we are asked for the area of the convex polygon enclosed by the points, which is the difference between the area of the larger square and the sum of the areas of the two smaller squares. So the area of the convex polygon is $(20\sqrt{2} + 16)^2 - 800 - 256$.

The numerical area of the convex polygon is approximately 905.1 square units. However, this is not the correct answer. The problem is that we have made a mistake in our calculations. Let's go back and re-examine the problem and our solution.

The equation given is a product of two terms equal to zero, which means that either of the terms must be zero. This gives us two sets of equations to solve:

1. $\vert x + y \vert - 10 = 0$ and $\vert x - y \vert - 10 = 0$
2. $\vert x \vert - 8 = 0$ and $\vert y \vert - 8 = 0$

For the first set of equations, we have $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. This implies that $x + y = \pm 10$ and $x - y = \pm 10$. Solving these equations gives us the vertices of the square formed by the lines $x + y = 10$, $x + y = -10$, $x - y = 10$, and $x - y = -10$. The side length of this square is $20\sqrt{2}$, so the area is $(20\sqrt{2})^2 = 800$.

For the second set of equations, we have $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$. This implies that $x = \pm 8$ and $y = \pm 8$. Solving these equations gives us the vertices of the square formed by the lines $x = 8$, $x = -8$, $y = 8$, and $y = -8$. The side length of this square is 16, so the area is $16^2 = 256$.

The convex polygon formed by the union of these two squares is a larger square with side length $20\sqrt{2} + 16$. The area of this larger square is $(20\sqrt{2} + 16)^2$.

However, we are asked for the area of the convex polygon enclosed by the points, which is the difference between the area of the larger square and the sum of the areas of the two smaller squares. So the area of the convex polygon is $(20\sqrt{2} + 16)^2 - 800 - 256$.

Let's correct this and re-calculate the area of the

 The equation $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + (\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ implies that $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. This means that $x + y = \pm 10$ and $x - y = \pm 10$. Solving these four equations, we get the vertices of the square as $(8, 2)$, $(8, -2)$, $(-8, -2)$, and $(-8, 2)$.

Similarly, the equation $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + (\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ implies that $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$. This means that $x = \pm 8$ and $y = \pm 8$. So, the vertices of the square are $(8, 8)$, $(8, -8)$, $(-8, -8)$, and $(-8, 8)$.

The convex polygon formed by the intersection of these two squares is a square with side length 8. The area of this square is $8^2 = 64$.

So, the area of the convex polygon is 64 square units. The answer is: $64$

The given equation is a product of two terms equal to zero, so either the first term is zero or the second term is zero.

The first term is zero when $|x+y| = 10$ and $|x-y| = 10$. This implies that $x+y = \pm 10$ and $x-y = \pm 10$. Solving these equations gives the vertices of the polygon as $(0, 10), (0, -10), (10, 0), (-10, 0)$.

The second term is zero when $|x| = 8$ and $|y| = 8$. This implies that $x = \pm 8$ and $y = \pm 8$. Solving these equations gives the vertices of the polygon as $(8, 8), (8, -8), (-8, 8), (-8, -8)$.

The convex polygon formed by these vertices is a square with side length 10. The area of a square is given by the square of its side length, so the area of the polygon is $10^2 = 100$.

So the area of the convex polygon is 100. The answer is: $100$

The given equation is a product of two expressions equal to zero. This means that either the first expression is zero or the second expression is zero. 

The first expression is $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)$. This expression is zero if and only if both $\vert x + y \vert - 10 = 0$ and $\vert x - y \vert - 10 = 0$. This implies that $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. The only way this can happen is if $x = y = 5$ or $x = -y = -5$.

The second expression is $((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2)$. This expression is zero if and only if both $\vert x \vert - 8 = 0$ and $\vert y \vert - 8 = 0$. This implies that $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$. The only way this can happen is if $x = 8$ or $x = -8$ and $y = 8$ or $y = -8$.

So the points that satisfy the equation are $(5, 5)$, $(5, -5)$, $(8, 8)$, and $(-8, -8)$. These points form a square with side length $10$. The area of this square is $10^2 = 100$.

So the area of the convex polygon is $100$.
