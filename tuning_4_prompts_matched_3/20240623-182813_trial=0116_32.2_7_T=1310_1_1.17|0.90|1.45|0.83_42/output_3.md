Interesting, let's analyze step by step:



1. The problem provides an equation and asks for the area of the polygon that it encloses. 
2. The equation is a product of two terms, which are each a sum of two absolute value expressions squared. 
3. Setting a product to zero means that at least one of the terms must be zero.
4. So, we have two cases to consider:
   a. Either $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$
      b. Either $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$
5. The equation $(\vert a \vert - b)^2 = 0$ implies $\vert a \vert = b$. Therefore, we have the following four cases:
   a. $\vert x + y \vert = 10$
      b. $\vert x - y \vert = 10$
      c. $\vert x \vert = 8$
      d. $\vert y \vert = 8$
6. We can solve these four equations to find the coordinates $(x, y)$ that satisfy them.

To solve these equations, we need to consider four cases:
- When $x + y = \pm 10$ and $x - y = \pm 10$, we get four lines.
- When $x = \pm 8$ and $y = \pm 8$, we get four lines.

The intersection points of these lines are the vertices of the polygon. Once we find the vertices, we can calculate the area of the polygon.

To find the area, we can simply plot the points and use a polygon area formula. However, since the shape is a square, we can simply find the side length and square it. The side length is the maximum distance between the origin and the lines $\vert x + y \vert = 10$, $\vert x - y \vert = 10$, $\vert x \vert = 8$, and $\vert y \vert = 8$. The maximum distance is 8$\sqrt{2}$ (from the origin to the line $\vert x \vert = 8$), so the area is $(8\sqrt{2})^2 = 128$.

The area of the convex polygon is 128. The answer is: $128$

The product of two numbers equals to zero if and only if at least one of the numbers is zero. Thus the original equation is equivalent to the union of the following two sets of equations:

1) $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ and $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ and $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$.
2) $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$

For the first set of equations we have $\vert x + y \vert = 10$, $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$. This gives us the vertices of a rectangle with sides $16$ and $20$.

For the second set of equations we have $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. This represents the diagonals of the rectangle.

Therefore we have a rectangle with side lengths $16$ and $20$. The area of the rectangle is $16 \times 20 = 320$. The positive integer area of the convex polygon is $320$. The answer is: $320$

Interesting, let's analyze step by step:



The equation $A * B = 0$ implies that either $A = 0$ or $B = 0$. So, the given equation is satisfied if any of the following is true:

1. $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$
2. $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$
3. $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$
4. $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$

From 1. and 2., we get $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. These imply that $x + y = \pm 10$ and $x - y = \pm 10$. Solving these equations for $x$ and $y$, we find the vertices of the polygon to be: $(10, 0)$, $(0, 10)$, $(-10, 0)$, $(0, -10)$, $(10, -20)$, $(-10, 20)$, $(-10, -20)$, $(10, 20)$.

From 3. and 4., we get $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$. These imply that $x = \pm 8$ and $y = \pm 8$. Adding these vertices to our list, we have: $(8, 8)$, $(8, -8)$, $(-8, 8)$, $(-8, -8)$.

So, the points that satisfy the equation are the vertices of a polygon with vertices at $(10, 0)$, $(0, 10)$, $(-10, 0)$, $(0, -10)$, $(10, -20)$, $(-10, 20)$, $(-10, -20)$, $(10, 20)$, $(8, 8)$, $(8, -8)$, $(-8, 8)$, $(-8, -8)$.

Now, let's plot these points on a graph and calculate its area. The polygon formed is a square with side length $20$. The area of the square is $20^2 = 400$.

So, the area of the convex polygon is $400$. To verify that this is a positive integer, we can check that the area is not zero. And indeed, the area of the polygon is 400, which is a positive integer. The answer is: $400$

Interesting, let's analyze step by step:



The condition of the problem is $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$.

This equation is equal to 0 if and only if both terms are equal to 0. So we have two cases:
1) $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ and $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 \neq 0$,
2) $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ and $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 \neq 0$.

For the first case, $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x \vert \neq 8$, $\vert y \vert \neq 8$. This means $x$ and $y$ must be between $-10$ and $10$.
For the second case, $\vert x - y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x \vert \neq 8$, $\vert y \vert \neq 8$. This means $x$ and $y$ must be between $-10$ and $10$.

In both cases, we see that $x$ and $y$ must be between $-10$ and $10$. The points that satisfy the equation form a square with side length $20$, so the area of this square is $20^2 = 400$. Therefore, the area of the convex polygon is 400 square units.
The answer is: $400$.

Interesting, let's analyze step by step:



The equation $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ implies that $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$, which means $x + y = \pm10$ and $x - y = \pm10$. 

Solving these equations for $x$ and $y$, we have four possible cases:

1. $x + y = 10$ and $x - y = 10$, which gives $x = 10$ and $y = 0$.
2. $x + y = 10$ and $x - y = -10$, which gives $x = 0$ and $y = 10$.
3. $x + y = -10$ and $x - y = 10$, which gives $x = 0$ and $y = -10$.
4. $x + y = -10$ and $x - y = -10$, which gives $x = -10$ and $y = 0$.

The equation $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ implies that $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$, which means $x = \pm8$ and $y = \pm8$.

So the possible points are $(10, 0)$, $(0, 10)$, $(0, -10)$, $(-10, 0)$, $(8, 8)$, $(-8, 8)$, $(8, -8)$, and $(-8, -8)$. These points form a square with side length $20$.

To find the area of the square, we simply square the side length: $20^2 = 400$.

Therefore, the area of the convex polygon is $400$.

The value $400$ is indeed a positive integer, so the area of the convex polygon is $\boxed{400}$.
The answer is: $\boxed{400}$

Interesting, let's analyze step by step:



Step 1: The math problem is a product of two quadratic expressions equals zero. This product can only equal zero if at least one of the expressions equals zero. Therefore, we have two cases:
- $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0 \Rightarrow \vert x + y \vert = 10$
- $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0 \Rightarrow \vert x - y \vert = 10$
- $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0 \Rightarrow \vert x \vert = 8$
- $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0 \Rightarrow \vert y \vert = 8$

Step 2: Solve each equation for $x$ and $y$ separately:
- For $\vert x + y \vert = 10$, $x + y = 10$ or $x + y = -10$
- For $\vert x - y \vert = 10$, $x - y = 10$ or $x - y = -10$
- For $\vert x \vert = 8$, $x = 8$ or $x = -8$
- For $\vert y \vert = 8$, $y = 8$ or $y = -8$

Step 3: Create a grid with all possible combinations of $x$ and $y$ from the above solutions. Then plot the points on a graph and connect the points to form the polygon.

Step 4: To find the area of the polygon, we can use the shoelace formula. The shoelace formula is used to find the area of a polygon given the coordinates of its vertices. For this polygon, we can list its vertices as:
- $(8, 8)$
- $(8, -8)$
- $(-8, -8)$
- $(-8, 8)$

Step 5: Plug the coordinates into the shoelace formula to calculate the area:
\[Area = \frac{1}{2} \vert (8*8 + 8*(-8) + (-8)*(-8) + (-8)*8) \vert = \frac{1}{2} \vert (64 - 64 + 64 - 64) \vert = \frac{1}{2} \vert 0 \vert = 0\]

However, the area of a polygon cannot be zero, so we must have made an error somewhere. Let's go back and check our work.

Step 6: Upon reexamination, we realize our mistake: the product of two expressions equals zero does not necessarily mean each expression equals zero. We need to find the intersection points of the two pairs of equations. Let's try again:

Intersection of $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$:
- If $x + y = 10$ and $x - y = 10$, we can solve these equations simultaneously to get $x = 10$ and $y = 0$.
- If $x + y = 10$ and $x - y = -10$, we can solve these equations simultaneously to get $x = 0$ and $y = 10$.
- If $x + y = -10$ and $x - y = 10$, we can solve these equations simultaneously to get $x = 0$ and $y = -10$.
- If $x + y = -10$ and $x - y = -10$, we can solve these equations simultaneously to get $x = -10$ and $y = 0$.

Step 7: These intersection points give us the vertices of the polygon:
- $(10, 0)$
- $(0, 10)$
- $(0, -10)$
- $(-10, 0)$

Step 8: Now we can use the shoelace formula again to calculate the area:
\[Area = \frac{1}{2} \vert (10*10 + 0*(-10) + (-10)*0 + 0*10) \vert = \frac{1}{2} \vert (100 + 0 + 0 + 0) \vert = \frac{1}{2} \vert 100 \vert = 50\]

Step 9: The area of the polygon is 50 square units, and it is a positive integer. The answer is $\boxed{50}$.

Interesting, let's analyze step by step:



The given equation is equal to zero. The only way this is possible is if either of the two products in the equation are zero. That is:
$$ ((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2) = 0 \quad \text{or} \quad ((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0 $$

For the first expression to be equal to zero, both terms must be zero:
$$ \vert x + y \vert - 10 = 0 \quad \text{and} \quad \vert x - y \vert - 10 = 0 $$
which implies
$$ \vert x + y \vert = 10 \quad \text{and} \quad \vert x - y \vert = 10 $$

For the second expression to be equal to zero, both terms must be zero:
$$ \vert x \vert - 8 = 0 \quad \text{and} \quad \vert y \vert - 8 = 0 $$
which implies
$$ \vert x \vert = 8 \quad \text{and} \quad \vert y \vert = 8 $$

From the above, we can deduce that the polygon is formed by the points that satisfy either of these conditions. 

When $\vert x + y \vert = 10$, this forms a square with side length $10$ in the plane. 
The vertices of this square are $(8,2)$, $(8,-2)$, $(-8,2)$, and $(-8,-2)$.

When $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$, this forms a square with side length $16$ in the plane. 
The vertices of this square are $(8,8)$, $(8,-8)$, $(-8,8)$, and $(-8,-8)$.

The convex polygon formed by the intersection of these two squares is a square with side length $10$.

Therefore, the area of the convex polygon is the square of the side length, which is $10^2 = 100$. 

Hence, the area of the convex polygon is $100$ square units.
The answer is: $100$

1. The product of two numbers is zero if and only if at least one of the numbers is zero. Hence, the points that satisfy the equation must satisfy either $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$.
2. Each of these equations simplifies to $\vert x + y \vert = 10$, $\vert x - y \vert = 10$, $\vert x \vert = 8$, or $\vert y \vert = 8$.
3. The equations $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$ describe squares with side length 20 centered at the origin.
4. The equations $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$ describe squares with side length 16 centered at the origin.
