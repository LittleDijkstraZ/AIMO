Question (hint: positive numerical answer):
"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"
Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:


The expression $A \cdot B = 0$ means that at least one of the expressions $A$ or $B$ must be zero. So, we have two cases to consider:

Case 1: $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$. This means that $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. This gives us four lines: $x + y = 10$, $x + y = -10$, $x - y = 10$, and $x - y = -10$. These lines form a square with side length $10\sqrt{2}$.

Case 2: $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$. This means that $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$. This gives us four lines: $x = 8$, $x = -8$, $y = 8$, and $y = -8$. These lines form a square with side length $16$.

The intersection of the two squares is the convex polygon we are looking for. The area of the convex polygon is the area of the smaller square. The side length of the smaller square is the smaller of the side lengths of the two squares, which is $10\sqrt{2}$. Therefore, the area of the convex polygon is $(10\sqrt{2})^2 = 200$. The answer is: $200$

Question (hint: positive numerical answer):
"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"
Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:


The expression equals zero if either $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$, or if either $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$.
This means that either $\vert x + y \vert = 10$, $\vert x - y \vert = 10$, $\vert x \vert = 8$, or $\vert y \vert = 8$.
The absolute value equations can be split into two cases each:
1. If $\vert x + y \vert = 10$, then $x + y = 10$ or $x + y = -10$.
2. If $\vert x - y \vert = 10$, then $x - y = 10$ or $x - y = -10$.
3. If $\vert x \vert = 8$, then $x = 8$ or $x = -8$.
4. If $\vert y \vert = 8$, then $y = 8$ or $y = -8$.
Combining all the cases, we get the following vertices for the polygon: $(8,8)$, $(8,-8)$, $(-8,8)$, $(-8,-8)$, $(10,0)$, $(-10,0)$, $(0,10)$, and $(0,-10)$.
The polygon is a square with side length 16, so its area is $16^2 = 256$. The answer is: $256$

Question (hint: positive numerical answer):
"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"
Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:



The product of two numbers is zero if and only if at least one of the numbers is zero. So, the equation $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ is satisfied if either of the following two conditions is met:

1. $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$.
2. $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$.

For the first condition to be true, both $\vert x + y \vert - 10 = 0$ and $\vert x - y \vert - 10 = 0$. This means $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. The only way for both of these to be true is if $x = \pm 10$ and $y = \pm 10$. This gives us four points: $(10, 10)$, $(10, -10)$, $(-10, 10)$, and $(-10, -10)$.

For the second condition to be true, both $\vert x \vert - 8 = 0$ and $\vert y \vert - 8 = 0$. This means $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$. The only way for both of these to be true is if $x = \pm 8$ and $y = \pm 8$. This gives us four more points: $(8, 8)$, $(8, -8)$, $(-8, 8)$, and $(-8, -8)$.

So, the points that satisfy the equation are the eight points: $(10, 10)$, $(10, -10)$, $(-10, 10)$, $(-10, -10)$, $(8, 8)$, $(8, -8)$, $(-8, 8)$, and $(-8, -8)$.

These eight points form a square with side length 16 (from $(-8, 8)$ to $(8, 8)$ or from $(10, 10)$ to $(-10, -10)$), so the area of the square is $16^2 = 256$. The answer is: $\boxed{256}$.

Question (hint: positive numerical answer):
"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"
Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:



The expression $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ is true if and only if either $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$.

If $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$, then $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. This means that $x + y = \pm 10$ and $x - y = \pm 10$. Solving these equations gives us the points $(5,5)$, $(5,-5)$, $(-5,5)$, and $(-5,-5)$.

If $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$, then $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$. This means that $x = \pm 8$ and $y = \pm 8$. Solving these equations gives us the points $(8,8)$, $(8,-8)$, $(-8,8)$, and $(-8,-8)$.

So the points that satisfy the given equation are $(5,5)$, $(5,-5)$, $(-5,5)$, $(-5,-5)$, $(8,8)$, $(8,-8)$, $(-8,8)$, and $(-8,-8)$. These points form a square with side length $10$. The area of this square is $10^2 = 100$.
The answer is: $100$

Question (hint: positive numerical answer):
"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"
Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:



The expression $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2)$ is equal to zero if and only if both $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ and $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$, or both $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ and $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$. 

This happens if and only if $|x + y| = 10$ and $|x| = 8$ and $|y| = 8$, or $|x - y| = 10$ and $|x| = 8$ and $|y| = 8$.

The equation $|x + y| = 10$ represents a square with side length 10 centered at the origin. The equation $|x - y| = 10$ also represents a square with side length 10 centered at the origin. The equation $|x| = 8$ represents a square with side length 16 centered at the origin. The equation $|y| = 8$ also represents a square with side length 16 centered at the origin.

The intersection of these four squares is a square with side length 10, which is the convex polygon enclosed by the points satisfying the given equation.

The area of this square is $10^2 = 100$.

So, the area of the convex polygon is 100. The answer is: $100$

Question (hint: positive numerical answer):
"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"
Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:


The expression $A \cdot B = 0$ means that either $A = 0$ or $B = 0$. Therefore, the given equation is satisfied if either of the following two conditions holds:

1. $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2) = 0$ or
2. $((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$

For the first condition to be true, we must have both $\vert x + y \vert - 10 = 0$ and $\vert x - y \vert - 10 = 0$. This implies that $x + y = 10$ and $x - y = 10$ or $x + y = 10$ and $x - y = -10$. The first pair of equations has no solutions, and the second pair gives $x = 5$ and $y = 5$.

For the second condition to be true, we must have both $\vert x \vert - 8 = 0$ and $\vert y \vert - 8 = 0$. This implies that $x = 8$ and $y = 8$.

So, the vertices of the polygon are $(5, 5)$ and $(8, 8)$. The polygon is a square with side length 3 (because the distance between $(5, 5)$ and $(8, 8)$ is $\sqrt{(8 - 5)^2 + (8 - 5)^2} = \sqrt{9 + 9} = \sqrt{18} = 3\sqrt{2}$, and we know that the square's side length is an integer, so it must be 3). Therefore, the area of the square is $3^2 = 9$. The answer is: $9$

Step-by-step Solution:


The product of two numbers is zero if and only if at least one of the numbers is zero. So, we have two cases to consider:

Case 1: $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$.
This means $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ or $\vert x - y \vert = 10$.
The absolute value equations can be split into two separate cases:
For $\vert x + y \vert = 10$, we have $x + y = 10$ or $x + y = -10$.
For $\vert x - y \vert = 10$, we have $x - y = 10$ or $x - y = -10$.
These four lines form a square with side length 10. The vertices of the square are $(5, 5)$, $(5, -5)$, $(-5, -5)$, and $(-5, 5)$.

Case 2: $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$.
This means $\vert x \vert = 8$ or $\vert y \vert = 8$.
The absolute value equations can be split into two separate cases:
For $\vert x \vert = 8$, we have $x = 8$ or $x = -8$.
For $\vert y \vert = 8$, we have $y = 8$ or $y = -8$.
These four lines form a square with side length 16. The vertices of the square are $(8, 8)$, $(8, -8)$, $(-8, -8)$, and $(-8, 8)$.

The area of the convex polygon is the sum of the areas of the two squares. The area of a square is side length squared, so the area of the smaller square is $10^2 = 100$ and the area of the larger square is $16^2 = 256$. Therefore, the total area of the convex polygon is $100 + 256 = 356$.
The answer is: $356$

"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"
Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:


The equation $A \cdot B = 0$ implies that either $A = 0$ or $B = 0$. Therefore, the given equation is satisfied if either of the following two conditions holds:
(i) $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$, or
(ii) $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$.

For (i) to hold, we must have $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. These four lines are the sides of a square with side length 10.

For (ii) to hold, we must have $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$. These four lines are the sides of a square with side length 8.

Therefore, the given equation encloses the union of two squares, one with side length 8 and the other with side length 10. The area of the convex polygon is the sum of the areas of these two squares, which is $8^2 + 10^2 = 64 + 100 = 164$. The answer is: $164$

Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:



The product of two numbers is zero if and only if at least one of the numbers is zero. So, we have two cases to consider:

1) $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$. This implies that $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ or $\vert x - y \vert = 10$.

2) $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$. This implies that $\vert x \vert = 8$ or $\vert y \vert = 8$.

From the first case, we have $x + y = \pm 10$ or $x - y = \pm 10$. These are the equations of four lines. From the second case, we have $x = \pm 8$ or $y = \pm 8$. These are the equations of four more lines.

The intersection points of these lines are the vertices of the polygon. By drawing these lines on a graph, we find that the polygon is a square with side length 16. The area of a square is given by the square of the length of its side, so the area of the polygon is $16^2 = 256$.
The answer is: $256$

Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:


The expression $AB = 0$ is equivalent to $A = 0$ or $B = 0$. So the given equation is equivalent to either $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$.

The first equation implies $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$, which simplifies to $x + y = \pm 10$ and $x - y = \pm 10$. Solving these four equations gives us the vertices of the square: $(8,2)$, $(8,-2)$, $(-8,2)$, and $(-8,-2)$.

The second equation implies $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$, which simplifies to $x = \pm 8$ and $y = \pm 8$. This gives us the vertices of the square: $(8,8)$, $(8,-8)$, $(-8,8)$, and $(-8,-8)$.

The two squares overlap to form a larger square with side length $10\sqrt{2}$. The area of this square is $(10\sqrt{2})^2 = 200$. So the area of the convex polygon is $200$. The answer is: $200$

"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"
Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:



The equation $AB=0$ implies that $A=0$ or $B=0$. So the given equation is equivalent to either $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2=0$ or $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$.

The equation $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2=0$ implies that $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. The only way this is possible is if $x = \pm 10$ and $y = \pm 10$.

The equation $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ implies that $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$, so $x = \pm 8$ and $y = \pm 8$.

So the polygon is a square with side length $20$, and its area is $20^2 = 400$. The answer is: $400$.

Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:


The expression $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ is true if and only if either $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$.
The first equation is true if and only if $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. These two equations imply that $x = 0$ and $y = 0$.
The second equation is true if and only if $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$. These two equations imply that the points $(x, y)$ lie on a square with side length 16.
Therefore, the points satisfying the given equation form a square with side length 16. The area of this square is $16^2 = 256$. The answer is: $256$
