 To solve this problem, we first need to understand the equation given. The equation is of the form $A \cdot B = 0$. This means that either $A=0$ or $B=0$. In this case, either $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$.
If $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$, then $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. This gives us a square with side length 20. The area of this square is $20^2 = 400$.
If $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$, then $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$. This gives us a square with side length 16. The area of this square is $16^2 = 256$.
The convex polygon formed by the intersection of these two squares is also a square. Its side length is the minimum of the side lengths of the two squares, which is 16. The area of this square is $16^2 = 256$. Therefore, the area of the convex polygon is 256. The answer is: $256$

The problem statement is a bit confusing, but it seems to be asking for the area of the unit square with vertices at $(8,8)$, $(-8,8)$, $(-8,-8)$, and $(8,-8)$.
The area of this square can be calculated by multiplying the length of one side by itself. The length of one side is 16 (8 units in both the x and y directions), so the area is $16 \times 16 = 256$. However, since we are only interested in the positive numerical answer, the area of the convex polygon is 256 square units.

    side_length = 16
    area = side_length ** 2

Below is a math problem you are to solve (positive numerical answer!):
"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"

The given equation is $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$.
This equation is satisfied only when both factors are zero.
The first factor is zero when $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$,
which implies that $x + y = \pm 10$ and $x - y = \pm 10$.
Solving these equations gives us four lines: $x + y = 10$, $x + y = -10$, $x - y = 10$, and $x - y = -10$.
The second factor is zero when $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$,
which implies that $x = \pm 8$ and $y = \pm 8$.
Solving these equations gives us four lines: $x = 8$, $x = -8$, $y = 8$, and $y = -8$.
The four lines from the first factor and the four lines from the second factor form a grid of lines that divide the plane into 16 smaller squares.
The vertices of the convex polygon are the intersection points of these lines.
The side length of each smaller square is the distance between two adjacent lines, which is 10.
Therefore, the area of each smaller square is $10^2 = 100$.
Since there are 4 smaller squares in the convex polygon, the area of the convex polygon is $4 \times 100 = 400$. The answer is: $400$

Assistant:

 The equation given in the problem is a product of two expressions equal to zero. Therefore, either the first expression is zero or the second expression is zero.

The first expression is zero when $|x + y| - 10 = 0$ or $|x - y| - 10 = 0$. This implies that $|x + y| = 10$ and $|x - y| = 10$. The solutions to these equations are the lines $x + y = 10$, $x + y = -10$, $x - y = 10$, and $x - y = -10$. These lines form a rectangle.

The second expression is zero when $|x| - 8 = 0$ or $|y| - 8 = 0$. This implies that $|x| = 8$ and $|y| = 8$. The solutions to these equations are the lines $x = 8$, $x = -8$, $y = 8$, and $y = -8$. These lines also form a rectangle.

The convex polygon formed by the intersection of these two rectangles is a square with side length 10 (since the distance between the lines $x + y = 10$ and $x + y = -10$ is 10, and similarly for the other two pairs of lines). The area of a square is the side length squared, so the area of this square is $10^2 = 100$. The answer is: $100$

Below is a math problem you are to solve (positive numerical answer!):
"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"
Analyze this problem and think step by step to come to a solution with programs. After solving the problem, output the final numerical answer within \boxed{}.

Assistant:

 To solve this problem, we need to analyze the equation and understand the conditions that make the equation equal to zero. The equation is:

$$((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0.$$

For the product of two factors to be zero, one or both of the factors must be zero. Therefore, either

1. $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$
2. $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$

From the first equation, we have $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. This implies that $x + y = \pm 10$ and $x - y = \pm 10$. Solving these equations gives us the vertices of a square with side length 10 and diagonals of length $10\sqrt{2}$.

From the second equation, we have $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$. This implies that $x = \pm 8$ and $y = \pm 8$. Solving these equations gives us the vertices of a square with side length 8 and diagonals of length $8\sqrt{2}$.

The total area of the convex polygon is the sum of the areas of these two squares. The area of a square is given by the square of the length of its side, so the area of the first square is $(10)^2 = 100$ and the area of the second square is $(8)^2 = 64$. The total area of the convex polygon is therefore $100 + 64 = 164$. The answer is: $164$

"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"

Assistant:


The given equation is a product of two terms, and the product is zero if and only if at least one of the terms is zero. Therefore, the given equation is equivalent to the following system of equations:
\[((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2) = 0,\]
\[((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0.\]
From the first equation, we have $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. This implies that $x + y = \pm 10$ and $x - y = \pm 10$. Solving these four equations, we get the vertices of the polygon as $(5, 5)$, $(5, -5)$, $(-5, 5)$, and $(-5, -5)$.
From the second equation, we have $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$. This implies that $x = \pm 8$ and $y = \pm 8$. Solving these four equations, we get the vertices of the polygon as $(8, 8)$, $(8, -8)$, $(-8, 8)$, and $(-8, -8)$.
The polygon is a square with side length 10. Therefore, its area is $10^2 = 100$.
So the area of the convex polygon is $100$. The answer is: $100$

"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"

 The given equation is a product of two terms equal to zero, so it is equal to zero when either of the terms is zero. This means that the points $(x, y)$ that satisfy the equation must satisfy either $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + (\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + (\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$.
The first term is zero when $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. These are the equations of two squares with side length 10, centered at the origin, with one square having its sides parallel to the x-axis and the other having its sides parallel to the y-axis.
The second term is zero when $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$. These are the equations of two squares with side length 16, centered at the origin, with one square having its sides parallel to the x-axis and the other having its sides parallel to the y-axis.
The convex polygon formed by the intersection of these squares is a square with side length 10, since the side length of the smaller squares is smaller than the side length of the larger squares.
The area of this square is $10^2 = 100$. The answer is: 100

Assistant:

 The given equation is of the form $(A)(B) = 0$, which means that either $A = 0$ or $B = 0$. 

If $A = 0$, then $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + (\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$. This is only possible if $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. This means that $x + y = \pm 10$ and $x - y = \pm 10$. Solving these equations gives us the vertices of the polygon: $(0, 10)$, $(0, -10)$, $(10, 0)$, and $(-10, 0)$.

If $B = 0$, then $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + (\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$. This is only possible if $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$. This means that $x = \pm 8$ and $y = \pm 8$. Solving these equations gives us the vertices of the polygon: $(8, 8)$, $(8, -8)$, $(-8, 8)$, and $(-8, -8)$.

So the vertices of the polygon are $(0, 10)$, $(0, -10)$, $(10, 0)$, $(-10, 0)$, $(8, 8)$, $(8, -8)$, $(-8, 8)$, and $(-8, -8)$.

The polygon is a square with side length 10. The area of a square is the side length squared, so the area of this square is $10^2 = 100$. The answer is: $100$
