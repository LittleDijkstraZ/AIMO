Interesting, let's analyze step by step:



The equation given is a product of two terms equal to zero. Therefore, either the first term is zero or the second term is zero. This means that the points that satisfy the equation are those that make either the first term zero or the second term zero.

The first term is $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)$. This term is zero if and only if both $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. These are the equations of two squares with side length 10 centered at the origin.

The second term is $((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2)$. This term is zero if and only if both $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$. These are the equations of two squares with side length 16 centered at the origin.

The intersection of these two squares forms a square with side length 8 (the smaller of the two squares). Therefore, the area of the convex polygon is $8^2 = 64$.

The answer is: $64$

Interesting, let's analyze step by step:



The given equation is $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + (\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + (\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$.

The only way for the product of two numbers to be zero is if one of them is zero. Therefore, we have two cases:

Case 1: $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + (\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$.
This implies that $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. This gives us the vertices of a square with side length 10 units. The area of the square is $10^2 = 100$ square units.

Case 2: $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + (\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$.
This implies that $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$. This gives us a square with side length 16 units. The area of the square is $16^2 = 256$ square units.

However, the intersection of the two cases is the square with side length 10 units. Therefore, the area of the convex polygon is the area of the square with side length 10 units, which is $100$ square units.

So, the area of the convex polygon is $100$. The answer is: $100$

Interesting, let's analyze step by step:



The expression $A \cdot B = 0$ is true if and only if $A = 0$ or $B = 0$. Thus, the given equation is satisfied if either of the following two conditions is true:

1. $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$.
2. $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$.

From condition 1, we have $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. This implies that $x + y = \pm 10$ and $x - y = \pm 10$. Solving these equations, we get the vertices of the polygon as $(0, 10)$, $(0, -10)$, $(10, 0)$, and $(-10, 0)$.

From condition 2, we have $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$. This implies that $x = \pm 8$ and $y = \pm 8$. Solving these equations, we get the vertices of the polygon as $(8, 8)$, $(8, -8)$, $(-8, 8)$, and $(-8, -8)$.

So, the polygon is a square with side length $10$. The area of this square is $10^2 = 100$.

Thus, the area of the convex polygon is $100$. The answer is: $100$

Interesting, let's analyze step by step:



The equation is $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$.

This equation is equal to zero if and only if both of its factors are equal to zero. So we have two cases to consider:

1. $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$. This can only happen if $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. Solving these equations gives us $x = \pm 10$ and $y = \pm 10$.

2. $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$. This can only happen if $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$. Solving these equations gives us $x = \pm 8$ and $y = \pm 8$.

So the points that satisfy the equation are the vertices of a square with side length 20. To find the area of this square, we simply square the length of its side: $20^2 = 400$.

So the area of the convex polygon is 400. The answer is: $400$.

Interesting, let's analyze step by step:



The given equation is $0$ if and only if at least one of the factors is $0$. So we have two cases:

1. $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$
2. $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$

From the first case, we have $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. This implies that $x + y = \pm 10$ and $x - y = \pm 10$. Solving these equations, we get the vertices of the polygon as $(0, 10)$, $(0, -10)$, $(10, 0)$, $(-10, 0)$, $(8, 8)$, $(8, -8)$, $(-8, 8)$, and $(-8, -8)$.

From the second case, we have $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$. This implies that $x = \pm 8$ and $y = \pm 8$.

Now, let's plot these points on a coordinate plane and connect them to form the polygon. The polygon is a square with side length $20$.

The area of the square is $20^2 = 400$.

Therefore, the area of the convex polygon is $400$. The answer is: $400$

This implies that either $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + (\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + (\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$.

The first equation is satisfied if and only if $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$, which implies $x = 0$ and $y = 10$ or $x = 10$ and $y = 0$.

The second equation is satisfied if and only if $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$, which implies $x = 8$ or $x = -8$ and $y = 8$ or $y = -8$.

Therefore, the polygon is a square with side length 10, and its area is $10^2 = 100$.

So, the area of the convex polygon is 100. The answer is: $100$

Interesting, let's analyze step by step:



The equation is a product of two terms, each of which must be zero for the product to be zero. This gives us two systems of equations to solve:

1. $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ and $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ and $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ and $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$.

2. One of the terms in the product can be zero without making the whole product zero. But this would mean that at least one of the factors is zero, which is not possible because the absolute value of any real number is always non-negative and therefore cannot be negative.

Now let's solve the first system of equations:

1. $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ implies $\vert x + y \vert = 10$. This gives us two cases: $x + y = 10$ and $x + y = -10$.

2. $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ implies $\vert x \vert = 8$. This gives us two cases: $x = 8$ and $x = -8$.

3. $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ implies $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. This gives us two cases: $x - y = 10$ and $x - y = -10$.

4. $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ implies $\vert y \vert = 8$. This gives us two cases: $y = 8$ and $y = -8$.

Now we need to find the intersection points of these cases and draw the corresponding lines on the coordinate plane to visualize the polygon.

After drawing the lines on the coordinate plane, we find that the polygon is a square with side length 16. The area of a square is given by the square of the length of its side, so the area of the polygon is $16^2 = 256$.

The answer is: $256$

1. The given equation is a product of two expressions equal to zero. This means that either the first expression is zero or the second expression is zero.
2. The first expression is $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)$. This expression is zero if and only if both $(\vert x + y \vert - 10) = 0$ and $(\vert x - y \vert - 10) = 0$. This implies that $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$.
3. The second expression is $((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2)$. This expression is zero if and only if both $(\vert x \vert - 8) = 0$ and $(\vert y \vert - 8) = 0$. This implies that $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$.

From these conditions, we can deduce that the points that satisfy the equation are of the form $(x, y) = (8, 8)$, $(-8, 8)$, $(8, -8)$, and $(-8, -8)$. These points form a square with side length 16.

The area of this square is $16^2 = 256$.

So the area of the convex polygon is 256.
The answer is: $256$

Interesting, let's analyze step by step:



The given equation is a product of two terms equal to zero. Therefore, either the first term is zero or the second term is zero. This gives us two systems of equations to solve:

1. $|x + y| - 10 = 0$ and $|x - y| - 10 = 0$
2. $|x| - 8 = 0$ and $|y| - 8 = 0$

For the first system of equations, we have:

1. $|x + y| = 10$
2. $|x - y| = 10$

This implies that $x + y = \pm 10$ and $x - y = \pm 10$. Solving these equations gives us the vertices of a square with side length 10. The area of this square is $10^2 = 100$.

For the second system of equations, we have:

1. $|x| = 8$ which gives $x = \pm 8$
2. $|y| = 8$ which gives $y = \pm 8$

This implies that the vertices of the square are also $(8, 8)$, $(-8, 8)$, $(-8, -8)$, and $(8, -8)$.

So the area of the convex polygon is the area of the square, which is 100. The answer is: $100$
