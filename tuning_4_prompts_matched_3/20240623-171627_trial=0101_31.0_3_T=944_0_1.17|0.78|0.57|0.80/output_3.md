Below is a math problem you are to solve (positive numerical answer!):
"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"
Analyze this problem and think step by step to come to a solution with programs. After solving the problem, output the final numerical answer within \boxed{}.

 The expression $A \cdot B = 0$ implies that at least one of the factors is zero. So, either $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$.
The equation $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ implies that $\vert x + y \vert = 10$, which means $x + y = \pm 10$. Similarly, $\vert x - y \vert = 10$ implies $x - y = \pm 10$. Also, $\vert x \vert = 8$ implies $x = \pm 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$ implies $y = \pm 8$. These equations describe a square with side length $16$. The area of this square is $16^2 = 256$. So, the area of the convex polygon is $256$. The answer is: $256$

The given equation is a product of two terms equal to zero, so either the first term is zero or the second term is zero.

If $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$, then $\vert x + y \vert = 10$, which implies $x + y = 10$ or $x + y = -10$.
If $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$, then $\vert x - y \vert = 10$, which implies $x - y = 10$ or $x - y = -10$.
If $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$, then $\vert x \vert = 8$, which implies $x = 8$ or $x = -8$.
If $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$, then $\vert y \vert = 8$, which implies $y = 8$ or $y = -8$.

Solving these equations, we get the vertices of the polygon as:
(8, 2), (8, -2), (-8, 2), (-8, -2), (2, 8), (-2, 8), (2, -8), and (-2, -8).

The polygon is a square with side length 16. To find the area of the square, we use the formula $side^2$, so the area is $16^2 = 256$.

```python

    """The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"""
    side_length = 16
    area = side_length ** 2
    return area

The area of the convex polygon is 256 square units. The answer is: $256$

The given equation is a product of two terms, which are equal to zero if either of the terms is zero. This gives us four conditions:

1. $\vert x + y \vert - 10 = 0$ and $\vert x \vert - 8 = 0$ and $\vert y \vert - 8 = 0$.
2. $\vert x + y \vert - 10 = 0$ and $\vert x - y \vert - 10 = 0$.
3. $\vert x \vert - 8 = 0$ and $\vert y \vert - 8 = 0$ and $\vert x - y \vert - 10 = 0$.
4. $\vert x + y \vert - 10 = 0$ and $\vert x \vert - 8 = 0$ and $\vert y \vert - 8 = 0$ and $\vert x - y \vert - 10 = 0$.

From the first condition, we have $x = \pm 8$ and $y = \pm 8$. This gives us a square with side length 16.

From the second condition, we have $x + y = \pm 10$ and $x - y = \pm 10$. This gives us four points: $(5, 5)$, $(5, -5)$, $(-5, 5)$, and $(-5, -5)$. These points form a square with side length 10.

From the third condition, we have $x = \pm 8$ and $y = \pm 8$ again, which is the same square as before.

From the fourth condition, we have $x + y = \pm 10$, $x - y = \pm 10$, $x = \pm 8$, and $y = \pm 8$. This gives us the same four points as before, which form the same square.

So, the convex polygon is a square with side length 16. The area of this square is $16^2 = 256$. The answer is: $256$.
