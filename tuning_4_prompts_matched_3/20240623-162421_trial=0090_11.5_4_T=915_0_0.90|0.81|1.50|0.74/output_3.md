Assistant:

 The given equation is a product of two expressions equal to zero. Therefore, either the first expression is zero or the second expression is zero.

If either $\vert x + y \vert - 10 = 0$ or $\vert x - y \vert - 10 = 0$, then $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ or $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. These equations represent two lines in the coordinate plane, and the points that satisfy them form a square with side length 20.

Similarly, if either $\vert x \vert - 8 = 0$ or $\vert y \vert - 8 = 0$, then $\vert x \vert = 8$ or $\vert y \vert = 8$. These equations represent two lines in the coordinate plane, and the points that satisfy them form a square with side length 16.

The intersection of these two squares is the convex polygon we are looking for. The side length of this square is the smaller of the two side lengths, which is 16.

The area of a square is given by the square of the side length, so the area of the convex polygon is $16^2 = 256$.
The answer is: $256$

 The given equation is a product of two terms equal to zero. This means that either the first term is zero or the second term is zero. 

If either $|x+y| - 10 = 0$ or $|x-y| - 10 = 0$, then $|x+y| = 10$ or $|x-y| = 10$. This implies that the points $(x, y)$ lie on a square with side length 20.

If either $|x| - 8 = 0$ or $|y| - 8 = 0$, then $|x| = 8$ or $|y| = 8$. This implies that the points $(x, y)$ lie on a square with side length 16.

The intersection of these two squares is the convex polygon that encloses the points $(x, y)$ that satisfy the given equation. The area of this convex polygon is the area of the smaller square, which is $(20)^2 = 400$.
The answer is: $400$

Below is a math problem you are to solve (positive numerical answer!):
"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"

 The given equation is a product of two expressions equal to zero, so it is equal to zero if either of the expressions is zero. This gives us two sets of equations to solve:

1. $\vert x + y \vert - 10 = 0$ and $\vert x - y \vert - 10 = 0$
2. $\vert x \vert - 8 = 0$ and $\vert y \vert - 8 = 0$

For the first set of equations, we have $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. This implies that $x + y = \pm 10$ and $x - y = \pm 10$. Solving these equations gives us the vertices of the square formed by the points $(5, 5)$, $(5, -5)$, $(-5, -5)$, and $(-5, 5)$.

For the second set of equations, we have $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$. This implies that $x = \pm 8$ and $y = \pm 8$. Solving these equations gives us the vertices of the square formed by the points $(8, 8)$, $(8, -8)$, $(-8, -8)$, and $(-8, 8)$.

The area of the convex polygon formed by the union of these two squares is the sum of the areas of the two squares. Each square has side length 10 (from the equation $\vert x + y \vert = 10$), so the area of each square is $10^2 = 100$. Therefore, the total area of the convex polygon is $2 \times 100 = 200$. The answer is: $200$

Below is a math problem you are to solve (positive numerical answer!):
"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"

The given equation is a product of two terms equal to zero, so it is equal to zero if either of the terms is zero. This gives us two sets of equations:

1. $|x+y| - 10 = 0 \Rightarrow |x+y| = 10$ and $|x-y| - 10 = 0 \Rightarrow |x-y| = 10$
2. $|x| - 8 = 0 \Rightarrow |x| = 8$ and $|y| - 8 = 0 \Rightarrow |y| = 8$

The solutions to the first set of equations are $x = \pm 10$ and $y = \pm 10$. The solutions to the second set of equations are $x = \pm 8$ and $y = \pm 8$.

These solutions form a square with side length 20 (from the first set of equations) and a smaller square with side length 16 (from the second set of equations). The convex polygon is the union of these two squares.

The area of the larger square is $20^2 = 400$, and the area of the smaller square is $16^2 = 256$. The area of the convex polygon is the sum of the areas of these two squares, so it is $400 + 256 = 656$.

Therefore, the area of the convex polygon is 656 square units.

Here is a Python function that calculates the area:

```python

    """The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"""
    side_length_large_square = 20
    side_length_small_square = 16
    area_large_square = side_length_large_square**2
    area_small_square = side_length_small_square**2
    area_polygon = area_large_square + area_small_square

"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"

The given equation is a product of two expressions equal to zero, so it is equal to zero if either of the expressions is zero. This gives us two sets of equations to solve:

1. $|x + y| - 10 = 0$ and $|x - y| - 10 = 0$.
2. $|x| - 8 = 0$ and $|y| - 8 = 0$.

From the first set of equations, we have $|x + y| = 10$ and $|x - y| = 10$. This implies that $x + y = \pm 10$ and $x - y = \pm 10$. Solving these equations gives us the vertices of the polygon: $(8, 2)$, $(8, -2)$, $(-8, 2)$, and $(-8, -2)$.

From the second set of equations, we have $|x| = 8$ and $|y| = 8$. This implies that $x = \pm 8$ and $y = \pm 8$. Solving these equations gives us the vertices of the polygon: $(8, 8)$, $(8, -8)$, $(-8, 8)$, and $(-8, -8)$.

The vertices of the polygon are $(8, 2)$, $(8, -2)$, $(-8, 2)$, $(-8, -2)$, $(8, 8)$, $(8, -8)$, $(-8, 8)$, and $(-8, -8)$. These vertices form a square with side length 16. The area of a square is side length squared, so the area of the polygon is $16^2 = 256$.
The answer is: $256$

"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"

Assistant:


This problem involves understanding the properties of absolute value and how it interacts with equations. The equation
\[((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0\]
is true if either of the following conditions hold:
1. $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$
2. $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$
The first condition is true if $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ or $\vert x - y \vert = 10$, which means that the point $(x, y)$ is at a distance of 10 from the lines $x + y = 0$ and $x - y = 0$. The second condition is true if $\vert x \vert = 8$ or $\vert y \vert = 8$, which means that the point $(x, y)$ is at a distance of 8 from the x-axis and the y-axis. The points that satisfy these conditions form a square with side length 16 (the distance from the origin to the lines $x + y = 0$ or $x - y = 0$ is 10, and the distance from the origin to the x-axis or y-axis is 8, so the side length of the square is the hypotenuse of a right triangle with sides 8 and 10, which is $\sqrt{8^2 + 10^2} = \sqrt{64 + 100} = \sqrt{164} = 16$). Therefore, the area of the convex polygon is $16^2 = 256$.

So the area of the convex polygon is 256. The answer is: $256$

"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"

The given equation is $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$. This equation is satisfied if either of the two factors is zero. 

For the first factor to be zero, we need $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. These two equations represent two squares of side length 10, one with the diagonals along the x and y axes (centered at the origin), and the other with the diagonals along the lines y = x and y = -x (also centered at the origin).

For the second factor to be zero, we need $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$. These two equations represent two squares of side length 16, one with the diagonals along the x and y axes (centered at the origin), and the other with the diagonals along the lines y = x and y = -x (also centered at the origin).

The intersection of these two sets of points is a square of side length 10, centered at the origin. Therefore, the area of the convex polygon is the area of this square, which is $10^2 = 100$.

So, the area of the convex polygon is 100. The answer is: $100$

The given equation is a product of two expressions equal to zero. This means that either the first expression is zero or the second expression is zero.

The first expression is $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)$. This expression is zero if and only if both $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. These are the equations of two squares in the coordinate plane, centered at the origin with side length 20.

The second expression is $((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2)$. This expression is zero if and only if both $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$. These are the equations of two squares in the coordinate plane, centered at the origin with side length 16.

The intersection of these two squares is a square with side length 8. Therefore, the area of the convex polygon is $8^2 = 64$.

 The given equation is equal to zero if and only if both $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ and $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$, or both $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ and $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$.
From the first pair of equations, we have $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$.
From the second pair of equations, we have $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$.
This means that the points must lie on the lines $x + y = \pm 10$, $x - y = \pm 10$, $x = \pm 8$, and $y = \pm 8$.
These lines form a square with side length 16.
The area of this square is $16^2 = 256$. The answer is: $256$
