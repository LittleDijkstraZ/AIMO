Interesting, let's analyze step by step:



The equation given is a product of two terms equal to zero. This means that either the first term is zero or the second term is zero.

The first term is $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)$. This term equals zero if and only if both $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. This gives us the lines $x + y = \pm 10$ and $x - y = \pm 10$.

The second term is $((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2)$. This term equals zero if and only if both $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$, which gives us the lines $x = \pm 8$ and $y = \pm 8$.

The intersection of these lines form a square with side length 16. The area of this square is $16^2 = 256$.

So, the area of the convex polygon is 256. The answer is: $256$

Interesting, let's analyze step by step:



The equation is $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$.

The product of two numbers is zero if and only if at least one of the numbers is zero. Therefore, we have two cases:

1. $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ and $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$.
2. $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ and $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$.

In the first case, we have $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x \vert = 8$, $\vert y \vert = 8$. This gives us a square with side length 16, so its area is $16^2 = 256$.

In the second case, we have $\vert x - y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x \vert = 8$, $\vert y \vert = 8$. This also gives us a square with side length 16, so its area is also $16^2 = 256$.

Therefore, the area of the convex polygon is the sum of the areas of these two squares, which is $256 + 256 = 512$.

The answer is: $512$

The equation is given as:
$$((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$$

This equation is equal to zero if either of the two factors is zero. Therefore, we have two sets of equations to solve:

1. $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ and $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$
2. $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ and $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$

From the first set of equations, we have $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x \vert = 8$, $\vert y \vert = 8$. This gives us the vertices of the rectangle: $(8, 0)$, $(8, 16)$, $(-8, 16)$, and $(-8, 0)$.

From the second set of equations, we have $\vert x - y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x \vert = 8$, $\vert y \vert = 8$. This gives us the vertices of the rectangle: $(0, -8)$, $(16, -8)$, $(16, 8)$, and $(0, 8)$.

The resulting figure is a rectangle with side lengths $16$ and $16$, so its area is $16 \times 16 = 256$.

Therefore, the area of the convex polygon is $256$.
The answer is: $256$

Interesting, let's analyze step by step:



The given equation is $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$.

This equation equals to zero if and only if either of the two factors equals to zero. This gives us two sets of equations:

1. $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ and $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ and $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ and $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$.
2. $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ and $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ and $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ and $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$.

From the first set of equations, we have $\vert x + y \vert = 10$, $\vert x \vert = 8$, $\vert x - y \vert = 10$, and $\vert y \vert = 8$. This means $-10 \leq x + y \leq 10$, $-8 \leq x \leq 8$, $-10 \leq x - y \leq 10$, and $-8 \leq y \leq 8$.

From the second set of equations, we have the same conditions.

So the points $(x, y)$ that satisfy the equation are those that lie in the intersection of the four rectangles:

1. $-10 \leq x + y \leq 10$.
2. $-8 \leq x \leq 8$.
3. $-10 \leq x - y \leq 10$.
4. $-8 \leq y \leq 8$.

This intersection is a square with side length $16$, because the maximum value of $x + y$ is $10$, the maximum value of $x$ is $8$, the maximum value of $x - y$ is $10$, and the maximum value of $y$ is $8$.

The area of this square is $16^2 = 256$.

So the area of the convex polygon is $256$. The answer is: $256$

Interesting, let's analyze step by step:



The equation is given as:

$$((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$$

This equation equals zero if either of the two terms equals zero. This gives us two sets of equations to solve:

1. $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ and $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$
2. $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ and $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$

For the first set of equations, we have:

1. $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ which means $x + y = 10$ or $x + y = -10$
2. $\vert x \vert = 8$ which means $x = 8$ or $x = -8$
3. $\vert y \vert = 8$ which means $y = 8$ or $y = -8$

For the second set of equations, we have:

1. $\vert x - y \vert = 10$ which means $x - y = 10$ or $x - y = -10$
2. $\vert x \vert = 8$ which means $x = 8$ or $x = -8$
3. $\vert y \vert = 8$ which means $y = 8$ or $y = -8$

By solving these equations, we find that the points that satisfy the equation are:

1. $(8, 2)$, $(8, -2)$, $(-8, 2)$, $(-8, -2)$, $(2, 8)$, $(2, -8)$, $(-2, 8)$, $(-2, -8)$
2. $(8, 10)$, $(8, -10)$, $(-8, 10)$, $(-8, -10)$, $(10, 8)$, $(10, -8)$, $(-10, 8)$, $(-10, -8)$

These points form a square with side length 16. The area of this square is $16^2 = 256$.

So the area of the convex polygon is 256.

To solve this problem, we didn't actually need to use sympy. We just needed to analyze the equations and find the points that satisfy them. Then we calculated the area of the square formed by these points. The final answer is a positive integer: 256. The answer is: $256$
