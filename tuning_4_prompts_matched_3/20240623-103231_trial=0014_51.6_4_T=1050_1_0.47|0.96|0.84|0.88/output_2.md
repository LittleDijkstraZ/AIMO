Interesting, let's analyze step by step:



The equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has $4$ distinct solutions. This means that the expression inside the absolute value, $\vert x-1 \vert -2$, must be equal to $\frac{m}{100}$, $-\frac{m}{100}$, $\frac{m}{100} + 2$, and $-\frac{m}{100} + 2$.

Now, let's solve each case separately:

1. $\vert x-1 \vert -2 = \frac{m}{100}$:

Adding $2$ to both sides, we get $\vert x-1 \vert = \frac{m}{100} + 2$.

This equation has two cases:

a) $x-1 = \frac{m}{100} + 2$, which simplifies to $x = \frac{m}{100} + 3$.

b) $-(x-1) = \frac{m}{100} + 2$, which simplifies to $x = 1 - \frac{m}{100} - 2 = - \frac{m}{100} - 1$.

2. $\vert x-1 \vert -2 = -\frac{m}{100}$:

Adding $2$ to both sides, we get $\vert x-1 \vert = 2 - \frac{m}{100}$.

This equation has two cases:

a) $x-1 = 2 - \frac{m}{100}$, which simplifies to $x = 3 - \frac{m}{100}$.

b) $-(x-1) = 2 - \frac{m}{100}$, which simplifies to $x = -1 + \frac{m}{100}$.

3. $\vert x-1 \vert -2 = \frac{m}{100} + 2$:

Adding $2$ to both sides, we get $\vert x-1 \vert = \frac{m}{100} + 4$.

This equation has two cases:

a) $x-1 = \frac{m}{100} + 4$, which simplifies to $x = \frac{m}{100} + 5$.

b) $-(x-1) = \frac{m}{100} + 4$, which simplifies to $x = - \frac{m}{100} + 1$.

4. $\vert x-1 \vert -2 = -\frac{m}{100} + 2$:

Adding $2$ to both sides, we get $\vert x-1 \vert = 2 - \frac{m}{100} + 2 = 4 - \frac{m}{100}$.

This equation has two cases:

a) $x-1 = 4 - \frac{m}{100}$, which simplifies to $x = 5 - \frac{m}{100}$.

b) $-(x-1) = 4 - \frac{m}{100}$, which simplifies to $x = - \frac{m}{100} + 1$.

We can see that the last two cases are the same as in the third case. So we only need to consider the first three cases.

Now, we need to find the values of $m$ for which all four solutions are distinct. This means that the four expressions for $x$ must be different.

After analyzing the four cases, we can see that the only way for all four solutions to be distinct is if the expressions for $x$ in the first and second cases are different from the expressions for $x$ in the third case.

This happens when $m < 100$, because then the expressions for $x$ in the first two cases will be negative, while the expressions for $x$ in the third case will be positive.

So, we need to find the number of positive integers $m$ such that $0 < m < 100$. This is simply $99$.

Therefore, the number of positive integers $m$ for which the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has $4$ distinct solutions is $99$.
The answer is: $99$

Interesting, let's analyze step by step:



The equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has $4$ distinct solutions. This means that the right side of the equation, $\frac{m}{100}$, must be equal to $2$. Therefore, we have $m=200$.

Now, let's verify that this value of $m$ indeed gives us $4$ distinct solutions. Substituting $m=200$ into the equation, we get $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{200}{100}=2$.

The equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=2$ can be solved as follows:

1. First, we solve $\vert x-1 \vert -2 = 2$, which gives $\vert x-1 \vert = 4$. This results in two equations: $x-1 = 4$ and $x-1 = -4$. Solving these equations gives $x = 5$ and $x = -3$.

2. Next, we solve $\vert x-1 \vert -2 = -2$, which gives $\vert x-1 \vert = 0$. This results in one equation: $x-1 = 0$, which gives $x = 1$.

So, the four distinct solutions are $x = -3, 1, 5$.

Thus, the value of $m$ that gives $4$ distinct solutions is indeed $200$. Since $200$ is a positive integer, the answer is $\boxed{1}$.
The answer is: 1

Interesting, let's analyze step by step:



1. We know that the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has 4 distinct solutions.
2. We can start by considering the right side of the equation, $\frac{m}{100}$. Since $m$ is a positive integer, $\frac{m}{100}$ is a positive rational number.
3. The left side of the equation, $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert$, is a composition of absolute value functions. The graph of this function is a series of V-shapes, with each V-shape representing a segment where the expression inside the absolute value is either positive or negative.
4. The number of distinct solutions of the equation is equal to the number of times the graph of $\frac{m}{100}$ intersects the graph of $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert$.
5. We can see that the graph of $\frac{m}{100}$ will intersect the graph of $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert$ exactly 4 times when $\frac{m}{100}$ is between 1 and 2 (inclusive).
6. This means that $1 \leq \frac{m}{100} \leq 2$, or equivalently, $100 \leq m \leq 200$.
7. The only positive integer $m$ in this range is $m = 100$.

Therefore, the only value of $m$ for which the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has 4 distinct solutions is $m = 100$.
The answer is: $1$

Interesting, let's analyze step by step:



The given equation is $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$, and we want to find the number of positive integer values of $m$ for which this equation has exactly 4 distinct solutions.

The equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ is equivalent to a piecewise function. Let's denote $k = \frac{m}{100}$, then the equation becomes:

\[\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=k.\]

This equation has 4 distinct solutions if and only if $0 < k < 1$. This is because the function $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert$ has a maximum value of 2 and a minimum value of 0, and it crosses the line $y = k$ four times in the interval $0 < k < 1$.

To find the number of such values of $m$, we need to find the number of positive integer values of $m$ such that $0 < \frac{m}{100} < 1$. This is equivalent to finding the number of positive integers $m$ in the interval $0 < m < 100$.

The number of positive integers in this interval is simply $100 - 1 = 99$.

So, the number of positive integer values of $m$ for which the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has exactly 4 distinct solutions is 99.

Therefore, the answer is $\boxed{99}$.
The answer is: $99$

Interesting, let's analyze step by step:



The equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has 4 distinct solutions. The right-hand side $\frac{m}{100}$ must be positive, so $m$ must be positive.

The number of solutions of the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=k$ depends on the value of $k$. If $k=1$, there are 4 solutions. If $k>1$, there are 2 solutions. Therefore, for the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ to have 4 distinct solutions, we must have $\frac{m}{100}=1$.

Solving for $m$ gives $m=100$.

Since $m=100$ is a positive integer, the answer is $\boxed{1}$.

The value of $m$ that makes the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ have 4 distinct solutions is 100. However, we are asked for the number of positive integers $m$ that satisfy this condition. Since there is only one positive integer value for $m$ that makes the equation have 4 distinct solutions, the answer is 1. The answer is: 1

The equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has $4$ distinct solutions. This means that the right side of the equation, $\frac{m}{100}$, must be equal to $2$. This is because the absolute value function makes the expression inside it non-negative, so the left side of the equation can only be equal to $2$ if it is equal to $2$ for $4$ distinct solutions. Therefore, we have $\frac{m}{100}=2$, which gives $m=200$.

Now we need to verify that $m=200$ is a positive integer. It is, so the answer is indeed $200$.

The answer is: $200$

def find_m():
    x, m = symbols('x m')
    # Set up the equation
    equation = Eq(Abs(Abs(x - 1) - 2), m / 100)
    
    # Initialize the count of m values
    count = 0

    # Iterate over possible m values
    for m_value in range(1, 101):  # m is a positive integer and less than 100
        # Substitute the current m value into the equation
        equation_substituted = equation.subs(m, m_value)
        # Solve the equation for x
        solutions = solve(equation_substituted, x)
        # Check if the solutions are distinct
        if len(set(solutions)) == 4:
            count += 1

    return count

result = find_m()
print(result)
