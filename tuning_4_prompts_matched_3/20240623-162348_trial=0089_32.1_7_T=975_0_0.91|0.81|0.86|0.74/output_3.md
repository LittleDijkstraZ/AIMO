Below is a math problem you are to solve (positive numerical answer!):
"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"
Analyze this problem and think step by step to come to a solution with programs. After solving the problem, output the final numerical answer within \boxed{}.

Assistant:


The expression $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2)$ is equal to zero if and only if at least one of the factors is zero. This means that either $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$.
For the first case, we have $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. This implies that $x + y = \pm 10$ and $x - y = \pm 10$. Solving these equations gives us the vertices of the square with side length 10: $(5,5)$, $(5,-5)$, $(-5,5)$, and $(-5,-5)$.
For the second case, we have $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$. This implies that $x = \pm 8$ and $y = \pm 8$. Solving these equations gives us the vertices of the square with side length 16: $(8,8)$, $(8,-8)$, $(-8,8)$, and $(-8,-8)$.
The convex polygon formed by the union of these two squares is a rectangle with length 16 and width 10. Therefore, the area of the convex polygon is $16 \times 10 = 160$. The answer is: $160$

Below is a math problem you are to solve (positive numerical answer!):
"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"

The given equation is equal to zero if and only if both factors are equal to zero. So we have two cases to consider:

1. $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ and $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ and $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$.
2. $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ and $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ and $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$.

For the first case, we have $\vert x + y \vert = 10$, $\vert x \vert = 8$, and $\vert y \vert = 8$. This implies $-8 \leq x, y \leq 8$ and $x + y = \pm 10$. The solutions are $(x, y) = (8, 2)$ and $(8, -2)$ and their reflections across the x and y axes. These points form a square with side length 8. The area of the square is $8^2 = 64$.

For the second case, we have $\vert x - y \vert = 10$, $\vert x \vert = 8$, and $\vert y \vert = 8$. This implies $-8 \leq x, y \leq 8$ and $x - y = \pm 10$. The solutions are $(x, y) = (8, -2)$ and $(8, 2)$ and their reflections across the x and y axes. These points form a square with side length 8. The area of this square is also $8^2 = 64$.

Adding the areas of the two squares, we get the total area of the convex polygon as $64 + 64 = 128$.

So, the area of the convex polygon is $128$. The answer is: $128$.

Below is a math problem you are to solve (positive numerical answer!):
"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"

 The given equation is of the form $A \cdot B = 0$, which implies that either $A = 0$ or $B = 0$. Therefore, either $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + (\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + (\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$.

The equation $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + (\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ implies that $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. These are the equations of two lines in the coordinate plane, so they enclose a rectangle. The length of the rectangle is $20$ (since $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ for all $x$ and $y$ on a line parallel to the line $y = -x$ and distance $10$ from it) and the width is also $20$ (since $\vert x - y \vert = 10$ for all $x$ and $y$ on a line parallel to the line $y = x$ and distance $10$ from it). Therefore, the area of this rectangle is $20 \times 20 = 400$.

The equation $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + (\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ implies that $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$. These are the equations of two lines in the coordinate plane, so they enclose a square. The side length of the square is $16$ (since $\vert x \vert = 8$ for all $x$ on a line parallel to the x-axis and distance $8$ from it), so the area of this square is $16 \times 16 = 256$.

The convex polygon formed by the points satisfying the given equation is the intersection of the rectangle and the square, so it is also a rectangle. The length of this rectangle is $20$ and the width is $16$, so its area is $20 \times 16 = 320$.
The answer is: $320$

Below is a math problem you are to solve (positive numerical answer!):
"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"

Assistant:

 The equation $AB=0$ implies that either $A=0$ or $B=0$. Therefore, the given equation is satisfied if either of the following two conditions is met:
1. $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$
2. $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$

For the first condition to be true, we must have $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. This means $x + y = \pm 10$ and $x - y = \pm 10$. Solving these four equations, we get the vertices of the polygon as $(0, 10)$, $(0, -10)$, $(10, 0)$, and $(-10, 0)$.

For the second condition to be true, we must have $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$. This means $x = \pm 8$ and $y = \pm 8$. Solving these four equations, we get the vertices of the polygon as $(8, 8)$, $(8, -8)$, $(-8, 8)$, and $(-8, -8)$.

The polygon formed by these eight vertices is a square with side length 10. Therefore, its area is $10^2 = 100$. The answer is: $100$

Below is a math problem you are to solve (positive numerical answer!):
"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"
Analyze this problem and think step by step to come to a solution with programs. After solving the problem, output the final numerical answer within \boxed{}.

Assistant:

 The equation $AB=0$ implies that either $A=0$ or $B=0$. So the given equation is equivalent to either $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$.

Solving these equations gives the vertices of the polygon:
- If $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$, then $\vert x + y \vert = 10$, which means $x + y = \pm 10$.
- If $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$, then $\vert x - y \vert = 10$, which means $x - y = \pm 10$.
- If $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$, then $\vert x \vert = 8$, which means $x = \pm 8$.
- If $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$, then $\vert y \vert = 8$, which means $y = \pm 8$.

Solving these equations gives the vertices of the polygon: $(8, 8)$, $(8, -8)$, $(-8, 8)$, $(-8, -8)$, $(10, 0)$, $(0, 10)$, $(-10, 0)$, $(0, -10)$.

The polygon is a square with side length 16. The area of the square is $16^2 = 256$. The answer is: $256$

"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"

Assistant:


The equation $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + (\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + (\vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ implies that either $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$, $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$, $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$, or $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$.

For $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$, we have $\vert x + y \vert = 10$, which gives $x + y = \pm 10$.
For $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$, we have $\vert x - y \vert = 10$, which gives $x - y = \pm 10$.
For $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$, we have $\vert x \vert = 8$, which gives $x = \pm 8$.
For $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$, we have $\vert y \vert = 8$, which gives $y = \pm 8$.

These equations define a square with side length 16, centered at the origin. The area of this square is $16^2 = 256$.

Therefore, the area of the convex polygon is 256.

Here is a Python function that calculates the area:

```python

Assistant:

 The equation $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ is satisfied only when either $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$.

This means that the points that satisfy the equation are on the lines $\vert x + y \vert = 10$, $\vert x - y \vert = 10$, $\vert x \vert = 8$, or $\vert y \vert = 8$.

These lines form a square with side length 16. The area of this square is $16^2 = 256$.

So the area of the convex polygon is 256.

The answer is: $256$
