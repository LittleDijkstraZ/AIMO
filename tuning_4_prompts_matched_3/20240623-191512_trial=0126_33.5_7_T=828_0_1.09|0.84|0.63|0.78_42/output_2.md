 The problem asks for the number of positive integers $m$ such that the equation $| |x - 1| - 2 | = \frac{m}{100}$ has 4 distinct solutions.

This equation involves absolute values, which makes it challenging to solve directly. However, we can analyze the number of solutions by considering the different cases for the expression inside the absolute values.

For the equation $| |x - 1| - 2 | = \frac{m}{100}$ to have 4 distinct solutions, the expression inside the absolute values must be of the form $$-2 - \frac{m}{100}, -2 + \frac{m}{100}, 2 - \frac{m}{100}, 2 + \frac{m}{100}.$$ This is because each of these four expressions gives a different number of solutions depending on the value of $m$.

For the absolute value to be equal to a nonnegative number, the expression inside must be either nonnegative or nonpositive. Therefore, we must have $$-2 + \frac{m}{100} \geq 0 \quad \text{and} \quad 2 - \frac{m}{100} < 0.$$ Solving these inequalities gives $200 - m \geq 0$ and $m < 200$. Thus, $m$ must be an integer between 0 and 199 inclusive.

However, we are interested in the number of positive integers $m$ that satisfy the condition, so we must count the positive values of $m$ that result in 4 distinct solutions. This occurs when $\frac{m}{100}$ is between 2 and 4, inclusive. In other words, we need $200 \geq m > 100$.

Therefore, the number of positive integers $m$ that satisfy the condition is $100$, which is the number of positive integers between 100 and 200. The answer is: 100.

The equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has 4 distinct solutions if and only if $\frac{m}{100} = 1$.
To see why, consider the graph of $y = \vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert$.
This graph is a "V" shape with a minimum at $x=1$, and the minimum value is 2.
The equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ is equivalent to moving the graph vertically by $\frac{m}{100}$.
For the equation to have 4 distinct solutions, the vertical shift must be exactly enough to cross the x-axis at 4 distinct points.
This happens when the shift is 1 unit (i.e., $\frac{m}{100}=1$).
Therefore, the value of $m$ is 100. The answer is: $1$

To solve this problem, we need to analyze the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ and find the values of $m$ for which it has $4$ distinct solutions.

First, let's consider the equation inside the absolute value, $\vert x-1 \vert -2 = y$, where $y = \frac{m}{100}$. This equation has $4$ distinct solutions if $y$ changes sign twice as $x$ varies. This happens when $-2 < y < 2$, so $-2 < \frac{m}{100} < 2$.

Solving the inequalities gives $$-200 < m < 200.$$

However, $m$ is a positive integer, so the possible values of $m$ are the integers from $1$ to $199$.

To count the number of these integers, we can use the formula for the number of integers from $a$ to $b$, which is $b - a + 1$. Here, $a = 1$ and $b = 199$, so the number of integers is $199 - 1 + 1 = 199$.

Therefore, there are $199$ positive integers $m$ for which the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has $4$ distinct solutions. The answer is: $199$

 To solve this problem, we need to analyze the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ and find for how many positive integers $m$ it has $4$ distinct solutions.

First, let's consider the right side of the equation, $\frac{m}{100}$. Since $m$ is a positive integer, $\frac{m}{100}$ is a positive rational number. The number of solutions of the equation will depend on the value of $\frac{m}{100}$.

The expression $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert$ can take values in the interval $[0, 2]$. Therefore, for the equation to have $4$ distinct solutions, $\frac{m}{100}$ must be a number in the interval $(1, 2)$. This means that $1 < \frac{m}{100} < 2$, which implies $100 < m < 200$. The positive integers $m$ that satisfy this inequality are the integers from $101$ to $199$, inclusive. Therefore, there are $199 - 101 + 1 = 99$ such integers $m$.
The answer is: $99$

Assistant:

 The equation $| |x-1|-2|=\frac{m}{100}$ has 4 distinct solutions if and only if $\frac{m}{100}=1$. 

This is because the expression on the left-hand side of the equation, $| |x-1|-2|$, can take on three distinct values: 1, 0, and 1. 

- If $| |x-1|-2|=1$, the equation has 4 distinct solutions.
- If $| |x-1|-2|=0$, the equation has 2 distinct solutions.
- If $| |x-1|-2|=1$, the equation has no solutions.

Setting $\frac{m}{100}=1$, we find $m=100$. 

So, the only positive integer $m$ for which the equation has 4 distinct solutions is 100.

```python

def value_of_m():

 To solve this problem, we need to analyze the equation and find out for how many positive integers $m$ the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has $4$ distinct solutions.

The equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ is a piecewise function with $4$ cases to consider:
1. If $\vert x-1 \vert -2 > 0$, then $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert = \vert x-1 \vert -2$. The equation becomes $\vert x-1 \vert -2 = \frac{m}{100}$, which simplifies to $\vert x-1 \vert = 2 + \frac{m}{100}$. This gives us two sub-cases:
   a. If $x-1 > 0$, then $x-1 = 2 + \frac{m}{100}$, which simplifies to $x = 3 + \frac{m}{100}$.
   b. If $x-1 < 0$, then $-(x-1) = 2 + \frac{m}{100}$, which simplifies to $x = -1 + \frac{m}{100}$.
2. If $\vert x-1 \vert -2 < 0$, then $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert = -( \vert x-1 \vert -2) = 2 - \vert x-1 \vert$. The equation becomes $2 - \vert x-1 \vert = \frac{m}{100}$, which simplifies to $\vert x-1 \vert = 2 - \frac{m}{100}$. This gives us two sub-cases:
   a. If $x-1 > 0$, then $x-1 = 2 - \frac{m}{100}$, which simplifies to $x = 3 - \frac{m}{100}$.
   b. If $x-1 < 0$, then $-(x-1) = 2 - \frac{m}{100}$, which simplifies to $x = -1 - \frac{m}{100}$.

For the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ to have $4$ distinct solutions, the distances between the solutions from the first case and the solutions from the second case must be equal to $\frac{m}{100}$. This means that $2\cdot \frac{m}{100} = 2$, so $m = 100$.

Therefore, the only positive integer $m$ for which the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has $4$ distinct solutions is $m = 100$.
The answer is: $1$

Assistant:



The equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has 4 distinct solutions if and only if $\frac{m}{100} = 1$. This is because the function $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert$ is a "V" shape with the maximum value of 2 and the minimum value of 0. So for the equation to have 4 distinct solutions, the right side of the equation must be a number strictly between 0 and 2. The only such number is 1. Therefore, $m = 100$.

```python


INTERMEDIATE OUT :

def number_of_solutions():
    """For how many positive integers $m$ does the equation \[\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}\] have $4$ distinct solutions?"""
    m = 100
    return m

The number of positive integers $m$ for which the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has 4 distinct solutions is 1. Therefore, $m = 100$. The answer is: 1
