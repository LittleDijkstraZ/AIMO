The given equation is a product of two expressions equal to zero. This means that either the first expression is zero or the second expression is zero.

The first expression is $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)$, and this equals zero if and only if $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. This gives us the lines $x + y = 10$, $x + y = -10$, $x - y = 10$, and $x - y = -10$.

The second expression is $((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2)$, and this equals zero if and only if $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$. This gives us the lines $x = 8$, $x = -8$, $y = 8$, and $y = -8$.

The intersection points of these lines are $(-8, -8)$, $(-8, 8)$, $(8, -8)$, and $(8, 8)$. These points form a square with side length 16. The area of this square is $16^2 = 256$. So the area of the convex polygon is 256.

This problem involves understanding the properties of absolute value and how it interacts with the equations given. The key is to recognize that the product of two quantities is zero if and only if at least one of the quantities is zero. Therefore, the equation $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ must be true for a point $(x, y)$ to be inside the polygon.

For $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$, this can only be true if $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. This implies that $x + y = \pm 10$ and $x - y = \pm 10$, which results in a square with side length 20.

For $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$, this can only be true if $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$, which results in a square with side length 16.

However, the second case is not valid because it is completely contained within the square from the first case. Therefore, the polygon is a square with side length 20, and its area is $20^2 = 400$. The answer is: $400$

Assistant:

 The equation given is a product of two expressions equal to zero, so each expression must be zero independently. This gives us the following four equations:

1. $\vert x + y \vert - 10 = 0$
2. $\vert x - y \vert - 10 = 0$
3. $\vert x \vert - 8 = 0$
4. $\vert y \vert - 8 = 0$

Solving these equations, we get:

1. $\vert x + y \vert = 10 \Rightarrow x + y = \pm 10$
2. $\vert x - y \vert = 10 \Rightarrow x - y = \pm 10$
3. $\vert x \vert = 8 \Rightarrow x = \pm 8$
4. $\vert y \vert = 8 \Rightarrow y = \pm 8$

The solutions to these equations give us the vertices of the polygon: $(8, 8)$, $(8, -8)$, $(-8, 8)$, and $(-8, -8)$.

This is a square with side length $16$, so the area of the polygon is $16^2 = 256$. The answer is: $256$

Below is a math problem you are to solve (positive numerical answer!):
"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"
Analyze this problem and think step by step to come to a solution with programs. After solving the problem, output the final numerical answer within \boxed{}.

Assistant:

 The equation given in the problem, $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$, is satisfied only when either of the two factors is zero. 

The first factor is zero when $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ or $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. These are the equations of two squares in the coordinate plane, centered at the origin with side length 20.

The second factor is zero when $\vert x \vert = 8$ or $\vert y \vert = 8$. These are the equations of two squares in the coordinate plane, centered at the origin with side length 16.

The intersection of these squares forms a octagon, which is the convex polygon described in the problem.

To find the area of the octagon, we can find the area of each square and subtract the area of the four overlapping triangles.

The side length of the larger square is 20, so its area is $20^2 = 400$.
The side length of the smaller square is 16, so its area is $16^2 = 256$.

Each of the four overlapping triangles is a right triangle with legs of length 8 (half the side length of the smaller square) and 10 (half the side length of the larger square), so its area is $\frac{1}{2} \cdot 8 \cdot 10 = 40$.

Therefore, the area of the octagon is $400 + 256 - 4 \cdot 40 = 400 + 256 - 160 = 496$.
The answer is: $496$

 The equation $AB = 0$ is equivalent to $A = 0$ or $B = 0$. Therefore, the given equation is equivalent to either $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$, $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$, $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$, or $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$.

Solving these equations gives the vertices of the polygon:

1. $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ gives $x + y = \pm 10$.
2. $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ gives $x - y = \pm 10$.
3. $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ gives $x = \pm 8$.
4. $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ gives $y = \pm 8$.

The vertices of the polygon are the intersections of these lines:

1. $(10, 0)$, $(0, 10)$, $(-10, 0)$, $(0, -10)$.
2. $(8, 2)$, $(8, -2)$, $(-8, 2)$, $(-8, -2)$.

Plotting these points, we find that they form a square with side length $20$. The area of the square is $20^2 = 400$. The answer is: $400$

"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"
Analyze this problem and think step by step to come to a solution with programs. After solving the problem, output the final numerical answer within \boxed{}.

Assistant:

 The given equation is equivalent to the product of two equations being zero: $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2) = 0$ or $((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$.
The first equation implies that $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$, which gives us a square with side length 10.
The second equation implies that $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$, which gives us a square with side length 16.
The intersection of these two squares is the convex polygon we are looking for.
The side length of the smaller square is 10, so its area is $10^2 = 100$.
The side length of the larger square is 16, so its area is $16^2 = 256$.
The area of the convex polygon is the difference of these two areas: $256 - 100 = 156$. The answer is: $156$

 The given equation is a product of two terms equal to zero. This means that either the first term is zero or the second term is zero. 

If the first term is zero, we have $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$. This is possible only if $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. This means that the points $(x, y)$ must lie on the lines $x + y = 10$ and $x - y = 10$. These lines are parallel and have a distance of $10\sqrt{2}$ between them.

If the second term is zero, we have $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$. This is possible only if $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$. This means that the points $(x, y)$ must lie on the lines $x = 8$ and $y = 8$. These lines form a square with side length $16$.

Therefore, the points $(x, y)$ that satisfy the equation form a square with side length $10\sqrt{2}$. The area of this square is $(10\sqrt{2})^2 = 200$. The answer is: $200$.

This problem is asking for the area of a polygon that is enclosed by the set of points that satisfy the given equation. The equation involves absolute values, which make it difficult to solve directly. However, the equation is equal to zero, which means that the product of two factors must be zero. This gives us two separate conditions to consider:

1. $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$
2. $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$

For the first condition, both $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2$ and $( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2$ must be zero. This means that $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. This implies that the points lie on the lines $x + y = 10$ and $x - y = 10$.

For the second condition, both $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2$ and $( \vert y \vert - 8)^2$ must be zero. This means that $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$. This implies that the points lie on the lines $x = 8$ and $y = 8$.

The intersection of these lines forms a square with side length 10 (since the distance between the lines $x + y = 10$ and $x - y = 10$ is 10, and the distance between the lines $x = 8$ and $y = 8$ is 8, and the square is determined by the smaller distances). The area of this square is $10^2 = 100$.

So the area of the convex polygon is 100. The answer is: $100$

The given equation is a product of two terms, each of which must be zero for the entire expression to be zero. Therefore, we have two separate cases to consider:
1. $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ and $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$.
2. $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ and $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$.
For the first case, we have $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. This gives us four equations: $x + y = 10$, $x + y = -10$, $x - y = 10$, and $x - y = -10$. Solving these equations, we get the vertices of the polygon: $(5,5)$, $(5,-5)$, $(-5,5)$, and $(-5,-5)$.
For the second case, we have $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$. This gives us four more vertices: $(8,0)$, $(-8,0)$, $(0,8)$, and $(0,-8)$.
The polygon formed by these vertices is a square with side length $10$. To find its area, we use the formula for the area of a square, which is the side length squared. Therefore, the area of the polygon is $10^2 = 100$.
The answer is: $100$

Assistant:

 The given equation is of the form $(A)(B) = 0$, which means that either $A = 0$ or $B = 0$. This gives us two separate cases to consider:

1. $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$. This equation implies that $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. This forms a square with side length 10, and the area is $10^2 = 100$.

2. $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$. This equation implies that $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$. This forms a square with side length 16, and the area is $16^2 = 256$.

However, the points that satisfy both equations simultaneously are the vertices of the square formed by the intersection of the two squares. The side length of this smaller square is 8 (since it's formed by the intersection of the two squares), so the area is $8^2 = 64$.

To find the area of the convex polygon, we subtract the area of the smaller square from the sum of the areas of the two larger squares. That is, the area of the convex polygon is $100 + 256 - 64 = 292$. The answer is: $292$

 The expression $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ implies that $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. These two equations imply that $x + y = \pm 10$ and $x - y = \pm 10$. Solving these four systems of equations gives us the vertices of the square: $(8, 2)$, $(8, -2)$, $(-8, -2)$, and $(-8, 2)$.

Similarly, the expression $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ implies that $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$, which means $x = \pm 8$ and $y = \pm 8$. This gives us the vertices of the square: $(8, 8)$, $(8, -8)$, $(-8, -8)$, and $(-8, 8)$.

The intersection of these two squares is the convex polygon we are looking for. This polygon is a square with side length $8\sqrt{2}$. The area of a square is given by the square of the length of its side, so the area of this square is $(8\sqrt{2})^2 = 128$. The answer is: $128$

 The equation $AB=0$ implies that either $A=0$ or $B=0$. Thus, the given equation is equivalent to either
\begin{align*}
((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2) = 0 \tag{1}
\end{align*}
or
\begin{align*}
((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0 \tag{2}
\end{align*}
From equation (1), we have $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. This gives us the system of equations:
\begin{align*}
x + y &= \pm 10 \\
x - y &= \pm 10
\end{align*}
Solving this system, we get the four lines $x + y = 10$, $x + y = -10$, $x - y = 10$, and $x - y = -10$.
From equation (2), we have $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$, which gives us the four lines $x = 8$, $x = -8$, $y = 8$, and $y = -8$.
The intersection of these lines form a square with side length 16. Therefore, the area of the convex polygon is $16^2 = 256$. The answer is: $256$
