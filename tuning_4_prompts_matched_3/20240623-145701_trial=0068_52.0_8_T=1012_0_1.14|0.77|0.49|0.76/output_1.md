"What is the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ when $x$ and $y$ range over all real numbers such that $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$?"

To solve this problem, we first recognize that the given equation $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$ is always true.
This is because $|x-2y| = |-(2x-y)| = |y-2x|$,
so the equation is equivalent to $2|x-2y| = 40$, or $|x-2y| = 20$.

Now we consider the expression $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$.
We can rewrite this as $(5x^2-8xy+5y^2) = (5x^2-10xy+5y^2) + (2xy-5y^2) = (5(x-y)^2) + y(2x-5y)$.

Since $(x-y)^2 \geq 0$, we have $5(x-y)^2 \geq 0$.
Also, $y(2x-5y)$ is minimized when $y = 0$, because if $y \neq 0$, then we can divide both sides of the equation $2x-5y = 0$ by $y$ to get $2\frac{x}{y} - 5 = 0$, or $2\frac{x}{y} = 5$, or $\frac{x}{y} = \frac{5}{2}$.
Thus, $y(2x-5y) = 0$.

Therefore, the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ is achieved when $y = 0$, and in this case, $5x^2+5y^2-8xy = 5x^2$.

Now we consider the equation $|x-2y| = 20$. When $y = 0$, this equation becomes $|x| = 20$, or $x = \pm 20$.

Therefore, the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ is achieved when $x = 20$ or $x = -20$, and in either case, $5x^2 = 5(20)^2 = 2000$.

So the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ is $2000$. The answer is: $2000$

 This problem requires knowledge of mathematical analysis and optimization techniques. We will use the given condition $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$ to simplify the expression $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$. 

Let's start by solving the given condition:

We have $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$. 

We know that $|a| + |b| = |a+b|$ if and only if $ab \geq 0$. So, we can rewrite the given condition as:

$|x-2y - (y-2x)| = 40 \Rightarrow |x-2y - y+2x| = 40 \Rightarrow |3x-3y| = 40 \Rightarrow |x-y| = \frac{40}{3}$.

Now, let's substitute $z = x - y$ in the expression $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$. We get:

$5(x^2 + y^2) - 8xy = 5[(x - y)^2 + 2xy] - 8xy = 5[z^2 + 2xy] - 8xy = 5z^2 + 10xy - 8xy = 5z^2 + 2xy$.

We know that $z = \frac{40}{3}$, so we can substitute this into the expression:

$5z^2 + 2xy = 5\left(\frac{40}{3}\right)^2 + 2xy = 5\left(\frac{1600}{9}\right) + 2xy$.

Now, we need to minimize this expression. Since $xy$ is a product of two real numbers, by the AM-GM inequality, we have $2xy \geq -4\sqrt{xy^2} = -4|y|$.

So, the minimum value of $5z^2 + 2xy$ is achieved when $2xy = -4|y|$, which gives $xy = -2|y|$. Substituting this into the expression, we get:

$5z^2 + 2xy = 5\left(\frac{1600}{9}\right) + 2(-2|y|) = \frac{8000}{9} - 4|y|$.

Now, we know that $|y| = \frac{|x-2y+y-2x|}{2} = \frac{|40|}{6} = \frac{20}{3}$.

Substituting this into the expression, we get:

$\frac{8000}{9} - 4|y| = \frac{8000}{9} - 4\left(\frac{20}{3}\right) = \frac{8000}{9} - \frac{80}{3} = \frac{7920}{9}$.

Finally, we simplify this fraction:

$\frac{7920}{9} = 880$.

So, the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ is 880.

It seems we made a mistake in our calculations. Let's retrace our steps and see where we went wrong.

When we substituted $z = x - y$ into the expression $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$, we got $5z^2 + 10xy - 8xy = 5z^2 + 2xy$. This is correct, but then we substituted $z = \frac{40}{3}$ and $xy = -2|y|$ into this expression, which led to a mistake. Let's correct this.

We know that $z = x - y = \frac{40}{3}$, so $x = y + \frac{40}{3}$. Now, we substitute this into $xy = -2|y|$ to get:

$(y + \frac{40}{3})y = -2|y|$.

Solving this equation for $y$, we get $y^2 + \frac{40}{3}y = -2|y|$. Multiplying through by 3 to clear the fraction, we get $3y^2 + 40y = -6|y|$. 

If $y \geq 0$, then $-6|y| = -6y$, so $3y^2 + 40y = -6y \Rightarrow 3y^2 + 46y = 0 \Rightarrow y(3y + 46) = 0$. The only solution in this case is $y = 0$, but this contradicts the condition $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$ (since $x \neq y$ when $y = 0$). So, we must have $y < 0$, and $-6|y| = 6y$, so $3y^2 + 40y = 6y \Rightarrow 3y^2 + 34y = 0 \Rightarrow y(3y + 34) = 0$. The only solution in this case is $y = -\frac{34}{3}$.

Now, we substitute $y = -\frac{34}{3}$ into $x = y + \frac{40}{3}$ to get $x = -\frac{34}{3} + \frac{40}{3} = \frac{6}{3} = 2$.

Finally, we substitute $x = 2$ and $y = -\frac{34}{3}$ into the expression $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ to get:

$5(2)^2 + 5\left(-\frac{34}{3}\right)^2 - 8(2)\left(-\frac{34}{3}\right) = 20 + \frac{6760}{9} + \frac{592}{3} = \frac{20}{1} + \frac{6760}{9} + \frac{1776}{9} = \frac{20 + 6760 + 1776}{9} = \frac{8556}{9} = 950$.

So, the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ is 950.

Assistant:

 The problem is a bit tricky, but we can solve it step by step.

Step 1: First, we need to simplify the equation $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$. We can rewrite it as $|x-2y| + |2y-x| = 40$.

Step 2: By the property of absolute value, $|a| + |b| = |a+b|$ if $a$ and $b$ have the same sign, or $|a| + |b| = -|a+b|$ if $a$ and $b$ have opposite signs. In this case, $x-2y$ and $2y-x$ have opposite signs. So we have $-(x-2y) + (2y-x) = 40$, which simplifies to $-2(x-2y) = 40$.

Step 3: Solving for $x-2y$, we get $x-2y = -20$.

Step 4: Now we can substitute $x-2y = -20$ into the expression $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ to get $5(-20+2y)^2+5y^2-8(-20+2y)y$.

Step 5: Simplify the expression. After simplification, we get $200y^2 - 200y + 200 + 5y^2 - 160y + 160y^2$.

Step 6: Combining like terms, we get $25y^2 - 360y + 360$.

Step 7: To find the minimum value of this expression, we can take the derivative with respect to $y$ and set it equal to zero. The derivative of $25y^2 - 360y + 360$ with respect to $y$ is $50y - 360$. Setting this equal to zero gives $50y = 360$, so $y = \frac{360}{50} = 7.2$.

Step 8: Substituting $y = 7.2$ back into $x-2y = -20$, we get $x - 2(7.2) = -20$, so $x = -20 + 14.4 = -5.6$.

Step 9: Substituting $x = -5.6$ and $y = 7.2$ into the expression $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$, we get $5(-5.6)^2+5(7.2)^2-8(-5.6)(7.2)$.

Step 10: After simplification, we get $-256$. So the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ when $x$ and $y$ range over all real numbers such that $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$ is $-256$.
The answer is: $-256$

 The given equation $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$ is actually a condition that relates $x$ and $y$. This condition is symmetric in $x$ and $y$, which suggests that the minimum value of the expression $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ might be achieved when $x=y$. 

Let's substitute $x=y$ into the equation and solve for $x$:
$$|x-2x| + |x-2x| = 40,$$
which simplifies to
$$|x| + |-x| = 40.$$
Since $|x|$ and $|-x|$ are always equal, this simplifies further to
$$2|x| = 40,$$
and dividing both sides by 2 gives $|x| = 20$. Thus, $x = \pm 20$. 

Now, let's substitute $x=y$ into the expression $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$:
$$5x^2+5x^2-8x^2 = 2x^2.$$
Since $x = \pm 20$, the minimum value of this expression is achieved when $x = -20$:
$$2(-20)^2 = 800.$$

Therefore, the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ under the condition $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$ is 800. The answer is: $\boxed{800}$.

The inequality $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$ represents a set of points in the $xy$-plane. The function $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ is a quadratic function in two variables, and we want to find its minimum value subject to the constraint given by the inequality.

To solve this problem, we can use the method of Lagrange multipliers. We introduce a new variable $\lambda$ and form the Lagrangian function:

$$L(x, y, \lambda) = 5x^2 + 5y^2 - 8xy - \lambda(|x - 2y| + |y - 2x - 40).$$

Now we need to find the gradient of $L$ and set it equal to the zero vector:

$$\nabla L = \begin{bmatrix} \frac{\partial L}{\partial x} \\ \frac{\partial L}{\partial y} \\ \frac{\partial L}{\partial \lambda} \end{bmatrix} = \begin{bmatrix} 0 \\ 0 \\ 0 \end{bmatrix}.$$

Setting the partial derivatives equal to zero gives us:

$$\frac{\partial L}{\partial x} = 10x - 8y - \lambda(-1 - 2) = 0,$$
$$\frac{\partial L}{\partial y} = 10y - 8x - \lambda(2 - 1) = 0,$$
$$\frac{\partial L}{\partial \lambda} = |x - 2y| + |y - 2x| - 40 = 0.$$

From the first two equations, we can express $\lambda$ in terms of $x$ and $y$:

$$\lambda = \frac{10x - 8y}{3} = \frac{10y - 8x}{1}.$$

Solving these equations simultaneously is difficult, so we can try to simplify the problem. Notice that the function $5x^2 + 5y^2 - 8xy$ can be rewritten as:

$$5(x^2 + y^2) - 8xy = 5\left(\left(x - \frac{4}{5}y\right)^2 + \frac{1}{5}y^2\right).$$

The expression inside the parentheses is always nonnegative, since it's a sum of squares. Therefore, the minimum value of $5x^2 + 5y^2 - 8xy$ is achieved when $x = \frac{4}{5}y$. Substituting this into the constraint equation gives:

$$|y - 2\cdot \frac{4}{5}y| + |\frac{4}{5}y - 2y| = 40,$$
$$|\frac{y}{5}| + |\frac{-6y}{5}| = 40,$$
$$\frac{7|y|}{5} = 40,$$
$$|y| = \frac{200}{7}.$$

Since the constraint equation is symmetric in $x$ and $y$, we can also consider the case when $y = \frac{4}{5}x$. Substituting this into the constraint equation gives the same result, so we can conclude that the minimum value of $5x^2 + 5y^2 - 8xy$ is achieved when $x = \frac{4}{5}y$ or $y = \frac{4}{5}x$.

Substituting $x = \frac{4}{5}y$ into the expression for the function gives:

$$5\left(\left(x - \frac{4}{5}y\right)^2 + \frac{1}{5}y^2\right) = 5\left(\left(x - \frac{4}{5}x\right)^2 + \frac{1}{5}x^2\right) = 5\left(\frac{1}{25}x^2 + \frac{1}{5}x^2\right) = \frac{3}{5}x^2.$$

The minimum value of this function is achieved when $x = 0$, giving a minimum value of 0. However, this solution does not satisfy the constraint equation. Therefore, we must have made an error in our reasoning.

Let's go back and reconsider the method of Lagrange multipliers. We introduced a new variable $\lambda$ and formed the Lagrangian function:

$$L(x, y, \lambda) = 5x^2 + 5y^2 - 8xy - \lambda(|x - 2y| + |y - 2x - 40).$$

Now we need to find the gradient of $L$ and set it equal to the zero vector:

$$\nabla L = \begin{bmatrix} \frac{\partial L}{\partial x} \\ \frac{\partial L}{\partial y} \\ \frac{\partial L}{\partial \lambda} \end{bmatrix} = \begin{bmatrix} 0 \\ 0 \\ 0 \end{bmatrix}.$$

Setting the partial derivatives equal to zero gives us:

$$\frac{\partial L}{\partial x} = 10x - 8y - \lambda(-1 - 2) = 0,$$
$$\frac{\partial L}{\partial y} = 10y - 8x - \lambda(2 - 1) = 0,$$
$$\frac{\partial L}{\partial \lambda} = |x - 2y| + |y - 2x| - 40 = 0.$$

From the first two equations, we can express $\lambda$ in terms of $x$ and $y$:

$$\lambda = \frac{10x - 8y}{3} = \frac{10y - 8x}{1}.$$

Solving these equations simultaneously is difficult, so we can try to simplify the problem. Notice that the function $5x^2 + 5y^2 - 8xy$ can be rewritten as:

$$5(x^2 + y^2) - 8xy = 5\left(\left(x - \frac{4}{5}y\right)^2 + \frac{1}{5}y^2\right).$$

The expression inside the parentheses is always nonnegative, since it's a sum of squares. Therefore, the minimum value of $5x^2 + 5y^2 - 8xy$ is achieved when $x = \frac{4}{5}y$. Substituting this into the constraint equation gives:

$$|y - 2\cdot \frac{4}{5}y| + |\frac{4}{5}y - 2y| = 40,$$
$$|\frac{y}{5}| + |\frac{-6y}{5}| = 40,$$
$$\frac{7|y|}{5} = 40,$$
$$|y| = \frac{200}{7}.$$

Since the constraint equation is symmetric in $x$ and $y$, we can also consider the case when $y = \frac{4}{5}x$. Substituting this into the constraint equation gives the same result, so we can conclude that the minimum value of $5x^2 +

 To solve this problem, we can use the method of completing the square and the inequality $|a| + |b| \geq |a+b|$.
First, let's rewrite the expression $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ as $(x^2 - 4xy + 4y^2) + (y^2 - 4xy + 4x^2)$, which simplifies to $(x-2y)^2 + (y-2x)^2$.
Next, we use the inequality $|x-2y| + |y-2x| \geq |(x-2y) + (y-2x)| = |0| = 0$.
Since $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$, we have equality only when $x-2y = y-2x$, which implies $x = y$.
So, we substitute $x = y$ into the expression $(x-2y)^2 + (y-2x)^2$ to get $(x-2x)^2 + (x-2x)^2 = 0$.
Therefore, the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ is 0.
The answer is: $0$

 This problem is an application of the method of Lagrange multipliers. The constraint equation is given by $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$. First, we can rewrite the constraint equation as $-(x-2y) - (y-2x) = 40$, which simplifies to $-3x + 3y = 40$. Thus, $y = x + \frac{40}{3}$.

Now, substitute $y = x + \frac{40}{3}$ into the function $f(x, y) = 5x^2 + 5y^2 - 8xy$:

Assistant:

 The given equation $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$ is equivalent to $|x-2y| = 40 - |y-2x|$.
We know that $|a| = b$ implies $a = b$ or $a = -b$. So we have two cases to consider:
Case 1: $x-2y = 40 - (y-2x)$, which simplifies to $3x - 3y = 40$, or $x - y = \frac{40}{3}$.
Case 2: $x-2y = -(40 - (y-2x))$, which simplifies to $x - 2y = -40 + y - 2x$, or $3x - 3y = -40$, or $x - y = -\frac{40}{3}$.
We can solve these two equations to find the values of $x$ and $y$.
For case 1, $x - y = \frac{40}{3}$, we can substitute $y = x - \frac{40}{3}$ into the expression $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$, and we get:
$5x^2 + 5\left(x - \frac{40}{3}\right)^2 - 8x\left(x - \frac{40}{3}\right)$.
Simplifying this expression, we get:
$5x^2 + 5\left(x^2 - \frac{80}{3}x + \frac{1600}{9}\right) - 8x^2 + \frac{320}{3}x$,
which simplifies further to:
$-3x^2 + \frac{200}{3}x + \frac{800}{3}$.
For case 2, $x - y = -\frac{40}{3}$, we can substitute $y = x + \frac{40}{3}$ into the expression $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$, and we get:
$5x^2 + 5\left(x + \frac{40}{3}\right)^2 - 8x\left(x + \frac{40}{3}\right)$.
Simplifying this expression, we get:
$5x^2 + 5\left(x^2 + \frac{80}{3}x + \frac{1600}{9}\right) - 8x^2 - \frac{320}{3}x$,
which simplifies further to:
$-3x^2 - \frac{200}{3}x + \frac{800}{3}$.
We can use calculus to find the minimum value of these two expressions.
For $-3x^2 + \frac{200}{3}x + \frac{800}{3}$, the derivative is $-6x + \frac{200}{3}$, which equals 0 when $x = \frac{100}{9}$.
Substituting this value into the expression, we get:
$-3\left(\frac{100}{9}\right)^2 + \frac{200}{3}\left(\frac{100}{9}\right) + \frac{800}{3} = \frac{2000}{9}$.
For $-3x^2 - \frac{200}{3}x + \frac{800}{3}$, the derivative is $-6x - \frac{200}{3}$, which equals 0 when $x = -\frac{100}{9}$.
Substituting this value into the expression, we get:
$-3\left(-\frac{100}{9}\right)^2 - \frac{200}{3}\left(-\frac{100}{9}\right) + \frac{800}{3} = \frac{2000}{9}$.
Therefore, the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ is $\frac{2000}{9}$. The answer is: $\boxed{\frac{2000}{9}}$

Below is a math problem you are to solve (positive numerical answer!):
"What is the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ when $x$ and $y$ range over all real numbers such that $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$?"
Analyze this problem and think step by step to come to a solution with programs. After solving the problem, output the final numerical answer within \boxed{}.

 To solve this problem, we can use the Cauchy-Schwarz inequality. The inequality states that for any real numbers $a_1, a_2, ..., a_n$ and $b_1, b_2, ..., b_n$, we have
\[(a_1b_1 + a_2b_2 + ... + a_nb_n)^2 \leq (a_1^2 + a_2^2 + ... + a_n^2)(b_1^2 + b_2^2 + ... + b_n^2).\]
Applying this inequality to the given problem, we let $a_1 = x - 2y$, $a_2 = y - 2x$, $b_1 = 1$, and $b_2 = 1$. Then we have
\[(a_1b_1 + a_2b_2)^2 \leq (a_1^2 + a_2^2)(b_1^2 + b_2^2).\]
Substituting the values of $a_1$, $a_2$, $b_1$, and $b_2$, we get
\[((x - 2y)(1) + (y - 2x)(1))^2 \leq ((x - 2y)^2 + (y - 2x)^2)(1^2 + 1^2).\]
Simplifying the left side gives
\[(x - 2y + y - 2x)^2 = (-x - y)^2 = (x + y)^2.\]
And the right side is
\[((x - 2y)^2 + (y - 2x)^2)(2) = 2[(x^2 - 4xy + 4y^2) + (y^2 - 4yx + 4x^2)] = 2(5x^2 + 5y^2 - 8xy).\]
So we have
\[(x + y)^2 \leq 2(5x^2 + 5y^2 - 8xy).\]
Dividing both sides by 2 gives
\[\frac{(x + y)^2}{2} \leq 5x^2 + 5y^2 - 8xy.\]
Since $|x - 2y| + |y - 2x| = 40$, we have $x + y = \pm 20$. Without loss of generality, we can assume $x + y = 20$. Then we have
\[\frac{(20)^2}{2} = 200 \leq 5x^2 + 5y^2 - 8xy.\]
So
\[5x^2 + 5y^2 - 8xy \geq 200.\]
The minimum value of $5x^2 + 5y^2 - 8xy$ is 200. The answer is: $200$.

Assistant:

 The first step is to notice that the expression $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ can be rewritten as $5(x^2+y^2) - 8xy = 5[(x-y)^2 + 2xy] - 8xy$.

Now, let's define $z = x - y$. Then $x = y + z$, and we can substitute this into the equation above to get $5[(z)^2 + 2(y+z)y] - 8(y+z)y = 5[z^2 + 2y^2 + 2zy] - 8y^2 - 8zy = 5z^2 + 10y^2 + 10zy - 8y^2 - 8zy = 5z^2 + 2y^2 + 2zy = 5z^2 + 2(y+z)^2 - 2z^2 = 3z^2 + 2(y+z)^2$.

The constraint $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$ can be rewritten as $|z| + |-z + 2(y+z)| = 40$, which simplifies to $|z| + |z + 2y| = 40$.

From the triangle inequality, we know that $|z| + |z + 2y| \geq |(z) - (z + 2y)| = |-2y| = 2|y|$. Therefore, $2|y| \leq 40$, which implies $|y| \leq 20$.

Now, let's minimize the expression $3z^2 + 2(y+z)^2$. Since $y$ is bounded, we want to minimize this expression with respect to $z$. The derivative of $3z^2 + 2(y+z)^2$ with respect to $z$ is $6z + 4(y+z) = 6z + 4y + 4z = 10z + 4y$. Setting this equal to zero gives $10z + 4y = 0$, or $z = -\frac{2y}{5}$.

Substituting $z = -\frac{2y}{5}$ back into the expression $3z^2 + 2(y+z)^2$, we get $3\left(-\frac{2y}{5}\right)^2 + 2\left(y-\frac{2y}{5}\right)^2 = \frac{12y^2}{25} + \frac{18y^2}{25} = \frac{30y^2}{25} = \frac{6y^2}{5}$.

Since $|y| \leq 20$, the minimum value of $\frac{6y^2}{5}$ is achieved when $|y| = 20$, which gives $\frac{6(20^2)}{5} = \frac{2400}{5} = 480$. Therefore, the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ is 480. The answer is: 480

Assistant:

 To solve this problem, we first need to simplify the expression $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$. We can rewrite it as $5(x^2+y^2) - 8xy$. Now, we use the identity $x^2+y^2 = \frac{1}{2}[(x-y)^2 + (x+y)^2]$ to rewrite the expression further as $5\cdot \frac{1}{2}[(x-y)^2 + (x+y)^2] - 8xy = \frac{5}{2}[(x-y)^2 + (x+y)^2] - 8xy$.

Next, we want to find the relationship between $x$ and $y$ from the equation $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$. Without loss of generality, we can assume that $x \geq 2y$ and $y \geq 2x$. Then, we have $x - 2y + y - 2x = 40$, which simplifies to $-x - y = 40$. So, $x + y = -40$.

Now, we substitute $x + y = -40$ into the expression $\frac{5}{2}[(x-y)^2 + (x+y)^2] - 8xy$ to get $\frac{5}{2}[(x-y)^2 + (-40)^2] - 8xy$. To minimize this expression, we need to minimize $(x-y)^2$. Since $x + y = -40$, we have $x - y = \frac{1}{2}(x + y) - 2y = -20 - 2y$. Therefore, $(x-y)^2 = (-20 - 2y)^2 = 400 + 80y + 4y^2$.

Substituting this back into the expression, we get $\frac{5}{2}(400 + 80y + 4y^2) + 800y - 8xy = 1000 + 200y + 10y^2 + 800y - 8xy = 10y^2 + 1000 + 1000y - 8xy$.

To minimize this expression, we take the derivative with respect to $y$ and set it equal to zero: $20y + 1000 - 8x = 0$. Solving for $y$, we get $y = \frac{8x - 1000}{20} = \frac{2x - 250}{5}$.

Substituting this back into $x + y = -40$, we get $x + \frac{2x - 250}{5} = -40$, which simplifies to $7x = 150$, so $x = \frac{150}{7}$. Substituting this back into $y = \frac{2x - 250}{5}$, we get $y = \frac{2 \cdot \frac{150}{7} - 250}{5} = \frac{300}{7} - 50 = -\frac{200}{7}$.

Finally, we substitute $x = \frac{150}{7}$ and $y = -\frac{200}{7}$ back into the expression $10y^2 + 1000 + 1000y - 8xy$, and we get the minimum value of the expression to be $10 \left(-\frac{200}{7}\right)^2 + 1000 + 1000 \left(-\frac{200}{7}\right) - 8 \cdot \frac{150}{7} \cdot -\frac{200}{7} = -\frac{80000}{7} + 1000 - \frac{200000}{7} + \frac{240000}{7} = -\frac{80000}{7} - \frac{200000}{7} + \frac{240000}{7} + 1000 = \frac{60000}{7} + 1000 = \frac{60000 + 7000}{7} = \frac{67000}{7} = 9571.428571428571$. However, this is not a valid numerical answer.

We made a mistake in our calculations. Let's retrace our steps and correct the mistakes.

From $x + y = -40$, we have $y = -40 - x$. Substituting this into the expression $\frac{5}{2}[(x-y)^2 + (-40)^2] - 8xy$, we get $\frac{5}{2}[(x - (-40 - x))^2 + (-40)^2] - 8x(-40 - x) = \frac{5}{2}[(2x + 40)^2 + 1600] - 8x(-40 - x) = \frac{5}{2}(4x^2 + 1600x + 1600 + 1600) + 320x + 8x^2 = 10x^2 + 4000x + 2000 + 320x + 8x^2 = 18x^2 + 4320x + 2000$.

To minimize this expression, we take the derivative with respect to $x$ and set it equal to zero: $36x + 4320 = 0$. Solving for $x$, we get $x = -\frac{4320}{36} = -120$. Substituting this back into $y = -40 - x$, we get $y = -40 - (-120) = 80$.

Finally, we substitute $x = -120$ and $y = 80$ back into the expression $18x^2 + 4320x + 2000$, and we get the minimum value of the expression to be $18(-120)^2 + 4320(-120) + 2000 = 259200 - 518400 + 2000 = -257200 + 2000 = -255200$. This is still not a valid numerical answer.

Let's retrace our steps again and correct the mistakes.

From $x + y = -40$, we have $y = -40 - x$. Substituting this into the expression $\frac{5}{2}[(x-y)^2 + (-40)^2] - 8xy$, we get $\frac{5}{2}[(x - (-40 - x))^2 + (-40)^2] -

 To solve this problem, we can use the Cauchy-Schwarz inequality. First, let's rewrite the given condition $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$ as $|x-2y| + |2y-x| = 40$, which simplifies to $|x-2y| + |-1*(x-2y)| = 40$. This is equal to $2|x-2y| = 40$, so $|x-2y| = 20$. Now we can apply the Cauchy-Schwarz inequality to the inequality $|x-2y| \le \sqrt{(1^2+(-2)^2)(x^2+y^2)} = \sqrt{5(x^2+y^2)}$. Squaring both sides gives $(x-2y)^2 \le 5(x^2+y^2)$, which simplifies to $x^2 - 4xy + 4y^2 \le 5x^2 + 5y^2$, or $4x^2 + 4y^2 \ge 4xy$. Rearranging terms gives $5x^2 + 5y^2 - 8xy \ge 0$. Therefore, the minimum value of $5x^2 + 5y^2 - 8xy$ is 0. However, this does not satisfy the condition $|x-2y| = 20$. To find the minimum value that does satisfy the condition, we can use the fact that the expression $5x^2 + 5y^2 - 8xy$ can be written as $\frac{1}{2}((x-2y)^2 + (2y-x)^2)$. From $|x-2y| = 20$, we have $(x-2y)^2 = 400$, so $\frac{1}{2}((x-2y)^2 + (2y-x)^2) = \frac{1}{2}(400 + 400) = 400$. Therefore, the minimum value of $5x^2 + 5y^2 - 8xy$ is 400.

The answer is: $400$

 To solve this problem, we can use the Cauchy-Schwarz inequality. The given equation $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$ can be rewritten as $|x-2y| + |2y-x| = 40$, which is equivalent to $|x-2y| = |2y-x|$. This implies that $x-2y = 2y-x$ or $x-2y = x-2y$. Both cases lead to $x = 2y$, so we can substitute $x = 2y$ into the expression $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ to get $5(2y)^2+5y^2-8(2y)y = 20y^2+5y^2-16y^2 = 9y^2$.

Now, we want to find the minimum value of $9y^2$. Since $y^2$ is always non-negative, the minimum value of $9y^2$ is 0, which occurs when $y = 0$. Substituting $y = 0$ into $x = 2y$ gives $x = 0$. Therefore, the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ occurs when $x = 0$ and $y = 0$, and the minimum value is $9 \cdot 0^2 = 0$.

However, this is not the correct answer. The problem statement says that $x$ and $y$ range over all real numbers such that $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$. This condition implies that $x$ and $y$ are not necessarily equal to 0. To find the correct minimum value, we need to consider the condition $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$ further.

By the triangle inequality, $|x-2y| + |y-2x| \geq |x-2y + y-2x| = |x-2y - (y-2x)| = |x-2y - y+2x| = |3x-3y| = 3|x-y|$. So, we have $3|x-y| = 40$, which implies $|x-y| = \frac{40}{3}$.

Now, let's substitute $x = 2y$ into the expression $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$:
\[5(2y)^2+5y^2-8(2y)y = 20y^2+5y^2-16y^2 = 9y^2.\]
To minimize $9y^2$, we need to minimize $|y|$. By the triangle inequality again, we have $|y| = \frac{|x-y|}{3} = \frac{40}{9}$. So, the minimum value of $9y^2$ is $9 \cdot \left(\frac{40}{9}\right)^2 = \frac{1600}{9}$.

Therefore, the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ when $x$ and $y$ range over all real numbers such that $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$ is $\frac{1600}{9}$.

The answer is: $\frac{1600}{9}$

 This problem is a challenge in optimization and inequalities. To solve it, we can use the Cauchy-Schwarz inequality to find the minimum value of the expression.

The Cauchy-Schwarz inequality states that for any real numbers $a_1, a_2, ..., a_n$ and $b_1, b_2, ..., b_n$, we have:
\[(a_1b_1 + a_2b_2 + ... + a_nb_n)^2 \leq (a_1^2 + a_2^2 + ... + a_n^2)(b_1^2 + b_2^2 + ... + b_n^2).\]

In this problem, we can let $a_1 = x$, $a_2 = y$, $b_1 = 2y$, and $b_2 = 2x$. Then, the inequality $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$ can be rewritten as:
\[(a_1b_1 + a_2b_2)^2 = (x \cdot 2y + y \cdot 2x)^2 = (2xy + 2xy)^2 = (4xy)^2 = 16x^2y^2.\]
On the other hand,
\[(a_1^2 + a_2^2)(b_1^2 + b_2^2) = (x^2 + y^2)(4y^2 + 4x^2) = 4(x^2 + y^2)(x^2 + y^2) = 4(x^2 + y^2)^2.\]
By the Cauchy-Schwarz inequality, we have:
\[16x^2y^2 \leq 4(x^2 + y^2)^2.\]
Simplifying, we get:
\[4x^2y^2 \leq (x^2 + y^2)^2.\]
Taking the square root of both sides, we have:
\[2xy \leq \sqrt{(x^2 + y^2)^2} = x^2 + y^2.\]
Rearranging the inequality, we get:
\[x^2 + y^2 - 2xy \geq 0.\]
This inequality can be rewritten as:
\[(x - y)^2 \geq 0.\]
Since the square of any real number is non-negative, the inequality holds true.

Now, we want to minimize the expression $5x^2 + 5y^2 - 8xy$. We can rewrite this expression as:
\[5x^2 + 5y^2 - 8xy = 5(x^2 + y^2) - 8xy = 5[(x - y)^2 + 2xy] - 8xy = 5(x - y)^2 + (10 - 8)xy = 5(x - y)^2 + 2xy.\]
From the inequality $(x - y)^2 \geq 0$, we know that $5(x - y)^2 \geq 0$. Therefore, to minimize the expression $5x^2 + 5y^2 - 8xy$, we need to minimize $2xy$.

From the inequality $2xy \leq x^2 + y^2$, we can conclude that the minimum value of $2xy$ is 0, which occurs when $x = y$. In this case, $x^2 + y^2 - 2xy = 0$, so $(x - y)^2 = 0$. Therefore, the minimum value of $5x^2 + 5y^2 - 8xy$ is achieved when $x = y$.

Let $x = y = t$ for some real number $t$. Then, the inequality $|x - 2y| + |y - 2x| = 40$ becomes:
\[|t - 2t| + |t - 2t| = 40.\]
Simplifying, we get:
\[| - t| + | - t| = 40.\]
This simplifies to:
\[2|t| = 40.\]
So, $|t| = 20$. Since $t$ can be either positive or negative, we have two possible cases: $t = 20$ or $t = -20$.

If $t = 20$, then the minimum value of $5x^2 + 5y^2 - 8xy$ is:
\[5(20)^2 + 5(20)^2 - 8(20)(20) = 2000 + 2000 - 3200 = 800.\]
If $t = -20$, then the minimum value of $5x^2 + 5y^2 - 8xy$ is:
\[5(-20)^2 + 5(-20)^2 - 8(-20)(-20) = 2000 + 2000 - 3200 = 800.\]
In both cases, the minimum value of $5x^2 + 5y^2 - 8xy$ is 800.
The answer is: $800$
