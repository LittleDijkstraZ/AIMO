Approach:


We first need to analyze the given equation \[\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}\] and understand the number of distinct solutions it has for a given value of $m$.

The equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ is a piecewise function, and it has 4 distinct solutions if and only if $\frac{m}{100}$ is less than 2 but greater than or equal to 0. This is because the function on the left side of the equation, $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert$, has a maximum value of 2 and a minimum value of 0.

So, we need to find the number of values of $m$ in the range $0 \leq \frac{m}{100} < 2$. This is equivalent to finding the number of integers in the range $0 \leq m < 200$.

There are exactly 200 integers in this range. Therefore, the number of positive integers $m$ for which the equation has 4 distinct solutions is 200.
The answer is: 200

Solve the following problem with a Python Script (positive numerical answer):

Approach:


We know that the equation $| |x - 1| - 2 | = \frac{m}{100}$ has 4 distinct solutions, which means the expression $|x - 1| - 2$ must oscillate between $\frac{m}{100}$ and $-\frac{m}{100}$ exactly twice.
This implies that $2 \cdot \frac{m}{100} = 2 \cdot \frac{m}{100}$ (since each time it goes from one value to the other, it must pass through 0).
So we have $2 \cdot \frac{m}{100} = 2 \cdot \frac{m}{100}$, which simplifies to $m = 100$.
To verify that this value works, we can substitute it back into the equation and check that it has 4 distinct solutions.

Solution:
Substituting $m = 100$ into the equation, we get $| |x - 1| - 2 | = \frac{100}{100} = 1$.
This equation is equivalent to two separate cases:
Case 1: $|x - 1| - 2 = 1$, which simplifies to $|x - 1| = 3$.
This gives us two more equations: $x - 1 = 3$ and $x - 1 = -3$.
Solving these, we find that $x = 4$ and $x = -2$, respectively.
Case 2: $|x - 1| - 2 = -1$, which simplifies to $|x - 1| = 1$.
This gives us two more equations: $x - 1 = 1$ and $x - 1 = -1$.
Solving these, we find that $x = 2$ and $x = 0$, respectively.
So the equation $| |x - 1| - 2 | = 1$ has 4 distinct solutions: $x = -2, 0, 2, 4$.
Thus, the positive integer $m = 100$ is the only value that makes the equation have 4 distinct solutions.
The answer is: $1$

"For how many positive integers $m$ does the equation \[\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}\] have $4$ distinct solutions?"
Write comments to indicate the steps you take. Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Assistant:

Approach:

 The equation $| |x-1| - 2 | = \frac{m}{100}$ has 4 distinct solutions if and only if $\frac{m}{100}$ is strictly between 1 and 2. This is because the function $| |x-1| - 2 |$ has a graph that is a "V" shape with a maximum at $y=2$ and a minimum at $y=1$. So, the values of $\frac{m}{100}$ that give 4 solutions are those that satisfy $1 < \frac{m}{100} < 2$.

To find the values of $m$ that satisfy this inequality, we can multiply all sides of the inequality by 100 to get $100 < m < 200$.

The number of positive integers $m$ in this range is the difference between 200 and 101, which is $200 - 101 = 99$.

So, the number of positive integers $m$ for which the equation has 4 distinct solutions is 99.

The answer is: $99$

Assistant:

Approach:


The equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has 4 distinct solutions when $\frac{m}{100}$ is the positive difference between two consecutive integers. The only such values for $\frac{m}{100}$ are $\frac{1}{100}, \frac{2}{100}, \frac{3}{100}, ..., \frac{99}{100}$. Therefore, there are 99 possible values for $\frac{m}{100}$. However, since $m$ must be a positive integer, we discard the fractions. This leaves us with the positive integers $1, 2, ..., 99$. Therefore, there are 99 positive integers $m$ that satisfy the given condition.

The answer is: $99$

Approach:


To find the number of positive integers $m$ for which the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has 4 distinct solutions, we need to analyze the behavior of the function $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert$.

The function $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert$ is a "V" shape with a minimum value of 0 and a maximum value of 2.

The equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ will have 4 distinct solutions if $\frac{m}{100}$ falls strictly between 0 and 2, which gives us $0 < \frac{m}{100} < 2$.

Solving this inequality, we get $0 < m < 200$.

The positive integers $m$ that satisfy this inequality are the integers from 1 to 199, inclusive.

So, there are 199 positive integers $m$ for which the equation has 4 distinct solutions.

However, the problem asks for the number of positive integers $m$, not the range of $m$. To find the number of positive integers $m$, we simply count the integers from 1 to 199, inclusive.

Therefore, the number of positive integers $m$ for which the equation has 4 distinct solutions is 199.

The answer is: 199

Assistant:

Approach:

 The number of distinct solutions to the equation $| |x-1|-2|=\frac{m}{100}$ is equal to $4$ if and only if $\frac{m}{100}=2$. This is because the function $| |x-1|-2|$ has a maximum value of $2$ and a minimum value of $0$, and it attains each of these values exactly once for every value of $x$ in its domain.

Solution: If we set $\frac{m}{100}=2$, then we can solve for $m$ by multiplying both sides by $100$ to get $m=200$.

Therefore, the number of positive integers $m$ for which the equation $| |x-1|-2|=\frac{m}{100}$ has $4$ distinct solutions is $1$, namely $m=200$. The answer is: $1$

Solve the following problem with a Python Script (positive numerical answer):

Approach:


We want to find the number of positive integers $m$ such that the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has exactly four distinct solutions.

First, let's consider the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$.
This equation is equivalent to a piecewise function:
If $\vert x-1 \vert -2 \ge 0$, then $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert = \vert x-1 \vert -2$, and the equation becomes $\vert x-1 \vert -2 = \frac{m}{100}$.
If $\vert x-1 \vert -2 < 0$, then $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert = -( \vert x-1 \vert -2 ) = 2 - \vert x-1 \vert$, and the equation becomes $2 - \vert x-1 \vert = \frac{m}{100}$.

Let's solve these two equations separately:
1) $\vert x-1 \vert -2 = \frac{m}{100} \implies \vert x-1 \vert = \frac{m}{100} + 2$.
The absolute value equation splits into two cases:
a) $x-1 = \frac{m}{100} + 2 \implies x = \frac{m}{100} + 3$.
b) $-(x-1) = \frac{m}{100} + 2 \implies x = 1 - \frac{m}{100} - 2 \implies x = - \frac{m}{100} - 1$.

2) $2 - \vert x-1 \vert = \frac{m}{100} \implies \vert x-1 \vert = 2 - \frac{m}{100}$.
This equation splits into two cases:
a) $x-1 = 2 - \frac{m}{100} \implies x = 3 - \frac{m}{100}$.
b) $-(x-1) = 2 - \frac{m}{100} \implies x = -1 + \frac{m}{100}$.

Now we want the four distinct solutions to be positive. 
From the solutions we found, only the solutions from case 1a and case 2b are positive: $x = \frac{m}{100} + 3$ and $x = -1 + \frac{m}{100}$.
Setting these two equal to each other, we have $\frac{m}{100} + 3 = -1 + \frac{m}{100} \implies 4 = -\frac{m}{100} \implies m = -400$. 
But $m$ must be positive, so there are no solutions for this case.

From the solutions we found, only the solutions from case 1b and case 2a are positive: $x = - \frac{m}{100} - 1$ and $x = 3 - \frac{m}{100}$.
Setting these two equal to each other, we have $- \frac{m}{100} - 1 = 3 - \frac{m}{100} \implies 4 = 3 \implies m = 0$. 
But $m$ must be positive, so there are no solutions for this case.

From the solutions we found, only the solutions from case 1b and case 2b are positive: $x = - \frac{m}{100} - 1$ and $x = -1 + \frac{m}{100}$.
Setting these two equal to each other, we have $- \frac{m}{100} - 1 = -1 + \frac{m}{100} \implies 0 = 2 \frac{m}{100} \implies m = 0$. 
But $m$ must be positive, so there are no solutions for this case.

From the solutions we found, only the solutions from case 1a and case 2a are positive: $x = \frac{m}{100} + 3$ and $x = 3 - \frac{m}{100}$.
Setting these two equal to each other, we have $\frac{m}{100} + 3 = 3 - \frac{m}{100} \implies 2 \frac{m}{100} = 0 \implies m = 0$. 
But $m$ must be positive, so there are no solutions for this case.

We conclude that there are no solutions for any of the cases. Therefore, there are no positive integers $m$ such that the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has exactly four distinct solutions. 
The answer is: $0$

Write comments to indicate the steps you take. Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Assistant:

Approach:



The equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has $4$ distinct solutions means that the right-hand side $\frac{m}{100}$ must be less than $2$. This is because if $\frac{m}{100} \geq 2$, then the left-hand side $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert$ will always be less than or equal to $2$, and thus the equation can only have at most $3$ distinct solutions.

Therefore, we need to find the number of positive integers $m$ such that $0 < \frac{m}{100} < 2$. This is equivalent to $0 < m < 200$.

Now, we count the number of positive integers $m$ in this range. Since $m$ starts from $1$ and ends at $199$, there are $199$ positive integers in this range.

Therefore, the number of positive integers $m$ for which the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has $4$ distinct solutions is $199$.

Approach:


We will find the number of positive integers $m$ such that the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has $4$ distinct solutions.

Step 1: Analyze the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$.
The right side $\frac{m}{100}$ must be a positive number, so $m$ must be a positive integer. The left side $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert$ is the distance between $x$ and $1$ subtracted by $2$, and its value is always between $0$ and $4$.

Step 2: Determine the possible values of $\frac{m}{100}$.
For the equation to have $4$ distinct solutions, the possible values of $\frac{m}{100}$ must be $1$, $2$, and $3$. This is because if $\frac{m}{100}$ is less than $1$, there will be at most $2$ solutions; if it's more than $3$, there will also be at most $2$ solutions.

Step 3: Solve for $m$.
To find the values of $m$ corresponding to $1$, $2$, and $3$, we multiply each by $100$:
\[m = 100, 200, 300.\]
These are the only three positive integers $m$ for which the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has $4$ distinct solutions.

Therefore, there are $3$ such positive integers $m$. The answer is: $3$

To solve this problem, we need to find the value of $m$ for which the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has exactly four distinct solutions.

The equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ represents a family of piecewise linear functions, where the number of distinct solutions depends on the value of $\frac{m}{100}$.

When $\frac{m}{100} < 2$, the equation has no solutions because the absolute value function is always non-negative and $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert$ can never be less than 2.

When $\frac{m}{100} = 2$, the equation has exactly two solutions because the absolute value function becomes a piecewise linear function with a single breakpoint at $x=1$.

When $2 \le \frac{m}{100} < 4$, the equation has exactly four distinct solutions because the absolute value function becomes a piecewise linear function with two breakpoints at $x=1-2\frac{m}{100}$ and $x=1+2\frac{m}{100}$.

When $\frac{m}{100} \ge 4$, the equation has no solutions because the absolute value function is always non-negative and $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert$ can never be greater than 2.

Therefore, the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has exactly four distinct solutions when $2 \le \frac{m}{100} < 4$. This means $200 \le m < 400$. The positive integers $m$ in this range are 200, 201, ..., 399, giving a total of 200 possible values.
The answer is: 200

Approach:


The equation $| |x-1| -2| = \frac{m}{100}$ has 4 distinct solutions if and only if $\frac{m}{100}$ is strictly between 1 and 2. This is because the expression $| |x-1| -2|$ oscillates between 0 and 4, and the equation has 4 distinct solutions when the right hand side $\frac{m}{100}$ falls into the range (1, 2). 

Therefore, we need to find the number of positive integers $m$ such that $1 < \frac{m}{100} < 2$.

Solving the inequalities gives $100 < m < 200$. 

So the number of positive integers $m$ that satisfy this condition is $200 - 100 - 1 = 99$. 

So the number of positive integers $m$ that make the equation $| |x-1| -2| = \frac{m}{100}$ have 4 distinct solutions is 99. 

Therefore, the answer is $\boxed{99}$.
The Python code to calculate this is:
```python


INTERMEDIATE OUT :

def count_m():
    lower_bound = 100
    upper_bound = 200

print(result)
```
