To solve this problem, we can use the AM-GM inequality (Arithmetic Mean - Geometric Mean inequality).
We first rewrite the expression $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ as $(x-2y)^2 + (y-2x)^2$ using the algebraic identity $a^2 + b^2 - 2ab = (a-b)^2$.
We then apply the AM-GM inequality to each of the terms $(x-2y)^2$ and $(y-2x)^2$.
The AM-GM inequality states that for any non-negative real numbers $a$ and $b$, we have $a+b \geq 2\sqrt{ab}$.
Applying this inequality to $(x-2y)^2$ and $(y-2x)^2$, we get:
\[(x-2y)^2 + (y-2x)^2 \geq 2\sqrt{(x-2y)^2(y-2x)^2}\]
\[(x-2y)^2 + (y-2x)^2 \geq 2|x-2y||y-2x|\]
We are given that $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$, so we can substitute this into the inequality:
\[(x-2y)^2 + (y-2x)^2 \geq 2*40 = 80\]
Therefore, the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ is 80.
The answer is: 80

Approach:


This problem involves finding the minimum value of a quadratic expression under a constraint. A common technique to solve such problems is to use the method of Lagrange multipliers. The constraint equation can be rewritten as $|x-2y| + |y-2x| - 40 = 0$.

Step 1: Rewrite the constraint equation
We can rewrite the constraint equation as:
\[|x-2y| + |y-2x| - 40 = 0\]
This equation can be further simplified using the property of absolute values $|a-b| = |b-a|$. We have:
\[|x-2y| = |2x-y|\]
So, the constraint equation can be rewritten as:
\[|x-2y| - |2x-y| = 40\]

Step 2: Express the constraint equation in terms of $x$ and $y$
The constraint equation $|x-2y| - |2x-y| = 40$ can be rewritten in terms of $x$ and $y$ as:
\[(x-2y) - (2x-y) = 40\]
Simplifying the equation gives:
\[-x - y = 40\]
Or equivalently:
\[x + y = -40\]

Step 3: Substitute the constraint equation into the quadratic expression
Now we substitute $x + y = -40$ into the quadratic expression $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$. We get:
\[5(x^2+y^2) - 8xy = 5[(x+y)^2 - 2xy] - 8xy = 5[(-40)^2 - 2xy] - 8xy = 8000 - 10xy - 8xy = 8000 - 18xy\]

Step 4: Find the minimum value of the quadratic expression
To find the minimum value of $8000 - 18xy$, we need to find the maximum value of $xy$.
By the AM-GM inequality, we have:
\[xy \leq \left(\frac{x+y}{2}\right)^2 = \left(\frac{-40}{2}\right)^2 = 400\]
Equality occurs when $x=y=-20$. So the maximum value of $xy$ is $400$.

Step 5: Substitute the maximum value of $xy$ into the quadratic expression
Substituting $xy = 400$ into $8000 - 18xy$, we get:
\[8000 - 18 \cdot 400 = 8000 - 7200 = 800\]

Therefore, the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ when $x$ and $y$ range over all real numbers such that $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$ is $800$. The answer is: $800$.

To solve this problem, we will use the inequality $|a| + |b| \geq |a + b|$ for real numbers $a$ and $b$. Applying this inequality to the given condition $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$, we get
\[|x-2y| + |y-2x| \geq |(x-2y) + (y-2x)| = |-x - y| = |-(x+y)| = |x+y|.\]
Hence, $|x+y| = 40$.

Now, let's consider the expression $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$. We can rewrite this as
\[5(x^2+y^2) - 8xy = 5[(x+y)^2 - 2xy] - 8xy = 5(x+y)^2 - 18xy.\]
We know that $|x+y| = 40$, so $(x+y)^2 = 1600$. Substituting this into the expression, we get
\[5(x+y)^2 - 18xy = 5*1600 - 18xy = 8000 - 18xy.\]
To minimize this expression, we need to maximize $18xy$. By AM-GM inequality, we have
\[xy \leq \left(\frac{x+y}{2}\right)^2 = \left(\frac{40}{2}\right)^2 = 400,\]
so $18xy \leq 18*400 = 7200$. Therefore, the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ is $8000 - 7200 = 800$. The answer is: 800

Approach:


The given equation $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$ is a bit complicated to handle directly. However, we can simplify it by noting that $|a| = |-a|$ and $|a| + |b| = |a+b| + |a-b|/2$. Therefore, we have
\begin{align*}
|x-2y| + |y-2x| &= |x-2y| + |2x-y| \\
&= |(x-2y) + (2x-y)| + |(x-2y) - (2x-y)|/2 \\
&= |3x-3y| + |-x+y|/2 \\
&= 3|x-y| + |y-x|/2 \\
&= 3|x-y| - |x-y|/2 \\
&= 7|x-y|/2.
\end{align*}
So we have $7|x-y|/2 = 40$, which implies $|x-y| = 160/7$.

Now we want to minimize the expression $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$. We can rewrite this as $5(x^2+y^2) - 8xy = 5[(x-y)^2 + 2xy] - 8xy = 5(x-y)^2 + 3xy$.

We know that $(x-y)^2 \ge 0$, so $5(x-y)^2 \ge 0$. Therefore, to minimize the expression, we want to minimize $3xy$. Since $|x-y| = 160/7$, we can substitute $y = x + 160/7$ (or $y = x - 160/7$) into the equation $3xy$, and then take the derivative with respect to $x$ to find the minimum.

After calculating the derivative and setting it to zero, we find that $x = y = 80/7$. Substituting these values into the expression $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$, we get the minimum value of $5(80/7)^2 + 5(80/7)^2 - 8(80/7)^2 = 0$. Therefore, the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ is 0. The answer is: $0$

This problem is an application of the Cauchy-Schwarz Inequality. We can rewrite the given expression as $5x^2+5y^2-8xy = \frac{1}{2}((5x-4y)^2 + (4x-5y)^2)$. We can then apply the Cauchy-Schwarz Inequality to find the minimum value of this expression.

The Cauchy-Schwarz Inequality states that for any real numbers $a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n$ and $b_1, b_2, \dots, b_n$, we have $(a_1^2 + a_2^2 + \dots + a_n^2)(b_1^2 + b_2^2 + \dots + b_n^2) \ge (a_1b_1 + a_2b_2 + \dots + a_nb_n)^2$. Equality holds if and only if the ratios $a_1:b_1 = a_2:b_2 = \dots = a_n:b_n$.

In our case, we can set $a_1 = 5x - 4y$, $a_2 = 4x - 5y$, $b_1 = 1$, and $b_2 = 1$. Then we have
\[(a_1^2 + a_2^2)(b_1^2 + b_2^2) \ge (a_1b_1 + a_2b_2)^2.\]
Substituting the values, we get
\[((5x - 4y)^2 + (4x - 5y)^2)(1^2 + 1^2) \ge ((5x - 4y)(1) + (4x - 5y)(1))^2.\]
Simplifying, we get
\[((5x - 4y)^2 + (4x - 5y)^2)(2) \ge ((5x - 4y) + (4x - 5y))^2.\]
This simplifies to
\[((5x - 4y)^2 + (4x - 5y)^2) \ge \left(\frac{1}{2}((5x - 4y) + (4x - 5y))\right)^2.\]
We know that the left-hand side is equal to $5x^2 + 5y^2 - 8xy$, and the right-hand side simplifies to $(x - y)^2$. Thus, we have
\[5x^2 + 5y^2 - 8xy \ge (x - y)^2.\]
Equality holds when $5x - 4y = 4x - 5y$, which gives $x = y$. Therefore, the minimum value of $5x^2 + 5y^2 - 8xy$ occurs when $x = y$.

Now, we need to find the value of $x = y$ that satisfies the constraint $|x - 2y| + |y - 2x| = 40$. Since $x = y$, the constraint becomes $|x - 2x| + |x - 2x| = 40$, which simplifies to $| -x | + | -x | = 40$. This simplifies further to $2|x| = 40$, so $|x| = 20$. Thus, $x = 20$ or $x = -20$.

Finally, we substitute $x = 20$ into the minimum value expression $5x^2 + 5y^2 - 8xy$. Since $x = y$, we get $5x^2 + 5x^2 - 8x^2 = 2x^2$. Substituting $x = 20$, we get $2(20)^2 = 800$. Similarly, if we substitute $x = -20$, we also get $2(-20)^2 = 800$. Therefore, the minimum value of $5x^2 + 5y^2 - 8xy$ is 800.
The answer is: $800$

Solve the following problem with a Python Script (positive numerical answer):

Approach:

 To find the minimum value of the function $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ under the constraint $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$, we can first observe that the constraint equation is symmetric in $x$ and $y$. This suggests that the minimum value should occur when $x=y$. 

So, let's substitute $x=y$ into the function and the constraint equation:

The function becomes $5x^2+5x^2-8x^2 = 2x^2$.

The constraint equation simplifies to $|x-2x| + |x-2x| = 40 \implies |x| + |-x| = 40 \implies 2|x| = 40 \implies |x| = 20$.

So, $x$ must be equal to $\pm 20$.

Now, we evaluate the function $2x^2$ at $x=20$ and $x=-20$:

$2(20^2) = 800$ and $2(-20^2) = 800$.

Therefore, the minimum value of the function $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ under the given constraint is $800$. The answer is: $\boxed{800}$
