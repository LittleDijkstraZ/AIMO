Solve the following problem with a Python Script (positive numerical answer):
"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"
Write comments to indicate the steps you take. Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Approach:


The equation given is a product of two expressions equal to zero. This means that either the first expression is zero or the second expression is zero. 
Let's solve each case separately.
Case 1: $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$
This equation implies that $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$.
The solutions to these absolute value equations are $x + y = 10$ or $x + y = -10$ and $x - y = 10$ or $x - y = -10$.
These four lines form a square with side length 10. The area of this square is $10^2 = 100$.
Case 2: $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$
This equation implies that $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$.
The solutions to these absolute value equations are $x = 8$ or $x = -8$ and $y = 8$ or $y = -8$.
These four lines form a square with side length 16. The area of this square is $16^2 = 256$.
However, the points that satisfy both cases simultaneously form a square with side length 10 (from case 1), so the area of this convex polygon is 100 square units.
The answer is: $100$

Solve the following problem with a Python Script (positive numerical answer):
"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"

Approach:

 The equation $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ implies that either $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$.
If $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$, then $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. This means $x + y = \pm 10$ and $x - y = \pm 10$. Solving these equations gives us the vertices of the square: $(8, 2), (8, -2), (-8, -2), (-8, 2)$.
If $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$, then $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$, which means $x = \pm 8$ and $y = \pm 8$. This gives us the vertices of the square: $(8, 8), (8, -8), (-8, -8), (-8, 8)$.
The vertices of the convex polygon are the intersection of these two squares, which is a square with side length 8. The area of a square is given by the square of its side length, so the area of this square is $8^2 = 64$. The answer is: $64$

Solve the following problem with a Python Script (positive numerical answer):
"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"

Approach:

 The given equation is $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$. If the product of two numbers is zero, then at least one of the numbers must be zero. This gives us two cases to consider.

Case 1: $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$.
For this case, both $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2$ and $( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2$ must be zero. This means that $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. This results in a square with side length $20$ centered at the origin.

Case 2: $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$.
For this case, both $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2$ and $( \vert y \vert - 8)^2$ must be zero. This means that $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$. This results in a square with side length $16$ centered at the origin.

The area of the convex polygon is the sum of the areas of these two squares. The area of a square with side length $a$ is $a^2$. So, the area of the first square is $20^2 = 400$ and the area of the second square is $16^2 = 256$. Adding these together, the total area of the convex polygon is $400 + 256 = 656$.
The answer is: $656$

Approach:


The equation given in the problem is a product of two expressions equal to zero. Therefore, either the first expression is zero or the second expression is zero. We will consider each case and find the points that satisfy each case.

Case 1: $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$
This case implies that $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. This results in the following system of equations:

$$x + y = 10 \quad \text{or} \quad x + y = -10$$
$$x - y = 10 \quad \text{or} \quad x - y = -10$$

Solving this system of equations, we get the points $(5,5)$, $(5,-5)$, $(-5,5)$, and $(-5,-5)$. These points form a square with side length 10. The area of this square is $10^2 = 100$.

Case 2: $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$
This case implies that $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$. This results in the following system of equations:

$$x = 8 \quad \text{or} \quad x = -8$$
$$y = 8 \quad \text{or} \quad y = -8$$

Solving this system of equations, we get the points $(8,8)$, $(8,-8)$, $(-8,8)$, and $(-8,-8)$. These points also form a square with side length 16. The area of this square is $16^2 = 256$.

However, the points from both cases are the same, i.e., they enclose the same square. Therefore, the area of the convex polygon is the area of the square formed by the points from either case.

The answer is: $\boxed{100}$

Solve the following problem with a Python Script (positive numerical answer):
"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"
Write comments to indicate the steps you take. Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Assistant:

Approach:

 The given equation is equal to zero, which means either of the factors must be zero. Therefore, we have two sets of equations: $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ and $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ and $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ and $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$.

Solving these equations, we get the following:

1. For $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$: $\vert x + y \vert = 10$, which gives us $x + y = 10$ or $x + y = -10$.

2. For $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$: $\vert x - y \vert = 10$, which gives us $x - y = 10$ or $x - y = -10$.

3. For $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$: $\vert x \vert = 8$, which gives us $x = 8$ or $x = -8$.

4. For $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$: $\vert y \vert = 8$, which gives us $y = 8$ or $y = -8$.

The solutions of these equations give us the vertices of the polygon: $(8,8)$, $(8,-8)$, $(-8,8)$, and $(-8,-8)$. These points form a square with side length 16. The area of a square is given by side length squared, so the area of the polygon is $16^2 = 256$.
The answer is: 256

Approach:



The given equation is a product of two expressions equal to zero. This means that either the first expression is zero or the second expression is zero. We will consider each case separately.

Case 1: $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$
This equation can only be true if $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. This means that the points $(x, y)$ lie on a square with side length 20.

Case 2: $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$
This equation can only be true if $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$. This means that the points $(x, y)$ lie on a square with side length 16.

Combining the two cases, the points $(x, y)$ that satisfy the given equation are those that lie on the intersection of these two squares. This intersection is a square with side length 8.

The area of a square is given by the square of the side length. Therefore, the area of the convex polygon is $8^2 = 64$.
The answer is: $64$

Approach:

 The equation given is a product of two expressions, set equal to zero. This means that either one of the expressions is zero, or both are zero. We will consider each case and find the points that satisfy the equation.

Case 1: $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$. This implies that $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. This is the equation of a square with side length 20 centered at the origin.

Case 2: $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$. This implies that $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$. This is a square with side length 16 centered at the origin.

The intersection of these two cases is a square with side length 8 centered at the origin. The area of this square is $8^2 = 64$. So the area of the convex polygon is 64. The answer is: $\boxed{64}$

The given equation is $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$. The first equation implies $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$, which are the equations of two lines parallel to the x-axis and y-axis, respectively, and are at a distance of 10 units from the origin. The second equation implies $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$, which are the equations of two lines parallel to the y-axis and x-axis, respectively, and are at a distance of 8 units from the origin.
The intersection of these lines forms a square with side length 16 units. Therefore, the area of the convex polygon is $16^2 = 256$. The answer is: $256$

Solve the following problem with a Python Script (positive numerical answer):
"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"
Write comments to indicate the steps you take. Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Assistant:

Approach:


The equation given is $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$. This equation is equal to zero if either of the two factors is zero. Therefore, we can set each factor to zero and solve for the points that satisfy the equation.

The solutions to the first factor being zero are:
$\vert x + y \vert - 10 = 0 \Rightarrow \vert x + y \vert = 10 \Rightarrow x + y = \pm 10$
$\vert x - y \vert - 10 = 0 \Rightarrow \vert x - y \vert = 10 \Rightarrow x - y = \pm 10$

These lines intersect at four points: $(5,5), (5,-5), (-5,5), (-5,-5)$.

The solutions to the second factor being zero are:
$\vert x \vert - 8 = 0 \Rightarrow \vert x \vert = 8 \Rightarrow x = \pm 8$
$\vert y \vert - 8 = 0 \Rightarrow \vert y \vert = 8 \Rightarrow y = \pm 8$

These lines also intersect at four points: $(8,0), (0,8), (-8,0), (0,-8)$.

Combining the points from both factors, we get a total of eight points: $(5,5), (5,-5), (-5,5), (-5,-5), (8,0), (0,8), (-8,0), (0,-8)$.

The eight points form a square with side length $10$, hence the area of the square is $10^2 = 100$.

So the area of the convex polygon is $100$. The answer is: $100$

Solve the following problem with a Python Script (positive numerical answer):
"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"
Write comments to indicate the steps you take. Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Assistant:

Approach:



The equation is satisfied when either of the factors is equal to zero. This implies that either $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$.

Solving these equations, we get:

1. $\vert x + y \vert = 10 \implies x + y = \pm 10$ or $x + y = 0$
2. $\vert x - y \vert = 10 \implies x - y = \pm 10$ or $x - y = 0$
3. $\vert x \vert = 8 \implies x = \pm 8$
4. $\vert y \vert = 8 \implies y = \pm 8$

The solution set is the intersection of all these lines. This gives us the vertices of a square with side length 10. The area of the square is $10^2 = 100$. So the area of the convex polygon is 100.
The answer is: $100$
