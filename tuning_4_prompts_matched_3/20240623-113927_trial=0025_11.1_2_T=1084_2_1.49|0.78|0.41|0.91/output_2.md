Question (hint: positive numerical answer):
"For how many positive integers $m$ does the equation \[\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}\] have $4$ distinct solutions?"
Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:


The equation $| |x - 1| - 2 | = \frac{m}{100}$ has 4 distinct solutions if and only if $\frac{m}{100}$ is in the range of the function $| |x - 1| - 2 |$.
The function $| |x - 1| - 2 |$ is equal to 3 when $x$ is less than 1, equal to 1 when $1 \leq x \leq 3$, equal to $-(x - 3) + 2 = 5 - x$ when $3 < x < 5$, equal to 1 when $5 \leq x \leq 7$, and equal to 3 when $x$ is greater than 7.
Therefore, the range of the function is $[0, 3]$. So, $\frac{m}{100}$ must be in the interval $(0, 3]$.
This means $0 < \frac{m}{100} \leq 3$, and we multiply each part of the inequality by 100 to get $0 < m \leq 300$.
The positive integers $m$ that satisfy this inequality are 1, 2, ..., 300.
However, the question asks for the number of positive integers $m$ for which the equation has 4 distinct solutions. By looking at the graph of the function $| |x - 1| - 2 |$, we can see that the value of $\frac{m}{100}$ must be 1 for the equation to have 4 distinct solutions. Therefore, the number of positive integers $m$ is 1. The answer is: $1$

Question (hint: positive numerical answer):
"For how many positive integers $m$ does the equation \[\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}\] have $4$ distinct solutions?"
Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:


The equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has $4$ distinct solutions if and only if $\frac{m}{100}$ is equal to $2$. This is because the expression on the left, $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert$, can take on exactly $4$ distinct values, namely $0$, $1$, $2$, and $3$. But it can never be less than zero, so the only way it can have $4$ distinct solutions is when it is equal to $2$. Therefore, we must have $\frac{m}{100}=2$, which implies $m=200$. So the only positive integer $m$ for which the equation has $4$ distinct solutions is $200$. The answer is: $1$

Question (hint: positive numerical answer):
"For how many positive integers $m$ does the equation \[\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}\] have $4$ distinct solutions?"
Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:


The equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has 4 distinct solutions,
which means that the right-hand side $\frac{m}{100}$ is between 1 and 2.
This is because the absolute value function $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert$ ranges from 1 to 3 when $x$ varies over the real numbers, and the graph of this function is V-shaped with the vertex at $x=1$.
Therefore, $1 < \frac{m}{100} < 2$, which gives $100 < m < 200$.
The positive integers $m$ in this range are 101, 102, ..., 199,
and there are $199 - 101 + 1 = 99$ such numbers.
Therefore, the number of positive integers $m$ is 99.
The answer is: $99$

Question (hint: positive numerical answer):
"For how many positive integers $m$ does the equation \[\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}\] have $4$ distinct solutions?"
Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:


To solve the problem, we need to understand the structure of the equation and how it behaves. The equation \[\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}\] has four distinct solutions, which means the expression on the left-hand side (LHS) equals to $\frac{m}{100}$ four times. 

We can analyze the graph of $y = \vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert$ to find the possible values of $\frac{m}{100}$. The graph is a "V" shape with two "humps" separated by a valley at $y = 2$. The "height" of the humps (the maximum and minimum values of $y$) is 2. 

So, for the equation to have four distinct solutions, the height of the humps, $\frac{m}{100}$, must be less than 2 and greater than 0. Therefore, the possible values of $m$ are those integers from 1 to 199 (not including 0 and 200) because $0 < \frac{m}{100} < 2$. 

To find the number of such integers, we can simply subtract the smallest possible value of $m$ from the largest possible value of $m$, and then add 1 (because both endpoints are included). So the number of possible values of $m$ is $199 - 1 + 1 = 199$. 

So the number of positive integers $m$ such that the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has four distinct solutions is 199. The answer is: $199$

Question (hint: positive numerical answer):
"For how many positive integers $m$ does the equation \[\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}\] have $4$ distinct solutions?"
Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:


The equation $| |x-1|-2|=\frac{m}{100}$ has 4 distinct solutions if and only if $\frac{m}{100}=2$.
To see this, note that the expression $| |x-1|-2|$ is a "V" shape with two arms, each of which is 2 units away from the $y$-axis. Therefore, for $| |x-1|-2|$ to equal 2, the horizontal distance between the "V" shape and the $y$-axis must be exactly 2 units.
Setting $\frac{m}{100}=2$, we can solve for $m$ to find $m=200$.
Therefore, the number of positive integers $m$ that satisfy the condition is 1. The answer is: $\boxed{1}$

Question (hint: positive numerical answer):
"For how many positive integers $m$ does the equation \[\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}\] have $4$ distinct solutions?"
Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:


To begin with, we want the expression $||x-1|-2|=\frac{m}{100}$ to have four distinct solutions. This implies that the right side $\frac{m}{100}$ must be positive, because if it were non-positive, the left side would always be non-negative and thus the equation could not have four distinct solutions. Therefore, $m$ must be a positive integer.
Next, we analyze the equation $||x-1|-2|=\frac{m}{100}$. This is a compound absolute value equation, and we can break it down into two cases:
Case 1: $|x-1|-2=\frac{m}{100}$ or $|x-1|-2=-\frac{m}{100}$.
For the first equation $|x-1|-2=\frac{m}{100}$, we add 2 to both sides to get $|x-1|=\frac{m}{100}+2$. This equation will have two solutions if $\frac{m}{100}+2>0$.
For the second equation $|x-1|-2=-\frac{m}{100}$, we add 2 to both sides to get $|x-1|=2-\frac{m}{100}$. This equation will have two solutions if $2-\frac{m}{100}>0$.
Combining these two cases, we need $2-\frac{m}{100}>0$ and $\frac{m}{100}+2>0$. The first inequality simplifies to $2-\frac{m}{100}>0$, which is equivalent to $\frac{m}{100}<2$, and multiplying both sides by 100 gives $m<200$. The second inequality $\frac{m}{100}+2>0$ is equivalent to $\frac{m}{100}>-2$, and multiplying both sides by 100 gives $m>-200$. However, since $m$ is a positive integer, the only values of $m$ that satisfy both inequalities are $100<m<200$. The positive integers in this range are the integers from 101 to 199, inclusive. The number of such integers is $199-101+1=99$.
Therefore, the value of the unknown variable $m$ is any integer from 101 to 199 inclusive. To count the number of possible values of $m$, we can simply subtract the smallest value from the largest value and add 1. So, there are $199 - 101 + 1 = 99$ possible values for $m$. The answer is: $99$

Question (hint: positive numerical answer):
"For how many positive integers $m$ does the equation \[\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}\] have $4$ distinct solutions?"
Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:


The equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has 4 distinct solutions when $\frac{m}{100}=2$. This is because the expression inside the absolute value on the left side, $\vert x-1 \vert -2$, can take on the value of $\frac{m}{100}$ twice: once when it is positive and once when it is negative. So we have:
\[\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}=2.\]
To solve this equation, we first set up two cases:
Case 1: $\vert x-1 \vert -2 = 2$.
Adding 2 to both sides gives us $\vert x-1 \vert = 4$.
This splits into two more cases:
Case 1a: $x-1 = 4$, giving $x = 5$.
Case 1b: $x-1 = -4$, giving $x = -3$.
So the solutions from Case 1 are $x = 5$ and $x = -3$.

Case 2: $\vert x-1 \vert -2 = -2$.
Adding 2 to both sides gives us $\vert x-1 \vert = 0$.
This implies that $x-1 = 0$, so $x = 1$.
So the solution from Case 2 is $x = 1$.

The four distinct solutions are therefore $x = 5$, $x = -3$, and $x = 1$.
This means that $m = 2 \cdot 100 = 200$.
The value of $m$ that makes the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ have 4 distinct solutions is $m = 200$. So the answer is $1$. The answer is: 1
