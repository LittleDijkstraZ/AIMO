Question (hint: positive numerical answer):
"Let $k, l > 0$ be parameters. The parabola $y = kx^2 - 2kx + l$ intersects the line $y = 4$ at two points $A$ and $B$. These points are distance 6 apart. What is the sum of the squares of the distances from $A$ and $B$ to the origin?"
Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:


First, we set the equation of the parabola equal to the equation of the line to find the x-coordinates of points $A$ and $B$:
\[kx^2 - 2kx + l = 4.\]
Rearranging the equation gives:
\[kx^2 - 2kx + l - 4 = 0.\]
Let $x_1$ and $x_2$ be the x-coordinates of points $A$ and $B$, respectively. We know that $|x_2 - x_1| = 6$. By the quadratic formula, we have:
\[x = \frac{2k \pm \sqrt{4k^2 - 4k(l - 4)}}{2k} = 1 \pm \frac{\sqrt{4k^2 - 4k(l - 4)}}{2k} = 1 \pm \frac{\sqrt{4k^2 - 4kl + 16k}}{2k}.\]
Taking the difference of the roots, we get:
\[x_2 - x_1 = \frac{\sqrt{4k^2 - 4kl + 16k}}{k}.\]
But we are given that $|x_2 - x_1| = 6$, so:
\[6 = \frac{\sqrt{4k^2 - 4kl + 16k}}{k}.\]
Squaring both sides gives:
\[36 = \frac{4k^2 - 4kl + 16k}{k^2}.\]
Multiplying through by $k^2$ gives:
\[36k^2 = 4k^2 - 4kl + 16k.\]
Simplifying this equation gives:
\[32k^2 + 4kl - 16k = 0.\]
Dividing through by 4 gives:
\[8k^2 + kl - 4k = 0.\]
We can solve this equation for $l$:
\[l = \frac{-8k^2 + 4k}{k} = -8k + 4.\]
The distance from a point $(x, y)$ to the origin is $\sqrt{x^2 + y^2}$. To find the sum of the squares of the distances from $A$ and $B$ to the origin, we substitute the equation of the parabola into the distance formula. For point $A$ with coordinates $(x_1, kx_1^2 - 2kx_1 + l)$, the distance squared is:
\[x_1^2 + (kx_1^2 - 2kx_1 + l)^2 = x_1^2 + k^2x_1^4 - 4k^2x_1^3 + 4k^3x_1^2 - 2k^2x_1^2 + 4klx_1 - l^2.\]
Similarly, the distance squared for point $B$ with coordinates $(x_2, kx_2^2 - 2kx_2 + l)$ is:
\[x_2^2 + (kx_2^2 - 2kx_2 + l)^2 = x_2^2 + k^2x_2^4 - 4k^2x_2^3 + 4k^3x_2^2 - 2k^2x_2^2 + 4klx_2 - l^2.\]
The sum of these two distances squared is:
\[(x_1^2 + x_2^2) + (k^2x_1^4 - 4k^2x_1^3 + 4k^3x_1^2 - 2k^2x_1^2 + 4klx_1 - l^2) + (k^2x_2^4 - 4k^2x_2^3 + 4k^3x_2^2 - 2k^2x_2^2 + 4klx_2 - l^2).\]
Since $x_1^2 + x_2^2 = (x_1 + x_2)^2 - 2x_1x_2 = \left( \frac{\sqrt{4k^2 - 4kl + 16k}}{k} \right)^2 - 2x_1x_2$, and $x_1x_2 = \frac{l - 4}{k}$, we have:
\[x_1^2 + x_2^2 = \frac{4k^2 - 4kl + 16k - 4(l - 4)}{k^2} = \frac{4k^2 - 4kl + 16k - 4l + 16}{k^2} = \frac{4k^2 - 4kl + 16k - 4(-8k + 4) + 16}{k^2} = \frac{4k^2 - 4kl + 16k + 32k - 16 + 16}{k^2} = \frac{4k^2 - 4kl + 48k}{k^2}.\]
Substituting this into the sum of the distances squared gives:
\[(x_1^2 + x_2^2) + (k^2x_1^4 - 4k^2x_1^3 + 4k^3x_1^2 - 2k^2x_1^2 + 4klx_1 - l^2) + (k^2x_2^4 - 4k^2x_2^3 + 4k^3x_2^2 - 2k^2x_2^2 + 4klx_2 - l^2) = \frac{4k^2 - 4kl + 48k}{k^2} + (k^2x_1^4 - 4k^2x_1^3 + 4k^3x_1^2 - 2k^2x_1^2 + 4klx_1 - l^2) + (k^2x_2^4 - 4k^2x_2^3 + 4k^3x_2^2 - 2k^2x_2^2 + 4klx_2 - l^2).\]
This expression simplifies to:
\[8k + 32k = 40k.\]
Since $l = -8k + 4$, we can substitute this into the equation $6 = \frac{\sqrt{4k^2 - 4kl + 16k}}{k}$ to get:
\[6 = \frac{\sqrt{4k^2 - 4k(-8k + 4) + 16k}}{k}.\]
Simplifying this gives:
\[6 = \frac{\sqrt{4k^2 + 32k^2 - 16k^2 + 16k}}{k} = \frac{\sqrt{24k^2 + 16k}}{k}.\]
Squaring both sides gives:
\[36 = \frac{24k^2 + 16

Question (hint: positive numerical answer):
"Let $k, l > 0$ be parameters. The parabola $y = kx^2 - 2kx + l$ intersects the line $y = 4$ at two points $A$ and $B$. These points are distance 6 apart. What is the sum of the squares of the distances from $A$ and $B$ to the origin?"
Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:


The line $y = 4$ intersects the parabola $y = kx^2 - 2kx + l$ when $kx^2 - 2kx + l = 4$.
So we have the quadratic equation $kx^2 - 2kx + l - 4 = 0$.
Let $x_1$ and $x_2$ be the x-coordinates of points $A$ and $B$, respectively.
Since the points are distance 6 apart, we have $(x_2 - x_1)^2 = 36$.
By Vieta's formulas, we know that $x_1 + x_2 = \frac{2k}{k} = 2$ and $x_1x_2 = \frac{l - 4}{k}$.
Squaring both sides of the equation $x_2 - x_1 = 6$, we get $(x_2 - x_1)^2 = 36$, which simplifies to $x_2^2 - 2x_1x_2 + x_1^2 = 36$.
Substituting $x_1 + x_2 = 2$ and $x_1x_2 = \frac{l - 4}{k}$ into the equation, we get $4 - 2\left(\frac{l - 4}{k}\right) + \left(\frac{l - 4}{k}\right)^2 = 36$.
Simplifying this equation, we get $4 - \frac{2(l - 4)}{k} + \frac{(l - 4)^2}{k^2} = 36$.
Multiplying through by $k^2$, we get $4k^2 - 2k(l - 4) + (l - 4)^2 = 36k^2$.
Expanding and rearranging terms, we get $(l - 4)^2 - 2k(l - 4) + 4k^2 - 36k^2 = 0$.
Simplifying further, we get $(l - 4)^2 - 2k(l - 4) - 32k^2 = 0$.
This is a quadratic equation in terms of $l - 4$.
Let $m = l - 4$. Then the equation becomes $m^2 - 2km - 32k^2 = 0$.
By Vieta's formulas, we know that $m_1 + m_2 = 2k$ and $m_1m_2 = -32k^2$.
The distance from a point $(x, y)$ to the origin is given by $\sqrt{x^2 + y^2}$.
For point $A$, which has coordinates $(x_1, 4)$, the distance to the origin is $\sqrt{x_1^2 + 4^2} = \sqrt{x_1^2 + 16}$.
For point $B$, which has coordinates $(x_2, 4)$, the distance to the origin is $\sqrt{x_2^2 + 16}$.
We want to find $(OA)^2 + (OB)^2 = (x_1^2 + 16) + (x_2^2 + 16) = x_1^2 + x_2^2 + 32$.
We know that $(x_1 + x_2)^2 - 2x_1x_2 = x_1^2 + x_2^2$, so $x_1^2 + x_2^2 = (2)^2 - 2\left(\frac{l - 4}{k}\right) = 4 - 2\left(\frac{l - 4}{k}\right)$.
Substituting this into the equation for the sum of the squares of the distances, we get $(OA)^2 + (OB)^2 = 4 - 2\left(\frac{l - 4}{k}\right) + 32 = 36 - 2\left(\frac{l - 4}{k}\right)$.
Substituting $m = l - 4$, we get $(OA)^2 + (OB)^2 = 36 - 2\left(\frac{m}{k}\right) = 36 - \frac{2m}{k}$.
Since $m_1 + m_2 = 2k$, we can substitute $m_1 + m_2 = 2k$ into the equation to get $(OA)^2 + (OB)^2 = 36 - \frac{2(m_1 + m_2)}{k} = 36 - \frac{4k}{k} = 36 - 4 = 32$.
Therefore, the sum of the squares of the distances from $A$ and $B$ to the origin is 32.
The value of the expression is $\boxed{32}$. The answer is: 32

Question (hint: positive numerical answer):
"Let $k, l > 0$ be parameters. The parabola $y = kx^2 - 2kx + l$ intersects the line $y = 4$ at two points $A$ and $B$. These points are distance 6 apart. What is the sum of the squares of the distances from $A$ and $B$ to the origin?"
Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:


First, we find the points of intersection between the parabola $y = kx^2 - 2kx + l$ and the line $y = 4$.
Setting the two equations equal to each other, we get $4 = kx^2 - 2kx + l$. Rearranging, we get the quadratic equation $kx^2 - 2kx + (l - 4) = 0$.
Since the parabola intersects the line at two points, the quadratic equation has two distinct roots, say $x_1$ and $x_2$. These are the $x$-coordinates of points $A$ and $B$, and by the distance formula, the distance between $A$ and $B$ is given by $|x_2 - x_1| = 6$.

By the quadratic formula, the roots of the quadratic equation are given by $x = \frac{2k \pm \sqrt{4k^2 - 4k(l - 4)}}{2k} = 1 \pm \frac{\sqrt{4k^2 - 4k(l - 4)}}{2k} = 1 \pm \frac{\sqrt{4k^2 - 4kl + 16k}}{2k}$.
Since the distance between $A$ and $B$ is 6, we have $ \left| \frac{\sqrt{4k^2 - 4kl + 16k}}{2k} \right| = 3$. Squaring both sides, we get $\frac{4k^2 - 4kl + 16k}{4k^2} = 9$.
Simplifying, we get $4k^2 - 4kl + 16k = 36k^2$. Rearranging terms, we have $32k^2 = 4kl$, so $8k = l$.

Now, we want to find the sum of the squares of the distances from $A$ and $B$ to the origin. The coordinates of $A$ and $B$ are $(x_1, 4)$ and $(x_2, 4)$, respectively. The distance from a point $(x, y)$ to the origin is $\sqrt{x^2 + y^2}$, so the distances from $A$ and $B$ to the origin are $\sqrt{x_1^2 + 4^2}$ and $\sqrt{x_2^2 + 4^2}$, respectively.
The sum of the squares of these distances is $\left(x_1^2 + 16\right) + \left(x_2^2 + 16\right) = x_1^2 + x_2^2 + 32$.

By the sum of squares formula, we have $x_1^2 + x_2^2 = (x_1 + x_2)^2 - 2x_1x_2$.
From the quadratic formula, we know that $x_1 + x_2 = \frac{2k}{k} = 2$ and $x_1x_2 = \frac{l - 4}{k} = \frac{8k - 4}{k} = 4$.
Substituting these values, we get $x_1^2 + x_2^2 = 2^2 - 2 \cdot 4 = 4 - 8 = -4$.
However, this is not possible, as the sum of squares cannot be negative.

Let's re-examine our work. When we squared the equation $|x_2 - x_1| = 6$ to get $ \left| \frac{\sqrt{4k^2 - 4kl + 16k}}{2k} \right| = 3$, we should have squared the equation correctly, but instead we only squared the absolute value, which led to an incorrect result.

The correct way to square the equation $|x_2 - x_1| = 6$ is to square both sides, which gives $(x_2 - x_1)^2 = 36$.
Using the difference of squares, we have $x_2^2 - 2x_1x_2 + x_1^2 = 36$.

From the quadratic formula, we know that $x_1x_2 = 4$.
Substituting this into the equation above, we get $x_2^2 - 2(4) + x_1^2 = 36$, so $x_2^2 + x_1^2 = 36 + 8 = 44$.
Finally, the sum of the squares of the distances from $A$ and $B$ to the origin is $x_1^2 + x_2^2 + 32 = 44 + 32 = 76$.
The answer is: $76$

Question (hint: positive numerical answer):
"Let $k, l > 0$ be parameters. The parabola $y = kx^2 - 2kx + l$ intersects the line $y = 4$ at two points $A$ and $B$. These points are distance 6 apart. What is the sum of the squares of the distances from $A$ and $B$ to the origin?"
Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:


The parabola $y = kx^2 - 2kx + l$ intersects the line $y = 4$ at two points $A$ and $B$, which means that the values of $x$ for which $kx^2 - 2kx + l - 4 = 0$ have two solutions, say $x_1$ and $x_2$. Since the points are distance 6 apart, we have $|x_2 - x_1| = 6$. By Vieta's formulas, $x_1 + x_2 = \frac{2k}{k} = 2$ and $x_1x_2 = \frac{l - 4}{k}$. Since $(x_2 - x_1)^2 = (x_1 + x_2)^2 - 4x_1x_2$, we have $36 = 4 - 4\left(\frac{l - 4}{k}\right)$, which gives us $l - 4 = -\frac{9k}{4}$.
The sum of the squares of the distances from $A$ and $B$ to the origin is $x_1^2 + x_2^2 = (x_1 + x_2)^2 - 2x_1x_2 = 4 - 2\left(\frac{l - 4}{k}\right) = 4 + \frac{9k}{2}$.
We already found that $l - 4 = -\frac{9k}{4}$, so we can substitute to get $4 + \frac{9k}{2} = 4 - \frac{9}{2} = \frac{7}{2}$. The answer is $\boxed{\frac{7}{2}}$.

Question (hint: positive numerical answer):
"Let $k, l > 0$ be parameters. The parabola $y = kx^2 - 2kx + l$ intersects the line $y = 4$ at two points $A$ and $B$. These points are distance 6 apart. What is the sum of the squares of the distances from $A$ and $B$ to the origin?"
Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:


First, we find the $x$-coordinates of $A$ and $B$ by setting $y = 4$ in the equation of the parabola:
$$4 = kx^2 - 2kx + l.$$
Rearranging terms, we get the quadratic equation:
$$kx^2 - 2kx + (l - 4) = 0.$$
The solutions to this equation, which represent the $x$-coordinates of $A$ and $B$, are given by the quadratic formula:
$$x = \frac{2k \pm \sqrt{(2k)^2 - 4k(l - 4)}}{2k} = 1 \pm \frac{\sqrt{4k^2 - 4k(l - 4)}}{2k} = 1 \pm \frac{\sqrt{4k^2 - 4kl + 16k}}{2k}.$$
Since the distance between $A$ and $B$ is 6, we have:
$$\left| \left(1 + \frac{\sqrt{4k^2 - 4kl + 16k}}{2k}\right) - \left(1 - \frac{\sqrt{4k^2 - 4kl + 16k}}{2k}\right) \right| = 6.$$
Simplifying the left-hand side, we get:
$$\frac{2\sqrt{4k^2 - 4kl + 16k}}{2k} = 6.$$
Thus, $\sqrt{4k^2 - 4kl + 16k} = 6k$. Squaring both sides, we obtain:
$$4k^2 - 4kl + 16k = 36k^2.$$
Rearranging terms, we have:
$$32k^2 = 4kl,$$
and solving for $l$, we get:
$$l = \frac{32k^2}{4k} = 8k.$$
The sum of the squares of the distances from $A$ and $B$ to the origin is given by:
$$(1 + \frac{\sqrt{4k^2 - 4kl + 16k}}{2k})^2 + (1 - \frac{\sqrt{4k^2 - 4kl + 16k}}{2k})^2.$$
Expanding and simplifying, we obtain:
$$\left(1 + \frac{\sqrt{4k^2 - 4kl + 16k}}{2k}\right)^2 + \left(1 - \frac{\sqrt{4k^2 - 4kl + 16k}}{2k}\right)^2 = 2\left(1 + \frac{16k}{4k}\right) = 2(1 + 4) = 10.$$
Therefore, the sum of the squares of the distances from $A$ and $B$ to the origin is 10.
The value of the expression $k^2 + l^2$ for $k = 1$ and $l = 8k = 8$ is $1^2 + 8^2 = 1 + 64 = 65$.
So, the sum of the squares of the distances from $A$ and $B$ to the origin is 65. The answer is: 65. The answer is: 65

Question (hint: positive numerical answer):
"Let $k, l > 0$ be parameters. The parabola $y = kx^2 - 2kx + l$ intersects the line $y = 4$ at two points $A$ and $B$. These points are distance 6 apart. What is the sum of the squares of the distances from $A$ and $B$ to the origin?"
Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:


First, we need to find the x-coordinates of points $A$ and $B$. Since the parabola $y = kx^2 - 2kx + l$ intersects the line $y = 4$, we can set the two equations equal to each other and solve for x:
\[4 = kx^2 - 2kx + l.\]
Rearranging the equation gives:
\[kx^2 - 2kx + (l - 4) = 0.\]
Let $x_1$ and $x_2$ be the roots of this equation. Then by Vieta's formulas, we know that the sum of the roots is $x_1 + x_2 = \frac{2k}{k} = 2$ and the product of the roots is $x_1x_2 = \frac{l - 4}{k}$.
Since the distance between $A$ and $B$ is 6, we have $(x_2 - x_1)^2 = 6^2 = 36$. By the difference of squares, this gives $(x_2 - x_1)^2 = (x_2 + x_1)^2 - 4x_1x_2 = 36$. Substituting the values from Vieta's formulas, we have $4 - 4\left(\frac{l - 4}{k}\right) = 36$. Simplifying gives $4k - 4l + 16 = 36$, or $4k - 4l = 20$, which simplifies to $k - l = 5$.

Next, we want to find the sum of the squares of the distances from $A$ and $B$ to the origin. The distance from a point $(x, y)$ to the origin is $\sqrt{x^2 + y^2}$. For point $A$, which has x-coordinate $x_1$, the y-coordinate is $4$, so the distance to the origin is $\sqrt{x_1^2 + 4^2} = \sqrt{x_1^2 + 16}$. Similarly, for point $B$, the distance to the origin is $\sqrt{x_2^2 + 16}$.
The sum of the squares of the distances from $A$ and $B$ to the origin is then $(\sqrt{x_1^2 + 16})^2 + (\sqrt{x_2^2 + 16})^2 = x_1^2 + 16 + x_2^2 + 16 = x_1^2 + x_2^2 + 32$.
By the difference of squares, we know that $(x_2 - x_1)^2 = (x_2 + x_1)^2 - 4x_1x_2 = 36$. Substituting the values from Vieta's formulas, we have $(2)^2 - 4\left(\frac{l - 4}{k}\right) = 36$, which simplifies to $4 - 4\left(\frac{l - 4}{k}\right) = 36$. Simplifying gives $4k - 4l + 16 = 36$, or $4k - 4l = 20$, which we already know is true.
So we can conclude that $x_1^2 + x_2^2 = (x_1 + x_2)^2 - 2x_1x_2 = 2^2 - 2\left(\frac{l - 4}{k}\right) = 4 - 2\left(\frac{l - 4}{k}\right)$.
From the equation $k - l = 5$, we can solve for $l$ in terms of $k$: $l = k - 5$. Substituting this into the expression for $x_1^2 + x_2^2$, we have $x_1^2 + x_2^2 = 4 - 2\left(\frac{(k - 5) - 4}{k}\right) = 4 - 2\left(\frac{k - 9}{k}\right) = 4 - 2 + \frac{18}{k} = 2 + \frac{18}{k}$.
Finally, the sum of the squares of the distances from $A$ and $B$ to the origin is $x_1^2 + x_2^2 + 32 = 2 + \frac{18}{k} + 32 = 34 + \frac{18}{k}$.

However, we know from the equation $k - l = 5$ that $k > l$. Since $l = k - 5$, we have $k > k - 5$, or $0 > -5$, which is always true. Therefore, the value of $k$ is positive.

Now, we need to find the value of $k$. From the equation $k - l = 5$, we can substitute $l = k - 5$ to get $k - (k - 5) = 5$, which simplifies to $5 = 5$. This is true, so our value of $k$ is correct.

Finally, substituting $k = 5$ into the expression $34 + \frac{18}{k}$, we have $34 + \frac{18}{5} = 34 + \frac{18}{5} = \frac{170 + 18}{5} = \frac{188}{5}$.

So the sum of the squares of the distances from $A$ and $B$ to the origin is $\frac{188}{5}$.
The answer is: $\boxed{\frac{188}{5}}$

Question (hint: positive numerical answer):
"Let $k, l > 0$ be parameters. The parabola $y = kx^2 - 2kx + l$ intersects the line $y = 4$ at two points $A$ and $B$. These points are distance 6 apart. What is the sum of the squares of the distances from $A$ and $B$ to the origin?"
Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:



To find the points $A$ and $B$, we set the equation of the parabola equal to the equation of the line and solve for $x$. 
\[kx^2 - 2kx + l = 4 \implies kx^2 - 2kx + l - 4 = 0.\]
Let the roots of this equation be $x_1$ and $x_2$, which represent the x-coordinates of points $A$ and $B$ respectively. Since they are distance 6 apart, we know that $(x_2 - x_1)^2 = 36$. Using Vieta's formulas, we know that $x_1 + x_2 = \frac{2k}{k} = 2$ and $x_1x_2 = \frac{l - 4}{k}$. We can use the difference of squares identity to expand $(x_2 - x_1)^2$:
\[(x_2 - x_1)^2 = (x_2 + x_1)^2 - 4x_1x_2 = 4^2 - 4\left(\frac{l - 4}{k}\right) = 36.\]
Simplifying, we have $16 - \frac{4l - 16}{k} = 36$, which gives us $\frac{4l - 16}{k} = 20$ or $4l - 16 = 20k$. Rearranging, we have $4l = 20k + 16$, or $l = 5k + 4$.

The distance from a point $(x, y)$ to the origin is $\sqrt{x^2 + y^2}$. To find the sum of the squares of the distances from $A$ and $B$ to the origin, we need to calculate $(x_1^2 + y_1^2) + (x_2^2 + y_2^2)$. We know that $y_1 = kx_1^2 - 2kx_1 + l$ and $y_2 = kx_2^2 - 2kx_2 + l$. Substituting these into the above expression, we get:
\[(x_1^2 + (kx_1^2 - 2kx_1 + l)^2) + (x_2^2 + (kx_2^2 - 2kx_2 + l)^2).\]
We already know that $x_1 + x_2 = 2$ and $x_1x_2 = \frac{l - 4}{k}$. We can use these relations to simplify the expression. Let's start with $x_1^2 + x_2^2$:
\[(x_1^2 + x_2^2) = (x_1 + x_2)^2 - 2x_1x_2 = 2^2 - 2\left(\frac{l - 4}{k}\right) = 4 - \frac{2l - 8}{k} = 4 - \frac{2(5k + 4) - 8}{k} = 4 - \frac{10k + 8 - 8}{k} = 4 - \frac{10k}{k} = 4 - 10 = -6.\]
However, the square of a real number cannot be negative, which indicates that we have made a mistake somewhere. 

Let's try another approach. Notice that $x_1^2 + y_1^2 + x_2^2 + y_2^2 = (x_1^2 + x_2^2) + (y_1^2 + y_2^2)$. By the distance formula, we know that $y_1^2 + y_2^2 = (kx_1^2 - 2kx_1 + l)^2 + (kx_2^2 - 2kx_2 + l)^2$. We can expand and simplify this expression, but it is quite complicated. 

Instead, let's use the fact that the sum of the squares of the distances from $A$ and $B$ to the origin is equal to the square of the distance from the midpoint of $A$ and $B$ to the origin, plus half the square of the distance between $A$ and $B$. The midpoint of $A$ and $B$ is $\left(\frac{x_1 + x_2}{2}, \frac{y_1 + y_2}{2}\right) = \left(1, \frac{k - 2k + l}{2}\right) = \left(1, \frac{l}{2}\right)$. The distance from this midpoint to the origin is $\sqrt{1 + \left(\frac{l}{2}\right)^2}$. The square of this distance is $1 + \left(\frac{l}{2}\right)^2$. The square of the distance between $A$ and $B$ is $(x_2 - x_1)^2 = 36$. So the sum of the squares of the distances from $A$ and $B$ to the origin is $\left(1 + \left(\frac{l}{2}\right)^2\right) + \frac{36}{2} = 1 + \left(\frac{l}{2}\right)^2 + 18$.

We already know that $l = 5k + 4$. Substituting this into the above expression, we have $1 + \left(\frac{5k + 4}{2}\right)^2 + 18 = 1 + \left(\frac{25k^2 + 40k + 16}{4}\right) + 18 = 1 + \frac{25k^2 + 40k + 16}{4} + 18 = \frac{25k^2 + 40k + 16 + 4 + 72}{4} = \frac{25k^2 + 40k + 82}{4}$.

We don't have enough information to determine the value of $k$, so we cannot calculate the exact sum of the squares of the distances. However, we have found a formula for this sum in terms of $k$: $\frac{25k^2 + 40k + 82}{4}$.

Since the final answer does not involve any unknown quantities, we know that the sum of the squares of the distances from $A$ and $B$ to the origin is constant. In other words, it does not depend on the value of $k$. So the sum of the squares of the distances from $A$ and $B$ to the origin is always the same, regardless of the value of $k$.

Let's try a numerical example. If we let $k = 1$, we find that $l = 9$. The parabola $y = x^2 - 2x + 9$ intersects the line $y = 4$ at two points $A$ and $B$. Using the quadratic formula, we find that the x-coordinates of these points are approximately $0.5359$ and $1.4641$, and the sum of

Question (hint: positive numerical answer):
"Let $k, l > 0$ be parameters. The parabola $y = kx^2 - 2kx + l$ intersects the line $y = 4$ at two points $A$ and $B$. These points are distance 6 apart. What is the sum of the squares of the distances from $A$ and $B$ to the origin?"
Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:


To find the $x$-coordinates of points $A$ and $B$, we set $kx^2 - 2kx + l = 4$, so $kx^2 - 2kx + l - 4 = 0$. Let $x_1$ and $x_2$ be the solutions to this equation, so $x_1$ and $x_2$ are the $x$-coordinates of $A$ and $B$. By the quadratic formula, $x_{1,2} = \frac{2k \pm \sqrt{(2k)^2 - 4k(l-4)}}{2k} = 1 \pm \sqrt{1 - \frac{l-4}{k}}$. We are given that $x_2 - x_1 = 6$, so $6 = 2\sqrt{1 - \frac{l-4}{k}}$. Squaring both sides, we get $9 = 1 - \frac{l-4}{k}$, so $\frac{l-4}{k} = -8$. Solving for $l$, we find $l = 4 - 8k$.

The distance from a point $(x, y)$ to the origin is $\sqrt{x^2 + y^2}$. So the square of the distance from point $A$ with coordinates $(x_1, 4)$ to the origin is $x_1^2 + 4^2 = x_1^2 + 16$, and the square of the distance from point $B$ with coordinates $(x_2, 4)$ to the origin is $x_2^2 + 16$. The sum of the squares of the distances from $A$ and $B$ to the origin is therefore $(x_1^2 + 16) + (x_2^2 + 16) = x_1^2 + x_2^2 + 32$.

We know that $x_1 + x_2 = 2$ and $x_1x_2 = 1 - \frac{l-4}{k} = 9$, so we can use the identity $x_1^2 + x_2^2 = (x_1 + x_2)^2 - 2x_1x_2 = 4 - 2(9) = -14$. Thus, the sum of the squares of the distances from $A$ and $B$ to the origin is $-14 + 32 = 18$. The answer is: $18$

Question (hint: positive numerical answer):
"Let $k, l > 0$ be parameters. The parabola $y = kx^2 - 2kx + l$ intersects the line $y = 4$ at two points $A$ and $B$. These points are distance 6 apart. What is the sum of the squares of the distances from $A$ and $B$ to the origin?"
Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:


To find the points of intersection, we set $kx^2 - 2kx + l = 4$. Rearranging terms, we have $kx^2 - 2kx + l - 4 = 0$. Let's call this equation (1).

We know that the distance between the two points of intersection is 6. The distance between two points $(x_1, y_1)$ and $(x_2, y_2)$ is given by $\sqrt{(x_2-x_1)^2 + (y_2-y_1)^2}$. Since the points are on the line $y = 4$, we only need to find the difference in their $x$-coordinates. Let's call the two points $A$ and $B$, and let $x_A$ and $x_B$ be their $x$-coordinates. Then we have:

$$\sqrt{(x_B - x_A)^2} = 6 \Rightarrow (x_B - x_A)^2 = 36.$$

From the quadratic formula, the roots of equation (1) are:

$$x = \frac{2k \pm \sqrt{(2k)^2 - 4k(l-4)}}{2k} = 1 \pm \sqrt{1 - \frac{l-4}{k}}.$$

So, $x_B - x_A = \sqrt{1 - \frac{l-4}{k}} - (1 - \sqrt{1 - \frac{l-4}{k}}) = 2\sqrt{1 - \frac{l-4}{k}}$. Thus, we have:

$$(2\sqrt{1 - \frac{l-4}{k}})^2 = 36 \Rightarrow 1 - \frac{l-4}{k} = 9.$$

Solving for $k$, we get:

$$1 - \frac{l-4}{k} = 9 \Rightarrow \frac{l-4}{k} = -8 \Rightarrow l - 4 = -8k \Rightarrow l = 4 - 8k.$$

Now we need to find the sum of the squares of the distances from $A$ and $B$ to the origin. The distance from a point $(x, y)$ to the origin is $\sqrt{x^2 + y^2}$. For point $A$ (with $x$-coordinate $x_A = 1 - \sqrt{1 - \frac{l-4}{k}}$) and $y$-coordinate $y_A = 4$, we have:

$$d_A = \sqrt{(1 - \sqrt{1 - \frac{l-4}{k}})^2 + 4^2}.$$

Similarly, for point $B$ (with $x$-coordinate $x_B = 1 + \sqrt{1 - \frac{l-4}{k}}$) and $y$-coordinate $y_B = 4$, we have:

$$d_B = \sqrt{(1 + \sqrt{1 - \frac{l-4}{k}})^2 + 4^2}.$$

We want $d_A^2 + d_B^2$. Let's first find $d_A^2$:

$$d_A^2 = (1 - \sqrt{1 - \frac{l-4}{k}})^2 + 16.$$

And $d_B^2$:

$$d_B^2 = (1 + \sqrt{1 - \frac{l-4}{k}})^2 + 16.$$

Adding $d_A^2$ and $d_B^2$, we get:

$$d_A^2 + d_B^2 = 2(1 - \frac{l-4}{k} + 16) = 2(17 - \frac{l-4}{k}).$$

Substituting $l = 4 - 8k$ into the equation, we get:

$$d_A^2 + d_B^2 = 2(17 - \frac{4 - 8k - 4}{k}) = 2(17 + 8) = 50.$$

So the sum of the squares of the distances from $A$ and $B$ to the origin is 50. The answer is: $50$.

Question (hint: positive numerical answer):
"Let $k, l > 0$ be parameters. The parabola $y = kx^2 - 2kx + l$ intersects the line $y = 4$ at two points $A$ and $B$. These points are distance 6 apart. What is the sum of the squares of the distances from $A$ and $B$ to the origin?"
Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:



The parabola $y = kx^2 - 2kx + l$ intersects the line $y = 4$ at two points $A$ and $B$, which means that when we substitute $y = 4$ into the equation of the parabola, we get a quadratic equation:
\[4 = kx^2 - 2kx + l.\]
Rearranging the terms, we get a quadratic equation:
\[kx^2 - 2kx + l - 4 = 0.\]
The roots of this quadratic equation are the x-coordinates of points $A$ and $B$, and we know that the distance between $A$ and $B$ is 6. So the difference of the roots is 6 divided by the coefficient of $x$ in the quadratic equation, which is $\frac{6}{k}$.

By Vieta's formulas, the sum of the roots is $\frac{2k}{k}=2$. So, the roots are $1$ and $1 - \frac{6}{k}$.

Now we want to find the sum of the squares of the distances from $A$ and $B$ to the origin. The distance from a point $(x, y)$ to the origin is $\sqrt{x^2 + y^2}$. Since the points are on the line $y = 4$, we only need to consider the $x$-coordinate of the points. So the sum of the squares of the distances is
\[(1)^2 + (1 - \frac{6}{k})^2 = 1 + (1 - \frac{6}{k})^2.\]
We know that the sum of the roots is 2, which gives us $1 + (1 - \frac{6}{k}) = 2$. Solving for $k$ gives $k = 3$.

Substitute $k = 3$ into the expression we obtained for the sum of the squares of the distances:
\[1 + (1 - \frac{6}{3})^2 = 1 + (1 - 2)^2 = 1 + (-1)^2 = 1 + 1 = 2.\]
So the sum of the squares of the distances from $A$ and $B$ to the origin is 2.
The answer is: $2$

Question (hint: positive numerical answer):
"Let $k, l > 0$ be parameters. The parabola $y = kx^2 - 2kx + l$ intersects the line $y = 4$ at two points $A$ and $B$. These points are distance 6 apart. What is the sum of the squares of the distances from $A$ and $B$ to the origin?"
Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:


The parabola $y = kx^2 - 2kx + l$ intersects the line $y = 4$ at two points $A$ and $B$, so we can substitute $y = 4$ into the equation of the parabola to get $4 = kx^2 - 2kx + l$. This is a quadratic equation and we can rearrange it to the standard form $kx^2 - 2kx + (l - 4) = 0$. Let's call this equation $(1)$.

We are given that the points $A$ and $B$ are distance 6 apart, so if we denote the coordinates of $A$ as $(x_1, 4)$ and the coordinates of $B$ as $(x_2, 4)$, then $|x_2 - x_1| = 6$.

Now, let's find the sum of the squares of the distances from $A$ and $B$ to the origin. The distance from a point $(x, y)$ to the origin is $\sqrt{x^2 + y^2}$, so the square of the distance from $A$ to the origin is $x_1^2 + 4^2 = x_1^2 + 16$ and the square of the distance from $B$ to the origin is $x_2^2 + 4^2 = x_2^2 + 16$.

Therefore, the sum of the squares of the distances from $A$ and $B$ to the origin is $x_1^2 + 16 + x_2^2 + 16 = x_1^2 + x_2^2 + 32$.

Recall that for any quadratic equation of the form $ax^2 + bx + c = 0$, the sum of the squares of the roots is given by $\frac{b^2 - 2ac}{a^2}$. In equation $(1)$, $a = k$, $b = -2k$, and $c = l - 4$. Therefore, $x_1^2 + x_2^2 = \frac{(-2k)^2 - 2k(l - 4)}{k^2} = \frac{4k^2 - 2kl + 8k}{k^2} = \frac{4k - 2l + 8}{k}$.

Substituting this into the sum of the squares of the distances gives $x_1^2 + x_2^2 + 32 = \frac{4k - 2l + 8}{k} + 32 = \frac{4k - 2l + 8 + 32k}{k} = \frac{36k - 2l + 8}{k}$.

Finally, we need to find the value of this expression. But we don't have enough information to find the values of $k$ and $l$. However, we can use the condition $|x_2 - x_1| = 6$ to form another equation. The discriminant of equation $(1)$ is $(-2k)^2 - 4k(l - 4) = 4k^2 - 4kl + 16k$. Since the equation has two distinct roots, the discriminant should be positive, so $4k^2 - 4kl + 16k > 0$. This simplifies to $k^2 - kl + 4k > 0$.

Now, let's multiply the equation $|x_2 - x_1| = 6$ by itself to get $(x_2 - x_1)^2 = 36$, which simplifies to $x_2^2 - 2x_1x_2 + x_1^2 = 36$. Substituting $x_1^2 + x_2^2 = \frac{4k - 2l + 8}{k}$ and $2x_1x_2 = \frac{2(l - 4)}{k}$ into this equation gives $\frac{4k - 2l + 8}{k} - \frac{2(l - 4)}{k} = 36$, which simplifies to $\frac{4k - 2l + 8 - 2l + 8}{k} = 36$.

This simplifies to $\frac{4k - 4l + 16}{k} = 36$, which further simplifies to $4k - 4l + 16 = 36k$. Rearranging gives $32k = 4l - 16$, or $8k = l - 4$.

Now we can substitute this into the expression for the sum of the squares of the distances: $\frac{36k - 2l + 8}{k} = \frac{36k - 2(8k + 4) + 8}{k} = \frac{36k - 16k - 8 + 8}{k} = \frac{20k}{k} = 20$.

Therefore, the sum of the squares of the distances from $A$ and $B$ to the origin is 20. The answer is: $20$

"Let $k, l > 0$ be parameters. The parabola $y = kx^2 - 2kx + l$ intersects the line $y = 4$ at two points $A$ and $B$. These points are distance 6 apart. What is the sum of the squares of the distances from $A$ and $B$ to the origin?"
Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:


To solve this problem, we first need to find the coordinates of points $A$ and $B$.

Setting $y = 4$ in the equation of the parabola gives:
\[4 = kx^2 - 2kx + l.\]
Rearranging terms, we get a quadratic equation:
\[kx^2 - 2kx + (l - 4) = 0.\]
Let the roots of this equation be $x_1$ and $x_2$, which represent the x-coordinates of points $A$ and $B$ respectively. By the properties of quadratic equations, we know that the sum of the roots $x_1 + x_2 = \frac{2k}{k} = 2$ and the product of the roots $x_1x_2 = \frac{l - 4}{k}$.

We are given that the distance between $A$ and $B$ is 6, which means $(x_2 - x_1)^2 = 6^2 = 36$.
By the difference of squares, we have $(x_2 - x_1)^2 = (x_2 + x_1)^2 - 4x_1x_2 = 4^2 - 4\left(\frac{l - 4}{k}\right) = 36$. Simplifying, we get $16 - \frac{4l - 16}{k} = 36$, or $\frac{4l - 16}{k} = -20$. This implies $4l - 16 = -20k$, or $4l = -20k + 16$. Solving for $l$, we get $l = -5k + 4$.

Now, we want to find the sum of the squares of the distances from $A$ and $B$ to the origin. The distance from a point $(x, y)$ to the origin is $\sqrt{x^2 + y^2}$. The $y$-coordinates of $A$ and $B$ are both 4 (since they lie on the line $y = 4$). Thus, the distance from $A$ to the origin is $\sqrt{x_1^2 + 4^2}$ and the distance from $B$ to the origin is $\sqrt{x_2^2 + 4^2}$.

The sum of the squares of these distances is:
\[(\sqrt{x_1^2 + 4^2})^2 + (\sqrt{x_2^2 + 4^2})^2 = x_1^2 + 16 + x_2^2 + 16 = (x_1^2 + x_2^2) + 32.\]
By the Pythagorean identity, $x_1^2 + x_2^2 = (x_1 + x_2)^2 - 2x_1x_2 = 2^2 - 2\left(\frac{l - 4}{k}\right) = 4 - 2\left(\frac{-5k + 4 - 4}{k}\right) = 4 + 10 = 14$.

Thus, the sum of the squares of the distances from $A$ and $B$ to the origin is $14 + 32 = 46$. The answer is: $46$

Question (hint: positive numerical answer):
"Let $k, l > 0$ be parameters. The parabola $y = kx^2 - 2kx + l$ intersects the line $y = 4$ at two points $A$ and $B$. These points are distance 6 apart. What is the sum of the squares of the distances from $A$ and $B$ to the origin?"
Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:


To find the coordinates of points $A$ and $B$, we set the equations $y = kx^2 - 2kx + l$ and $y = 4$ equal to each other and solve for $x$:
\[kx^2 - 2kx + l = 4.\]
Rearranging the terms, we get the quadratic equation:
\[kx^2 - 2kx + (l - 4) = 0.\]
We are given that $A$ and $B$ are distance 6 apart, which means the difference of the roots of the quadratic equation is 6. The difference of the roots of a quadratic equation $ax^2 + bx + c = 0$ is given by $\sqrt{\frac{b^2 - 4ac}{a}}$. Therefore, we have:
\[\sqrt{\frac{(-2k)^2 - 4(k)(l - 4)}{k}} = 6.\]
Simplifying the equation, we get:
\[\sqrt{\frac{4k^2 - 4k(l - 4)}{k}} = 6.\]
Squaring both sides to eliminate the square root, we have:
\[\frac{4k^2 - 4k(l - 4)}{k} = 36.\]
Multiplying both sides by $k$, we get:
\[4k^2 - 4k(l - 4) = 36k.\]
Rearranging the terms, we have:
\[4k^2 - 36k - 4kl + 16k = 0.\]
We can factor out a common factor of 4 from the left side of the equation:
\[4(k^2 - 9k - kl + 4k) = 0.\]
Dividing both sides by 4, we have:
\[k^2 - 9k - kl + 4k = 0.\]
We can rearrange the equation:
\[k^2 - (9 - 4)k - kl = 0.\]
Simplifying, we get:
\[k^2 - 5k - kl = 0.\]
Now, we want to find the sum of the squares of the distances from $A$ and $B$ to the origin. The distance from a point $(x, y)$ to the origin $(0, 0)$ is given by $\sqrt{x^2 + y^2}$. The coordinates of $A$ and $B$ are the solutions of the quadratic equation, so let $x_1$ and $x_2$ be the $x$-coordinates of $A$ and $B$ respectively. Then, the sum of the squares of the distances from $A$ and $B$ to the origin is:
\[(x_1^2 + y_1^2) + (x_2^2 + y_2^2).\]
Since $y_1 = y_2 = 4$, we can simplify the expression:
\[(x_1^2 + 4^2) + (x_2^2 + 4^2) = x_1^2 + x_2^2 + 32.\]
We know that the sum of the roots of a quadratic equation $ax^2 + bx + c = 0$ is given by $-\frac{b}{a}$, and the product of the roots is given by $\frac{c}{a}$. Therefore, we have:
\[x_1 + x_2 = \frac{5}{k} \quad \text{and} \quad x_1x_2 = \frac{l}{k}.\]
We want to find $x_1^2 + x_2^2$, which can be expressed as:
\[(x_1 + x_2)^2 - 2x_1x_2 = \left(\frac{5}{k}\right)^2 - 2\left(\frac{l}{k}\right).\]
Simplifying, we get:
\[x_1^2 + x_2^2 = \frac{25}{k^2} - \frac{2l}{k}.\]
Substituting this into the expression for the sum of the squares of the distances, we have:
\[x_1^2 + x_2^2 + 32 = \frac{25}{k^2} - \frac{2l}{k} + 32.\]
We know that $k^2 - 5k - kl = 0$, which we can rewrite as $k^2 = 5k + kl$. Substituting this into the expression for the sum of the squares of the distances, we have:
\[x_1^2 + x_2^2 + 32 = \frac{25}{5k + kl} - \frac{2l}{k} + 32.\]
Simplifying the expression, we get:
\[x_1^2 + x_2^2 + 32 = \frac{25}{5k + kl} - \frac{2l(5k + kl)}{k(5k + kl)} + 32.\]
Combining the fractions, we have:
\[x_1^2 + x_2^2 + 32 = \frac{25 - 10l^2 - 10kl}{5k + kl} + 32.\]
Simplifying further, we get:
\[x_1^2 + x_2^2 + 32 = \frac{25 - 10l^2 - 10kl + 160k + 32kl}{5k + kl}.\]
Combining the terms in the numerator, we have:
\[x_1^2 + x_2^2 + 32 = \frac{25 - 10l^2 - 10kl + 160k + 32kl}{5k + kl}.\]
The numerator simplifies to:
\[x_1^2 + x_2^2 + 32 = \frac{25 + 160k - 10l^2}{5k + kl}.\]
We are given that the difference of the roots of the quadratic equation is 6, which means $\sqrt{\frac{b^2 - 4ac}{a}} = 6$. Squaring both sides, we have:
\[\frac{b^2 - 4ac}{a} = 36.\]
Substituting $b = -5k$, $a = k$, and $c = -kl$, we get:
\[\frac{(-5k)^2 - 4(k)(-kl)}{k} = 36.\]
Simplifying, we have:
\[\frac{25k^2 + 4k^2l}{k} = 36.\]
Multiplying both sides by $k$, we get:
\[25k^2 + 4k^2l = 36k.\]
Rearranging the terms, we have:
\[4k^2l - 36k + 25k^2 = 0.\]
Dividing both sides by $k$, we get:
\[4kl - 36 + 25k = 0.\]
Rearranging the terms, we have:
\[4kl = 36 - 25

Question (hint: positive numerical answer):
"Let $k, l > 0$ be parameters. The parabola $y = kx^2 - 2kx + l$ intersects the line $y = 4$ at two points $A$ and $B$. These points are distance 6 apart. What is the sum of the squares of the distances from $A$ and $B$ to the origin?"
Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:



Setting $y = 4$ in the equation of the parabola gives $4 = kx^2 - 2kx + l$.
Rearranging terms, we have $kx^2 - 2kx + (l-4) = 0$.
Let $x_1$ and $x_2$ be the x-coordinates of points $A$ and $B$, respectively. Then by the distance formula, the distance between $A$ and $B$ is $\sqrt{(x_2-x_1)^2+(0-0)^2} = |x_2-x_1| = 6$. Given that the parabola and line intersect at two points, the quadratic equation has two distinct real roots. Therefore, we can use the formula for the difference of roots to find that $x_2-x_1 = \frac{b}{a} = \frac{2k}{k} = 2$. This is consistent with the given condition that $|x_2-x_1|=6$, so we have $x_2-x_1 = 2$.

Now, let's find the sum of the squares of the distances from $A$ and $B$ to the origin. The distance from a point $(x, y)$ to the origin $(0,0)$ is $\sqrt{x^2+y^2}$. Therefore, the sum of the squares of the distances from $A$ and $B$ to the origin is $(x_1^2 + y_1^2) + (x_2^2 + y_2^2)$.

Since the line $y = 4$ is horizontal, $y_1 = y_2 = 4$. Then the sum of the squares of the distances is $x_1^2 + y_1^2 + x_2^2 + y_2^2 = x_1^2 + 16 + x_2^2 + 16 = x_1^2 + x_2^2 + 32$.

We can use the formula for the sum of the squares of the roots of a quadratic equation, which is $x_1^2 + x_2^2 = (x_1 + x_2)^2 - 2x_1x_2$. We already know that $x_1 + x_2 = \frac{-b}{a} = \frac{2k}{k} = 2$ and $x_1x_2 = \frac{c}{a} = \frac{l-4}{k}$. So, $x_1^2 + x_2^2 = 2^2 - 2*\frac{l-4}{k} = 4 - 2*\frac{l-4}{k}$.

Therefore, the sum of the squares of the distances from $A$ and $B$ to the origin is $4 - 2*\frac{l-4}{k} + 32 = 36 - 2*\frac{l-4}{k}$.

However, we need to find the value of this expression in terms of $k$ and $l$. We know that the line $y = 4$ intersects the parabola $y = kx^2 - 2kx + l$, so we can substitute $y = 4$ into the parabola equation to get $4 = kx^2 - 2kx + l$. This gives us $kx^2 - 2kx + l - 4 = 0$. The discriminant of this quadratic equation is $(-2k)^2 - 4*k*(l - 4) = 4k^2 - 4k*(l - 4) = 4k^2 - 4kl + 16k$.

But we also know that the quadratic equation has two distinct real roots, so the discriminant must be greater than zero. Therefore, we have $4k^2 - 4kl + 16k > 0$.

Dividing by 4 gives $k^2 - kl + 4k > 0$. Rearranging terms, we get $k^2 + 4k > kl$.

We want to express the sum of the squares of the distances in terms of $k$ and $l$. From the above inequality, we know that $k^2 + 4k > kl$, so we can rearrange to get $k^2 + 4k - kl > 0$. This simplifies to $k^2 + 4k - kl > 0$.

Now we can substitute this into the expression for the sum of the squares of the distances: $36 - 2*\frac{l-4}{k} = 36 - 2*(l - 4)/k = 36 - 2l/k + 8/k = 44 - 2l/k$.

From the inequality $k^2 + 4k - kl > 0$, we can rearrange to get $k(k + 4 - l) > 0$. Since $k$ is positive, this implies that $k + 4 - l > 0$. Rearranging terms, we get $k > l - 4$.

Substituting this into the expression for the sum of the squares of the distances, we have $44 - 2l/k = 44 - 2l/(l - 4)$. This expression is the sum of the squares of the distances from $A$ and $B$ to the origin in terms of $k$ and $l$.

To find the numerical value, we need to find the specific values of $k$ and $l$. We can use the fact that the line $y = 4$ intersects the parabola $y = kx^2 - 2kx + l$ at two points, so we can substitute $y = 4$ into the equation of the parabola to get $4 = kx^2 - 2kx + l$. Solving this equation for $l$ gives $l = kx^2 - 2kx + 4$.

We also know that the points of intersection have a distance of 6 between them. This means that the difference of the x-coordinates of the points of intersection is 2. If $x_1$ and $x_2$ are the x-coordinates of the points of intersection, then $x_2 - x_1 = 2$.

From the equation $4 = kx^2 - 2kx + l$, we can substitute $l = kx^2 - 2kx + 4$ to get $4 = kx^2 - 2kx + kx^2 - 2kx + 4$, which simplifies to $0 = 2kx^2 - 4kx$. Dividing by 2k gives $0 = x^2 - 2x$. This equation factors to $0 = x(x - 2)$. So, the possible values for $x$ are 0 and 2. But we know that $x_2 - x_1 = 2$, so one of the values must be the smaller root $x_1$ and the other value must be the larger root $x_2$. Therefore, $x_1 = 0$ and $x_2 = 2$.

Now we can find the values of $k$ and $l

Question (hint: positive numerical answer):
"Let $k, l > 0$ be parameters. The parabola $y = kx^2 - 2kx + l$ intersects the line $y = 4$ at two points $A$ and $B$. These points are distance 6 apart. What is the sum of the squares of the distances from $A$ and $B$ to the origin?"
Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:


First, we set the equation of the parabola equal to 4: $4 = kx^2 - 2kx + l$.
Rearranging, we get $kx^2 - 2kx + l - 4 = 0$.
Let $x_1$ and $x_2$ be the x-coordinates of points $A$ and $B$ respectively.
Since the points are distance 6 apart, we have $(x_2 - x_1)^2 = 36$.
Using Vieta's formulas, we know that $x_1 + x_2 = \frac{2k}{k} = 2$ and $x_1x_2 = \frac{l - 4}{k}$.
By the difference of squares, we have $(x_2 - x_1)^2 = (x_2 + x_1)^2 - 4x_1x_2 = 4 - 4\left(\frac{l - 4}{k}\right) = 36$.
This simplifies to $4 - \frac{4l - 16}{k} = 36$.
Multiplying through by $k$ gives $4k - 4l + 16 = 36k$.
Rearranging, we get $36k - 4k = 4l - 16$, or $32k = 4l - 16$.
Dividing both sides by 4, we have $8k = l - 4$.
Adding 4 to both sides gives $l = 8k + 4$.
We substitute this into the equation of the parabola to get $4 = kx^2 - 2kx + 8k + 4$.
Rearranging, we have $kx^2 - 2kx + 8k = 0$.
Now we use the quadratic formula to find the x-coordinates of $A$ and $B$:
$$x = \frac{-(-2k) \pm \sqrt{(-2k)^2 - 4(k)(8k)}}{2(k)} = \frac{2k \pm \sqrt{4k^2 - 32k^2}}{2k} = \frac{2k \pm \sqrt{-28k^2}}{2k}.$$
Since we are looking for real solutions, we must have $-28k^2 \geq 0$, which implies $k = 0$ or $k < 0$.
But we are given that $k > 0$, so we must have $-28k^2 < 0$, which is a contradiction.
Therefore, our assumption that there are real solutions for $x$ must be incorrect.
This means that there must be no intersection between the parabola and the line $y = 4$.
This can only happen if the vertex of the parabola lies above the line $y = 4$.
The vertex of the parabola $y = kx^2 - 2kx + l$ is at $(1, k - 2k + l) = (1, l)$.
Setting $l > 4$, we find $8k + 4 > 4$, or $8k > 0$, which is true since $k > 0$.
Therefore, we have found a valid set of parameters.
Now, we want to find the sum of the squares of the distances from $A$ and $B$ to the origin.
Let $A$ and $B$ be $(x_1, 4)$ and $(x_2, 4)$ respectively.
The distance from $A$ to the origin is $\sqrt{x_1^2 + 4^2} = \sqrt{x_1^2 + 16}$, and the distance from $B$ to the origin is $\sqrt{x_2^2 + 16}$.
The sum of the squares of these distances is $(x_1^2 + 16) + (x_2^2 + 16) = x_1^2 + x_2^2 + 32$.
Using Vieta's formulas again, we know that $x_1^2 + x_2^2 = (x_1 + x_2)^2 - 2x_1x_2 = 2^2 - 2\left(\frac{l - 4}{k}\right) = 4 - 2\left(\frac{8k + 4 - 4}{k}\right) = 4 - 16 = -12$.
Therefore, the sum of the squares of the distances from $A$ and $B$ to the origin is $-12 + 32 = 20$. The answer is: 20

Question (hint: positive numerical answer):
"Let $k, l > 0$ be parameters. The parabola $y = kx^2 - 2kx + l$ intersects the line $y = 4$ at two points $A$ and $B$. These points are distance 6 apart. What is the sum of the squares of the distances from $A$ and $B$ to the origin?"
Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:


First, let's set $y = 4$ in the equation of the parabola, so we have: $4 = kx^2 - 2kx + l$. Rearranging the terms, we get $kx^2 - 2kx + l - 4 = 0$. This is a quadratic equation in $x$, and we know that it has two solutions $x = A$ and $x = B$, which are the x-coordinates of the points of intersection. We're also given that $|A - B| = 6$, which is the distance between $A$ and $B$.

Now, let's find the sum of the squares of the distances from $A$ and $B$ to the origin. The distance from a point $(x, y)$ to the origin $(0, 0)$ is $\sqrt{x^2 + y^2}$, so for point $A$, the distance is $\sqrt{A^2 + (kA^2 - 2kA + l)^2}$ and for point $B$, it's $\sqrt{B^2 + (kB^2 - 2kB + l)^2}$. We want to find the sum of the squares of these distances, which is

$$(A^2 + (kA^2 - 2kA + l)^2) + (B^2 + (kB^2 - 2kB + l)^2).$$

We know that $A$ and $B$ are the roots of the quadratic equation $kx^2 - 2kx + l - 4 = 0$, so by Vieta's formulas, we have $A + B = \frac{2k}{k} = 2$ and $AB = \frac{l - 4}{k}$.

We also know that $|A - B| = 6$, so $(A - B)^2 = 36$. Expanding, we get $A^2 - 2AB + B^2 = 36$. We can substitute $A + B = 2$ and $AB = \frac{l - 4}{k}$ into this equation to get

$$4 - 2\left(\frac{l - 4}{k}\right) + \left(\frac{l - 4}{k}\right)^2 = 36.$$

Solving this equation for $l$, we get $l = 6$.

Now, we can substitute $l = 6$ back into the sum of the squares of the distances to get

$$(A^2 + (kA^2 - 2kA + 6)^2) + (B^2 + (kB^2 - 2kB + 6)^2).$$

We can simplify this expression by using the fact that $A + B = 2$ and $AB = \frac{2}{k}$:

$$(A^2 + (2A - 2kA + 6)^2) + (B^2 + (2B - 2kB + 6)^2).$$

This simplifies to:

$$(A^2 + (2A - 2kA + 6)^2) + ((2 - A)^2 + (2(2 - A) - 2k(2 - A) + 6)^2).$$

Expanding and simplifying this expression, we get:

$$4A^2 - 24kA + 144 + 4A^2 - 24A + 144.$$

Combining like terms, we have:

$$8A^2 - 24(A + k)A + 288.$$

Substituting $A + B = 2$ and $AB = \frac{2}{k}$ into this expression, we get:

$$8\left(\frac{2}{k}\right) - 24(2) \cdot \frac{2}{k} + 288.$$

Simplifying this expression, we get:

$$\frac{16}{k} - \frac{96}{k} + 288 = \frac{16 - 96}{k} + 288 = \frac{-80}{k} + 288.$$

Finally, substituting $k = 1$ (since the parabola $y = kx^2 - 2kx + l$ is already in standard form), we get:

$$\frac{-80}{1} + 288 = -80 + 288 = 208.$$
The sum of the squares of the distances from $A$ and $B$ to the origin is 208.
The answer is: 208
