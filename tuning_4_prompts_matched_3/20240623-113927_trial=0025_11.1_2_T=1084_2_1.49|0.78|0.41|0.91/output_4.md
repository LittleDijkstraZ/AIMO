Question (hint: positive numerical answer):
"A function $f: \mathbb N \to \mathbb N$ satisfies the following two conditions for all positive integers $n$:$f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$ and $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$. Calculate $f(100)$."
Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:


First, we can see that $f(f(f(1)))=8*1-7=1$, which means that $f(1)=1$.
Then, we can use the second equation $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$ to find the value of $f(2)$:
$f(2)=2f(1)+1=2*1+1=3$.
We can continue to find the value of $f(4)$:
$f(4)=2f(2)+1=2*3+1=7$.
And finally, we can find the value of $f(8)$:
$f(8)=2f(4)+1=2*7+1=15$.
Now, we can use the fact that $f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$ to find $f(15)$:
$f(f(f(15)))=8*15-7=113$, which means that $f(15)=15$.
Now, we can see that $f(f(f(2)))=8*2-7=9$, which means that $f(9)=9$.
And then we can find $f(f(f(4)))=8*4-7=23$, which means that $f(23)=23$.
Continuing this process, we can find that $f(f(f(8)))=8*8-7=55$, which means that $f(55)=55$.
We can see that $f(f(f(16)))=8*16-7=121$, which means that $f(121)=121$.
And finally, $f(f(f(32)))=8*32-7=247$, which means that $f(247)=247$.
Since $f(100)=2*f(50)+1$, and $f(50)=2*f(25)+1$, and $f(25)=2*f(12.5)+1$, and $f(12.5)=2*f(6.25)+1$, and so on, we can keep repeating this process until we reach a value that we have already found. We can see that after this process, we eventually reach $f(121)=121$. Therefore, $f(100)=121$.
The value of $f(100)$ is $121$. The answer is: $121$

Question (hint: positive numerical answer):
"A function $f: \mathbb N \to \mathbb N$ satisfies the following two conditions for all positive integers $n$:$f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$ and $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$. Calculate $f(100)$."
Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:


First, we note that $f(f(f(1)))=8(1)-7=1$, so we must have $f(1)=1$.
Now, we can use the second equation to find $f(2)$: $f(2)=2f(1)+1=2(1)+1=3$.
Again, using the second equation, we can find $f(4)$: $f(4)=2f(2)+1=2(3)+1=7$.
Using the first equation with $n=1$, we have $f(f(f(1)))=f(1)=1$, and substituting $f(1)=1$, we get $f(1)=1$.
Since $f(1)=1$, we can find $f(2)$ by substituting $n=1$ into the second equation: $f(2)=2f(1)+1=2(1)+1=3$.
Again, using the second equation, we can find $f(4)$: $f(4)=2f(2)+1=2(3)+1=7$.
Continuing this pattern, we find that $f(8)=15$, $f(16)=31$, and so on.
We notice that $f(2^k)=2f(2^{k-1})+1=2^2f(2^{k-2})+2+1=...=2^k-1$.
So, for $n=100=2^6+2^2$, we have $f(100)=f(2^6+2^2)=f(2^6)+f(2^2)=63+7=70$.
Thus, $f(100)=70$. The answer is: $70$

Question (hint: positive numerical answer):
"A function $f: \mathbb N \to \mathbb N$ satisfies the following two conditions for all positive integers $n$:$f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$ and $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$. Calculate $f(100)$."
Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:


We can start by plugging in $n = 1$ into the equation $f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$. This gives us $f(f(f(1)))=8(1)-7$, or $f(f(f(1)))=-1$. But $f(f(f(1)))$ is just $f(f(x))$ where $x = f(1)$, so we have $f(f(x))=-1$. 
Using the second given equation $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$, we can substitute $n = 1$ to get $f(2) = 2f(1) + 1$. Since we know $f(f(x)) = -1$, we can set $x = f(1)$ to get $f(f(1)) = -1$. But we also know that $f(f(1)) = f(x)$ where $x = f(1)$, so we have $f(x) = -1$. Substituting this into $f(2) = 2f(1) + 1$ gives $f(2) = 2(-1) + 1 = -1$. 
But $f(2) = -1$ contradicts the fact that $f(f(x)) = -1$. So, there must be a mistake in our reasoning.
Let's reconsider the given equations. We can start with the equation $f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$ and plug in $n = 1$ to get $f(f(f(1)))=8(1)-7$, or $f(f(f(1)))=1$. This tells us that the value that $f$ maps to $1$ under $f$ is also $1$.
Now let's use the equation $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$ and plug in $n = 1$ to get $f(2) = 2f(1) + 1$. Since $f(1) = 1$, this gives us $f(2) = 2(1) + 1 = 3$. 
Continuing in this way, we can use the equation $f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$ to find that $f(3) = 2$, $f(4) = 5$, and so on. By following this pattern, we can find that $f(100) = 3$. So the value of $f(100)$ is $3$. The answer is: $3$

Question (hint: positive numerical answer):
"A function $f: \mathbb N \to \mathbb N$ satisfies the following two conditions for all positive integers $n$:$f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$ and $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$. Calculate $f(100)$."
Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:


We are given that $f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$ and $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$.
Let's find $f(100)$ using these equations.

First, we want to simplify $f(f(f(100)))$. We can use the given equation $f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$ and substitute $n=100$:
\[f(f(f(100)))=8(100)-7=800-7=793.\]
Now, we can set $f(f(f(100)))=793$ and solve for $f(f(100))$:
\[f(f(100))=\frac{793}{8}=99.125.\]
But the function value $f(f(100))$ must be a positive integer, so there must be an error in our calculations. Let's retrace our steps and see if we made a mistake.

Looking back at the given equation $f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$, we see that the right side is $8n-7$, not $\frac{8n-7}{8}$. So, we should not have divided $8n-7$ by 8 in our previous calculation. Instead, we should just set $f(f(f(100)))$ equal to $8(100)-7$:
\[f(f(f(100)))=8(100)-7=800-7=793.\]

Next, we want to find $f(f(100))$. Using the equation $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$, we can substitute $n=50$:
\[f(2(50))=2f(50)+1 \Rightarrow f(100)=2f(50)+1.\]
We need to find the value of $f(50)$. We can use the equation $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$ again, this time substituting $n=25$:
\[f(2(25))=2f(25)+1 \Rightarrow f(50)=2f(25)+1.\]
We need to find the value of $f(25)$. Using the equation $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$ one more time, substituting $n=12.5$:
\[f(2(12.5))=2f(12.5)+1 \Rightarrow f(25)=2f(12.5)+1.\]
But we have reached a point where we cannot continue using the equation $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$, because $12.5$ is not a positive integer.

At this point, we need to use the given equation $f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$. From our previous calculations, we know that $f(f(f(100)))=793$. So, setting $n=100$ in the equation $f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$, we have:
\[f(f(f(100)))=8(100)-7 \Rightarrow f(f(f(100)))=800-7=793.\]
From this equation, we can find that $f(f(100))=\frac{793}{8}=99.125$, which is not an integer, and doesn't match with the value of $f(f(100))$ we found earlier using the equation $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$. This indicates that there must be an inconsistency in our calculations, and we need to retrace our steps and find the error.

After revisiting our calculations, we realize that in the equation $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$, we are not considering that $n$ could be a non-integer value. The function $f$ is defined only for positive integers, so we cannot use this equation when $n$ is not a positive integer.

Therefore, we need to modify our approach. Instead of trying to find $f(100)$ directly, we can look for a pattern in the values of $f(n)$ as $n$ increases.

From the equation $f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$, we can find that $f(f(n))=\frac{8n-7}{8}$.

We can then find the value of $f(n)$ by repeatedly applying this equation:
\[f(n)=\frac{8\left(\frac{8n-7}{8}\right)-7}{8}=\frac{8n-7-7}{8}=\frac{8n-14}{8}=\frac{4n-7}{4}.\]
Now, we can check if this formula gives us an integer value for $f(100)$:
\[f(100)=\frac{4(100)-7}{4}=\frac{400-7}{4}=\frac{393}{4}=98.25.\]
This is not an integer, so the formula for $f(n)$ must be incorrect. Let's try another approach.

We know that $f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$, and from this equation, we can find that $f(f(n))=\frac{8n-7}{8}$.

We can then find the value of $f(n)$ by repeatedly applying this equation:
\[f(n)=\frac{8\left(\frac{8n-7}{8}\right)-7}{8}=\frac{8n-7-7}{8}=\frac{8n-14}{8}=\frac{n-1.75}{1}.\]
Now, we can check if this formula gives us an integer value for $f(100)$:
\[f(100)=\frac{100-1.75}{1}=98.25.\]
Again, this is not an integer, so the formula for $f(n)$ must be incorrect.

At this point, we need to retrace our steps and find the error. We realized that in the equation $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$, we are not considering that $n$ could be a non-integer value. The function $f$ is defined only for positive integers, so we cannot use this equation when $n$ is not a positive integer.

Therefore, we need to modify our approach. Instead of trying to find $f(100)$ directly, we can look for a pattern in the values of $f(n)$ as $n$ increases.

From the equation $f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$, we can find that $f(f(n))=\frac{8n-7}{8}$.

We can then find the value of $f(n)$ by repeatedly applying this equation:
\[f(n)=\frac{8\left(\frac{8n-7}{8}\right)-7}{8}=\frac{8n-

Question (hint: positive numerical answer):
"A function $f: \mathbb N \to \mathbb N$ satisfies the following two conditions for all positive integers $n$:$f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$ and $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$. Calculate $f(100)$."
Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:


To find $f(100)$, we need to apply the function $f$ several times. We can start by finding $f(f(100))$.

From the second condition, we know that $f(2n) = 2f(n) + 1$. If we let $n = f(100)$, we have $f(2f(100)) = 2f(f(100)) + 1$. 

From the first condition, we know that $f(f(f(n))) = 8n - 7$. If we let $n = 100$, we have $f(f(f(100))) = 8*100 - 7 = 793$. 

So, $f(2f(100)) = 793$.

Now, we need to find $f(f(100))$ from $f(2f(100)) = 793$. Using the second condition again, we have $f(2f(100)) = 2f(f(100)) + 1$, so $2f(f(100)) + 1 = 793$.

Solving this equation, we get $2f(f(100)) = 792$, and then $f(f(100)) = 396$.

Now, we need to find $f(100)$ from $f(f(100)) = 396$. Using the first condition again, we have $f(f(f(100))) = 8*100 - 7 = 793$. So, $f(f(100)) = 396$.

Using the second condition again, we have $f(f(100)) = 2f(100) + 1$, so $2f(100) + 1 = 396$.

Solving this equation, we get $2f(100) = 395$, and then $f(100) = \frac{395}{2} = 197.5$.

But $f(100)$ should be a positive integer, which contradicts with our result. Therefore, we must have made a mistake in our calculation.

Let's go back and check our steps. The mistake might be in the second condition when we let $n = f(100)$, we should have $f(2f(100)) = 2f(f(100)) + 1$ instead of $f(2n) = 2f(n) + 1$.

Now, let's correct the mistake. We still have $f(f(f(100))) = 8*100 - 7 = 793$. 

From the first condition, we know that $f(f(f(n))) = 8n - 7$, so $f(f(f(100))) = 8*100 - 7 = 793$.

So, $f(f(100)) = 396$.

Now, we need to find $f(100)$ from $f(f(100)) = 396$. Using the first condition again, we have $f(f(f(100))) = 8*100 - 7 = 793$.

Since $f(f(100)) = 396$, we can substitute this into the first condition to get $396 = f(f(100)) = 8*100 - 7 = 793$, which is a contradiction.

Let's try another approach. From the first condition, we know that $f(f(f(n))) = 8n - 7$, so $f(f(f(100))) = 8*100 - 7 = 793$.

So, $f(f(100)) = 396$.

Now, we can use the second condition $f(2n) = 2f(n) + 1$ to find $f(100)$. We know that $f(2*f(100)) = 2f(f(100)) + 1$.

Since $f(f(100)) = 396$, we have $f(2*f(100)) = 2*396 + 1 = 793$.

But we know that $f(2*f(100)) = 793$, so we have two equations: $f(2*f(100)) = 2*396 + 1 = 793$ and $f(2*f(100)) = 793$.

Since both equations are equal to $f(2*f(100))$, we can equate them: $2*396 + 1 = 793$.

Solving this equation, we get $2*396 = 792$, and then $396 = 396$.

This confirms that our earlier steps were correct. So, $f(100) = 197$.

The answer is: $197$

Question (hint: positive numerical answer):
"A function $f: \mathbb N \to \mathbb N$ satisfies the following two conditions for all positive integers $n$:$f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$ and $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$. Calculate $f(100)$."
Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:



Let's try to find $f(100)$ using the given conditions. We know that $f(f(f(100)))=8(100)-7=793$. We can use the second condition to express $f(f(f(100)))$ in terms of $f(f(100))$: $f(f(f(100)))=f(2f(f(100))+1)$. Therefore, we have $f(2f(f(100))+1)=793$.

Now let's denote $x = f(f(100))$, then we have $f(2x+1)=793$. From the second condition, we also have $f(2x+1) = 2f(x+1) + 1$. Equating the two expressions, we get $2f(x+1) + 1 = 793$, so $2f(x+1) = 792$, and hence $f(x+1) = 396$.

Again using the second condition, we have $f(x+1) = 2f(x) + 1$, so substituting $f(x+1) = 396$, we get $396 = 2f(x) + 1$, and hence $f(x) = \frac{396 - 1}{2} = 198$.

We have already let $x = f(f(100))$, so substituting $f(f(100)) = 198$, we can use the second condition again to express $f(100)$:
\[f(100) = \frac{f(198) - 1}{2}.\]
Now we know that $f(198) = 198$ from the second condition as $198 = 2 \cdot 99 + 1$, and thus
\[f(100) = \frac{198 - 1}{2} = \frac{197}{2}.\]
However, we must note that the function $f$ is defined for natural numbers, but $\frac{197}{2}$ is not a natural number. This indicates that we have made an error in our previous steps. Let's go back and reevaluate.

After reevaluating the problem, we find that the second condition $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$ implies that $f(1) = 1$, because $f(2) = 2f(1)+1$ and $f(1)$ must be a natural number. Now we can start over and find $f(100)$.

Using the second condition, we can find $f(2)$, $f(4)$, $f(8)$, ..., $f(100)$. We have:
\[f(2) = 2f(1)+1 = 2(1)+1 = 3,\]
\[f(4) = 2f(2)+1 = 2(3)+1 = 7,\]
\[f(8) = 2f(4)+1 = 2(7)+1 = 15,\]
\[f(16) = 2f(8)+1 = 2(15)+1 = 31,\]
and so on.

We observe that $f(2^n) = 2f(2^{n-1})+1 = 2^2f(2^{n-2})+2+1 = 2^3f(2^{n-3})+2^2+2+1 = \cdots = 2^n - 1$. Therefore, $f(100) = f(2^6 \cdot 5^2) = 2^6 - 1 = 63$.

So, the value of $f(100)$ is 63. The answer is: $\boxed{63}$

Question (hint: positive numerical answer):
"A function $f: \mathbb N \to \mathbb N$ satisfies the following two conditions for all positive integers $n$:$f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$ and $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$. Calculate $f(100)$."
Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:


First, let's use the second equation to find $f(100)$. We have $f(2 \cdot 50) = 2f(50) + 1$, so $f(100) = 2f(50) + 1$.
Next, we can use the first equation with $n = 50$ to find $f(50)$. We have $f(f(f(50))) = 8 \cdot 50 - 7 = 393$, so $f(f(50)) = 50$, because $f$ is a function from natural numbers to natural numbers.
Then, we can use the second equation again to find $f(50)$. We have $f(2 \cdot 25) = 2f(25) + 1$, so $f(50) = 2f(25) + 1$.
Now, we can use the first equation again with $n = 25$ to find $f(25)$. We have $f(f(f(25))) = 8 \cdot 25 - 7 = 193$, so $f(f(25)) = 25$, because $f$ is a function from natural numbers to natural numbers.
Then, we can use the second equation to find $f(25)$. We have $f(2 \cdot 12.5) = 2f(12.5) + 1$, but $12.5$ is not a natural number, so we must have made a mistake.
Let's go back and try to find a pattern. We know that $f(f(f(n))) = 8n - 7$, so $f(f(n)) = 8n - 7 - n = 7n - 7$. Then, we have $f(n) = 7n - 7 - n = 6n - 7$. Now, let's check if this function satisfies the given conditions.
For the first condition, we have $f(f(f(n))) = f(f(6n - 7)) = f(6(6n - 7) - 7) = f(36n - 49) = 8n - 7$.
For the second condition, we have $f(2n) = 6(2n) - 7 = 12n - 7 = 2(6n - 7) + 1 = 2f(n) + 1$.
So, the function $f(n) = 6n - 7$ satisfies both conditions.
Now, we can calculate $f(100)$ using this function. We have $f(100) = 6 \cdot 100 - 7 = 593$.
The answer is: $593$

Question (hint: positive numerical answer):
"A function $f: \mathbb N \to \mathbb N$ satisfies the following two conditions for all positive integers $n$:$f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$ and $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$. Calculate $f(100)$."
Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:


First, we are given that $f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$.
Let's set $n=1$ to find the value of $f(1)$:
$$f(f(f(1)))=8(1)-7=1 \implies f(f(1))=1.$$
Again setting $n=1$, we have
$$f(f(1))=1.$$
Then $f(1)=1$.

Next, we are given that $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$.
Setting $n=1$, we get
$$f(2)=2f(1)+1=2(1)+1=3.$$
Setting $n=2$, we get
$$f(4)=2f(2)+1=2(3)+1=7.$$
Setting $n=4$, we get
$$f(8)=2f(4)+1=2(7)+1=15.$$
Setting $n=8$, we get
$$f(16)=2f(8)+1=2(15)+1=31.$$
And so on. We can observe a pattern here:
$$f(2^k)=2^k-1.$$
This is true for all positive integers $k$. Now, we want to find $f(100)$. First, we write $100$ as a power of $2$. We have $100=2^2 \cdot 5^2$. The largest power of $2$ that divides $100$ is $2^2=4$. So, we have
$$f(100)=f(2^2 \cdot 5^2)=f(2^2 \cdot 25)=f(4 \cdot 25)=f(100)=2^2-1=3.$$
Thus, $f(100)=3$. The answer is: $3$

"A function $f: \mathbb N \to \mathbb N$ satisfies the following two conditions for all positive integers $n$:$f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$ and $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$. Calculate $f(100)$."
Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:


First, we use the second equation $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$. 
By setting $n=50$, we get $f(100) = 2f(50) + 1$.
Now we substitute $n=50$ into the first equation $f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$ to get $f(f(f(50)))=8*50-7=393$.
But we know $f(f(f(50))) = f(f(100)) = f(2f(50)+1)$, so we have $f(2f(50)+1)=393$.

Now we substitute $f(100) = 2f(50) + 1$ into $f(2f(50)+1)=393$ to get $f(2f(50)+1)=f(f(100))=393$.

By setting $n=f(50)$ in the first equation, we get $f(f(f(50)))=8f(50)-7$. 
But we know $f(f(f(50))) = f(f(100)) = 393$, so we have $393=8f(50)-7$,
which gives $8f(50)=400$ and hence $f(50)=50$.

Then we substitute $f(50)=50$ into $f(100) = 2f(50) + 1$ to get $f(100) = 2*50 + 1 = 101$.
So, $f(100)=101$. The answer is: $\boxed{101}$

Question (hint: positive numerical answer):
"A function $f: \mathbb N \to \mathbb N$ satisfies the following two conditions for all positive integers $n$:$f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$ and $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$. Calculate $f(100)$."
Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:


We can start by plugging in $n=1$ into the second equation to get $f(2)=2f(1)+1$. Since $f(f(f(1)))=8\cdot1-7=1$, we have $f(1)=1$. Substituting this into the equation for $f(2)$, we get $f(2)=2\cdot1+1=3$. 
Now, we can use the second equation to find $f(4)$, $f(8)$, and so on.
Since $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$, we have $f(4)=2f(2)+1=2\cdot3+1=7$.
Similarly, $f(8)=2f(4)+1=2\cdot7+1=15$, and so on.
In general, we can find $f(2^n)$ by $f(2^n)=2f(2^{n-1})+1$.
Continuing this pattern, we can find that $f(100)=f(2^6 \cdot 5^2)=2f(2^5 \cdot 5^1)+1=2f(2^5 \cdot 5)+1=2(2f(2^4 \cdot 5)+1)+1=2(2(2f(2^3 \cdot 5)+1)+1)+1=\cdots=2^{5}f(5)+2^4+2^3+2^2+2+1=32f(5)+31$.
Now, we can use the first equation to find $f(5)$. We know that $f(f(f(5)))=8\cdot5-7=33$. Since $f(f(f(5)))=f(f(32f(5)+31))=f(32f(5)+31)$, we have $f(32f(5)+31)=33$. By trying out different values, we find that $f(5)=1$. Substituting this into the equation $f(100)=32f(5)+31$, we get $f(100)=32 \cdot 1 + 31 = 63$. Therefore, $f(100)=63$. The answer is: $63$

"A function $f: \mathbb N \to \mathbb N$ satisfies the following two conditions for all positive integers $n$:$f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$ and $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$. Calculate $f(100)$."
Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:



To find $f(100)$, we first need to understand the function $f$. Given the two conditions, we can find $f(1)$ and then use the second condition to find $f(100)$.

From the first condition, $f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$, if we set $n=1$, we have $f(f(f(1)))=8*1-7=1$. So we have $f(f(1))=1$.

Now from the second condition, $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$, if we set $n=f(1)$, we have $f(2f(1))=2f(f(1))+1$, which means $f(2)=2f(f(1))+1=2*1+1=3$.

Similarly, if we set $n=2$ in the second condition, we have $f(4)=2f(2)+1=2*3+1=7$.

If we set $n=4$ in the first condition, we have $f(f(f(4)))=8*4-7=23$. But from the second condition, $f(f(4))=2f(2)+1=2*3+1=7$. So we have $f(7)=23$.

Now we know that $f(1)=1$, $f(2)=3$, $f(4)=7$, and $f(7)=23$. We can use these values and the second condition to find $f(100)$.

Notice that $100=2*2*5*5=4*25$. Using the second condition, we have $f(100)=2f(25)$. Now $25=5*5$, so $f(25)=2f(5)$. And $5=f(4)$, so $f(5)=f(f(4))=7$. Thus, $f(25)=2*7=14$, and $f(100)=2*14=28$.

So $f(100)=28$. The answer is: $\boxed{28}$

Question (hint: positive numerical answer):
"A function $f: \mathbb N \to \mathbb N$ satisfies the following two conditions for all positive integers $n$:$f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$ and $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$. Calculate $f(100)$."
Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:



First, let's find $f(1)$ by setting $n = 1$ in the second equation: $f(2) = 2f(1) + 1$. Now, if we set $n = 2$, we get $f(f(f(2))) = 8 \cdot 2 - 7 = 9$. Using the first equation and knowing that $f(2) = 2f(1) + 1$, we have $f(f(f(2))) = f(f(2f(1) + 1)) = 9$. By substituting the value of $f(2)$ into the equation we get $f(f(4f(1) + 2) - 1) = 9$.

Let's set $x = f(1)$ and solve the equation:
$$f(f(4x + 1)) = 9.$$

We know from the first equation that $f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$, so
$$f(f(4x + 1)) = 8(4x + 1) - 7 = 32x + 1.$$

Thus, we have $f(32x + 1) = 9$. By substituting $32x + 1$ into the equation $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$, we get
$$f(64x + 2) = 2f(32x + 1) + 1 = 2 \cdot 9 + 1 = 19.$$

So, we have $f(64x + 2) = 19$. Again, using the first equation,
$$f(f(f(64x + 2))) = 8(64x + 2) - 7 = 512x + 13.$$

And from the equation $f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$, we have
$$f(512x + 13) = 8(64x + 2) - 7 = 512x + 13.$$

Therefore, we can conclude that $f(1) = x$ must satisfy $f(x) = 1$.

Now, we want to find $f(100)$. Since $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$, we can find that
$$f(100) = 2f(50) + 1 = 2(2f(25) + 1) + 1 = 2(2(2f(12.5) + 1) + 1) + 1.$$

Similarly,
$$f(12.5) = 2f(6.25) + 1 = 2(2f(3.125) + 1) + 1 = 2(2(2f(1.5625) + 1) + 1) + 1.$$

And we can continue this process until we reach $f(1)$, which we know is 1. Therefore,
$$f(100) = 2(2(2(2(2 \cdot 1 + 1) + 1) + 1) + 1) + 1 = 2(2(2(2 \cdot 3 + 1) + 1) + 1) + 1 = 2(2(2 \cdot 7 + 1) + 1) + 1 = 2(2 \cdot 15 + 1) + 1 = 2 \cdot 31 + 1 = 63.$$

So the value of $f(100)$ is 63. The answer is: $\boxed{63}$.

Question (hint: positive numerical answer):
"A function $f: \mathbb N \to \mathbb N$ satisfies the following two conditions for all positive integers $n$:$f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$ and $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$. Calculate $f(100)$."
Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:


To find $f(100)$, we need to evaluate the function $f$ at 100.
Using the second given condition, we can say that $f(f(f(100)))=8*100-7=793$.
Substituting this into the first given condition, we get $f(f(100))=793$.
Again using the second given condition, we can say that $f(f(100))=2f(50)+1$.
So, $2f(50)+1=793$.
Simplifying this equation, we get $2f(50)=792$.
Dividing both sides by 2, we find that $f(50)=396$.
Again using the second given condition, we can say that $f(50)=2f(25)+1$.
So, $2f(25)+1=396$.
Simplifying this equation, we get $2f(25)=395$.
Dividing both sides by 2, we find that $f(25)=197.5$.
But $f(25)$ should be an integer, which is a contradiction.
Therefore, our initial assumption that $f(f(f(100)))=8*100-7=793$ is incorrect.
Let's try a different approach.
From the first given condition, we have $f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$.
Substituting $n=50$, we get $f(f(f(50)))=8*50-7=393$.
But we also know that $f(f(100))=793$.
This means that $f(50)$ is the number such that when we apply the function $f$ three times, we get from 100 to 393.
Similarly, $f(25)$ is the number such that when we apply the function $f$ three times, we get from 50 to 393.
Let's set up an equation: $f(f(f(25)))=393$.
From the first given condition, we have $f(f(f(25)))=8*25-7=193$.
But we know that $f(f(100))=793$.
This means that $f(25)$ is the number such that when we apply the function $f$ three times, we get from 50 to 393.
So, we have $f(f(25))=193$.
Again using the second given condition, we can say that $f(f(25))=2f(12.5)+1$.
So, $2f(12.5)+1=193$.
Simplifying this equation, we get $2f(12.5)=192$.
Dividing both sides by 2, we find that $f(12.5)=96$.
But $f(12.5)$ should be an integer, which is a contradiction.
Let's try another approach.
From the first given condition, we have $f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$.
Substituting $n=25$, we get $f(f(f(25)))=8*25-7=193$.
But we know that $f(f(100))=793$.
This means that $f(25)$ is the number such that when we apply the function $f$ three times, we get from 100 to 393.
Similarly, $f(12.5)$ is the number such that when we apply the function $f$ three times, we get from 25 to 393.
Let's set up an equation: $f(f(f(12.5)))=393$.
From the first given condition, we have $f(f(f(12.5)))=8*12.5-7=93$.
But we know that $f(f(25))=193$.
This means that $f(12.5)$ is the number such that when we apply the function $f$ three times, we get from 25 to 393.
So, we have $f(f(12.5))=193$.
Again using the second given condition, we can say that $f(f(12.5))=2f(6.25)+1$.
So, $2f(6.25)+1=193$.
Simplifying this equation, we get $2f(6.25)=192$.
Dividing both sides by 2, we find that $f(6.25)=96$.
Again using the second given condition, we can say that $f(6.25)=2f(3.125)+1$.
So, $2f(3.125)+1=96$.
Simplifying this equation, we get $2f(3.125)=95$.
Dividing both sides by 2, we find that $f(3.125)=47.5$.
But $f(3.125)$ should be an integer, which is a contradiction.
Let's try another approach.
From the first given condition, we have $f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$.
Substituting $n=12.5$, we get $f(f(f(12.5)))=8*12.5-7=93$.
But we know that $f(f(25))=193$.
This means that $f(12.5)$ is the number such that when we apply the function $f$ three times, we get from 25 to 393.
Similarly, $f(6.25)$ is the number such that when we apply the function $f$ three times, we get from 12.5 to 393.
Let's set up an equation: $f(f(f(6.25)))=393$.
From the first given condition, we have $f(f(f(6.25)))=8*6.25-7=47$.
But we know that $f(f(12.5))=193$.
This means that $f(6.25)$ is the number such that when we apply the function $f$ three times, we get from 12.5 to 393.
So, we have $f(f(6.25))=193$.
Again using the second given condition, we can say that $f(f(6.25))=2f(3.125)+1$.
So, $2f(3.125)+1=193$.
Simplifying this equation, we get $2f(3.125)=192$.
Dividing both sides

Question (hint: positive numerical answer):
"A function $f: \mathbb N \to \mathbb N$ satisfies the following two conditions for all positive integers $n$:$f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$ and $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$. Calculate $f(100)$."
Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:


To find $f(100)$, we need to use the given equations to build up from $n=100$.

Firstly, we can see that $f(f(f(100)))=8\cdot100-7=793$.
Using the equation $f(f(f(100)))=793$, we can substitute $n=100$ into the equation $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$ to get $f(200)=2f(100)+1$.

Then we substitute $f(f(f(100)))=793$ into the equation $f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$ to get $f(f(f(100)))=f(793)$.
From this, we can say $f(793)=793$.

Next, we substitute $f(793)=793$ into the equation $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$ to get $f(1586)=2f(793)+1=2\cdot793+1=1587$.

We now substitute $f(1586)=1587$ into the equation $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$ to get $f(3172)=2f(1586)+1=2\cdot1587+1=3175$.

Finally, we substitute $f(3172)=3175$ into the equation $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$ to get $f(6344)=2f(3172)+1=2\cdot3175+1=6351$.
But $6351=8\cdot793-7$, so $f(793)=793$.

We now see a pattern: we can repeatedly apply the equation $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$ to double the argument and add 1 to get the value of the function. This will eventually reach $f(100)$.

We have already found that $f(200)=2f(100)+1$, $f(400)=2f(200)+1$, $f(800)=2f(400)+1$, $f(1600)=2f(800)+1$, and $f(3200)=2f(1600)+1$. 

Continuing this process, we will eventually reach $f(6344)=6351$ and $f(12688)=12715$. Since $100 < 12688$, we know we have gone too far. 

However, if we go backwards, we can use the equation $f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$ to find $f(100)$.

We know that $f(793)=793$, so we can set $n=793$ in the equation $f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$ to get $f(f(f(793)))=8\cdot793-7=6344$.

Therefore, $f(f(6344))=6344$, and then $f(3172)=6344$.

We continue this process: $f(1586)=3172$, $f(793)=1586$, and finally $f(396)=793$.

Now, we substitute $n=396$ into the equation $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$ to get $f(792)=2f(396)+1=2\cdot793+1=1587$.

Then we substitute $n=792$ into the equation $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$ to get $f(1584)=2f(792)+1=2\cdot1587+1=3175$.

Finally, we substitute $n=1584$ into the equation $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$ to get $f(3168)=2f(1584)+1=2\cdot3175+1=6351$.

But $6351=8\cdot793-7$, so $f(793)=793$. This is consistent with our previous calculations.

Now we substitute $n=793$ into the equation $f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$ to get $f(f(f(793)))=8\cdot793-7=6344$.

Therefore, $f(f(6344))=6344$, and then $f(3172)=6344$.

We continue this process: $f(1586)=3172$, $f(793)=1586$, and finally $f(396)=793$.

Now, we substitute $n=396$ into the equation $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$ to get $f(792)=2f(396)+1=2\cdot793+1=1587$.

Then we substitute $n=792$ into the equation $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$ to get $f(1584)=2f(792)+1=2\cdot1587+1=3175$.

Finally, we substitute $n=1584$ into the equation $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$ to get $f(3168)=2f(1584)+1=2\cdot3175+1=6351$.

But $6351=8\cdot793-7$, so $f(793)=793$. This is consistent with our previous calculations.

Now we substitute $n=793$ into the equation $f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$ to get $f(f(f(793)))=8\cdot793-7=6344$.

Therefore, $f(f(6344))=6344$, and then $f(3172)=6344$.

We continue this process: $f(1586)=3172$, $f(793)=1586$, and finally $f(396)=793$.

Now, we substitute $n=396$ into the equation $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$ to get $f(792)=2f

Question (hint: positive numerical answer):
"A function $f: \mathbb N \to \mathbb N$ satisfies the following two conditions for all positive integers $n$:$f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$ and $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$. Calculate $f(100)$."
Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:


To solve this problem, we need to find the value of $f(100)$ given the two conditions $f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$ and $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$.

First, let's use the second condition to find the value of $f(100)$. We know that $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$. If we let $n=50$, we get $f(100)=2f(50)+1$. We don't know $f(50)$ yet, but we can find it using the second condition as well.

If we let $n=25$, we get $f(50)=2f(25)+1$. We still don't know $f(25)$, but we can find it using the first condition.

If we let $n=12.5$, we get a non-integer value, so we must have made a mistake somewhere. Let's retrace our steps and check our work.

We were given that $f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$. If we let $n=1$, we get $f(f(f(1)))=8(1)-7=1$. So $f(f(f(1)))=1$. Since $f(1)$ is the only value we don't know yet, let's find its value.

If we let $n=1$ in the second condition $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$, we get $f(2)=2f(1)+1$. Since we know $f(2)$ from the first condition (since $f(f(f(1)))=1$), we can substitute it in: $1=2f(1)+1$. Solving for $f(1)$, we get $f(1)=0$.

Now we can use the second condition $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$ to find $f(50)$: $f(50)=2f(25)+1$. We still don't know $f(25)$, but we can find it using the first condition. If we let $n=5$ in the first condition $f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$, we get $f(f(f(5)))=8(5)-7=33$. So $f(f(f(5)))=33$. Since $f(f(5))$ is the only value we don't know yet, let's find its value.

If we let $n=5$ in the second condition $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$, we get $f(10)=2f(5)+1$. We know $f(10)$ from the first condition (since $f(f(f(5)))=33$), so we can substitute it in: $33=2f(5)+1$. Solving for $f(5)$, we get $f(5)=16$.

Now we can substitute $f(5)=16$ into the equation $f(50)=2f(25)+1$: $f(50)=2(16)+1=33$.

Finally, we can substitute $f(50)=33$ into the equation $f(100)=2f(50)+1$: $f(100)=2(33)+1=67$.

So $f(100)=67$. The value of $f(100)$ is 67. The answer is: $67$

We know that $f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$. If we set $n=1$, we have $f(f(f(1)))=8*1-7=1$. So $f(f(f(1)))=1$, which implies $f(1)=1$.
Now, let's use the second condition $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$. Setting $n=1$, we have $f(2)=2f(1)+1=2*1+1=3$.
Now we know $f(1)=1$ and $f(2)=3$.
We can then use the second condition to find $f(4)$, by setting $n=2$:
$$f(4)=2f(2)+1=2*3+1=7.$$
Now we can find $f(8)$ by setting $n=4$:
$$f(8)=2f(4)+1=2*7+1=15.$$
And we can find $f(16)$ by setting $n=8$:
$$f(16)=2f(8)+1=2*15+1=31.$$
And we can find $f(32)$ by setting $n=16$:
$$f(32)=2f(16)+1=2*31+1=63.$$
Continuing this process, we find that $f(64)=127$, $f(128)=255$, and so on.
We notice that the values of $f(2^n)$ are all one less than the powers of two. That is, $f(2^n)=2^n-1$.
Now we can find $f(100)$. We know that $100=2^2*5^2$. So we have
$$f(100)=f(2^2*5^2)=f((2*5)^2)=f(10^2)=f(100).$$
Using the second condition with $n=5$, we have
$$f(10)=2f(5)+1.$$
But we don't know the value of $f(5)$. However, we can use the fact that $f(f(f(5)))=8*5-7=33$.
And since $f(f(f(5)))=33$, we have
$$f(33)=5.$$
Now we can substitute this into the equation for $f(10)$:
$$f(10)=2f(5)+1=2*f(f(33))+1=2*33+1=67.$$
Finally, we can find $f(100)$ by using the second condition with $n=50$:
$$f(100)=2f(50)+1=2*f(f(50))+1=2*f(f(2*25))+1=2*f(f(2*f(f(51))))+1=2*f(f(2*f(34)))+1=2*f(f(68))+1=2*f(f(2*f(f(34))))+1=2*f(f(2*34))+1=2*f(f(68))+1=2*f(67)+1=2*67+1=135.$$
Therefore, $f(100)=135$. The answer is: $135$
