Question (hint: positive numerical answer):
"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"
Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:



The equation given in the problem is a product of two expressions equal to zero. This means that either one of the expressions is zero, or both are zero.

The expressions are $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)$ and $((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2)$.

If either of these expressions is zero, then the product is zero. 

The expression $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)$ is zero when $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. This means that the points $(x, y)$ lie on the lines $x + y = 10$ and $x - y = 10$. These lines intersect at the point $(5,5)$.

The expression $((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2)$ is zero when $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$. This means that the points $(x, y)$ lie on the lines $x = 8$ and $y = 8$. These lines intersect at the points $(8,0)$ and $(0,8)$.

The four lines $x + y = 10$, $x - y = 10$, $x = 8$, and $y = 8$ form a square with side length $10$ (since the lines $x + y = 10$ and $x - y = 10$ intersect at $(5,5)$, which is the midpoint of the line segment joining $(8,0)$ and $(0,8)$, and the distance between $(5,5)$ and $(8,0)$ or $(0,8)$ is $\sqrt{10^2/2} = 5\sqrt{2}$, which is the side length of the square).

Therefore, the area of the square is $10^2 = 100$. The answer is: $100$

Question (hint: positive numerical answer):
"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"
Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:


The expression $AB = 0$ is equivalent to $A = 0$ or $B = 0$. So, the given equation is equivalent to either $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$.

The equation $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ implies that $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. These two equations describe a square with side length 10 and vertices at $(5,5), (5,-5), (-5,-5), (-5,5)$.

The equation $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ implies that $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$, which means $x = \pm 8$ and $y = \pm 8$. So these two equations describe a square with side length 16 and vertices at $(8,8), (8,-8), (-8,-8), (-8,8)$.

Therefore, the points satisfying the given equation enclose a square with side length 16. The area of this square is $16^2 = 256$.
The answer is: $256$.

Question (hint: positive numerical answer):
"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"
Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:


The given equation is a product of two expressions equal to zero, which means that either the first expression is zero or the second expression is zero.

Let's consider the first expression: $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$. For the sum of two squares to be zero, both squares must be zero, so we have $\vert x + y \vert - 10 = 0$ and $\vert x - y \vert - 10 = 0$. This gives us $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. The absolute value function splits into two cases: $x + y = \pm 10$ and $x - y = \pm 10$. These four equations represent the sides of a square with side length 10.

Now let's consider the second expression: $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$. Similar to the first expression, for the sum of two squares to be zero, both squares must be zero. This gives us $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$. The absolute value function splits into two cases: $x = \pm 8$ and $y = \pm 8$. These four lines represent the sides of another square with side length 8.

The area of the polygon enclosed by the two squares is the sum of the areas of the two squares. The area of a square is the side length squared, so the area of the larger square is $10^2 = 100$ and the area of the smaller square is $8^2 = 64$. The total area of the polygon is $100 + 64 = 164$. The answer is: $\boxed{164}$

"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"
Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:


The product of two numbers is zero if and only if at least one of the numbers is zero. So, the equation $A \cdot B = 0$ implies that either $A = 0$ or $B = 0$. Applying this to the given equation, we have two cases:
Case 1: $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$.
This implies that $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$.
This system of equations implies that $x + y = 10$ and $x - y = 10$ or $x + y = -10$ and $x - y = -10$.
Solving these systems, we find that the four vertices of the polygon are $(0, 10)$, $(20, 0)$, $(0, -10)$, and $(-20, 0)$.
Case 2: $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$.
This implies that $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$.
This system of equations implies that $x = 8$ or $x = -8$, and $y = 8$ or $y = -8$.
So the vertices of the polygon also include $(8, 8)$, $(8, -8)$, $(-8, 8)$, and $(-8, -8)$.
Therefore, the polygon is a square with side length 20.
The area of this square is $20^2 = 400$. The answer is: $400$

"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"
Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:


The expression $ab = 0$ is true if and only if $a = 0$ or $b = 0$. Therefore, the given equation is satisfied if either of the following two conditions is met:

1. $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$.
2. $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$.

For the first condition to be true, both $\vert x + y \vert - 10 = 0$ and $\vert x - y \vert - 10 = 0$, which implies $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. The solutions to these equations are the points on the lines $x + y = 10$ and $x - y = 10$.

For the second condition to be true, both $\vert x \vert - 8 = 0$ and $\vert y \vert - 8 = 0$, which implies $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$. The solutions to these equations are the points on the lines $x = 8$ and $y = 8$.

The points that satisfy either of these conditions form a square with side length 10, as can be seen by drawing the lines on a graph. The area of this square is $10 \times 10 = 100$. Therefore, the area of the convex polygon is 100. The answer is: $\boxed{100}$

"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"
Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:



For the product of two numbers to be 0, at least one of the numbers must be 0. So, either $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + (\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + (\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$.

For $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + (\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$, it means that both $\vert x + y \vert - 10 = 0$ and $\vert x - y \vert - 10 = 0$, which means that $x + y = \pm 10$ and $x - y = \pm 10$. This gives us four lines: $x + y = 10$, $x + y = -10$, $x - y = 10$, and $x - y = -10$.

For $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + (\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$, it means that both $\vert x \vert - 8 = 0$ and $\vert y \vert - 8 = 0$, which means that $x = \pm 8$ and $y = \pm 8$. This gives us four lines: $x = 8$, $x = -8$, $y = 8$, and $y = -8$.

These lines form a rectangle with side lengths 16 and 20, so its area is $16 \times 20 = 320$. Therefore, the area of the convex polygon is $\boxed{320}$.
The answer is: $320$

Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:


The equation $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + (\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ implies that $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. These equations represent two pairs of parallel lines, $x + y = 10$ and $x + y = -10$, and $x - y = 10$ and $x - y = -10$. These lines form a square with side length 10 and diagonals of length $10\sqrt{2}$.

Similarly, the equation $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + (\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ implies that $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$, which represent two pairs of parallel lines, $x = 8$ and $x = -8$, and $y = 8$ and $y = -8$. These lines form a square with side length 16 and diagonals of length $16\sqrt{2}$.

The intersection of the two squares is the convex polygon we are looking for. To find the area of this polygon, we need to find the area of the smaller square (the one with side length 10) and subtract the area of the intersection of the two squares.

The intersection of the two squares is a smaller square with side length equal to the difference of the side lengths of the two squares, which is $16 - 10 = 6$. Therefore, the area of the intersection of the two squares is $6^2 = 36$.

The area of the larger square with side length 16 is $16^2 = 256$. The area of the smaller square with side length 10 is $10^2 = 100$.

Therefore, the area of the convex polygon is $100 - 36 = 64$.
The answer is: $64$

Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:


The expression $A \cdot B = 0$ implies that either $A=0$ or $B=0$. So, for the given equation to be satisfied, either $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$.
The first equation implies that $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. The only way this can happen is if $x = 0$ and $y = 0$.
The second equation implies that $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$, so $x = 8$ or $x = -8$ and $y = 8$ or $y = -8$.
So the vertices of the polygon are $(0,0)$, $(8,8)$, $(8,-8)$, and $(-8, -8)$. This is a square with side length 16. The area of the square is $16^2 = 256$. The answer is: $256$

Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:



The given expression equals zero if either $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$. Each of these equations implies that the absolute value of one of the expressions $x + y$, $x - y$, $x$, or $y$ is equal to 10. The solutions to each of these equations are four pairs of lines in the $xy$-plane.

1. $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$: These are the equations of two pairs of parallel lines, each pair being $x + y = 10$ and $x + y = -10$, and $x - y = 10$ and $x - y = -10$.

2. $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$: These are the equations of two pairs of parallel lines, each pair being $x = 8$ and $x = -8$, and $y = 8$ and $y = -8$.

These lines form a square with side length 16. Therefore, the area of the convex polygon is $16^2 = 256$.

Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:



For the product to be zero, one of the factors must be zero.

Thus, either $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$.

From $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$, we get $\vert x + y \vert = 10$. This gives $x + y = 10$ or $x + y = -10$.

From $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$, we get $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. This gives $x - y = 10$ or $x - y = -10$.

From $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$, we get $\vert x \vert = 8$. This gives $x = 8$ or $x = -8$.

From $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$, we get $\vert y \vert = 8$. This gives $y = 8$ or $y = -8$.

The points satisfying these conditions are:
$(8,8)$, $(8,-8)$, $(-8,8)$, $(-8,-8)$, $(10,0)$, $(0,10)$, $(-10,0)$, $(0,-10)$.

These points form a square with side length 16. The area of this square is $16^2 = 256$.
The answer is: $256$
