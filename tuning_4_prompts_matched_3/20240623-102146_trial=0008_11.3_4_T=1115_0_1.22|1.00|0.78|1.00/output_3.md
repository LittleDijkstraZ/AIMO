 The given equation is a product of two expressions equal to zero, so it is equal to zero if either of the expressions is zero. This means that the points where the equation is zero are the union of the points where each expression is zero.

The equation is zero when either of the following two conditions holds:
1. $(|x + y| - 10)^2 + (|x - y| - 10)^2 = 0$.
2. $(|x| - 8)^2 + (|y| - 8)^2 = 0$.

From the first condition, we have $|x + y| = 10$ and $|x - y| = 10$. This gives us four lines: $x + y = 10$, $x + y = -10$, $x - y = 10$, and $x - y = -10$. These lines form a square with side length 10. The area of this square is $10^2 = 100$.

From the second condition, we have $|x| = 8$ and $|y| = 8$. This gives us four lines: $x = 8$, $x = -8$, $y = 8$, and $y = -8$. These lines form a square with side length 16. The area of this square is $16^2 = 256$.

However, the area of the convex polygon that the points enclose is the area of the intersection of these two squares, which is exactly the smaller square with side length 10. Therefore, the area of the convex polygon is $10^2 = 100$.

So, the area of the convex polygon is 100. The answer is:

$$100$$

Below is a math problem you are to solve (positive numerical answer!):
"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"
Analyze this problem and think step by step to come to a solution with programs. After solving the problem, output the final numerical answer within \boxed{}.

Assistant:

 The equation given in the problem,
\[((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0\]
forces one of the terms multiplied to equal zero. In other words, either one of the following two conditions must hold:
1. $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2) = 0$
2. $((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$
In the first case, $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$, which implies that $x = \pm10$ and $y = \pm10$. This forms a square with side length 20 and area $20^2 = 400$.
In the second case, $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$, which also implies that $x = \pm8$ and $y = \pm8$. This forms a square with side length 16 and area $16^2 = 256$.

Therefore, the total area of the polygon formed by the intersection of these two sets of points (the square formed by satisfying either condition) is the sum of the areas of these two squares, which is $400 + 256 = 656$. However, since the conditions are mutually exclusive (it is not possible to satisfy both conditions simultaneously), the area of the convex polygon formed by the intersection of these two regions is simply the maximum of the two areas, which is 400.
The answer is: $400$

 This problem seems to be a mathematical riddle rather than a problem that can be solved directly by writing a python program. The equation given involves absolute values and square of absolute values, which makes it difficult to solve it in a straightforward way using Python.

However, the equation essentially states that either $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$. This means that either $\vert x + y \vert = 10$, $\vert x - y \vert = 10$, $\vert x \vert = 8$, or $\vert y \vert = 8$. These are all lines in the plane. The enclosed area forms a rectangle with side lengths 16 and 20, so its area is $16 \times 20 = 320$. The solution to this problem is the number 320.

```python

 The equation provided, $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$, represents the product of two functions, one of which is the square of the distance from a point to $(0,0)$ and the other is the square of the distance from a point to $(8,8)$. The expression equals zero only when both functions are zero, which happens exactly when a point lies on the circle with radius 10 around the origin and the circle with radius 8 around the point $(8,8)$. These two circles intersect at four points, which form a square with side length $10 + 8 = 18$. The area of this square is $18^2 = 324$. So, the area of the convex polygon enclosed by the points is $324$.

So, the answer is: $324$. The area of the convex polygon is 324 square units.
The answer is: $324$

"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"

Assistant:

 The given equation is a product of two terms equal to zero, which means either of the terms has to be zero for the entire equation to be true. Therefore, we have two cases to consider:

1. $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ and $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$
2. $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ and $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$

For the first case, we have $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. This implies that $x + y = \pm 10$ and $x - y = \pm 10$. Solving these equations gives us the vertices of a square with side length 10.

For the second case, we have $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$. This implies that $x = \pm 8$ and $y = \pm 8$. Solving these equations gives us the vertices of a square with side length 16.

The points that satisfy the original equation are the points that lie in both squares. This means that they form a smaller square that is inside the larger square. The side length of the smaller square is the difference in the side lengths of the two squares, which is $16 - 10 = 6$. Therefore, the area of the convex polygon is the area of the smaller square, which is $6^2 = 36$. The answer is: $36$

Below is a math problem you are to solve (positive numerical answer!):
"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"

Assistant:


The equation $A \cdot B = 0$ implies that either $A = 0$ or $B = 0$. Thus the given equation implies either
\[((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2) = 0\]
or
\[((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0.\]
From the first equation it follows that $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. These equalities can only hold when both $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10.$ When $x = 5$ and $y = 5$, all four absolute values equal to 10. When $x = -5$ and $y = -5$, all four absolute values also equal to 10. Thus these two points and the four points in which any two absolute values are equal to 10, completely determine the boundary of the polygon. A simple computation shows that the distance between $\left( 5, 5\right)$ and $\left( -5, -5\right)$ is $10\sqrt{2}$, thus the polygon is a square with side length $10\sqrt{2}$. Its area is $\left(10\sqrt{2}\right)^2 = 200$.

The answer is: $200$

Below is a math problem you are to solve (positive numerical answer!):
"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"

 The equation $ab=0$ if and only if $a=0$ or $b=0$. Therefore, the points will satisfy either $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$, $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$, $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$, or $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 =0$.

Let's analyze these four conditions separately:

1. $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ implies $\vert x + y \vert = 10$, which means $x + y = 10$ or $x + y = -10$.
2. $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ implies $\vert x - y \vert = 10$, which means $x - y = 10$ or $x - y = -10$.
3. $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ implies $\vert x \vert = 8$, which means $x = 8$ or $x = -8$.
4. $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ implies $\vert y \vert = 8$, which means $y = 8$ or $y = -8$.

Combining these conditions, we find all the vertices of the polygon. They are: $(8,8)$, $(8,-8)$, $(-8,8)$, $(-8,-8)$, $(10,0)$, $(0,10)$, $(-10,0)$, and $(0,-10)$.

The polygon is an octagon with side length 16. We can divide it into four congruent rectangles, each with side lengths 16 and 8. The area of one rectangle is $16*8=128$, so the area of the octagon is $4*128=512$. The answer, therefore, is $\boxed{512}$.

"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"
Analyze this problem and think step by step to come to a solution with programs. After solving the problem, output the final numerical answer within \boxed{}.

Assistant:

 Solving this problem step by step, we first analyze the given equation:
$$((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$$
For the product of two terms to be zero, either the first term is zero or the second term is zero. 
Let's analyze the first term:
$$(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0 \text{ and } (\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$$
This implies $\vert x + y \vert = 10 \text{ and } \vert x - y \vert = 10$, which are two lines.
Similarly, for the second term:
$$(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0 \text{ and } (\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$$
This implies $\vert x \vert = 8 \text{ and } \vert y \vert = 8$, which are two squares.
The intersection of these lines and squares forms a convex polygon.
The diagonals of the square of side length $16$ are $\sqrt{2} \times 16 = 16\sqrt{2}$.
The distance between the parallel lines is $10$, equal to the side length of the square.
Therefore, the polygon is a square with side length $10$.
The area of this square is $10 \times 10 = 100$. The answer is: $100$

 To solve this problem, we first look at the given equation and recognize that the product of two expressions equals to zero if at least one of them equals to zero. Therefore, we can have two cases:
1) $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$, which implies $\vert x + y \vert = 10$;
2) $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$, which implies $\vert x - y \vert = 10$;
3) $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$, which implies $\vert x \vert = 8$;
4) $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$, which implies $\vert y \vert = 8$.

The first two conditions represent two perpendicular lines $x+y = 10$ and $x-y = 10$, and the last two conditions represent two more perpendicular lines $x=-8$ and $y=-8$. The four lines enclose a square with side length 10. The area of the square is $10^2 = 100$. Therefore, the area of the convex polygon is 100.

In Python, there is no code needed for this problem, as you were asked to think about the problem and provide the numerical answer directly. So the area of the convex polygon is $\boxed{100}$.

In summary, the points enclosed by the four lines $x+y = 10$, $x-y = 10$, $x=-8$, and $y=-8$ form a square with side length 10, and thus the area of the convex polygon is 100. The answer is: $100$

 The equation $AB=0$ implies that either $A=0$ or $B=0$. Therefore, the given equation is satisfied if either of the following two equations is satisfied:
1. $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$
2. $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$
The first equation is satisfied if and only if $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$, which implies $x + y = \pm 10$ and $x - y = \pm 10$. This gives us four lines: $x + y = 10$, $x + y = -10$, $x - y = 10$, and $x - y = -10$. These four lines form a square with side length 10 and diagonals of length $10\sqrt{2}$.
The second equation is satisfied if and only if $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$, which implies $x = \pm 8$ and $y = \pm 8$. This gives us four lines: $x = 8$, $x = -8$, $y = 8$, and $y = -8$. These four lines form a square with side length 16 and diagonals of length $16\sqrt{2}$.
Therefore, the points that satisfy the given equation encloses a square of side length 10. The area of this square is $10^2 = 100$. The answer is: $100$
