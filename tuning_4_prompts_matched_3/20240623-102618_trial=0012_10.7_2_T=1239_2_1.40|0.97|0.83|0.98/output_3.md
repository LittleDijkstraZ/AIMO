Question (hint: positive numerical answer):
"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"
Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:


The product of two numbers is zero if and only if at least one of the numbers is zero. So in this problem, either $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$.
If $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$, then $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. This means that $x + y = \pm 10$ and $x - y = \pm 10$. Solving these two equations, we get four points: $(8,2)$, $(8,-2)$, $(-8,2)$, and $(-8,-2)$.
If $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$, then $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$. This means that $x = \pm 8$ and $y = \pm 8$. Combining this with the previous result, the points that satisfy the original equation are $(8,2)$, $(8,-2)$, $(-8,2)$, and $(-8,-2)$. These four points form a square with side length 8.
To find the area of this square, we simply square the length of one side: $8^2 = 64$. Therefore, the area of the square is $\boxed{64}$ square units.
The final answer is: 64.

Question (hint: positive numerical answer):
"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"
Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:


The given expression is equal to zero if either $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$. 

If $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$, then $\vert x + y \vert = 10$, which implies $x + y = 10$ or $x + y = -10$. 
If $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$, then $\vert x - y \vert = 10$, which implies $x - y = 10$ or $x - y = -10$. 
If $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$, then $\vert x \vert = 8$, which implies $x = 8$ or $x = -8$. 
If $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$, then $\vert y \vert = 8$, which implies $y = 8$ or $y = -8$.

Combining these equations, we find that the points that satisfy the given equation are:
(8, 8), (8, -8), (-8, 8), (-8, -8), (10, 0), (0, 10), (-10, 0), (0, -10). These points are the vertices of the octagon.

The sides of the octagon are all equal to $\sqrt{8^2 + 8^2} = 8\sqrt{2}$.

The area of the octagon is the sum of the areas of two squares of side length 10 (since the squares with side length 10 contain all the vertices of the octagon) minus the areas of four right triangles with base and height equal to 8 (since each of these right triangles is formed by a side of the octagon and two adjacent sides of a square with side length 10).

The area of each square with side length 10 is $10^2 = 100$, so the total area of the two squares is $2 \times 100 = 200$.

The area of each right triangle is $\frac{1}{2} \times 8 \times 8 = 32$, so the total area of the four right triangles is $4 \times 32 = 128$.

Therefore, the area of the octagon is $200 - 128 = 72$. The answer is: 72

Question (hint: positive numerical answer):
"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"
Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:


The expression is equal to zero if either $(|x + y| - 10)^2 = 0$, $(|x - y| - 10)^2 = 0$, $(|x| - 8)^2 = 0$, or $(|y| - 8)^2 = 0$.

Setting each of the factors equal to zero, we find:

1. If $(|x + y| - 10)^2 = 0$, then $|x + y| = 10$, which gives us the lines $x + y = 10$ and $x + y = -10$.
2. If $(|x - y| - 10)^2 = 0$, then $|x - y| = 10$, which gives us the lines $x - y = 10$ and $x - y = -10$.
3. If $(|x| - 8)^2 = 0$, then $|x| = 8$, which gives us the lines $x = 8$ and $x = -8$.
4. If $(|y| - 8)^2 = 0$, then $|y| = 8$, which gives us the lines $y = 8$ and $y = -8$.

The eight lines divide the plane into 16 regions, and the points that satisfy the original equation lie on the boundaries of these regions. The polygon formed by these points is a square with side length 16, so its area is $16^2 = 256$. The answer is: $256$

"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"
Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:

 The expression $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + (\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + (\vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ is equivalent to $\vert x + y \vert - 10 = 0$ or $\vert x - y \vert - 10 = 0$ or $\vert x \vert - 8 = 0$ or $\vert y \vert - 8 = 0.$ We can rewrite these equations as $\vert x + y \vert = 10,$ $\vert x - y \vert = 10,$ $\vert x \vert = 8,$ and $\vert y \vert = 8.$
The equalities $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$ give us $x = \pm 8$ and $y = \pm 8.$
The equalities $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$ give us two pairs of lines:
$x + y = \pm 10$ and $x - y = \pm 10.$ Solving these pairs of lines, we find the intersection points of the lines to be $(5,5),$ $(5,-5),$ $(-5,5),$ and $(-5,-5).$
Thus, the points that satisfy the equation form a square with side length 16. The area of this square is $16^2 = 256.$ The answer is: $256$ square units
The area of the convex polygon is $\boxed{256}$ square units. The answer is $\boxed{256}$.

Question (hint: positive numerical answer):
"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"
Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:


In order for the expression on the left side of the equation to be equal to 0, at least one of the factors must be 0, because the product of two terms being zero implies one or both of the terms are zero. So we consider two cases:
Case 1: $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$, which implies $\vert x + y \vert = 10$, or $x + y = 10$ or $x + y = -10$.
Case 2: $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$, which implies $\vert x - y \vert = 10$, or $x - y = 10$ or $x - y = -10$.
Case 3: $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$, which implies $\vert x \vert = 8$, or $x = 8$ or $x = -8$.
Case 4: $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$, which implies $\vert y \vert = 8$, or $y = 8$ or $y = -8$.
Solving all of these cases, we find that the points satisfying the given equation lie on the intersections of the lines $x + y = 10, -10$, $x - y = 10, -10$, $x = 8, -8$, and $y = 8, -8$. Plotting these points on a graph and connecting the lines, we find that the enclosed convex polygon is a square with side length 10. The area of a square is given by the square of the length of its side, so the area of the square is $10^2 = 100$. The answer is: $100$ square units

Question (hint: positive numerical answer):
"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"
Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:


This problem requires knowledge of coordinate geometry, absolute value functions and the properties of equality to solve it. The equation given is a product of two expressions each containing absolute value functions. The product being zero means that at least one of the factors must be zero.
First, consider the factor $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2$. For this to be zero, we must have $\vert x + y \vert = 10$, which means $x + y = 10$ or $x + y = -10$. These two lines are the boundary lines of the polygon.

Second, consider the factor $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2$. For this to be zero, we must have $\vert x - y \vert = 10$, which means $x - y = 10$ or $x - y = -10$. These two lines are also the boundary lines of the polygon.

Third, consider the factor $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2$. For this to be zero, we must have $\vert x \vert = 8$, which means $x = 8$ or $x = -8$. These two lines are the boundary lines of the polygon.

Fourth, consider the factor $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2$. For this to be zero, we must have $\vert y \vert = 8$, which means $y = 8$ or $y = -8$. These two lines are the boundary lines of the polygon.

Plot these four lines on a graph and the enclosed region will form a square of side length 20 units. The area of this square is $20^2 = 400$ square units. The answer is: $400$

Question (hint: positive numerical answer):
"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"
Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:


The equation given in the problem is $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$. For the product of two numbers to be zero, at least one of them must be zero. So either $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$.

For the first equation to be zero, we must have $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. This means $x + y = \pm 10$ and $x - y = \pm 10$. Solving this system of equations gives us the following points: $(5,5), (5,-5), (-5,5), (-5,-5)$.

Similarly, for the second equation to be zero, we must have $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$. This means $x = \pm 8$ and $y = \pm 8$. Solving this gives us the following points: $(8,0), (0,8), (-8,0), (0,-8)$.

All of these points lie on the square with vertices at $(8,0), (0,8), (-8,0), (0,-8)$. The side length of this square is 16, so its area is $16^2 = 256$.
The answer is: $256$.

"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"
Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:


This question asks us for the area of a polygon. 
The area of a polygon enclosed by the points that satisfy an equation is equivalent to the number of points satisfying that equation.
If $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$, then the product of two numbers is 0 if and only if at least one of the numbers is zero. 
This means that either $ ((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2) = 0$ or $ ((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$.
If $ ((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2) = 0$, then $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$.
This is satisfied when $x + y = 10$ or $x + y = -10$ and $x - y = 10$ or $x - y = -10$.
These equations can be solved to give the vertices of a square with side length 10: $(5, 5)$, $(5, -5)$, $(-5, -5)$, and $(-5, 5)$.
Similarly, if $ ((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$, then $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$.
This is satisfied when $x = 8$ or $x = -8$ and $y = 8$ or $y = -8$.
These equations can be solved to give the vertices of a square with side length 16: $(8, 8)$, $(8, -8)$, $(-8, -8)$, and $(-8, 8)$.
Taking the union of these two squares gives us the convex polygon whose area we are asked to find.
The area of a square is calculated by squaring the length of one of its sides.
For the first square, the side length is 10, so its area is $10^2 = 100$.
For the second square, the side length is 16, so its area is $16^2 = 256$.
Therefore, the total area of the convex polygon is $100 + 256 = 356$.
The answer is: $356$.

"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"
Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:


For the product to be equal to $0$, one of the factors must be $0$.
This gives us two cases to consider:
Case 1: $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + (\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$.
If this equation is true, then both $\vert x + y \vert - 10 = 0$ and $\vert x - y \vert - 10 = 0$.
This means that $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$.
This is the same as saying $x + y = \pm 10$ and $x - y = \pm 10$.
Solving these equations gives the points as $(5,5), (5,-5), (-5,5),$ and $(-5,-5)$.

Case 2: $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + (\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$.
If this equation is true, then both $\vert x \vert - 8 = 0$ and $\vert y \vert - 8 = 0$.
This means that $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$.
This is the same as saying $x = \pm 8$ and $y = \pm 8$.
Solving these equations gives the points as $(8,0), (-8,0), (0,8),$ and $(0,-8)$.

These eight points form a square with side length $10$. Therefore, the area of this square is $10^2 = 100$. The answer is: $\boxed{100}$.

Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:


The expression $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2$ equals 0 if and only if $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$, which means $x + y = 10$ and $x - y = 10$ or $x + y = -10$ and $x - y = -10$. The first pair of equations yields $x = 10$ and $y = 0$, and the second pair yields $x = -10$ and $y = 0$.
Similarly, $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ if and only if $x = \pm 8$ and $y = \pm 8$.
The four points are $\left( 10, 0 \right), \left( -10, 0 \right), \left( 8, 8 \right)$ and $\left( 8, -8 \right)$. The shape they form is a square with side length 20 (the distance between $\left( 10, 0 \right)$ and $\left( -10, 0 \right)$ or $\left( 8, 8 \right)$ and $\left( 8, -8 \right)$). Therefore, the area of the square is $20^2 = 400$. The answer is: $400$.

"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"
Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:



In order for the product of the two complicated expressions to be 0, at least one of them must be 0. Thus either $(\vert x + y\vert - 10)^2 + (\vert x - y\vert - 10)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert x\vert - 8)^2 + (\vert y\vert - 8)^2 = 0$. If the first expression is 0, then both $\vert x + y\vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y\vert = 10$. This implies that both $x + y = \pm 10$ and $x - y = \pm 10$. Adding these equations, we get $x = \pm 10$. Subtracting the second from the first, we get $2y = 0$ so $y = 0$. Thus either $(x, y) = (10, 0)$ or $(x, y) = (-10, 0)$.  If the second expression is 0, then both $\vert x\vert = 8$ and $\vert y\vert = 8$, which implies $x = \pm 8$ and $y = \pm 8$. Thus the points in the polygon are $(10, 0)$, $( -10, 0)$, $(8, 8)$, $(8, -8)$, $(-8, 8)$, and $(-8, -8)$. These points form a square with side length 20. The area of a square of side length s is $s^2$, thus the area of the polygon is $20^2 = 400$.
The value is
\[400.\] The answer is: $400$.

Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:


The product of two numbers is zero if and only if at least one of the numbers is zero. Therefore, the equation $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ is true if and only if at least one of the following two conditions is true:
1. $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$
2. $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$
The first condition is satisfied if and only if $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$, which implies that $x = y = 5$ or $x = -y = 5$. The second condition is satisfied if and only if $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$, which implies that $(x, y) = (8, 0), (0, 8), (-8, 0)$ or $(0, -8)$. These points form a square with side length $10$.
The area of the square is $10 \times 10 = 100$. The answer is: $100$

"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"
Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:


In order to get a product of two things to be zero, either the first thing has to be zero, or the second thing has to be zero, or both are zero. So, the original equation splits into several smaller equations:
$(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$,
$(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$,
$(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$, and
$(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$.
These equations are easy to solve:
$\vert x + y \vert = 10$,
$\vert x - y \vert = 10$,
$\vert x \vert = 8$, and
$\vert y \vert = 8$.
Then $x + y = \pm 10$, $x - y = \pm 10$, $x = \pm 8$, and $y = \pm 8$. These give us the vertices of the rectangle. Its length is $20$, and its width is $16$. Therefore its area is $20 \times 16 = 320$. Hence the area of the convex polygon is $320$, and our final solution is $320$. The answer is: $\boxed{320}$.

Question (hint: positive numerical answer):
"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"
Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:



Notice that
\[(u - 10)^2 + (v - 10)^2 = 0 \implies u = v = 10,\]and
\[(s - 8)^2 + (t - 8)^2 = 0 \implies s = t = 8.\]Since $(u - 10)^2 + (v - 10)^2 = 0$ and $(s - 8)^2 + (t - 8)^2 = 0$, each pair of absolute value expressions must be equal. That is
\[\vert x + y \vert = 10, \quad \vert x - y \vert = 10, \quad \vert x \vert = 8, \quad \vert y \vert = 8.\]From $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$, we get a square with side length $10$, where the vertices are $(8, 2), (8, -2), (-8, -2), (-8, 2)$.

To convince yourself or to check our work, we graph the equations. The point lie on the intersection of
\[\vert x + y \vert = 10 \text{ and } \vert x - y \vert = 10.\]Also, $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$ define squares with side length $16$, namely
\[\vert x \vert = 8 \text{ is equivalent to } x = 8 \text{ or } x = -8,\]and $\vert y \vert = 8$ is equivalent to $y = 8$ or $y = -8$. So, these two equations intersect at the four vertices of our square.

Therefore, the area of this square is $10 \times 10 = 100$. So, the area of the convex polygon formed by the points $(x, y)$ satisfying the given equation is $100$.
The answer is: $100$

Question (hint: positive numerical answer):
"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"
Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:



First, we notice that if $a \cdot b = 0$, then either $a = 0$ or $b = 0$. So this equation is saying one of the two groups of absolute values have to be equal to 10, and the other two absolute values have to be equal to 8. This translates to the following system of equations:

1. $|x + y| = 10$ and $|x| = 8$, or
2. $|x + y| = 10$ and $|y| = 8$, or
3. $|x - y| = 10$ and $|x| = 8$, or
4. $|x - y| = 10$ and $|y| = 8$.

Let's solve each of these cases:

For case 1: $|x + y| = 10$ and $|x| = 8$ implies that $x = 8$ or $x = -8$. If $x = 8$, then from $|x + y| = 10$, we have $|8 + y| = 10$, which gives $y = 2$ or $y = -18$. If $x = -8$, then from $|x + y| = 10$, we have $|-8 + y| = 10$, which gives $y = 18$ or $y = -2$. So we get the points $(8,2)$, $(8,-18)$, $(-8,18)$, $(-8,-2)$.

For case 2: $|x + y| = 10$ and $|y| = 8$ implies that $y = 8$ or $y = -8$. If $y = 8$, then from $|x + y| = 10$, we have $|x + 8| = 10$, which gives $x = 2$ or $x = -18$. If $y = -8$, then from $|x + y| = 10$, we have $|x - 8| = 10$, which gives $x = 18$ or $x = -2$. So we get the same points $(8,2)$, $(8,-18)$, $(-8,18)$, $(-8,-2)$.

For case 3 and case 4, we get the same points as above.

So all four of these points are in the solution set. When we plot these points on the coordinate plane, we see that they form a rectangle with vertices at $(8,2)$, $(8,-18)$, $(-8,18)$, and $(-8,-2)$.

The width of the rectangle is $20$ (the difference between $8$ and $-8$) and the height is $20$ (the difference between $18$ and $-18$). The area of a rectangle is given by the product of its width and height, so the area of this convex polygon is $20 \times 20 = 400$. Therefore, the area of the convex polygon is $\boxed{400}$ square units.
The answer is: $400$
