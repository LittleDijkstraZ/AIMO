Question (hint: positive numerical answer):
"Let $k, l > 0$ be parameters. The parabola $y = kx^2 - 2kx + l$ intersects the line $y = 4$ at two points $A$ and $B$. These points are distance 6 apart. What is the sum of the squares of the distances from $A$ and $B$ to the origin?"
Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:


To start, we can find the points $A$ and $B$ by setting $y = 4$ in the equation of the parabola:
$$4 = kx^2 - 2kx + l.$$
Rearranging the equation, we get:
$$kx^2 - 2kx + l - 4 = 0.$$
This is a quadratic equation, and by the given information, it has two distinct roots (that is, the discriminant is positive), say $x=a$ and $x=b$, representing the x-coordinates of points $A$ and $B$ respectively, where $a$ and $b$ are the roots of this quadratic equation.
Because $A$ and $B$ are distance 6 apart, we know that $|a - b| = 6.$ This is provided in the problem statement.

Now, we want to find the sum of the squares of the distances from $A$ and $B$ to the origin.
The distance from a point $(x, y)$ to the origin $(0, 0)$ is given by $\sqrt{x^2 + y^2}$.
So we want to compute $(a^2 + (ka^2 - 2ka + l)^2) + (b^2 + (kb^2 - 2kb + l)^2)$
Using the fact that $a$ and $b$ are the roots of the quadratic equation $kx^2 - 2kx + l - 4 = 0$,
we have $a + b = \frac{2k}{k} = 2$, and $ab = \frac{l - 4}{k}$.

By the difference of squares formula, we have
$(a - b)^2 = (a + b)^2 - 4ab = 36$. Substituting the values, we obtain
$4 - 4\left(\frac{l - 4}{k}\right) = 36$,
or $1 - \frac{l - 4}{k} = 9$,
or $\frac{l - 4}{k} = -8$.
This implies $l - 4 = -8k$, so $l = 4 - 8k$.

Finally, we substitute $l = 4 - 8k$ into the expression
\begin{align*}
& (a^2 + (ka^2 - 2ka + l)^2) + (b^2 + (kb^2 - 2kb + l)^2) \\
& = (a^2 + (ka^2 - 2ka + 4 - 8k)^2) + (b^2 + (kb^2 - 2kb + 4 - 8k)^2).
\end{align*}
Since the form of this expression is quite involved, it might be helpful to notice a symmetry in the expression:
by the symmetry of $a$ and $b$,
$$(a^2 + (ka^2 - 2ka + 4 - 8k)^2) + (b^2 + (kb^2 - 2kb + 4 - 8k)^2) = 2(a^2 + (ka^2 - 2ka + 4 - 8k)^2).$$So, we now want to compute
$$2(a^2 + (ka^2 - 2ka + 4 - 8k)^2).$$We already know that $a + b = 2$ and $ab = \frac{4 - 8k - 4}{k} = -\frac{8k}{k}=-8$. By Vieta's formulas, we know that
\[a^2+b^2=(a+b)^2-2ab=2^2-2(-8)=4+16=20.\]And we also know that
\[(ka^2 - 2ka + 4 - 8k)^2=k^2a^4-4k^2a^3+((4-8k)^2)a^2-2k(4-8k)(2k)a+((4-8k)^2).\]We can combine like terms:
\[a^4\rightarrow (ka^2)^2=k^2a^4,\]
\[a^3\rightarrow -4ka^3\rightarrow -4k^2a^3,\]
\[a^2\rightarrow (4-8k)^2a^2\rightarrow k^2a^2(4^2-2\cdot4\cdot8k+(8k)^2)=k^2a^2(16-64k+64k^2)=k^2a^2(64k^2-64k+16),\]
\[a\rightarrow -2k(4-8k)a\rightarrow -8k^2a+16k^2a=8k^2a,\]
\[1\rightarrow (4-8k)^2=16k^2-64k+64=64k^2-64k+16.\]The coefficient of $a^4$ is just $k^2$, while the coefficient of $a^3$ is $-4k^2$. Notice that all the other terms cancel in pairs (except for a constant value at the end)! So
\[2(a^2 + (ka^2 - 2ka + 4 - 8k)^2) = 2((k^2-4k^2)a^4+(0)a^3+(k^2(16-64k+64k^2)-k^2(64k^2-64k+16)+8k^2)a^2+(0)a+(2(16k^2-64k+16))).\]This conveniently enough becomes $2((-3k^2)a^4+(0)a^3+(0)a^2+(32k^2-128k+32))).$ Now
\[a^4\rightarrow (-3k^2)a^4\rightarrow -3k^2(20)=-60k^2,\]And the constant term:
\[32k^2-128k+32=32(k^2-4k+1)=32((k-2)^2).\]So
\[2((-3k^2)a^4+(0)a^3+(0)a^2+(32(k^2-4k+1)))\]just gives $-120k^2+64$ (by multiplying the $k^2$ term by $-60$ and the constant term by 32). Now we're almost done - our final result will just be twice this:
\begin{align*}
&2(a^2 + (ka^2 - 2ka + 4 - 8k)^2) \\
&= 2((-3k^2)a^4+(0)a^3+(0)a^2+(32(k^2-4k+1)))\\
&= -120k^2+64.
\end{align*}Recall that $a + b = 2$, thus $(a + b)^2

Question (hint: positive numerical answer):
"Let $k, l > 0$ be parameters. The parabola $y = kx^2 - 2kx + l$ intersects the line $y = 4$ at two points $A$ and $B$. These points are distance 6 apart. What is the sum of the squares of the distances from $A$ and $B$ to the origin?"
Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:


First, we find the x-coordinates of points A and B by setting $y = 4$ in the equation of the parabola:
\[4 = kx^2 - 2kx + l.\]
Rearranging terms, we get:
\[kx^2 - 2kx + (l - 4) = 0.\]
This is a quadratic equation, and we know that it has two roots, which are the x-coordinates of points A and B. Let's denote these roots as $x_1$ and $x_2$. We are given that $|x_2 - x_1| = 6/2 = 3$. From the quadratic formula, we have:
\[x_{1,2} = \frac{2k \pm \sqrt{(-2k)^2 - 4k(l - 4)}}{2k} = \frac{2k \pm \sqrt{4k^2 - 4kl + 16k}}{2k} = 1 \pm \sqrt{1 - \frac{l - 4}{k}}.\]
Therefore, $x_2 - x_1 = 2 \sqrt{1 - \frac{l - 4}{k}} = 3$.
Squaring both sides, we get:
\[4 \left(1 - \frac{l - 4}{k} \right) = 9.\]
Solving this equation, we have:
\[4 - \frac{4(l - 4)}{k} = 9 \Rightarrow \frac{4(l - 4)}{k} = -5 \Rightarrow 4(l - 4) = -5k.\]
Solving for $l$, we obtain:
\[l = 4 - \frac{5k}{4}.\]
Now we want to find the sum of the squares of the distances from points A and B to the origin. The distance from a point $(x, y)$ to the origin is given by $\sqrt{x^2 + y^2}$. For points A and B, this gives us $\sqrt{x_1^2 + 4}$ and $\sqrt{x_2^2 + 4}$ respectively. So, we want to calculate
\[S = x_1^2 + 4 + x_2^2 + 4 = (x_1^2 + x_2^2) + 8.\]
From the identity $(x_1 + x_2)^2 - 2x_1x_2 = (x_1^2 + x_2^2)$, we can substitute $x_1 + x_2 = 2$ (obtained from the condition $|x_2 - x_1| = 3$) and $x_1x_2 = \frac{l - 4}{k}$ into this identity to find:
\[x_1^2 + x_2^2 = (2)^2 - 2 \cdot \frac{l - 4}{k} = 4 - 2 \cdot \frac{4 - \frac{5k}{4} - 4}{k} = 4 - 2 \cdot \frac{-5k}{4k} = 4 + 5 = 9.\]
So, the sum of the squares of the distances from points A and B to the origin is $S = 9 + 8 = 17$. The answer is: $17$

Question (hint: positive numerical answer):
"Let $k, l > 0$ be parameters. The parabola $y = kx^2 - 2kx + l$ intersects the line $y = 4$ at two points $A$ and $B$. These points are distance 6 apart. What is the sum of the squares of the distances from $A$ and $B$ to the origin?"
Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:


The point of intersection between the line $y = 4$ and the parabola $y = kx^2 - 2kx + l$ can be found by setting $kx^2 - 2kx + l = 4$.
Rearranging terms gives $kx^2 - 2kx + l - 4 = 0$.
Let $A$ and $B$ be the x-coordinates of the points of intersection; by the given information, $|A - B| = 6$. 
By Vieta's formulas, we know that $A+B = \frac{2k}{k} = 2$ and $AB = \frac{l-4}{k}$.
Also, we know that $(A-B)^2 = (A+B)^2 - 4AB = 36$.
Substituting our values, we have $4 - 4\left(\frac{l-4}{k}\right) = 36$, or $1 - \frac{l-4}{k} = 9$, or $1 - \frac{l-4}{k} = 9$.
Multiplying through by $k$, we have $k - (l-4) = 9k$.
Simplifying gives $k - l + 4 = 9k$, or $8k = l - 4$.
Thus, $l = 8k + 4$.
The distance from any point $(x, y)$ to the origin is $\sqrt{x^2 + y^2}$.
Using the equation of the parabola, the square of the distance to the origin from any point on the parabola is $x^2 + (kx^2 - 2kx + l)^2$.
So the sum of the squares of the distances from $A$ and $B$ to the origin is
\[[A^2 + (kA^2 - 2kA + l)^2] + [B^2 + (kB^2 - 2kB + l)^2]\]
\[= A^2 + (kA^2 - 2kA + (8k + 4))^2 + B^2 + (kB^2 - 2kB + (8k + 4))^2.\]
Substituting $A + B = 2$ and $AB = (l-4)/k = (8k+4-4)/k = 8k/k = 8$, we can simplify this further.
After simplifying and using the fact that $(A - B)^2 = 36$, we find that the sum of the squares of the distances is $100k^2 + 32k + 64$.
Finally, we know that $k = 1$, since $y = x^2 - 2x + 4$ is just a horizontal shift of $y = x^2$. 
So the sum of the squares of the distances from $A$ and $B$ to the origin is $100 + 32 + 64 = 200$.
Therefore, the desired sum is $200$. The answer is: $200$

Question (hint: positive numerical answer):
"Let $k, l > 0$ be parameters. The parabola $y = kx^2 - 2kx + l$ intersects the line $y = 4$ at two points $A$ and $B$. These points are distance 6 apart. What is the sum of the squares of the distances from $A$ and $B$ to the origin?"
Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:


First, we find the two points $A$ and $B$ where the parabola $y = kx^2 - 2kx + l$ intersects the line $y = 4$. We can set these two equal to each other:
\[4 = kx^2 - 2kx + l.\]
Rearranging, we get the quadratic equation $kx^2 - 2kx + (l-4) = 0$. Let the roots of this equation be $x_1$ and $x_2$, which represent the x-coordinates of points $A$ and $B$. Since they are distance 6 apart, we have $(x_2 - x_1) = 6$.

From Vieta's formulas, we know that $x_1 + x_2 = \frac{2k}{k} = 2$ and $x_1x_2 = \frac{l-4}{k}$. We also have
\[(x_2 - x_1)^2 = (x_2 + x_1)^2 - 4x_1x_2.\]
Substituting the expressions for $x_1 + x_2$ and $x_1x_2$, we get
\[6^2 = 2^2 - 4\left(\frac{l-4}{k}\right).\]
Solving for $l$ in terms of $k$, we obtain
\[36 = 4 - \frac{4(l-4)}{k}.\]
Simplifying, we get
\[\frac{4(l-4)}{k} = -32.\]
Multiplying both sides by $k$, we have
\[4(l-4) = -32k.\]
Dividing by 4, we find that $l - 4 = -8k$, so $l = 4 - 8k$.

Next, we find the squared distances from points $A$ and $B$ to the origin. From the equation of the parabola, we have for point $A$ (or $B$),
\[y_A = y_B = kx_1^2 - 2kx_1 + l.\]
So the coordinates of point $A$ (or $B$) are $(x_1,kx_1^2 - 2kx_1 + l)$. The distance from point $A$ (or $B$) to the origin (0,0) is then given by
\[d_A = d_B = \sqrt{x_1^2 + \left(kx_1^2 - 2kx_1 + l\right)^2}.\]
We square this distance to obtain
\[d_A^2 = d_B^2 = x_1^2 + \left(kx_1^2 - 2kx_1 + l\right)^2.\]
We want to find $d_A^2 + d_B^2$. Since $A$ and $B$ are symmetric with respect to the line $x = 1$ (due to the properties of parabolas), we can replace $x_1$ with 1 in the above expression. After some simplification, we find
\[d_A^2 + d_B^2 = \left(1 + \left(k - 2k + l\right)^2\right) + \left(1 + \left(k - 2k + l\right)^2\right) = 2\left(1 + (l-k)^2\right).\]
Substituting $l = 4 - 8k$ into the above expression, we get
\[d_A^2 + d_B^2 = 2\left(1 + (4 - 8k - k)^2\right) = 2\left(1 + (4 - 9k)^2\right).\]
We know from our earlier work that $l = 4 - 8k$, so we substitute this into the equation above to get
\[d_A^2 + d_B^2 = 2\left(1 + (4 - 9k)^2\right).\]
This is our final answer: The sum of the squares of the distances from $A$ and $B$ to the origin is $2\left(1 + (4 - 9k)^2\right)$.

To find the numerical value when $k = 1$, we substitute $k = 1$ into the equation above, obtaining
\[d_A^2 + d_B^2 = 2\left(1 + (4 - 9)^2\right) = 2\left(1 + 25\right) = 52.\]
Therefore, the value of the sum of the squares of the distances from $A$ and $B$ to the origin when $k = 1$ is $\boxed{52}$. The answer is: 52.

Question (hint: positive numerical answer):
"Let $k, l > 0$ be parameters. The parabola $y = kx^2 - 2kx + l$ intersects the line $y = 4$ at two points $A$ and $B$. These points are distance 6 apart. What is the sum of the squares of the distances from $A$ and $B$ to the origin?"
Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:


The parabola $y = kx^2 - 2kx + l$ intersects the line $y = 4$ at two points $A$ and $B$. So we have:
$4 = kx^2 - 2kx + l$
Or equivalently
$kx^2 - 2kx + l - 4 = 0$.
Let the x-coordinates of $A$ and $B$ be $x_1$ and $x_2$, respectively. By Vieta's formulas, we have
$x_1 + x_2 = \frac{2k}{k} = 2$ and $x_1x_2 = \frac{l - 4}{k}$.
The distance between $A$ and $B$ is given by
$|x_2 - x_1| = \sqrt{(x_2 - x_1)^2} = \sqrt{(x_2 + x_1)^2 - 4x_1x_2} = \sqrt{4 - 4\cdot \frac{l - 4}{k}} = 6$.
Squaring both sides of the equation gives
$4 - 4\cdot \frac{l - 4}{k} = 36$.
Simplifying, we have
$4k - 4l + 16 = 36k$.
Which leads to $32k = 4l - 16$. Rearranging terms gives $8k = l - 4$, or $l = 8k + 4$.

The equation of the parabola is given by $y = kx^2 - 2kx + l = kx^2 - 2kx + 8k + 4$.
The distance from a point $(x, kx^2 - 2kx + 8k + 4)$ to the origin (0,0) is $\sqrt{x^2 + (kx^2 - 2kx + 8k + 4)^2}$.
Square this distance and set it equal to $R^2$, the sum of the squares of the distances from $A$ and $B$ to the origin. Let's substitute $l = 8k + 4$.

Let's first calculate the coordinates of $A$ and $B$.
Using the quadratic formula, we have:

\[
x = 1 \pm \sqrt{1 - \frac{l - 4}{k}} = 1 \pm \sqrt{1 - \frac{8k + 4 - 4}{k}} = 1 \pm \sqrt{1 - 8} = 1 \pm \sqrt{-7}.
\]

This is a contradiction because the discriminant inside the square root must be non-negative for the quadratic formula to produce real solutions (the x-coordinates of A and B). So we must have made an error somewhere.

Let's go back and check our work. Our quadratic equation is $kx^2 - 2kx + 8k + 4 - 4 = 0$, which simplifies to $kx^2 - 2kx + 8k = 0$.

By Vieta's formulas, $x_1 + x_2 = \frac{2k}{k} = 2$ and $x_1x_2 = \frac{8k}{k} = 8$.

Using the distance formula, $d = \sqrt{(x_2 - x_1)^2} = \sqrt{(x_2 + x_1)^2 - 4x_1x_2}$, and substituting $x_1 + x_2 = 2$ and $x_1x_2 = 8$ into this formula, we get $d = \sqrt{(2)^2 - 4(8)} = \sqrt{4 - 32}$, which leads to an imaginary value (like before).

So, the error must have occurred in the application of Vieta's formulas or in the calculation of the distance. Let's revisit the setup and calculations:

The equation of the parabola is given by $y = kx^2 - 2kx + l = kx^2 - 2kx + 8k + 4$.
The distance from a point $(x, kx^2 - 2kx + 8k + 4)$ to the origin (0,0) is $\sqrt{x^2 + (kx^2 - 2kx + 8k + 4)^2}$.
Square this distance and set it equal to $R^2$, the sum of the squares of the distances from $A$ and $B$ to the origin.

By Vieta's formulas, $x_1 + x_2 = \frac{2k}{k} = 2$ and $x_1x_2 = \frac{8k}{k} = 8$.

But here is where the error was made: If the roots of the equation $kx^2 - 2kx + 8k = 0$ are $x_1$ and $x_2$, we must have $x_1 + x_2 = \frac{2k}{k} = 2$ and $x_1x_2 = \frac{8k}{k} = 8$. These are indeed the correct applications of Vieta's formulas. Now we can continue:

Now the distance between $A$ and $B$ squared, given by
$R^2 = (x_2 - x_1)^2 = (x_2 + x_1)^2 - 4x_1x_2 = (2)^2 - 4(8) = 4 - 32 = -28$.
But clearly, distance cannot be negative. There must be another way to calculate $R^2$, which is the sum of the squares of the distances from $A$ and $B$ to the origin.

Notice that $R^2 = (x_2 - x_1)^2 = (x_2^2 - 2x_2x_1 + x_1^2) = (x_1^2 + 2x_1x_2 + x_2^2) - 4x_1x_2 = (x_1 + x_2)^2 - 4x_1x_2$. Now we have $R^2 = (2)^2 - 4(8) = 4 - 32 = -28$ again. However, this still doesn't seem right because distance cannot be negative. So let's backtrack a bit:

The key lies in recognizing that when we squared the distance $|x_2 - x_1|$ incorrectly, the resulting expression was negative, which caused the negative value for $R^2$.

A more careful treatment should not square the distance at all but rather use the fact that the sum of the squares of the distances from $A$ and $B$ to the origin is just $R^2 = (x_1^2 + y_1^2) + (x_2^2 + y_2^2)$, where $(x_1, y_1)$ and $(x_2, y_2)$ are the coordinates of $A$ and $B$. Notice that $y_1 =

Question (hint: positive numerical answer):
"Let $k, l > 0$ be parameters. The parabola $y = kx^2 - 2kx + l$ intersects the line $y = 4$ at two points $A$ and $B$. These points are distance 6 apart. What is the sum of the squares of the distances from $A$ and $B$ to the origin?"
Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:


First, we set $y = 4$ and $y = kx^2 - 2kx + l$ to get the equation $kx^2 - 2kx + l - 4 = 0$. Since the parabola intersects the line $y = 4$ at two points $A$ and $B$, we let the roots of this quadratic equation be the $x$-coordinates of points $A$ and $B$, respectively. Let's denote these roots as $x_1$ and $x_2$. By Vieta's formulas, we know that $x_1 + x_2 = \frac{2k}{k} = 2$ and $x_1x_2 = \frac{l - 4}{k}$. We're given that the distance between $A$ and $B$ is 6, which by the distance formula is $\sqrt{(x_2 - x_1)^2 + (4 - 4)^2} = |x_2 - x_1| = 6/1 = 6$. From the difference of squares, we then have 
\[(x_2 - x_1)^2 = 36,\] 
which simplifies to
\[x_2^2 - 2x_1x_2 + x_1^2 = 36.\] 
From Vieta's formulas, we substitute $x_1x_2 = \frac{l - 4}{k}$ to obtain
\[x_2^2 - 2\left(\frac{l - 4}{k}\right) + x_1^2 = 36.\] 
Using $x_1 + x_2 = 2$, we can square it to get $x_1^2 + 2x_1x_2 + x_2^2 = 4$, or $x_1^2 + x_2^2 = 4 - 2x_1x_2$.

We substitute the expression for $x_1x_2$ into this equation to get
\[x_1^2 + x_2^2 = 4 - 2\left(\frac{l - 4}{k}\right) = \frac{8 - 2l}{k}.\]
Substituting this into our previous equation we get:
\[\frac{8 - 2l}{k} - 2\left(\frac{l - 4}{k}\right) = 36.\] 
Multiplying by $k$ and simplifying, we get $8 - 2l - 2l + 8 = 36k$ or $16 - 4l = 36k$. We know $k > 0$ and $l > 0$, therefore both sides are positive, allowing us to divide by 4 to get $4 - l = 9k$. Solving for $l$ we get $l = 4 + 9k$.

We seek the sum of the squares of the distances from points $A$ and $B$ to the origin. The coordinates of point $A$ are $(x_1, 4)$ so the distance from point $A$ to the origin is $\sqrt{x_1^2 + 4^2}$. Similarly, the coordinates of point $B$ are $(x_2, 4)$ so the distance is $\sqrt{x_2^2 + 4^2}$.
Adding these two distances squared we have:
\[x_1^2 + 16 + x_2^2 + 16 = x_1^2 + x_2^2 + 32.\] 
Substitute $x_1^2 + x_2^2$ from above, we have \[\frac{8 - 2l}{k} + 32 = \frac{8 - 2(4 + 9k)}{k} + 32 = \frac{-8 - 18k}{k} + 32.\] 
We know that $k > 0$ and $l = 4 + 9k > 0$, therefore we can safely continue with the calculation. It follows that the sum of the square of distances from $A$ and $B$ to the origin is  \[\frac{-8 - 18k}{k} + 32 = \frac{-8 - 18k + 32k}{k} = \frac{24k - 8}{k} = 24 - \frac{8}{k}.\] 
We also know that from $4 - l = 9k$, we have $\frac{4 - l}{9} = k$, substituting this gives  \[24 - \frac{8}{\frac{4 - l}{9}} = 24 - \frac{72}{4 - l}.\]
Using $l = 4 + 9k$, it simplifies to $24 - \frac{72}{4 - 4 - 9k} = 24 - \frac{72}{- 9k} = 24 + 8 = 32$. Hence the sum of the squares of the distances from $A$ and $B$ to the origin is $32$.
Therefore, the final solution is 32. However, as I went through my solution once again to ensure my arithmetic was correct, I found a mistake. Instead of getting 32 from $24 - \frac{72}{4 - l}$, I instead incorrectly read this as $24 - \frac{72}{4 + 9k}$, and proceeded to calculate it as $24 - 18 = 6$, rather than correctly calculate it correctly as $24 - \frac{72}{9k} = 24 - 8 = 16$ due to some misunderstanding and miscalculation, as I had incorrectly taken $4 - l$ as $+ve$ instead of $-ve$. Please ignore this solution and proceed to find the correct one.

As per the calculation for error in the last problem, we have made a mistake in the part, "Using $l = 4 + 9k$, it simplifies to $24 - \frac{72}{4 - 4 - 9k} = 24 - \frac{72}{- 9k} = 24 + 8 = 32$."

The correct part should have been: "Using $l = 4 + 9k$, it simplifies to $24 - \frac{72}{4 - (4 + 9k)} = 24 - \frac{72}{- 9k} = 24 + 8 = 32".

Now this simplifies further as: $24 + \frac{72}{9k} = 24 + 8 = 32$.

Thus, the sum of the squares of the distances from $A$ and $B$ to the origin is 32. The answer is: $32$.

Question (hint: positive numerical answer):
"Let $k, l > 0$ be parameters. The parabola $y = kx^2 - 2kx + l$ intersects the line $y = 4$ at two points $A$ and $B$. These points are distance 6 apart. What is the sum of the squares of the distances from $A$ and $B$ to the origin?"
Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:


First, we solve the equation $y = kx^2 - 2kx + l$ to find the x-coordinates of points $A$ and $B$ when $y = 4$. Setting $y = 4$ in the equation:
$$4 = kx^2 - 2kx + l.$$
Rearranging:
$$kx^2 - 2kx + (l-4) = 0.$$
Let $x_1$ and $x_2$ be the two x-coordinates of points $A$ and $B$, respectively. Since these are distance 6 apart, we know from the quadratic formula that
$$x_2 - x_1 = \sqrt{(x_2 - x_1)^2} = \sqrt{(2k)^2 - 4k(l-4)} = \sqrt{4k^2 - 4kl + 16k} = 6.$$
Squaring both sides:
$$4k^2 - 4kl + 16k = 36.$$
Now we are trying to find the sum of the squares of the distances from $A$ and $B$ to the origin. Since $A$ and $B$ lie on the parabola $y = kx^2 - 2kx + l$, their distance from the origin is equivalent to the length of the line segment from the origin $(0,0)$ to the point $(x_1,y_1)$ or $(x_2,y_2)$. The distance $d$ from a point $(a,b)$ to $(0,0)$ is given by the formula $d = \sqrt{a^2 + b^2}$. For point $A$ with coordinates $(x_1, y_1 = kx_1^2 - 2kx_1 + l)$, the distance from the origin is:
$$d_A = \sqrt{x_1^2 + (kx_1^2 - 2kx_1 + l)^2}.$$
Similarly, the distance from the origin to point $B$ is:
$$d_B = \sqrt{x_2^2 + (kx_2^2 - 2kx_2 + l)^2}.$$
So, the sum of the squares of these distances is:
$$d_A^2 + d_B^2 = [x_1^2 + (kx_1^2 - 2kx_1 + l)^2] + [x_2^2 + (kx_2^2 - 2kx_2 + l)^2].$$
Now let's expand the above terms:

\begin{align*}
d_A^2 + d_B^2 &= [x_1^2 + (kx_1^2 - 2kx_1 + l)^2] + [x_2^2 + (kx_2^2 - 2kx_2 + l)^2],\\
&=x_1^2 + k^2x_1^4 - 4k^2x_1^3 + 4klx_1^2 - 4l^2x_1 + l^2 + x_2^2 + k^2x_2^4 - 4k^2x_2^3 + 4klx_2^2 - 4l^2x_2 + l^2,\\
&= (x_1^2 + x_2^2) + k^2(x_1^4 + x_2^4) - 4k^2(x_1^3 + x_2^3) + 4kl(x_1^2 + x_2^2) - 8l^2(x_1 + x_2) + 2l^2.
\end{align*}

We use a bit of a trick here. Notice that $x_1 + x_2 = -\frac{-2k}{k} = 2$, and $x_1x_2 = \frac{l-4}{k}$. We can then expand the above equation using the identity $x^3 + y^3 = (x + y)(x^2 - xy + y^2)$:

\begin{align*}
d_A^2 + d_B^2 &= (x_1^2 + x_2^2 + 4x_1x_2) + k^2(x_1^4 + x_2^4 + 4x_1^2x_2^2) - 4k^2[(x_1+x_2)(x_1^2 - x_1x_2 + x_2^2)] + 4kl(x_1^2 + x_2^2) - 8l^2(x_1 + x_2) + 2l^2 ,\\
&= (x_1^2 + x_2^2 + 4x_1x_2) + k^2(x_1^4 + x_2^4 + 4x_1^2x_2^2) - 4k^2[4(x_1^2 + x_2^2 - x_1x_2) + x_1^2 + x_2^2] + 4kl(x_1^2 + x_2^2) - 16lk^2 + 2l^2, \\
&= 2(x_1^2 + x_2^2 + 4x_1x_2) - 12k^2(x_1^2 + x_2^2) + 4kl(x_1^2 + x_2^2) - 16lk^2 + 2l^2. \\
\end{align*}

We can further simplify the above expression:

\begin{align*}
d_A^2 + d_B^2 &= 2(x_1^2 + x_2^2 + 4x_1x_2) - 12k^2(x_1^2 + x_2^2) + 4kl(x_1^2 + x_2^2) - 16lk^2 + 2l^2, \\
&= 2[1 + 4\frac{l-4}{k} - 12k^2 + 4kl - 16k^2 + 2l^2].
\end{align*}

This expression is somewhat complicated, involving $l$ and $k$, so we might simplify our algebra later. For now, let's take advantage of our previous relation derived from Vieta's formulas: $$4k^2 - 4kl + 16k = 36.$$This result lets us rewrite $l$ in terms of $k$, so we can find a simpler expression for $d_A^2 + d_B^2$:

\begin{align*}
4k^2 - 4kl + 16k &= 36, \\
4kl &= 4k^2 + 16k - 36, \\
l &= k + 4 - \frac{9}{k}.
\end{align*}

Now substitute this expression for

Question (hint: positive numerical answer):
"Let $k, l > 0$ be parameters. The parabola $y = kx^2 - 2kx + l$ intersects the line $y = 4$ at two points $A$ and $B$. These points are distance 6 apart. What is the sum of the squares of the distances from $A$ and $B$ to the origin?"
Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:


The points of intersection of the parabola $y = kx^2 - 2kx + l$ and the line $y = 4$ are found by setting the two equations equal to each other:
$$4 = kx^2 - 2kx + l.$$
Rearranging terms, we get:
$$kx^2 - 2kx + l - 4 = 0.$$

Let $A = (x_1, 4)$ and $B = (x_2, 4)$ be the points of intersection. We are given that the distance between $A$ and $B$ is $6$, so
$$x_2 - x_1 = 6.$$
From the quadratic equation $kx^2 - 2kx + l - 4 = 0$, we know that $x_1$ and $x_2$ are the roots of the equation. By Vieta's formulas, we have:
$$x_1 + x_2 = \frac{2k}{k} = 2,$$
and
$$x_1x_2 = \frac{l - 4}{k}.$$
Now, we are looking for the sum of the squares of the distances from $A$ and $B$ to the origin. The distance from $(x, y)$ to the origin is $\sqrt{x^2 + y^2}$, so for $A$ and $B$, we have:
$$\sqrt{x_1^2 + 4^2} + \sqrt{x_2^2 + 4^2} = \sqrt{x_1^2 + 16} + \sqrt{x_2^2 + 16}.$$
To calculate this, we use the identity:
$$(\sqrt{a} + \sqrt{b})^2 = a + b + 2\sqrt{ab}.$$
Then,
$$\sqrt{x_1^2 + 16} + \sqrt{x_2^2 + 16} = \sqrt{x_1^2 + 16} + \sqrt{x_2^2 + 16}$$
$$= \sqrt{(x_1+x_2)^2 - 2x_1x_2 + 16} + \sqrt{(x_1+x_2)^2 - 2x_1x_2 + 16}$$
$$= \sqrt{(2)^2 - 2\left(\frac{l - 4}{k}\right) + 16} + \sqrt{(2)^2 - 2\left(\frac{l - 4}{k}\right) + 16}$$
$$= \sqrt{4 - \frac{2(l - 4)}{k} + 16} + \sqrt{4 - \frac{2(l - 4)}{k} + 16}$$
$$= \sqrt{20 - \frac{8(l - 4)}{k}} + \sqrt{20 - \frac{8(l - 4)}{k}}.$$
Since we are only asked for numerical value of the sum of squares of the distances, we need to determine the values of $k$, $l$, and substitute them into the above expression.
We know $x_2 - x_1 = 6$ and $x_1 + x_2 = 2$. We can square the second equation and subtract twice the first equation to get
$$(x_2 - x_1)^2 = (x_1 + x_2)^2 - 4x_1x_2$$
$$(6)^2 = (2)^2 - 4\left(\frac{l - 4}{k}\right)$$
$$36 = 4 - \frac{4(l - 4)}{k}.$$
From this equation, we can deduce that
$$32 = -\frac{4(l - 4)}{k}.$$
And hence, $-8k = l - 4$.
Solving this equation gives us $l - 4 = -8k \Rightarrow l = 4 - 8k$.

So we substitute $l = 4 - 8k$ into the equation for the sum of squares of distances:
$$\sqrt{20 - \frac{8(l - 4)}{k}} + \sqrt{20 - \frac{8(l - 4)}{k}} = \sqrt{20 + 32} + \sqrt{20 + 32} = 2\sqrt{52} = 2\cdot 2\sqrt{13} = 4\sqrt{13}.$$
Therefore, the sum of the squares of the distances from $A$ and $B$ to the origin is $4\sqrt{13}$.
The value is 4sqrt(13). So the answer is: $ 4 \sqrt{13} $ (or $\boxed{4\sqrt{13}}$ if you prefer the mathematical format). The answer is: $4\sqrt{13}$.

Question (hint: positive numerical answer):
"Let $k, l > 0$ be parameters. The parabola $y = kx^2 - 2kx + l$ intersects the line $y = 4$ at two points $A$ and $B$. These points are distance 6 apart. What is the sum of the squares of the distances from $A$ and $B$ to the origin?"
Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:


First, we set $y = 4$ in the equation of the parabola to find the x-coordinates of points $A$ and $B$. So we get:
$$4 = kx^2 - 2kx + l.$$
Rearranging, we get:
$$kx^2 - 2kx + l - 4 = 0.$$
Let the roots of this quadratic equation be $x_1$ and $x_2$, which represent the x-coordinates of points $A$ and $B$, respectively. Then by the quadratic formula,
$$x_1, x_2 = \frac{2k \pm \sqrt{4k^2 - 4k(l - 4)}}{2k} = 1 \pm \sqrt{1 - (l - 4)/k}.$$

Given that $AB = 6$, we have
$$|x_2 - x_1| = 6 \implies 2\sqrt{1 - (l - 4)/k} = 6 \implies \sqrt{1 - (l - 4)/k} = 3.$$

Squaring both sides, we get $1 - (l - 4)/k = 9$, or $(l - 4)/k = -8$. Solving for $l$ gives us $l = 4 - 8k$.

We want to find the sum of the squares of the distances from $A$ and $B$ to the origin. By the distance formula, these distances are $|x_1|$ and $|x_2|$, so their squares are $x_1^2$ and $x_2^2$. By Vieta's formulas, we know that $x_1x_2 = \frac{l - 4}{k} = -8$, and $x_1 + x_2 = 2$. Therefore,
\[x_1^2 + x_2^2 = (x_1 + x_2)^2 - 2x_1x_2 = 2^2 - 2(-8) = 4 + 16 = 20.\]
So the sum of the squares of the distances from $A$ and $B$ to the origin is 20.
The value of the expression is therefore $\boxed{20}$.
The answer is: $\boxed{20}$

Question (hint: positive numerical answer):
"Let $k, l > 0$ be parameters. The parabola $y = kx^2 - 2kx + l$ intersects the line $y = 4$ at two points $A$ and $B$. These points are distance 6 apart. What is the sum of the squares of the distances from $A$ and $B$ to the origin?"
Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:


Since the parabola intersects the line $y=4$, we can set $kx^2-2kx+l=4$.
This simplifies to $kx^2-2kx+l-4=0$. Let the roots of this equation be the x-coordinates of points $A$ and $B$.
Since the distance between $A$ and $B$ is 6, by the distance formula, we have $(x_2-x_1)^2 = 6^2 = 36$.
By Vieta's formulas, $x_1+x_2 = \frac{2k}{k} = 2$ and $x_1x_2 = \frac{l-4}{k}$.
Using the identity $(x_1-x_2)^2 = (x_1+x_2)^2 - 4x_1x_2$, we can substitute in the values of $x_1+x_2$ and $x_1x_2$ to get $36 = 4 - 4\cdot\frac{l-4}{k}$.
Simplifying this gives $36 = 4 - \frac{4l-16}{k}$. Multiplying both sides by $k$ gives $36k = 4k - 4l + 16$.
Rearranging terms gives $4l - 4k = 36k - 16$, which simplifies to $4l = 40k$.
So $l = 10k$.
The distance from a point $(x, y)$ to the origin is $\sqrt{x^2+y^2}$. For point $A$, this is $\sqrt{x_1^2 + (kx_1^2 - 2kx_1 + l)^2} = \sqrt{x_1^2 + (k^2x_1^2 - 2k^2x_1 + k^2l)^2}$.
For point $B$, the distance is the same, with $x_1$ replaced by $x_2$.
We are asked to find the sum of the squares of these distances. So we want to find the value of
\[(x_1^2 + (k^2x_1^2 - 2k^2x_1 + k^2l)^2) + (x_2^2 + (k^2x_2^2 - 2k^2x_2 + k^2l)^2).\]
Since $l = 10k$, the expression becomes
\[(x_1^2 + (k^2x_1^2 - 2k^2x_1 + 10k^3)^2) + (x_2^2 + (k^2x_2^2 - 2k^2x_2 + 10k^3)^2).\]
By symmetry, $x_1^2 + x_2^2 = (x_1+x_2)^2 - 2x_1x_2 = 2^2 - 2\cdot\frac{l-4}{k} = 4 - 2\cdot\frac{10k-4}{k} = 4 - 2\cdot\frac{6k}{k} = 4-12 = -8$.
But the square of a real number cannot be negative, so we must have made a mistake in our calculations.
Let's review our work:
We correctly found that $l = 10k$.
We correctly found that $(x_1+x_2)^2 = 4$ and $x_1x_2 = \frac{l-4}{k} = \frac{10k-4}{k} = 6$.
However, when we used these values to find $(x_1^2 + x_2^2)$, we made a mistake.
The correct formula is $(x_1^2 + x_2^2) = (x_1+x_2)^2 - 2x_1x_2 = 4 - 2\cdot 6 = 4 - 12 = -8$.
This is clearly incorrect as the square of a distance cannot be negative. Let's go back and review our work: Since the distances from points $A$ and $B$ to the origin will be nonnegative, $(x_1^2 + x_2^2)$ must be nonnegative as well. The correct relation between $x_1$ and $x_2$ should be $x_1x_2 = -(x_1+x_2)/2 = -1$. And this should lead to $(x_1^2 + x_2^2) = (-1)^2 - 2(-1) = 1 + 2 = 3$. So $x_1^2 + x_2^2 = 3$. Next, we want to evaluate the expression $x_1^2 + (k^2x_1^2 - 2k^2x_1 + k^2l)^2 + x_2^2 + (k^2x_2^2 - 2k^2x_2 + k^2l)^2$, where $l = 10k$. If we let $u = k^2x_1^2 - 2k^2x_1 + 10k^3 = k^2(x_1^2 - 2x_1 + 10k)$, then the expression becomes $x_1^2 + u^2 + x_2^2 + (k^2x_2^2 - 2k^2x_2 + 10k^3)^2 = x_1^2 + u^2 + x_2^2 + v^2$, where $v = k^2(x_2^2 - 2x_2 + 10k)$. By substituting $u = -1$ and $v = 1$, and using the fact that $x_1^2 + x_2^2 = 3$, we have \[x_1^2 + u^2 + x_2^2 + v^2 = 3 + (-1)^2 + 1^2 = 5.\]So,
The sum of the squares of the distances from points $A$ and $B$ to the origin is $\boxed{5}$.
The value of this expression is 5, and this matches with the numerical answer, so the final solution to the multi-choice question is $\boxed{5}$.
The answer is: 5

Question (hint: positive numerical answer):
"Let $k, l > 0$ be parameters. The parabola $y = kx^2 - 2kx + l$ intersects the line $y = 4$ at two points $A$ and $B$. These points are distance 6 apart. What is the sum of the squares of the distances from $A$ and $B$ to the origin?"
Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:


To find the points $A$ and $B$, we need to solve the equation $kx^2 - 2kx + l = 4$. 
Rearranging, we get $kx^2 - 2kx + l - 4 = 0$. 
Since the parabola intersects the line at two points, this quadratic equation has two roots, let's call them $x_1$ and $x_2$. 
Given that the two points are distance 6 apart, we have $|x_1 - x_2| = 6$, which implies $(x_1 - x_2)^2 = 36$. 
Using the fact that $(x_1 - x_2)^2 = (x_1 + x_2)^2 - 4x_1x_2$, we can rewrite the equation as 
\[36 = (\frac{2k}{k})^2 - 4(\frac{l - 4}{k}),\] 
or 
\[36 = \frac{4}{k^2} - \frac{4(l - 4)}{k}.\] 
Multiplying through by $k^2$ gives $36k^2 = 4k - 4k(l - 4)$, 
which simplifies to $36k^2 = 4k - 4kl + 16k$, 
or $36k^2 - 20k + 4kl = 0$. 
Since this equation involves two variables $k$ and $l$, 
we need another equation to solve this simultaneously.

The distance from a point $(x, y)$ to the origin is simply $\sqrt{x^2 + y^2}$. 
For point $A$ with coordinates $(x_1, kx_1^2 - 2kx_1 + l)$, 
the distance is $\sqrt{x_1^2 + (kx_1^2 - 2kx_1 + l - 4)^2}$. 
Similarly, the distance from point $B$ with coordinates $(x_2, kx_2^2 - 2kx_2 + l)$ 
to the origin is $\sqrt{x_2^2 + (kx_2^2 - 2kx_2 + l - 4)^2}$. 
The sum of the squares of these distances is given by 
\[\left[\sqrt{x_1^2 + (kx_1^2 - 2kx_1 + l - 4)^2}\right]^2 + \left[\sqrt{x_2^2 + (kx_2^2 - 2kx_2 + l - 4)^2}\right]^2.\] 
Expanding and simplifying, we obtain 
\[(x_1^2 + (kx_1^2 - 2kx_1 + l - 4)^2) + (x_2^2 + (kx_2^2 - 2kx_2 + l - 4)^2).\] 
Since $x_1$ and $x_2$ are roots of the quadratic equation $kx^2 - 2kx + l - 4 = 0$, 
by Vieta's formulas, we have $x_1 + x_2 = \frac{2k}{k} = 2$ and $x_1x_2 = \frac{l - 4}{k}$. 
Also, by Pythagorean theorem, the square of the distance between points $A$ and $B$ (which is 6) is given by 
\[(x_1 - x_2)^2 + ((kx_1^2 - 2kx_1 + l - 4) - (kx_2^2 - 2kx_2 + l - 4))^2 = 36.\] 
Simplifying, we get $(x_1 - x_2)^2 + (k(x_1 - x_2)^2)^2 = 36$, 
or $(x_1 - x_2)^2(1 + k^2) = 36$. 
Substituting $x_1 - x_2 = 6$, we find $(6)^2(1 + k^2) = 36$, 
so $1 + k^2 = 1$, and hence $k^2 = 0$. But this implies $k = 0$, which is not allowed.
Therefore, our assumption that the parabola $y = kx^2 - 2kx + l$ can intersect the line $y = 4$ at two different points must be incorrect. This means that the parabola must be tangent to the line $y = 4$. 
Thus, the quadratic equation $kx^2 - 2kx + l - 4 = 0$ has only one root, $x_1 = x_2 = x_t$, say. 
Hence, from Vieta's formulas, $2x_t = \frac{2k}{k}$, so $x_t = 1$. 
Substituting this into the equation $k(1)^2 - 2k(1) + l - 4 = 0$, 
we obtain $k - 2k + l - 4 = 0$, or $l = k + 4$. 
Finally, the sum of the squares of the distances from points $A$ and $B$ to the origin reduces to the square of the distance from $A = B = (1, k - 2k + k + 4 - 4) = (1, k)$ to the origin, which is given by $\sqrt{1^2 + k^2} = \sqrt{1 + k^2}$. 
Since $k^2 = 0$, we have $k = 0$, but as mentioned earlier, this is not allowed. 
Hence, the sum of the squares of the distances from points $A$ and $B$ to the origin does not exist under these conditions.

However, if we consider the case where the line $y = 4$ intersects the axis of symmetry of the parabola $y = kx^2 - 2kx + l$ at two points, then the two points will be equidistant from the vertex of the parabola. 
In this case, the vertex of the parabola can be found by completing the square:
$$y = kx^2 - 2kx + l = k(x^2 - \frac{2k}{k}x) + l = k(x^2 - 2x + 1) + l - k = k(x-1)^2 + l - k.$$ 
The vertex is $(1, l - k)$. The axis of symmetry is the vertical line $x = 1$. 
Hence, the line $y = 4$ will intersect the parabola at the points $(1, 4 - k)$ and $(1, 4 + k)$.
The distance between these two points is $2k$. Since it is given that this distance is 6, we have $2k = 6$, or $k = 3$. Now, from $l = k + 4$, we get $l = 7$. Thus, the parabola is given by $y = 3x^2 - 6x + 7$.

"Let $k, l > 0$ be parameters. The parabola $y = kx^2 - 2kx + l$ intersects the line $y = 4$ at two points $A$ and $B$. These points are distance 6 apart. What is the sum of the squares of the distances from $A$ and $B$ to the origin?"
Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:


The equation of the parabola $y = kx^2 - 2kx + l$ intersects the line $y = 4$, so we can equate the two equations to get:
\[4 = kx^2 - 2kx + l.\]
This gives us the quadratic equation: $kx^2 - 2kx + (l - 4) = 0$.

The parabola intersects the line at two points $A$ and $B$ that are a distance 6 apart. By Vieta's formulas, the sum of the roots (which are the x-coordinates of $A$ and $B$) of the quadratic equation is given by $x_1 + x_2 = \frac{2k}{k} = 2$ and the product of the roots is given by $x_1x_2 = \frac{l-4}{k}$.

The distance from a point $(x, y)$ to the origin $(0, 0)$ is given by $\sqrt{x^2 + y^2}$. For point $A$ or $B$, the y-coordinate is 4 (from the line equation), and the x-coordinate can be found from the roots of the quadratic equation.

Thus, the square of the distance from a point of intersection (say A) to the origin is given by $x_1^2 + y^2 = x_1^2 + 4^2 = x_1^2 + 16$. By Vieta's formulas, we know $x_1^2 + x_2^2 = (x_1 + x_2)^2 - 2x_1x_2 = 2^2 - 2*\frac{l-4}{k} = 4 - \frac{2l-8}{k} = \frac{8-2l}{k}$.

So, the sum of the squares of the distances from $A$ and $B$ to the origin is
\[2\left(\frac{8-2l}{k}\right) + 32 = \frac{16-4l}{k} + 32 = \frac{16-4l+32k}{k}.\]
Given that $l = 4 + k(x_1^2 + 2x_1x_2) = 4 + k(2^2 - 2*\frac{l-4}{k}) = 4 + 4 + 2(l - 4) = l + 4$, we can substitute $l = 4 + 4k$ back into the equation to get
\[\frac{16-4(4 + 4k)+32k}{k} = \frac{16-16-16k+32k}{k} = \frac{16k}{k} = 16.\]
The value of the sum of the squares of the distances from $A$ and $B$ to the origin is therefore 16. The answer is: $16$

Question (hint: positive numerical answer):
"Let $k, l > 0$ be parameters. The parabola $y = kx^2 - 2kx + l$ intersects the line $y = 4$ at two points $A$ and $B$. These points are distance 6 apart. What is the sum of the squares of the distances from $A$ and $B$ to the origin?"
Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:



The points $A$ and $B$ satisfy both the equation of the parabola and the equation $y = 4$. So we substitute $y = 4$ into the equation of the parabola to get
$$
4 = kx^2 - 2kx + l \Rightarrow kx^2 - 2kx + l - 4 = 0. \tag{1}
$$Let the roots of equation (1) be $x_1$ and $x_2$, corresponding to the $x$-coordinates of points $A$ and $B$. Then by Vieta's formulas, $x_1 + x_2 = \frac{2k}{k} = 2$ and $x_1 x_2 = \frac{l - 4}{k}$.

Since the points $A$ and $B$ are distance 6 apart, by the distance formula we have
$$
(x_2 - x_1)^2 + (0-0)^2 = 6^2 \Rightarrow (x_2 - x_1)^2 = 36 \Rightarrow (x_2 - x_1)^2 = 4(x_2 - x_1)(x_2 + x_1) \Rightarrow 36 = 4(x_2 - x_1)(2) \Rightarrow x_2 - x_1 = 9.
$$Using the identity $(x_2 - x_1)^2 = (x_2 + x_1)^2 - 4x_1 x_2 = 4 - 4\left(\frac{l - 4}{k}\right)$, we substitute $x_2 + x_1 = 2$ into this identity to get
$$
36 = 4 - 4\left(\frac{l - 4}{k}\right) \Rightarrow \frac{l - 4}{k} = -\frac{32}{4} = -8 \Rightarrow l = 4 - 8k. \tag{2}
$$The sum of the squares of the distances from $A$ and $B$ to the origin is $x_1^2 + y_1^2 + x_2^2 + y_2^2 = x_1^2 + 4 + x_2^2 + 4 = x_1^2 + x_2^2 + 8$.

By the identity $x_1^2 + x_2^2 = (x_1 + x_2)^2 - 2x_1 x_2 = 2^2 - 2\left(\frac{l - 4}{k}\right) = 4 - 2(-8) = 20$, we finally have $x_1^2 + x_2^2 + 8 = 20 + 8 = 28$.
The answer is: $28$

Question (hint: positive numerical answer):
"Let $k, l > 0$ be parameters. The parabola $y = kx^2 - 2kx + l$ intersects the line $y = 4$ at two points $A$ and $B$. These points are distance 6 apart. What is the sum of the squares of the distances from $A$ and $B$ to the origin?"
Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:


To solve this problem, we need to find the coordinates of points $A$ and $B$, which are the solutions to the equation $kx^2 - 2kx + l = 4$.
Setting this equation equal to zero, we get:
$kx^2 - 2kx + l - 4 = 0$.
Let $x_1$ and $x_2$ be the solutions to this equation. Then by the distance formula, the square of the distance between $A$ and $B$ is $(x_2 - x_1)^2 = 36$.
By Vieta's formulas, we know that $x_1 + x_2 = \frac{2k}{k} = 2$, and $x_1x_2 = \frac{l - 4}{k}$. Now, we use the fact that $(x_2 - x_1)^2 = (x_1 + x_2)^2 - 4x_1x_2 = 36$. Substituting the values, we get:
$(2)^2 - 4\cdot \frac{l - 4}{k} = 36$.
$4 - \frac{4l - 16}{k} = 36$.
$\frac{4l - 16}{k} = -32$.
$4l - 16 = -32k$.
$4l = -32k + 16$.
$l = -8k + 4$.
Now we need to find the square of the distance from $A$ and $B$ to the origin. The distance squared from a point $(x, y)$ to the origin is $x^2 + y^2 = x^2 + (kx^2 - 2kx + l - 4)^2$.
Let $d_1^2$ and $d_2^2$ be the squares of the distances from $A$ and $B$ to the origin, respectively. Then:
$d_1^2 = x_1^2 + (kx_1^2 - 2kx_1 + l - 4)^2$, and
$d_2^2 = x_2^2 + (kx_2^2 - 2kx_2 + l - 4)^2$.
To find $d_1^2 + d_2^2$, we add the two equations:
$d_1^2 + d_2^2 = (x_1^2 + x_2^2) + [(kx_1^2 - 2kx_1 + l - 4)^2 + (kx_2^2 - 2kx_2 + l - 4)^2]$.
From Vieta's formulas, we know that $x_1^2 + x_2^2 = (x_1 + x_2)^2 - 2x_1x_2 = 4 - 2 \cdot \frac{l - 4}{k} = 4 - 2 \cdot \frac{-8k + 4 - 4}{k} = 4 + 16 = 20$.
Also, $(kx^2 - 2kx + l - 4)^2$ is the same for both $x = x_1$ and $x = x_2$. Let $P = kx^2 - 2kx + l - 4$. Then we have:
$d_1^2 + d_2^2 = 20 + 2P^2$.
To find $P^2$, we substitute $l = -8k + 4$:
$P^2 = (kx^2 - 2kx + (-8k + 4) - 4)^2 = (kx^2 - 2kx - 8k)^2 = (k(x^2 - 2x - 8))^2$.
Now consider the expression inside the square, $x^2 - 2x - 8$. This expression is the same for both $x = x_1$ and $x = x_2$. Its value when $x = x_1$ or $x = x_2$ is 0 (since $x^2 - 2x - 8 = 0$ is the equation we solved to find $x_1$ and $x_2$). Therefore, we have:
$P^2 = (k(0))^2 = 0$.
Thus, $d_1^2 + d_2^2 = 20 + 2 \cdot 0 = 20$.
Therefore, the sum of the squares of the distances from $A$ and $B$ to the origin is 20. The value 20 is the final solution to this problem.
The answer is: $20$

Question (hint: positive numerical answer):
"Let $k, l > 0$ be parameters. The parabola $y = kx^2 - 2kx + l$ intersects the line $y = 4$ at two points $A$ and $B$. These points are distance 6 apart. What is the sum of the squares of the distances from $A$ and $B$ to the origin?"
Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:


The line $y = 4$ intersects the parabola $y = kx^2 - 2kx + l$ at the points where $kx^2 - 2kx + l = 4$, so $kx^2 - 2kx + l - 4 = 0$. Let the $x$-coordinates of $A$ and $B$ be $x_1$ and $x_2$, respectively. Since the distance between $A$ and $B$ is 6, we have $(x_2 - x_1)^2 = 36$. By Vieta's formulas, we know that $x_1 + x_2 = \frac{2k}{k} = 2$ and $x_1x_2 = \frac{l - 4}{k}$. Then,
\begin{align*}
(x_2 - x_1)^2 &= (x_2 + x_1)^2 - 4x_1x_2\\
36 &= 4 - \frac{4(l - 4)}{k} \\
-32 &= \frac{-4l + 16}{k} \\
32k &= 4l - 16 \\
8k &= l - 4.
\end{align*}
Thus, $l = 8k + 4$. We want to find the sum of the squares of the distances from $A$ and $B$ to the origin, which is $(x_1^2 + y_1^2) + (x_2^2 + y_2^2) = x_1^2 + y_1^2 + x_2^2 + y_2^2$, where $y_1 = y_2 = 4$ since the points lie on the line $y = 4$. By the distance formula, this is equal to $(x_1^2 + 4^2) + (x_2^2 + 4^2) = x_1^2 + x_2^2 + 32$.

By the identity $(x_1 + x_2)^2 - 2x_1x_2 = x_1^2 + x_2^2$, we have $x_1^2 + x_2^2 = (x_1 + x_2)^2 - 2x_1x_2 = 2^2 - 2\frac{l - 4}{k} = 4 - \frac{2(l - 4)}{k}$.
Using the equation $8k = l - 4$, we can substitute for $l$ and find that $x_1^2 + x_2^2 = 4 - \frac{2((8k) + 4 - 4)}{k} = 4 - \frac{16k}{k} = 4 - 16 = -12$.

However, this result is not possible as the sum of the squares of distances cannot be negative. We must have made a mistake somewhere in our calculations.

Let's try simplifying our steps:
The distance between $A$ and $B$ is given by the difference of the roots of the quadratic equation $kx^2 - 2kx + l - 4 = 0$. By Vieta's formulas, this difference equals $\sqrt{(x_2 - x_1)^2} = \sqrt{(x_2 + x_1)^2 - 4x_1x_2}$. We know that $x_1 + x_2 = \frac{2k}{k} = 2$, and $x_1x_2 = \frac{l - 4}{k}$. So, we can substitute in these values into the equation above and get
\[\sqrt{2^2 - 4\left(\frac{l - 4}{k}\right)} = \sqrt{4 - \frac{4(l - 4)}{k}}.\] Setting this equal to 6 (since the distance is 6) and squaring gives
\[36 = 4 - \frac{4(l - 4)}{k}.\] From this equation we get $-32 = \frac{-4l + 16}{k}$, so multiplying through by $k$ gives us $32k = 4l - 16$, or $8k = l - 4$. Thus, $l = 8k + 4$.
Now we want to find $x_1^2 + x_2^2$. Remember that
\[x_1^2 + x_2^2 = (x_1 + x_2)^2 - 2x_1x_2 = 2^2 - 2\frac{l - 4}{k} = 4 - \frac{2(l - 4)}{k}.\]Substituting $l = 8k + 4$, we get
\[x_1^2 + x_2^2 = 4 - \frac{2((8k + 4) - 4)}{k} = 4 - \frac{16k}{k} = 4 - 16 = -12.\]But the sum of squares of distances must be non-negative.

Let's try a different approach:

The distance from $A$ to the origin is $\sqrt{x_1^2 + y_1^2} = \sqrt{x_1^2 + 4^2} = \sqrt{x_1^2 + 16}$. Likewise, the distance from $B$ to the origin is $\sqrt{x_2^2 + 16}$. So the sum of the squares of the distances is $(\sqrt{x_1^2 + 16})^2 + (\sqrt{x_2^2 + 16})^2 = x_1^2 + 16 + x_2^2 + 16 = x_1^2 + x_2^2 + 32$.
We already know that $x_1^2 + x_2^2 = (x_1 + x_2)^2 - 2x_1x_2 = 2^2 - 2\frac{l - 4}{k} = 4 - \frac{2(l - 4)}{k}$.
Substituting $l = 8k + 4$, we get
\[x_1^2 + x_2^2 = 4 - \frac{2((8k + 4) - 4)}{k} = 4 - \frac{16k}{k} = 4 - 16 = -12.\]But the sum of squares of distances must be non-negative.

Oops again. We must have used the wrong approach. Let's try another method:

We know that the line $y = 4$ intersects the parabola at points $A$ and $B$, so we can say that $4 = kx^2 - 2kx + l$. Let the $x$-coordinates of $A$ and $B$ be $x_1$ and $x_2$, respectively. Then from the equation above, we have:
\[4 = kx_1^2 - 2kx_1 + l\]and\[4 = kx_2^2 - 2kx_2 +

Question (hint: positive numerical answer):
"Let $k, l > 0$ be parameters. The parabola $y = kx^2 - 2kx + l$ intersects the line $y = 4$ at two points $A$ and $B$. These points are distance 6 apart. What is the sum of the squares of the distances from $A$ and $B$ to the origin?"
Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:


First, we want to find the values of $k$ and $l$. Since the parabola intersects the line $y=4$, we can substitute $y=4$ into the equation of the parabola to get $4 = kx^2 - 2kx + l$. Setting $y=4$ will give us a quadratic equation in $x$. 

Next, we are told that the distance between points $A$ and $B$ is 6. Because the parabola and the line intersect at two points, the difference of the two roots of the quadratic equation will be equal to the distance between the two points (by Vieta's formulas). So we have $6= \sqrt{(x_2 - x_1)^2} = \sqrt{(x_2 + x_1)^2 - 4x_1x_2}$.

Substituting the values from Vieta's formulas: $\sqrt{(2k)^2 - 4l} = 6$, we get $4k^2 - 4l = 36$. Simplifying gives $k^2 - l = 9$. 

We have two equations now: $4 = kx^2 - 2kx + l$ and $k^2 - l = 9$. To solve for $k$ and $l$, we can eliminate $l$ by substituting $l = k^2 - 9$ from the second equation into the first equation. We will get $4 = kx^2 - 2kx + k^2 - 9$. 

This equation should hold for all $x$, so $4 = k^2 - 9$. Therefore, $k^2 = 13$ and $k = \sqrt{13}$. Substituting $k = \sqrt{13}$ into $k^2 - l = 9$, we get $13 - l = 9$, which gives $l = 4$. So $k = \sqrt{13}$ and $l = 4$.

Now we want to find the sum of the squares of the distances from $A$ and $B$ to the origin. Using the distance formula, the distances from $A$ and $B$ to the origin are $\sqrt{x_1^2 + y_1^2} = \sqrt{x_1^2 + (k x_1^2 - 2k x_1 + l)^2} = \sqrt{(x_1^2 + (kx_1 - k)^2 + (l - 2kx_1 + kx_1^2)^2)}$, and similarly for $x_2$. 

However, it's easier to use the fact that the square of the distance is the sum of the squares of the coordinates, so the square of the distance from $A$ or $B$ to the origin is just $x_1^2 + y_1^2 = x_1^2 + (k x_1^2 - 2k x_1 + l)^2 = x_1^2 + (13 x_1^2 - 2\sqrt{13} x_1 + 4)^2$. 

The sum of the squares of the distances from $A$ and $B$ to the origin is $2[x_1^2 + (13 x_1^2 - 2\sqrt{13} x_1 + 4)^2]$. This expression depends on the value of $x_1$, but it is the same for both $x_1$ and $x_2$ since they are the roots of the quadratic equation $kx^2 - 2kx + l - 4 = 0$. 

Let's evaluate this expression for one of the roots, say $x_1$:
\begin{align*}
2[x_1^2 + (13 x_1^2 - 2\sqrt{13} x_1 + 4)^2] &= 2[x_1^2 + (13x_1^2 - 8\sqrt{13} x_1 + 52)^2] \\
&= 2[x_1^2 + (144 x_1^2 - 16\sqrt{13} x_1 + 52)^2].
\end{align*}

However, the sum of the squares of the roots of a quadratic equation $ax^2 + bx + c = 0$ is given by $s = \left(\dfrac{b}{a}\right)^2 - 2\left(\dfrac{c}{a}\right)$. Here, $a=k= \sqrt{13}$, $b=-2k=-2\sqrt{13}$, and $c=l-4=4-4=0$. Substituting these values into the formula gives 
\begin{align*}
s &= \left(\dfrac{-2\sqrt{13}}{\sqrt{13}}\right)^2 - 2\left(\dfrac{0}{\sqrt{13}}\right)\\
& = (-2)^2 - 0 = 4.
\end{align*}

Therefore, the sum of the squares of the distances from $A$ and $B$ to the origin is $2s = 2 \times 4 = 8$. The final answer is $\boxed{8}$.
The value of the expression $x_1^2 + y_1^2$ does not depend on which root of the quadratic equation we take because the sum of the squares of the roots of a quadratic equation $ax^2+bx+c=0$ is given by $s = \left(\dfrac{b}{a}\right)^2 - 2\left(\dfrac{c}{a}\right)$, and in this case $a=k= \sqrt{13}$, $b=-2k=-2\sqrt{13}$, and $c=l-4=4-4=0$. Substituting these values into the formula gives $s = (-2)^2 - 2 \cdot 0 = 4$. Therefore, the sum of the squares of the distances from $A$ and $B$ to the origin is $2s = 2 \times 4 = 8$.
The value of the expression $x_1^2 + y_1^2$ does not depend on which root of the quadratic equation we take because the sum of the squares of the roots of a quadratic equation $ax^2+bx+c=0$ is given by $s = \left(\dfrac{b}{a}\right)^2 - 2\left(\dfrac{c}{a}\right)$, and in this case $a=k= \sqrt{13}$, $b=-2k=-2\sqrt{13}$, and $c=l-4=4-4=0$. Substituting these values into the formula gives $s = (-2)^2 - 2 \cdot 0 = 4$. Therefore, the sum of the squares of the distances from $A$ and $B$ to the origin is $2s = 2 \times 4 = 8$. The value of the expression $x_1^2 + y_1^2$ does not depend on which root of the quadratic equation we take because the sum of the squares of the roots of a quadratic equation $ax^2+

Question (hint: positive numerical answer):
"What is the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ when $x$ and $y$ range over all real numbers such that $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$?"
Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:


To maximize the value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$, we need to find the relationship between $x$ and $y$ from the given equation $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$ and then substitute that relationship into the expression $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$.

First, let's simplify the equation:

$|x-2y| + |y-2x| = |x-2y| + |2y-x| = 40$, so we have $2|x-2y| = 40$.

Divide both sides of the equation by 2 to get $|x-2y| = 20$.

Then we know $x - 2y = \pm20$ because the absolute value equals to a non-negative number. 

Next, we have to solve the two equations: $x - 2y = 20$ and $x - 2y = -20$ for $y$. 

Solve $x - 2y = 20$ for $y$ to get: $y = \frac{x-20}{2}$.

Solve $x - 2y = -20$ for $y$ to get: $y = \frac{x+20}{2}$.

Now we need to substitute these expressions for $y$ into the expression $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ to find the minimum value.

Case 1: When $y = \frac{x-20}{2}$:

Let's substitute this into $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ to get:

$5x^2 + 5(\frac{x-20}{2})^2 - 8x*\frac{x-20}{2}$.

Simplify this to get:

$5x^2 + \frac{5}{4}(x^2 - 40x + 400) - 4x^2 + 40x$,

$5x^2 + \frac{5x^2}{4} - 50x + 500 - 4x^2 + 40x$,

$\frac{x^2}{4} - 10x + 500$.

Let $f(x) = \frac{x^2}{4} - 10x + 500$, then $f'(x) = \frac{x}{2} - 10$.

Setting $f'(x)$ to 0, we can solve for $x$: $\frac{x}{2} - 10 = 0$, then $x = 20$.

This gives us the minimum value of $f(x)$ at $x = 20$: $f(20) = \frac{20^2}{4} - 10*20 + 500 = 100 - 200 + 500 = 400$.

Case 2: When $y = \frac{x+20}{2}$:

Do the same as above, you will get a similar function in the end of the day. It will result in the same minimum value which is $400$.

The minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ when $x$ and $y$ range over all real numbers such that $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$ is $400$. So the numerical answer is $400$. 
The answer is $\boxed{400}$.

Question (hint: positive numerical answer):
"What is the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ when $x$ and $y$ range over all real numbers such that $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$?"
Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:


First, note that $|x - 2y| + |y - 2x| = 40$ can be rewritten as $|2y - x| + |2x - y| = 40$ using the property $|a| = |-a|$.
Now, let's rewrite this equation as $f(x, y) = |2y - x| + |2x - y| = 40$.

By the triangle inequality, $|a| + |b| \geq |a + b|$, so we have $f(x, y) = |2y - x| + |2x - y| \geq |(2y - x) + (2x - y)| = |y| = y$ when $y \geq 0$ and $|-y| = y$ when $y < 0$.
Similarly, $f(x, y) = |2y - x| + |2x - y| \geq |(2y - x) - (2x - y)| = |-x| = x$ when $x \geq 0$ and $|-x| = x$ when $x < 0$.
Therefore, $f(x, y) \geq |x| + |y|$. The equation $f(x, y) = 40$ implies that $|x| + |y| = 40$.

Now, consider the expression $5x^2 + 5y^2 - 8xy = (5x^2 - 8xy + 5y^2) = (5x^2 - 10xy + 5y^2) + 2xy = (5(x - y)^2) + 2xy$.
We want to minimize this expression, given the constraint $|x| + |y| = 40$.

By the triangle inequality again, we know that $|x| + |y| \geq |x + y|$. Equality occurs when $x$ and $y$ have the same sign (or one of them is 0), so we take $x$ and $y$ to have the same sign. Now we have $|x + y| = |x| + |y| = 40$.
Setting $z = x + y$, we have $|z| = 40$, so we need to minimize $(5z^2)/4 + 2(z/2)(z/2)$ subject to the condition $z = \pm 40$. Let $A = 5z^2/4$, $B = 2(z/2)(z/2) = z^2/2$, then minimizing $(5z^2)/4 + 2(z/2)(z/2)$ is equivalent to finding the minimum value of $A + B$ subject to $z = \pm 40$.

By the AM-GM inequality, we have $A + B = (5/4)z^2 + (1/2)z^2 = (13/4)z^2 \geq 2\sqrt{(5/4)(1/2)z^4} = z^2$. Equating the first and last term gives equality, so the minimum value is achieved when $z = \pm 40$. Substituting $z = 40$ (or $z = -40$) back into $A + B = (13/4)z^2$, we find the minimum value of $(5z^2)/4 + 2(z/2)(z/2)$ is $(13/4)(40^2) = 1300$.

Therefore, the minimum value of $5x^2 + 5y^2 - 8xy$ is 1300, given the constraint $|x - 2y| + |y - 2x| = 40$. The answer is: $1300$

Question (hint: positive numerical answer):
"What is the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ when $x$ and $y$ range over all real numbers such that $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$?"
Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:


We know that $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$.

Firstly, note that $|x-2y| = |-(2x-y)| = |-1*(2x-y)| = |2x-y|$ by the property of absolute value $|a| = |-a|$. Also, $|y-2x| = |-1*(2y-x)| = |2y-x|$.
Thus the given equation can be written as $|2x-y| + |2y-x| = 40$.

Next, we use the identity $|a| + |b| = |a+b| + |a-b|/2$. By letting $a = 2x-y$ and $b = 2y-x$, we have $|2x-y| + |2y-x| = |(2x-y)+(2y-x)| + |(2x-y)-(2y-x)|/2 = |x| + |-x| = 2|x|$. This means that $2|x| = 40$, and thus $|x| = 20$.

Therefore, $x = 20$ or $x = -20$. When $x=20$, we substitute it into $2y - x = 0$ to solve for $y$, finding $y=10$. When $x=-20$, by the same procedure we can get $y=-10$. So, the possible solutions for the $(x, y)$ pairs are (20, 10) and (-20, -10).

Now, substituting these pair into $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$, we obtain when $(x, y) = (20, 10)$:
\[5*20^2+5*10^2-8*20*10= 2000+500-1600 = 1900.\]
When $(x, y) = (-20, -10)$:
\[5*(-20)^2+5*(-10)^2-8*(-20)*(-10) = 2000+500-1600 = 1900.\]

Therefore, the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ under the constraint of $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$ is $1900$. The answer is: $1900$

Question (hint: positive numerical answer):
"What is the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ when $x$ and $y$ range over all real numbers such that $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$?"
Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:


First, we note that the given condition $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$ can be rewritten as $|x-2y| + |2y-x| = 40$, which means that $|x-2y| = |2y-x|$. Because the absolute value of a number is always nonnegative, we can drop the absolute value signs and write $x-2y = 2y-x$. This simplifies to $x = 2y$.
Now, we substitute $x = 2y$ into the expression $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ to get
$$5(2y)^2 + 5y^2 - 8(2y)(y) = 20y^2 + 5y^2 - 16y^2 = 9y^2.$$
So, the original expression simplifies to $9y^2$, and we are looking for the minimum value of $9y^2$ where $y$ ranges over all real numbers. Since $y^2$ is always nonnegative (since it is the square of a real number), $9y^2$ is always nonnegative as well. The minimum value of $9y^2$ occurs when $y = 0$, in which case $9y^2 = 0$.

Therefore, the minimum value of the expression $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ subject to the condition $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$ is $0$. The answer is: $0$.

Question (hint: positive numerical answer):
"What is the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ when $x$ and $y$ range over all real numbers such that $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$?"
Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:



Firstly, we'll solve the constraint equation $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$ for some value of $x$ and $y$. We can rewrite the constraint equation as $|x-2y| + |2y-x| = 40$. The absolute value function $|a-b|$ is equivalent to $|b-a|$, so we have
\[|x-2y| + |- (x-2y)| = 40 \implies |x-2y| + |x-2y| = 40.\]
This simplifies to $2|x-2y| = 40$ which implies $|x-2y| = 20$. Again, using the definition of absolute value, we've got two possibilities:
\begin{align*}
x-2y &= 20 \quad \text{or} \\
x-2y &= -20.
\end{align*}Now we'll find the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ while considering these cases.

Case 1: $x-2y = 20$. Solving for $x$ we get $x = 2y + 20$. Substituting this into the function gives
\begin{align*}
5(2y+20)^2 + 5y^2 - 8(2y+20)y &= 5(4y^2 + 80y + 400) + 5y^2 - 16y^2 -160y\\
&= 20y^2 + 400y + 2000 + 5y^2 - 16y^2 -160y\\
&= (20 - 16)y^2 + (400 - 160)y + 2000\\
&= 4y^2 + 240y + 2000.
\end{align*}To minimize this expression, we can find its minimum point. Completing the square,
\begin{align*}
4y^2 + 240y + 2000 &= 4(y^2 + 60y) + 2000 \\
&= 4[(y^2 + 60y + 900) - 900] + 2000 \\
&= 4[(y+30)^2 - 900] + 2000 \\
&= 4(y+30)^2 - 3600 + 2000 \\
&= 4(y+30)^2 - 1600.
\end{align*}Since the square of a real number is always nonnegative, $4(y+30)^2 \ge 0$, and thus the minimum value of this expression is $-1600$.

Case 2: $x-2y = -20$. Solving for $x$ gives $x = 2y - 20$, and substituting this into the function gives
\begin{align*}
5(2y-20)^2 + 5y^2 - 8(2y-20)y &= 5(4y^2 - 80y + 400) + 5y^2 - 16y^2 +160y\\
&= 20y^2 - 400y + 2000 + 5y^2 - 16y^2 +160y\\
&= (20 - 16)y^2 - (400 - 160)y + 2000\\
&= 4y^2 - 240y + 2000.
\end{align*}Again, to minimize this expression, we complete the square:
\begin{align*}
4y^2 - 240y + 2000 &= 4(y^2 - 60y) + 2000 \\
&= 4[(y^2 - 60y + 900) - 900] + 2000 \\
&= 4[(y-30)^2 - 900] + 2000 \\
&= 4(y-30)^2 - 3600 + 2000 \\
&= 4(y-30)^2 - 1600.
\end{align*}Therefore, the minimum value is also $-1600$.

Since both cases give the same minimum value of the function, we conclude that the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ when $x$ and $y$ range over all real numbers such that $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$ is $-1600$.

The answer is: $-1600$

Question (hint: positive numerical answer):
"What is the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ when $x$ and $y$ range over all real numbers such that $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$?"
Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:


Since $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$, we can use the Triangle Inequality to get an inequality based on $x$ and $y$. The Triangle Inequality says that $|a| + |b| \geq |a+b|$, so we have $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = |(x-2y) + (y-2x)| = |-x - y| \geq |-3(x+y)| = 3|x+y|$. Hence, $3|x+y| = 40$ and $|x+y| = \frac{40}{3}$.
Now consider the quantity $5x^2+5y^2-8xy = 5(x^2+y^2)-8xy = 5[(x+y)^2 - 2xy] - 8xy = 5(x+y)^2 - 18xy$. We know that $x+y = \pm\frac{40}{3}$.
Substituting $|x+y| = \frac{40}{3}$ gives $18xy = 5\left(\frac{40}{3}\right)^2 - 18xy \Rightarrow xy = \frac{800}{9}$.
Substituting this value of $xy$ back into $5(x+y)^2 - 18xy$ gives the minimum value. 
So, the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ is $5\left(\frac{40}{3}\right)^2 - 18\cdot\frac{800}{9} = \frac{8000}{9} - \frac{14400}{9} = -\frac{6400}{9}$. 
However, this is not the minimum value as it should be non-negative, so there seems to be an error somewhere.
Let's re-examine the given equation $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$. This equation is equal to $|-x + 2y| + |-y + 2x| = 40$. Now we use the property of absolute values $|a| = |-a|$. This gives us $|-x + 2y| + |-y + 2x| = |2y - x| + |2x - y| = 40$. Now this is similar to our previous equation with $x$ and $y$ swapped, therefore if $(x, y)$ is a solution to the original equation, then $(y, x)$ is also a solution.
This observation helps us to restrict our attention to the case where $x \geq y$, because if $x < y$, then $(y, x)$ would be our case, and we'd just get the same minimum value for $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$. 
When $x \geq y$, we have $|x - 2y| = x - 2y$ and $|y - 2x| = -y + 2x$ because $x - 2y \geq 0$ and $y - 2x < 0$. So the equation becomes $(x - 2y) + (-y + 2x) = 40$. Simplifying gives $3x - 3y = 40$, or $x - y = \frac{40}{3}$. 
Now we substitute $x - y = \frac{40}{3}$ into the expression we want to minimize $5x^2+5y^2-8xy = 5(x+y)^2 - 18xy$. 
We already know that $x+y = \frac{40}{3}$, we can square this equation to get $(x+y)^2 = \left(\frac{40}{3}\right)^2 = \frac{1600}{9}$, substitute into the expression to get $5\left(\frac{1600}{9}\right) - 18xy$. 
To get the minimum value, we need to minimize $xy$. This can be done by completing the square in the equation $x - y = \frac{40}{3}$, which gives $x = \frac{40}{3} + y$, and substitue this into the equation $x^2 + y^2 - 8xy = 0$, then we can solve for $xy$ to get $xy = \frac{200}{9}$. 
Hence, the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy = 5\left(\frac{1600}{9}\right) - 18\cdot\frac{200}{9} = \frac{8000}{9} - \frac{3600}{9} = \frac{4400}{9}$. 
This value is non-negative, indicating that our derivation is correct. 
Therefore the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ is $\boxed{\frac{4400}{9}}$.

The answer is: $$\boxed{\frac{4400}{9}}$$

Question (hint: positive numerical answer):
"What is the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ when $x$ and $y$ range over all real numbers such that $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$?"
Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:


First, we solve the constraint equation $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$.
Without loss of generality, assume $x \geq 2y$. Then, we can rewrite the equation as $(x-2y) + (2x-y) = 40$,
which simplifies to $3x-3y = 40$ and $x-y = \frac{40}{3}$. Then, $y = x - \frac{40}{3}$. 
Now, substitute this into the expression $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$:
\begin{align*}
5x^2+5y^2-8xy &= 5x^2+5\left(x - \frac{40}{3}\right)^2 - 8x\left(x - \frac{40}{3}\right) \\
&= 5x^2 + 5 \left(x^2 - \frac{80x}{3} + \frac{1600}{9}\right) - 8x^2 + \frac{320x}{3} \\
&= 5x^2 + 5x^2 - \frac{400x}{3} + \frac{800}{3} - 8x^2 + \frac{320x}{3} \\
&= 2x^2 - \frac{80x}{3} + \frac{800}{3}.
\end{align*}
This expression is a quadratic in $x$, with a leading coefficient of $2 > 0$. 
To find its minimum value, we can take the derivative with respect to $x$, set it equal to zero, 
and solve for $x$:
\[\frac{d}{dx} \left(2x^2 - \frac{80x}{3} + \frac{800}{3}\right) = 4x - \frac{80}{3}.\]
Setting the derivative equal to zero gives us $4x - \frac{80}{3} = 0$, 
which simplifies to $x = \frac{20}{3}$. 
Then, we can substitute this value back into the equation $y = x - \frac{40}{3}$ to find
\[y = \frac{20}{3} - \frac{40}{3} = -\frac{20}{3}.\]
Now, we can substitute $x = \frac{20}{3}$ and $y = -\frac{20}{3}$ back into 
$2x^2 - \frac{80x}{3} + \frac{800}{3}$ to find that the minimum value is
\[2\left(\frac{20}{3}\right)^2 - \frac{80}{3}\cdot \frac{20}{3} + \frac{800}{3} = \frac{800}{9} - \frac{1600}{9} + \frac{800}{3} = 0.\]
Therefore, the minimum value is $\boxed{0}$. The answer is: 0

Question (hint: positive numerical answer):
"What is the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ when $x$ and $y$ range over all real numbers such that $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$?"
Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:


By the triangle inequality,
\begin{align*}
|x - 2y| + |y - 2x| &= |x - 2y| + |2x - y| \\
&\ge |(x - 2y) + (2x - y)| \\
&= |3x - 3y| = 3|x - y| = 40.
\end{align*}Therefore, $|x - y| = \frac{40}{3}$.
Now substitute $y = x + \frac{40}{3}$ or $y = x - \frac{40}{3}$ into $5x^2 + 5y^2 - 8xy$, we get
\begin{align*}
5x^2 + 5\left(x + \frac{40}{3}\right)^2 - 8x\left(x + \frac{40}{3}\right) &= -\frac{800}{3}, \\
5x^2 + 5\left(x - \frac{40}{3}\right)^2 - 8x\left(x - \frac{40}{3}\right) &= -\frac{800}{3}.
\end{align*}Therefore, the minimum value of $5x^2 + 5y^2 - 8xy$ when $|x - 2y| + |y - 2x| = 40$ is $-\frac{800}{3}$. The answer is: $-\frac{800}{3}$

Question (hint: positive numerical answer):
"What is the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ when $x$ and $y$ range over all real numbers such that $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$?"
Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:


We can rewrite the constraint as $|x-2y| + |-y+2x| = 40$ and using the properties of absolute value, we have $|x-2y| + |2x-y| = 40$.
Using the definition of absolute value, we split each into two cases:
Case 1: $x-2y \ge 0$ and $2x-y \ge 0$. In this case, we have $x-2y + 2x-y = 40 \implies 3x-3y = 40 \implies x-y = \frac{40}{3}$.
Case 2: $x-2y < 0$ and $2x-y < 0$. In this case, we have $-(x-2y) - (2x-y) = 40 \implies -x+2y -2x+y = 40 \implies -3x + 3y = 40 \implies x-y = -\frac{40}{3}$.
The two cases lead to a contradiction because $x-y$ cannot both be equal to $\frac{40}{3}$ and $-\frac{40}{3}$ at the same time. Therefore, there must be another combination of cases to consider.
Let's consider cases where exactly one of the expressions inside the absolute value is negative:
Case 3: $x-2y \ge 0$ and $2x-y < 0$. In this case, we have $x-2y - (2x-y) = 40 \implies -x+y = 40 \implies y = x+40$.
Case 4: $x-2y < 0$ and $2x-y \ge 0$. In this case, we have $-(x-2y) + 2x-y = 40 \implies x-2y + 2x-y = 40 \implies 3x-3y = 40 \implies y = x-\frac{40}{3}$.
Substituting either $y = x+40$ or $y = x-\frac{40}{3}$ into the expression $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$, we have:
\[5x^2+5(x\pm40)^2-8x(x\pm40).\]
Expanding and simplifying, we get:
\[5x^2+5x^2\pm400x+8000-8x^2\mp320x = 2x^2\pm120x+8000.\]
Completing the square, we have:
\[2(x^2\mp60x+900)+8000-1800 = 2(x-30)^2 + 6200.\]
The minimum value of $2(x-30)^2 + 6200$ is achieved when $(x-30)^2 = 0$, which means $x=30$.
Substituting $x=30$ back into either $y = x+40$ or $y = x-\frac{40}{3}$, we find $y = 70$ or $y = 10$, respectively.
However, only $y=10$ satisfies the constraint $|x-2y| + |2x-y| = 40$ with $x=30$.
So the minimum value of the expression $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ given the constraint is:
\[2(30-30)^2 + 6200 = 6200.\]
Therefore, the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ given the constraint is 6200. The answer is:
$\boxed{6200}$.

Question (hint: positive numerical answer):
"What is the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ when $x$ and $y$ range over all real numbers such that $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$?"
Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:


First, let's rewrite the equation $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$ as $|2y-x| + |2x-y| = 40$.
By the triangle inequality, we have $|2y-x| + |2x-y| \ge |(2y-x) - (2x-y)| = |y-3x|$, so $|y-3x| = 40$.
Let $u = x - 2y$, then $y - 2x = -u$, we have $|y-2x| = |-u| = |u|$. So the equation becomes $|2y-x| + |2x-y| = |u| + |-u| = 2|u| = 40$, thus $|u| = 20$. This gives us $u = \pm 20$ which leads to two systems of equations:
Case 1: $u = x - 2y = 20$. Then we have the system of equations:
$x - 2y = 20$,
$y - 2x = -20$.
Adding these two equations together gives $-3x = 0$, which implies $x = 0$. Substituting $x = 0$ into the first equation of the system gives $y = -10$.

Case 2: $u = x - 2y = -20$. Then we have the system of equations:
$x - 2y = -20$,
$y - 2x = 20$.
Adding these two equations together gives $-3x = 0$, which implies $x = 0$. Substituting $x = 0$ into the first equation of the system gives $y = 10$.

So we have found two points $(x, y) = (0, -10)$ and $(0, 10)$ that satisfy the original equation. Now we substitute these points into $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$:
For $(0, -10)$, we get $5(0)^2 + 5(-10)^2 - 8(0)(-10) = 500$.
For $(0, 10)$, we get $5(0)^2 + 5(10)^2 - 8(0)(10) = 500$.
So in both cases, the value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ is 500. Therefore, the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ is 500 when $(x, y)$ satisfies $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$. The answer is: $500$

Question (hint: positive numerical answer):
"What is the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ when $x$ and $y$ range over all real numbers such that $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$?"
Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:


First, we note that $|x-2y| + |y-2x|$ can be rewritten as $|x-2y| + |2y-x|$ using the property $|a| = |-a|$.
We know that $|a| + |b|$ is minimized when $a$ and $b$ have the same sign. So we have:
\[|x-2y| + |2y-x| = (x-2y) + (2y-x) = 0.\]
This means that $x=2y$.
Now we can substitute $x=2y$ into the expression $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$:
\[5(2y)^2+5y^2-8(2y)(y) = 20y^2+5y^2-16y^2 = 9y^2.\]
This expression is minimized when $y=0$, so the minimum value is $9(0)^2 = 0$. However, this would make $x=2y=0$, which does not satisfy $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$.
Let's try another approach.
We rewrite the given equation as $|x-2y| = 40 - |y-2x|$. Since the absolute values on both sides are equal, the expressions inside the absolute values must be equal or negatives of each other:
\[(x-2y) = 40 - (y-2x) \quad \text{or} \quad (x-2y) = -(40 - (y-2x)).\]
Solving the first equation gives:
\[x-2y = 40 - y + 2x \implies y = 40.\]
This makes $x = 2y = 80$. However, this solution does not satisfy the given equation $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$.
Solving the second equation gives:
\[x-2y = y-2x - 40 \implies 3x = 3y - 40 \implies x = y - \frac{40}{3}.\]
Substituting this into the given equation gives:
\[|y - \frac{40}{3} - 2y| + |2y - y + \frac{40}{3}| = 40.\]
Simplifying, we get:
\[\left|\frac{40}{3} - y\right| + \left|y + \frac{40}{3}\right| = 40.\]
This is a well-known equation which has a unique solution $y=0$. Therefore, $x = 2y = 0$.
So the only solution is $(x, y) = (0, 0)$, but this does not satisfy $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$.
There might be a mistake in our solution. Let's try a different approach.
Consider the expression $f(x, y) = 5x^2+5y^2-8xy = 5(x^2 - \frac{8}{5}xy + y^2) = 5[(x-y)^2 + \frac{3}{5}y^2]$.
By the Trivial Inequality $(a+b)^2 \geq 0$, we have $(x-y)^2 \geq 0$, so $(x-y)^2 + \frac{3}{5}y^2 \geq \frac{3}{5}y^2$. This implies $f(x, y) \geq \frac{3}{5}y^2$.
Since $y^2 \geq 0$, we have $f(x, y) \geq 0$. Therefore, the minimum value of $f(x, y)$ is 0. However, this would imply $(x, y) = (0, 0)$, which does not satisfy $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$.
Let's try another approach.
Note that $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = |x-2y| + |2y-x| = |x - 2y| + |- (x - 2y)| = 2|x - 2y|$. This implies $|x-2y| = 20$.
Since $|x-2y|$ is the absolute value of a quantity, it can't be negative. Therefore, we must have $x - 2y = \pm 20$. Let's consider both cases separately.
Case 1: $x - 2y = 20$. Rearranging gives $x = 20 + 2y$. Substituting into the expression $5x^2 + 5y^2 - 8xy$ gives:
\[f(x, y) = 5(20 + 2y)^2 + 5y^2 - 8y(20 + 2y) = 5(400 + 80y + 4y^2) + 5y^2 - 160y - 16y^2.\]
Expanding and simplifying gives $f(x, y) = 2000 + 400y + 20y^2 + 5y^2 - 160y - 16y^2 = 2000 + 240y - 16y^2 = -16(y - 7.5)^2 + 2025$.
This expression is minimized when $y = 7.5$, and the minimum value is $f(x, y) = -16(0)^2 + 2025 = 2025$.
Case 2: $x - 2y = -20$. Rearranging gives $x = 2y - 20$. Substituting into the expression $5x^2 + 5y^2 - 8xy$ gives:
\[f(x, y) = 5(2y - 20)^2 + 5y^2 - 8y(2y - 20) = 5(4y^2 - 80y + 400) + 5y^2 - 16y^2 + 160y = 2000 - 400y + 20y^2 + 5y^2 - 16y^2 + 160y = 2000 - 240y + 20y^2 = -16(y - 7.5)^2 + 2025.\]
This expression is also minimized when $y = 7.5$, and the minimum value is $f(x, y) = -16(0)^2 + 2025 = 2025$.
In both cases, the minimum value of the expression $5x^2 + 5y^2 - 8xy$ is 2025. However, this would imply that $(x, y) = (20, 7.5)$, which does satisfy $|

Question (hint: positive numerical answer):
"What is the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ when $x$ and $y$ range over all real numbers such that $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$?"
Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:



First, we need to solve the inequality $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$.
Using the absolute value properties, we have:
If $x-2y \ge 0$ and $y-2x \ge 0$, then $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = (x-2y) + (y-2x) = -x + 2y + y - 2x = -3x + 3y = 40$. Rearranging terms, we get $3x - 3y = -40$, or $x - y = -\frac{40}{3}$.
If $x-2y \ge 0$ and $y-2x < 0$, then $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = (x-2y) + (2x-y) = x - 2y + 2x - y = 3x - 3y = 40$, giving us $x - y = \frac{40}{3}$.
If $x-2y < 0$ and $y-2x \ge 0$, then $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = -(x-2y) + (y-2x) = -x + 2y + y - 2x = -3x + 3y = 40$, giving us $x - y = -\frac{40}{3}$.
If $x-2y < 0$ and $y-2x < 0$, then $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = -(x-2y) + -(y-2x) = -x + 2y - y + 2x = x - y = \frac{40}{3}$.
From these cases, we conclude that the only possible solution is $x - y = \frac{40}{3}$.
Let $y = x - \frac{40}{3}$. Substituting this into the expression $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$, we get:
$$5x^2 + 5 \left(x - \frac{40}{3}\right)^2 - 8x \left(x - \frac{40}{3}\right)$$
$$= 5x^2 + 5 \left(x^2 - \frac{80}{3}x + \frac{1600}{9}\right) - 8x^2 + \frac{320}{3}x$$
$$= 5x^2 + 5x^2 - \frac{400}{3}x + \frac{1600}{9} - 8x^2 + \frac{320}{3}x$$
$$= -3x^2 + \frac{40}{3}x + \frac{1600}{9}$$
To find the minimum value of this expression, we can take the derivative with respect to $x$ and set it equal to zero:
$$-6x + \frac{40}{3} = 0 \Rightarrow x = \frac{20}{9}$$
Substituting this back into $y = x - \frac{40}{3}$, we get $y = \frac{20}{9} - \frac{40}{3} = -\frac{20}{3}$.
Now we can evaluate $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ at these values of $x$ and $y$:
$$5 \left(\frac{20}{9}\right)^2 + 5 \left(-\frac{20}{3}\right)^2 - 8 \left(\frac{20}{9}\right) \left(-\frac{20}{3}\right)$$
$$= 5 \cdot \frac{400}{81} + 5 \cdot \frac{400}{9} + \frac{3200}{27} = \frac{2000}{81} + \frac{2000}{9} + \frac{3200}{27}$$
$$= \frac{2000 \cdot 3 + 2000 \cdot 27 + 3200 \cdot 9}{27} = \frac{6000 + 54000 + 28800}{27} = \frac{88800}{27} = \frac{29600}{9}$$
Thus, the minimum value is $\frac{29600}{9}$. However, that is not an integer.

We went wrong when we took the derivative, as it should be $-6x + \frac{40}{3} = 0$. Solving for $x$, we get $x = \frac{20}{9}$.

Let's retry the problem.
We know that $x - y = \frac{40}{3} \Rightarrow y = x - \frac{40}{3}$, and we substitute that into $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$:
$$5x^2 + 5 \left(x - \frac{40}{3}\right)^2 - 8x \left(x - \frac{40}{3}\right)$$
$$= 5x^2 + 5 \left(x^2 - \frac{80}{3}x + \frac{1600}{9}\right) - 8x^2 + \frac{320}{3}x$$
$$= 5x^2 + 5x^2 - \frac{400}{3}x + \frac{1600}{9} - 8x^2 + \frac{320}{3}x$$
$$= -3x^2 + \frac{40}{3}x + \frac{1600}{9}$$
Take the derivative with respect to $x$:
$$-6x + \frac{40}{3} = 0 \Rightarrow x = \frac{20}{9}.$$
And find the corresponding $y$ value:
$$y = x - \frac{40}{3} = \frac{20}{9} - \frac{40}{3} = -\frac{20}{3}.$$
Finally, we evaluate the expression $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ at these values of $x$ and $y$:
$$5 \left(\frac{20}{9}\right)^2 + 5 \left(-\frac{20}{3}\right)^2 - 8 \left(\frac{20}{9}\right) \left(-\frac{20}{3}\right)$$
$$= 5 \cdot \frac{400}{81} + 5 \cdot \frac{400}{9} + \frac{3200}{27} = \frac{2000}{81} + \frac{2000}{9} + \frac{3200}{27}$$
$$= \frac{

Question (hint: positive numerical answer):
"What is the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ when $x$ and $y$ range over all real numbers such that $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$?"
Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:


First, we need to simplify the equation $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$.
Using the property $|a| + |b| = |a+b|$ whenever $ab \geq 0$, we rewrite the equation as
$|x-2y + (y-2x)| = 40 \implies |-x-y| = 40 \implies x+y = \pm 40$.
Now, let's substitute $y = \pm 40 - x$ into the expression $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$:
\[5x^2 + 5(40 - x)^2 - 8x(40 - x) = 5x^2 + 5(x^2 - 80x + 1600) - 8x^2 + 320x = -3x^2 + 320x + 8000.\]
To minimize this expression, we take its derivative with respect to $x$ and set it equal to 0:
\[\frac{d}{dx}(-3x^2 + 320x + 8000) = -6x + 320 = 0 \implies x = \frac{320}{6} = \frac{160}{3}.\]
Substituting this value back into the equation $x + y = \pm 40$, we get
\[\frac{160}{3} + y = 40 \implies y = \frac{40}{3}.\]
So the point $(x, y) = \left(\frac{160}{3}, \frac{40}{3}\right)$ minimizes the expression $5x^2 + 5y^2 - 8xy$.
Substituting this point into the expression, we get
\[5\left(\frac{160}{3}\right)^2 + 5\left(\frac{40}{3}\right)^2 - 8\left(\frac{160}{3}\right)\left(\frac{40}{3}\right) = 8000.\]
Therefore, the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ is 8000 when $x$ and $y$ range over all real numbers satisfying $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$. The answer is: 8000.

"What is the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ when $x$ and $y$ range over all real numbers such that $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$?"
Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:


Using the property $|a| + |b| \geq |a+b|$, we have
\[|x-2y| + |y-2x| \geq |(x-2y) + (y-2x)| = |x-2y+y-2x| = |-x-y| = |-(x+y)| = |x+y|.\]Then $|x+y| = 40$. Now we want to minimize $f(x, y) = 5x^2+5y^2-8xy$. We can write this as
\[f(x, y) = 5(x^2 + y^2) - 8xy = 5[(x+y)^2 - 2xy] - 8xy = 5[(x+y)^2 - 2xy] - 8xy = 5(40^2 - 2xy) - 8xy = 8000 - 10xy - 8xy = 8000 - 18xy.\]Since $|x+y| = 40$, we have $x+y = \pm 40$. Without loss of generality, we can assume $x+y = 40$. Then
\[xy = \frac{(x+y)^2 - (x^2 + y^2)}{2} = \frac{(x+y)^2 - ( (x+y)^2 - 2xy)}{2} = \frac{2xy}{(x+y)^2}.\]So
\[xy = \frac{(40)^2 - ( (40)^2 - 2xy)}{2} = \frac{2xy}{40^2}.\]Simplifying this equation gives $xy = \frac{(40)^2}{2} = 800$. Therefore,
\[f(x, y) = 8000 - 18xy = 8000 - 18(800) = 8000 - 14400 = -6400.\]Therefore, the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ when $x$ and $y$ range over all real numbers such that $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$ is $-6400$. The answer is: $-6400$

Question (hint: positive numerical answer):
"What is the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ when $x$ and $y$ range over all real numbers such that $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$?"
Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:


Using the given equation $|x - 2y| + |y - 2x| = 40,$ we can see that it represents the sum of the absolute values of two differences. We can rewrite this equation using the properties of absolute values:
\[|x - 2y| + |y - 2x| = |x - 2y| + |2x - y| = 40.\]
Now, let's consider the expression $5x^2 + 5y^2 - 8xy$. We can rewrite this as follows:
\[5x^2 + 5y^2 - 8xy = \left( \frac{9}{2}(x^2 + y^2) - \frac{1}{2} (x - y)^2 \right).\]
Notice that $(x^2 + y^2) - (x - y)^2 = 2xy$. So we can rewrite the given expression again as follows:
\[5x^2 + 5y^2 - 8xy = \frac{9}{2}(x^2 + y^2) - \frac{1}{2} (x - y)^2 = \frac{9}{2} \left( (x^2 + y^2) - \frac{2}{9} (x - y)^2 \right) = \frac{9}{2} \left( \frac{1}{9} (x^2 + y^2 - 2xy + 2xy) - \frac{2}{9} (x - y)^2 \right) = \frac{9}{2} \left( \frac{1}{9} ((x - y)^2 + 2xy) - \frac{2}{9} (x - y)^2 \right) = \frac{1}{2} (x - y)^2 + \frac{9}{2} (2xy). \]
Now, let's substitute the given equation $|x - 2y| + |y - 2x| = 40$ into this expression. Since $|x - 2y| + |y - 2x| = 40$, we have $(x - y)^2 + 4xy = 1600$. Therefore, our expression becomes
\[\frac{1}{2} (x - y)^2 + \frac{9}{2} (2xy) = \frac{1}{2} (1600 - 4xy) + 9xy = 800 - 2xy + 18xy = 800 + 16xy.\]

We want to minimize this expression. Since the expression involves only the product of $x$ and $y$, it will be minimized when the product $xy$ is maximized. From the equation $(x - y)^2 + 4xy = 1600$, we know that $xy$ cannot be greater than $400$. In fact, the maximum value of $xy$ occurs when $x = y$, so we have $x^2 + x^2 - 2x^2 + 4x^2 = 1600$, or $2x^2 = 1600$, so $x^2 = 800$, which implies $|x| = \sqrt{800}$. Thus $xy_{\max} = x^2 = 800$.
Therefore, the minimum value of the expression $5x^2 + 5y^2 - 8xy$ is
\[\frac{1}{2} (1600 - 4xy_{\max}) + 9xy_{\max} = \frac{1}{2} (1600 - 4*800) + 9*800 = \frac{1}{2} (1600 - 3200) + 7200 = -800 + 7200 = 6400.\]
However, this is a negative value, which contradicts the fact that the expression represents a sum of squares and therefore must be non-negative. Therefore, our approach of maximizing $xy$ was wrong.

We need to revisit the equation $(x - y)^2 + 4xy = 1600$ to find another way to maximize $xy$. From this equation, we see that $(x - y)^2 = 1600 - 4xy$. Since $(x - y)^2$ is always non-negative, we must have
\[1600 - 4xy \geq 0 \implies 4xy \leq 1600 \implies xy \leq 400.\]
Now, equality holds if $x = 2y$ or $y = 2x$. Without loss of generality, suppose $x = 2y$. Then the equation $|x - 2y| + |y - 2x| = 40$ becomes $|x - x| + |y - \frac{x}{2}| = 40$, or $|y - \frac{x}{2}| = 40$. Substituting $x = 2y$ into this equation, we get $|y - y| = 40$, or $0 = 40$, which is a contradiction. So we must have $y = 2x$. Substituting this into the equation, we get
\[|x - 2*2x| + |2x - 4x| = 40 \implies |-x| + |-2x| = 40 \implies x = -20.\]
Therefore, we have $y = -40$.

Now, plugging these values of $x$ and $y$ into the expression $5x^2 + 5y^2 - 8xy$, we get
\[5(-20)^2 + 5(-40)^2 - 8(-20)(-40) = 2000 + 8000 - 6400 = 3600.\]
Therefore, the minimum value of the expression $5x^2 + 5y^2 - 8xy$ is $3600$.
So, the solution to this problem is $\boxed{3600}$. The negative numerical answer does not work. That's why we can discard it. We are given an inequality which says that x and y have a constraint, so we will need to use this constraint to get the equation to a much simpler expression to minimize or maximize. Here in this question as well, the same concept has been used: firstly you write the expression you have in the simplest mathematical form. Then use the constraints to reach at your answer. Therefore, in this way, you reach to your desired simplified form! Hence the Minimum value is 3600.
The minimum value is 3600. Therefore, it can’t take a positive numerical value

Question (hint: positive numerical answer):
"What is the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ when $x$ and $y$ range over all real numbers such that $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$?"
Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:


Let $u = x - 2y$ and $v = y - 2x$. Then we have $|u| + |v| = 40$. 
We can write $u = (x - 2y)$ and $v = -(y - 2x) = -y + 2x$. 
So we have $|u| + |-v| = 40$. 
Using the property $|a| + |b| \geq |a + b|$, we get $|u - (-v)| \geq |u + (-v)| = |u - v| = 40$. 
Since $|u - v| = |(x - 2y) - (-y + 2x)| = |x - 2y + y - 2x| = |-x - y| = |-(x + y)| = |x + y|$, 
we have $|x + y| = 40$. 
Now let's go back to the expression $5x^2 + 5y^2 - 8xy$. We can rewrite it as $\frac{1}{2} [(5x^2 - 8xy + 5y^2) + (5x^2 + 8xy + 5y^2)]$.
We recognize $(5x^2 - 8xy + 5y^2)$ as $(3x - y)^2$ and $(5x^2 + 8xy + 5y^2)$ as $(3y + x)^2$. 
So we have $\frac{1}{2}[(3x - y)^2 + (3y + x)^2] = \frac{1}{2} [(3x - y)^2 + (x + 3y)^2]$.
Note that $(3x - y)^2 + (x + 3y)^2 \geq 0$ for all $x, y$. 
We want to find the minimum value of this expression, given that $|x + y| = 40$. 
We can use the substitution method to solve for one variable in terms of the other.
From the equation $|x + y| = 40$, we can square both sides to get $(x + y)^2 = 1600$.
Expanding, we get $x^2 + 2xy + y^2 = 1600$. 
Now we substitute $2xy = (3x - y)^2 + (x + 3y)^2 - (x^2 + y^2)$ into the equation:
$x^2 + 2xy + y^2 = 1600$ gives us $x^2 + ((3x - y)^2 + (x + 3y)^2 - (x^2 + y^2)) + y^2 = 1600$.
Simplifying, we get $(3x - y)^2 + (x + 3y)^2 = 3200$.
Therefore, we have shown that the minimum value of $5x^2 + 5y^2 - 8xy$ is $\frac{1}{2}(3200) = 1600$. Thus, the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ when $x$ and $y$ range over all real numbers such that $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$ is $1600$. The answer is: $1600$

Question (hint: positive numerical answer):
"For how many positive integers $m$ does the equation \[\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}\] have $4$ distinct solutions?"
Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:


To have 4 distinct solutions to the given equation, we need to choose a value of $m$ so that the right-hand side of the equation (which is $\frac{m}{100}$) satisfies a specific condition regarding the absolute value on the left-hand side.

For the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ to have 4 distinct solutions, the value $\frac{m}{100}$ must lie strictly between 2 and 1. This is because, on the left-hand side, $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert$ can take values ranging from 1 to 3, and if we let the right-hand side range from 1 to 3 as well, we would only have 3 (and not 4) distinct solutions. The value of $\frac{m}{100}$ must be strictly between 1 and 2 so as to give us 4 different solutions. This means $1 < \frac{m}{100} < 2$, or $100 < m < 200$. Now we just need to find how many positive integers fall within this range, which can be found by subtracting the lower limit (100) from the upper limit (200) and adding 1 (for inclusive counting). Thus, the number of such positive integers $m$ is $200-100+1 = 101$. But this does not make sense as there is no $m$ giving 4 distinct solutions!
This was a mistake, let's reexamine our reasoning.

When we have $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$, we know that for $|x - 1| - 2 = z$, there will be 4 distinct solutions when $z = \frac{m}{100}$ lies within $(0, 2)$. For $|x - 1| - 2 = z$, when $z < 0$, there are no solutions. When $z = 0$, there is one solution $x = 1$. When $0 < z < 2$, there are two solutions. When $z = 2$, there are two solutions if they're different from the case of $z < 2$. When $z > 2$, there are no solutions. Combining all the cases, we need $|x - 1| - 2 = z$ to have two solutions for $z = \frac{m}{100}$ in $(0, 2)$, so $\frac{m}{100}$ must be in $(1, 2)$.

This is exactly where $1 < \frac{m}{100} < 2$ comes from. So, with a proper understanding of the solutions to the absolute value equation, the correct range of $m$ is actually $100 < m < 200$. Therefore, the number of positive integers $m$ that make the original equation have four distinct solutions are the integers in the interval $(100, 200)$ and that is $200 - 100 -1 = 99$.
So the only step in the reasoning that was mistaken was finding the range of $m$ to be $100 < m < 200$. The correct inequality is actually $100 < m < 200$. Therefore, the number of positive integer solutions for $m$ is the number of elements in the set $\{m \in \mathbb Z | 100 < m < 200 \}$, or $(200 - 100) - 1 = 99$. Therefore, the total number of positive integer solutions for m is 99. The answer is: $99$.

Question (hint: positive numerical answer):
"For how many positive integers $m$ does the equation \[\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}\] have $4$ distinct solutions?"
Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:



The equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ is a piecewise function, so it can be solved in steps.

First, let's set $\frac{m}{100}$ to $k$. Then we have $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert = k$.
We consider two cases for the inner absolute value expression:

Case 1: $\vert x-1 \vert - 2 = k$, so $\vert x - 1 \vert = k + 2$. Then two subcases:
- If $x - 1 \geq 0$, we have $x - 1 = k + 2 \Rightarrow x = k + 3$.
- If $x - 1 < 0$, we have $-(x - 1) = k + 2 \Rightarrow x = 1 - k - 2 \Rightarrow x = -k - 1$.

Case 2: $\vert x - 1 \vert - 2 = -k$, so $\vert x - 1 \vert = 2 - k$. Then the only subcase:
- If $x - 1 \geq 0$, we have $x - 1 = 2 - k \Rightarrow x = 3 - k$.
- If $x - 1 < 0$, we have $-(x - 1) = 2 - k \Rightarrow x = -1 + k + 2 \Rightarrow x = k + 1$.

So we have four solutions in terms of $k$: $x = k + 3$, $x = -k - 1$, $x = 3 - k$, and $x = k + 1$. 
For this system of equations to have four distinct solutions, the solution values for $x$ from the two cases must be different. By inspection we observe that the case 1 solutions will always be the same as the case 2 solutions for certain values of $k$. 

The case 1 solution $x = k + 3$ will equal the case 2 solution $x = k + 1$ when $k + 3 = k + 1$, which yields the contradiction $3 = 1$. This tells us that some of the solutions must be eliminated because they are the same. 
The case 1 solution $x = -k - 1$ will equal the case 2 solution $x = 3 - k$ when $-k - 1 = 3 - k$ which also yields the contradiction $1 = 3$. This also tells us that some of the solutions must be eliminated because they are the same.

Let's check the remaining solutions pairwise for $k \ge 0$:
- $k + 3 \neq 3 - k$, because the left hand side is $k + 3$ and the right hand side is $3 - k$. There is no equality.
- $k + 3 \neq k + 1$, because the left hand side is $k + 3$ and the right hand side is $k + 1$. There is no equality.
- $k + 1 \neq -k - 1$, because the left hand side is $k + 1$ and the right hand side is $-k - 1$. There is equality only when $k = 0$. So this is an extraneous case.
- $k + 1 \neq 3 - k$, because the left hand side is $k + 1$ and the right hand side is $3 - k$. There is no equality.
- $-k - 1 \neq -k - 1$, because both sides of the equation are $-k - 1$. There is an equality. This is an extraneous case.
- $-k - 1 \neq 3 - k$, because the left hand side is $-k - 1$ and the right hand side is $3 - k$. There is an equality only when $k = 2$. So this is an extraneous case.

Thus, the only cases that result in distinct solutions for $k \ge 0$ are $k + 3$ and $3 - k$ and $k + 1$ and $-k - 1$, because of some of the pairwise non-equalities.

For $k < 0$, we swap the absolute values in each of the two cases. In case 1, we then have $|x - 1| = -k + 2 \Rightarrow x = 1 \pm (-k + 2)$ which is equal to $1 - k + 2 = 3 - k$ and $1 + k - 2 = k - 1$. In case 2, we then have $|x - 1| = 2 - (-k) \Rightarrow x = 1 \pm (2 + k)$ which is equal to $1 + 2 + k = k + 3$ and $1 - 2 - k = -k - 1$. Thus, the solutions obtained this way are just the same as those we obtained for $k \ge 0$.

Considering all these, the only solutions that we are left with are $(k + 3)$ and $(3 - k)$ from case 1 and case 2 respectively. Let's combine these two: $k + 3 = 3 - k \implies k = 0$. Thus, there is only 1 value for $m = 100k = 100 \cdot 0 = 0$, which doesn't work.

Considering the case where $k > 2$, We will always have two positive integer solutions with distinct absolute values, because both $k + 3$ and $3 - k$ are positive integers and $k + 3 > 3 - k \implies k > 0$. For each $k$, the number of distinct solutions for the equation in this case is 4. If we require $k$ to be an integer in the range $(0,2)$ (so that $0 < \frac{m}{100} < 2$), there is no $k$ value that would satisfy this, hence there are 0 such $k$. We find that only $k=2$ will satisfy $0 < \frac{m}{100} < 2$. Hence for $m = 100 \cdot 2 = 200$, the number of distinct solutions would be 4.
Therefore, only one value for $m$ (namely 200) would satisfy the given condition. Hence $\boxed{1}$.
The answer is: $${\boxed{1}}$$.

Question (hint: positive numerical answer):
"For how many positive integers $m$ does the equation \[\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}\] have $4$ distinct solutions?"
Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:


To the left of the equation we have an absolute value of an absolute value. This means that the graph of the function $y=\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert$ is V-shaped with a base on the interval $[1-2, 1+2] = [ -1, 3]$. The function on this interval is equal to:
- $y = -(x-1) + 2 = -x + 3$ if $ x \leq 1$,
- $y = (x-1) - 2 = x - 3$ if $1 \le x \le 3$,
- and 0 elsewhere (since absolute values of negative numbers are negative, and absolute values of numbers larger than 3 are positive).

The graph thus has a "hump" centered at $x=1$ with a height of $2$ units. And to the right there's a $\tfrac{m}{100}$ which makes the graph shift upwards by a factor of $\tfrac{m}{100}$.

The right side of the equation equals to four distinct solutions exactly when graph of $\tfrac{m}{100}$ intersects the graph of $y=\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert$ at 4 points. This occurs exactly when $\tfrac{m}{100}$ is in the interval $(0,2)$. Thus the number of such $m$ is just 200. 

The answer is: $200$

Question (hint: positive numerical answer):
"For how many positive integers $m$ does the equation \[\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}\] have $4$ distinct solutions?"
Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:


The given equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has 4 distinct solutions.
The absolute value function $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert$ reaches its minimum value of 0 at $x=3$ and maximum value of 4 at $x=-1$.
So for the equation to have 4 distinct solutions, we need $\frac{m}{100}$ to be in the interval $(0,4)$.
Multiplying by $100$, we get $0 < m < 400$.
The number of positive integer values of $m$ in this interval is $399$.
So the value of $m$ for which the equation has 4 distinct solutions is 399.
The answer is: $\boxed{399}$

Question (hint: positive numerical answer):
"For how many positive integers $m$ does the equation \[\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}\] have $4$ distinct solutions?"
Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:


To solve this problem, let's understand the graph of $y=\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert$ first. 

If we consider the expression inside the absolute value, that is $|x - 1| - 2$. This is a type of "V" shape graph (reminiscent of the letter "V"), with a vertex at $x = 1$. The "V" opens upwards, as when $x < 1$, $|x - 1| - 2$ becomes $-(x - 1) - 2 = -x + 3$. The graph changes slope at $x = 1$, where it goes from being a downward sloping line to an upward sloping line, with $|x - 1| - 2$ becoming $x - 1 - 2 = x - 3$. So the graph of $y = | | x - 1 | - 2 |$ is the graph of a "|" shape, where the left "arm" of the "|" moves along the $y$-axis as $x$ varies from $-\infty$ to $1$, while the right "arm" moves along the $y$-axis as $x$ varies from $1$ to $\infty$. The "|" is $2$ units wide, and $2$ units high.

Now, the equation is asking about how many times this "|" shaped graph intersects the line $y = m/100$, where $m$ is a positive integer from $1$ to $100$ (because $m/100$ is a positive number less than 1 when $m<100$). 

Looking at the graph, we notice that the "|" shaped graph is equal to $2$ for exactly two values of $x$. Therefore, for this equation to have 4 distinct solutions, we need two values of $m$ such that $0<m/100<2$ or $2<m/100<4$. That means $0<m<200$ and $200<m<400$. The possible values of $m$ are thus any integers in the range $(0,200) \cup (200, 400)$, or, equivalently, the union of the sets of integers in the ranges $(0, 200)$ and $(200, 400)$. 

The number of integers in a set from $a$ to $b$ is $(b-a)+1$, so: 
- The number of positive integers in the interval (0, 200) is (200 - 0) + 1 = 200 + 1 = 201.
- The number of positive integers in the interval (200, 400) is (400 - 200) + 1 = 200 + 1 = 201.

So, to get the total number of integers $m$, we add these two results together. This gives us 201 + 201 = 402. However, m is only from 1 to 100, so we have to get back the overlap in the range for m. When we add these two sets together (0,200) and (200,400), the overlap is (200, 400). Since there is 1 positive integer $m$ in the range (200,400), which is equivalent to the number of integers in the intersection of the two sets, we need to subtract this integer from our total result. So we subtract 1 from 402 to get 402 - 1 = 401. 

And now, to return to our original problem: we were looking for the number of positive integers $m$, and according to our analysis, there are 401 such integers $m$ for which the given equation has four distinct solutions. The solution is therefore 1.

But let's revisit that step from before. Shouldn't we add the possible values of $m$ from both sets? Why did we need to subtract one? The answer lies in the question itself: "how many positive integers $m$". Looking back at the original problem again, it only asked for positive integer $m$ values ranging from $1$ to $100$. This restriction eliminates the number 401 as a possible value for $m$, but if you didn't pay attention to the problem's conditions, your answer might include a possible value greater than $100$ (which isn't valid either) or less than $1$ (which is excluded by definition). The requirement that $m$ be a positive integer less than or equal to $100$ eliminates the integers that are not in our desired range $(1, 100).$

If you were asked how many possible values of $m$ fit in the entire integer set for example in the open interval $(-100, 100)$, your answer would include 201 numbers, including positive and negative integers. The situation is the same here but with much stricter conditions that we didn't need to consider when just asking for "any" positive integers.

So, indeed, from the problem's conditions that m is only from 1 to 100, we need to subtract the overlap and come up with the right answer: 402 - 1 = 401.

Therefore, the positive integer $m$ for the original problem that allows the equation to have $4$ distinct solutions is $1$. The answer is $1$. The equation has $4$ distinct solutions only for $1$ value of $m$. In other words, only $1$ equation in the set of equations $ \vert \vert x - 1 \vert - 2 \vert = \frac{m}{100}$ with $m$ a positive integer from $1$ to $100$ has four solutions. And the value of $m$ for this specific equation is $100$. This value is the unique solution to the original problem. So, the number of positive integers $m$ that allows the equation to have $4$ distinct solutions in the set of equations with $m$ a positive integer from $1$ to $100$ is $1$. The value of $m$ for the unique equation that has $4$ distinct solutions is also $1$. Answer: 1.
The answer is $\boxed{1}$.

Question (hint: positive numerical answer):
"For how many positive integers $m$ does the equation \[\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}\] have $4$ distinct solutions?"
Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:


The equation $| |x-1|-2|=\frac{m}{100}$ has 4 distinct solutions means that the right side, $\frac{m}{100}$, is equal to 2. So we have $| |x-1|-2|=2$.
This equation splits into two cases:
Case 1: $|x-1|-2=2$, so $|x-1|=4$. This gives us two equations: $x-1=4$ and $x-1=-4$. So $x=5$ and $x=-3$.
Case 2: $|x-1|-2=-2$, so $|x-1|=0$. This gives us one equation: $x-1=0$, so $x=1$.
So the only solution from Case 1 is $x=5$ or $x=-3$, and the solution from Case 2 is $x=1$. Therefore, the 4 distinct solutions are $x=5$, $x=-3$, and $x=1$.
The value of m can be found by setting $\frac{m}{100}$ equal to 2, so we have $m=200$.
Therefore, the number of positive integer m for which the equation $| |x-1|-2|=\frac{m}{100}$ has 4 distinct solutions is 1.
The answer is: $\boxed{1}$

Question (hint: positive numerical answer):
"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"
Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:


The product of two numbers is zero if and only if at least one of the numbers is zero. So in this problem, either $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$.
If $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$, then $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. This means that $x + y = \pm 10$ and $x - y = \pm 10$. Solving these two equations, we get four points: $(8,2)$, $(8,-2)$, $(-8,2)$, and $(-8,-2)$.
If $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$, then $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$. This means that $x = \pm 8$ and $y = \pm 8$. Combining this with the previous result, the points that satisfy the original equation are $(8,2)$, $(8,-2)$, $(-8,2)$, and $(-8,-2)$. These four points form a square with side length 8.
To find the area of this square, we simply square the length of one side: $8^2 = 64$. Therefore, the area of the square is $\boxed{64}$ square units.
The final answer is: 64.

Question (hint: positive numerical answer):
"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"
Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:


The given expression is equal to zero if either $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$. 

If $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$, then $\vert x + y \vert = 10$, which implies $x + y = 10$ or $x + y = -10$. 
If $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$, then $\vert x - y \vert = 10$, which implies $x - y = 10$ or $x - y = -10$. 
If $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$, then $\vert x \vert = 8$, which implies $x = 8$ or $x = -8$. 
If $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$, then $\vert y \vert = 8$, which implies $y = 8$ or $y = -8$.

Combining these equations, we find that the points that satisfy the given equation are:
(8, 8), (8, -8), (-8, 8), (-8, -8), (10, 0), (0, 10), (-10, 0), (0, -10). These points are the vertices of the octagon.

The sides of the octagon are all equal to $\sqrt{8^2 + 8^2} = 8\sqrt{2}$.

The area of the octagon is the sum of the areas of two squares of side length 10 (since the squares with side length 10 contain all the vertices of the octagon) minus the areas of four right triangles with base and height equal to 8 (since each of these right triangles is formed by a side of the octagon and two adjacent sides of a square with side length 10).

The area of each square with side length 10 is $10^2 = 100$, so the total area of the two squares is $2 \times 100 = 200$.

The area of each right triangle is $\frac{1}{2} \times 8 \times 8 = 32$, so the total area of the four right triangles is $4 \times 32 = 128$.

Therefore, the area of the octagon is $200 - 128 = 72$. The answer is: 72

Question (hint: positive numerical answer):
"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"
Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:


The expression is equal to zero if either $(|x + y| - 10)^2 = 0$, $(|x - y| - 10)^2 = 0$, $(|x| - 8)^2 = 0$, or $(|y| - 8)^2 = 0$.

Setting each of the factors equal to zero, we find:

1. If $(|x + y| - 10)^2 = 0$, then $|x + y| = 10$, which gives us the lines $x + y = 10$ and $x + y = -10$.
2. If $(|x - y| - 10)^2 = 0$, then $|x - y| = 10$, which gives us the lines $x - y = 10$ and $x - y = -10$.
3. If $(|x| - 8)^2 = 0$, then $|x| = 8$, which gives us the lines $x = 8$ and $x = -8$.
4. If $(|y| - 8)^2 = 0$, then $|y| = 8$, which gives us the lines $y = 8$ and $y = -8$.

The eight lines divide the plane into 16 regions, and the points that satisfy the original equation lie on the boundaries of these regions. The polygon formed by these points is a square with side length 16, so its area is $16^2 = 256$. The answer is: $256$

Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:

 The expression $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + (\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + (\vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ is equivalent to $\vert x + y \vert - 10 = 0$ or $\vert x - y \vert - 10 = 0$ or $\vert x \vert - 8 = 0$ or $\vert y \vert - 8 = 0.$ We can rewrite these equations as $\vert x + y \vert = 10,$ $\vert x - y \vert = 10,$ $\vert x \vert = 8,$ and $\vert y \vert = 8.$
The equalities $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$ give us $x = \pm 8$ and $y = \pm 8.$
The equalities $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$ give us two pairs of lines:
$x + y = \pm 10$ and $x - y = \pm 10.$ Solving these pairs of lines, we find the intersection points of the lines to be $(5,5),$ $(5,-5),$ $(-5,5),$ and $(-5,-5).$
Thus, the points that satisfy the equation form a square with side length 16. The area of this square is $16^2 = 256.$ The answer is: $256$ square units
The area of the convex polygon is $\boxed{256}$ square units. The answer is $\boxed{256}$.

Question (hint: positive numerical answer):
"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"
Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:


In order for the expression on the left side of the equation to be equal to 0, at least one of the factors must be 0, because the product of two terms being zero implies one or both of the terms are zero. So we consider two cases:
Case 1: $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$, which implies $\vert x + y \vert = 10$, or $x + y = 10$ or $x + y = -10$.
Case 2: $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$, which implies $\vert x - y \vert = 10$, or $x - y = 10$ or $x - y = -10$.
Case 3: $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$, which implies $\vert x \vert = 8$, or $x = 8$ or $x = -8$.
Case 4: $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$, which implies $\vert y \vert = 8$, or $y = 8$ or $y = -8$.
Solving all of these cases, we find that the points satisfying the given equation lie on the intersections of the lines $x + y = 10, -10$, $x - y = 10, -10$, $x = 8, -8$, and $y = 8, -8$. Plotting these points on a graph and connecting the lines, we find that the enclosed convex polygon is a square with side length 10. The area of a square is given by the square of the length of its side, so the area of the square is $10^2 = 100$. The answer is: $100$ square units

"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"
Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:


This problem requires knowledge of coordinate geometry, absolute value functions and the properties of equality to solve it. The equation given is a product of two expressions each containing absolute value functions. The product being zero means that at least one of the factors must be zero.
First, consider the factor $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2$. For this to be zero, we must have $\vert x + y \vert = 10$, which means $x + y = 10$ or $x + y = -10$. These two lines are the boundary lines of the polygon.

Second, consider the factor $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2$. For this to be zero, we must have $\vert x - y \vert = 10$, which means $x - y = 10$ or $x - y = -10$. These two lines are also the boundary lines of the polygon.

Third, consider the factor $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2$. For this to be zero, we must have $\vert x \vert = 8$, which means $x = 8$ or $x = -8$. These two lines are the boundary lines of the polygon.

Fourth, consider the factor $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2$. For this to be zero, we must have $\vert y \vert = 8$, which means $y = 8$ or $y = -8$. These two lines are the boundary lines of the polygon.

Plot these four lines on a graph and the enclosed region will form a square of side length 20 units. The area of this square is $20^2 = 400$ square units. The answer is: $400$

"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"
Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:


The equation given in the problem is $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$. For the product of two numbers to be zero, at least one of them must be zero. So either $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$.

For the first equation to be zero, we must have $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. This means $x + y = \pm 10$ and $x - y = \pm 10$. Solving this system of equations gives us the following points: $(5,5), (5,-5), (-5,5), (-5,-5)$.

Similarly, for the second equation to be zero, we must have $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$. This means $x = \pm 8$ and $y = \pm 8$. Solving this gives us the following points: $(8,0), (0,8), (-8,0), (0,-8)$.

All of these points lie on the square with vertices at $(8,0), (0,8), (-8,0), (0,-8)$. The side length of this square is 16, so its area is $16^2 = 256$.
The answer is: $256$.

"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"
Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:


This question asks us for the area of a polygon. 
The area of a polygon enclosed by the points that satisfy an equation is equivalent to the number of points satisfying that equation.
If $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$, then the product of two numbers is 0 if and only if at least one of the numbers is zero. 
This means that either $ ((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2) = 0$ or $ ((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$.
If $ ((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2) = 0$, then $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$.
This is satisfied when $x + y = 10$ or $x + y = -10$ and $x - y = 10$ or $x - y = -10$.
These equations can be solved to give the vertices of a square with side length 10: $(5, 5)$, $(5, -5)$, $(-5, -5)$, and $(-5, 5)$.
Similarly, if $ ((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$, then $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$.
This is satisfied when $x = 8$ or $x = -8$ and $y = 8$ or $y = -8$.
These equations can be solved to give the vertices of a square with side length 16: $(8, 8)$, $(8, -8)$, $(-8, -8)$, and $(-8, 8)$.
Taking the union of these two squares gives us the convex polygon whose area we are asked to find.
The area of a square is calculated by squaring the length of one of its sides.
For the first square, the side length is 10, so its area is $10^2 = 100$.
For the second square, the side length is 16, so its area is $16^2 = 256$.
Therefore, the total area of the convex polygon is $100 + 256 = 356$.
The answer is: $356$.

Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:


For the product to be equal to $0$, one of the factors must be $0$.
This gives us two cases to consider:
Case 1: $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + (\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$.
If this equation is true, then both $\vert x + y \vert - 10 = 0$ and $\vert x - y \vert - 10 = 0$.
This means that $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$.
This is the same as saying $x + y = \pm 10$ and $x - y = \pm 10$.
Solving these equations gives the points as $(5,5), (5,-5), (-5,5),$ and $(-5,-5)$.

Case 2: $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + (\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$.
If this equation is true, then both $\vert x \vert - 8 = 0$ and $\vert y \vert - 8 = 0$.
This means that $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$.
This is the same as saying $x = \pm 8$ and $y = \pm 8$.
Solving these equations gives the points as $(8,0), (-8,0), (0,8),$ and $(0,-8)$.

These eight points form a square with side length $10$. Therefore, the area of this square is $10^2 = 100$. The answer is: $\boxed{100}$.

Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:


The expression $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2$ equals 0 if and only if $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$, which means $x + y = 10$ and $x - y = 10$ or $x + y = -10$ and $x - y = -10$. The first pair of equations yields $x = 10$ and $y = 0$, and the second pair yields $x = -10$ and $y = 0$.
Similarly, $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ if and only if $x = \pm 8$ and $y = \pm 8$.
The four points are $\left( 10, 0 \right), \left( -10, 0 \right), \left( 8, 8 \right)$ and $\left( 8, -8 \right)$. The shape they form is a square with side length 20 (the distance between $\left( 10, 0 \right)$ and $\left( -10, 0 \right)$ or $\left( 8, 8 \right)$ and $\left( 8, -8 \right)$). Therefore, the area of the square is $20^2 = 400$. The answer is: $400$.

Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:



In order for the product of the two complicated expressions to be 0, at least one of them must be 0. Thus either $(\vert x + y\vert - 10)^2 + (\vert x - y\vert - 10)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert x\vert - 8)^2 + (\vert y\vert - 8)^2 = 0$. If the first expression is 0, then both $\vert x + y\vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y\vert = 10$. This implies that both $x + y = \pm 10$ and $x - y = \pm 10$. Adding these equations, we get $x = \pm 10$. Subtracting the second from the first, we get $2y = 0$ so $y = 0$. Thus either $(x, y) = (10, 0)$ or $(x, y) = (-10, 0)$.  If the second expression is 0, then both $\vert x\vert = 8$ and $\vert y\vert = 8$, which implies $x = \pm 8$ and $y = \pm 8$. Thus the points in the polygon are $(10, 0)$, $( -10, 0)$, $(8, 8)$, $(8, -8)$, $(-8, 8)$, and $(-8, -8)$. These points form a square with side length 20. The area of a square of side length s is $s^2$, thus the area of the polygon is $20^2 = 400$.
The value is
\[400.\] The answer is: $400$.

Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:


The product of two numbers is zero if and only if at least one of the numbers is zero. Therefore, the equation $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ is true if and only if at least one of the following two conditions is true:
1. $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$
2. $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$
The first condition is satisfied if and only if $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$, which implies that $x = y = 5$ or $x = -y = 5$. The second condition is satisfied if and only if $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$, which implies that $(x, y) = (8, 0), (0, 8), (-8, 0)$ or $(0, -8)$. These points form a square with side length $10$.
The area of the square is $10 \times 10 = 100$. The answer is: $100$

Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:


In order to get a product of two things to be zero, either the first thing has to be zero, or the second thing has to be zero, or both are zero. So, the original equation splits into several smaller equations:
$(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$,
$(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$,
$(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$, and
$(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$.
These equations are easy to solve:
$\vert x + y \vert = 10$,
$\vert x - y \vert = 10$,
$\vert x \vert = 8$, and
$\vert y \vert = 8$.
Then $x + y = \pm 10$, $x - y = \pm 10$, $x = \pm 8$, and $y = \pm 8$. These give us the vertices of the rectangle. Its length is $20$, and its width is $16$. Therefore its area is $20 \times 16 = 320$. Hence the area of the convex polygon is $320$, and our final solution is $320$. The answer is: $\boxed{320}$.

Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:



Notice that
\[(u - 10)^2 + (v - 10)^2 = 0 \implies u = v = 10,\]and
\[(s - 8)^2 + (t - 8)^2 = 0 \implies s = t = 8.\]Since $(u - 10)^2 + (v - 10)^2 = 0$ and $(s - 8)^2 + (t - 8)^2 = 0$, each pair of absolute value expressions must be equal. That is
\[\vert x + y \vert = 10, \quad \vert x - y \vert = 10, \quad \vert x \vert = 8, \quad \vert y \vert = 8.\]From $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$, we get a square with side length $10$, where the vertices are $(8, 2), (8, -2), (-8, -2), (-8, 2)$.

To convince yourself or to check our work, we graph the equations. The point lie on the intersection of
\[\vert x + y \vert = 10 \text{ and } \vert x - y \vert = 10.\]Also, $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$ define squares with side length $16$, namely
\[\vert x \vert = 8 \text{ is equivalent to } x = 8 \text{ or } x = -8,\]and $\vert y \vert = 8$ is equivalent to $y = 8$ or $y = -8$. So, these two equations intersect at the four vertices of our square.

Therefore, the area of this square is $10 \times 10 = 100$. So, the area of the convex polygon formed by the points $(x, y)$ satisfying the given equation is $100$.
The answer is: $100$

Question (hint: positive numerical answer):
"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"
Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:



First, we notice that if $a \cdot b = 0$, then either $a = 0$ or $b = 0$. So this equation is saying one of the two groups of absolute values have to be equal to 10, and the other two absolute values have to be equal to 8. This translates to the following system of equations:

1. $|x + y| = 10$ and $|x| = 8$, or
2. $|x + y| = 10$ and $|y| = 8$, or
3. $|x - y| = 10$ and $|x| = 8$, or
4. $|x - y| = 10$ and $|y| = 8$.

Let's solve each of these cases:

For case 1: $|x + y| = 10$ and $|x| = 8$ implies that $x = 8$ or $x = -8$. If $x = 8$, then from $|x + y| = 10$, we have $|8 + y| = 10$, which gives $y = 2$ or $y = -18$. If $x = -8$, then from $|x + y| = 10$, we have $|-8 + y| = 10$, which gives $y = 18$ or $y = -2$. So we get the points $(8,2)$, $(8,-18)$, $(-8,18)$, $(-8,-2)$.

For case 2: $|x + y| = 10$ and $|y| = 8$ implies that $y = 8$ or $y = -8$. If $y = 8$, then from $|x + y| = 10$, we have $|x + 8| = 10$, which gives $x = 2$ or $x = -18$. If $y = -8$, then from $|x + y| = 10$, we have $|x - 8| = 10$, which gives $x = 18$ or $x = -2$. So we get the same points $(8,2)$, $(8,-18)$, $(-8,18)$, $(-8,-2)$.

For case 3 and case 4, we get the same points as above.

So all four of these points are in the solution set. When we plot these points on the coordinate plane, we see that they form a rectangle with vertices at $(8,2)$, $(8,-18)$, $(-8,18)$, and $(-8,-2)$.

The width of the rectangle is $20$ (the difference between $8$ and $-8$) and the height is $20$ (the difference between $18$ and $-18$). The area of a rectangle is given by the product of its width and height, so the area of this convex polygon is $20 \times 20 = 400$. Therefore, the area of the convex polygon is $\boxed{400}$ square units.
The answer is: $400$

Question (hint: positive numerical answer):
"A function $f: \mathbb N \to \mathbb N$ satisfies the following two conditions for all positive integers $n$:$f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$ and $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$. Calculate $f(100)$."
Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:


We are given that $f(2n) = 2f(n) + 1$ and $f(f(f(n))) = 8n - 7$. Let's try to find $f(1)$.
Using $n = 1$ in the first equation, we have $f(2) = 2f(1) + 1$.
Then, using $n = 2$ in the second equation, we have $f(f(f(2))) = 8(2) - 7$, which simplifies to $f(f(f(2))) = 9$.
But from the first equation, we know $f(f(f(2))) = f(f(4)) = f(2f(2) + 1) = f(2(2f(1) + 1) + 1) = f(4f(1) + 3)$.
Substituting $f(4f(1) + 3) = 9$ gives $4f(1) + 3 = f^{-1}(9)$.
Since we're looking for $f(1)$, we need to find the value that, when plugged into $f$, gives 9. Let's assume this value is $a$, so $f(a) = 9$.
From $f(f(f(1)))=8(1)-7 = -5$, we have $f(f(a)) = -5$. So then $f(a) = f^{-1}(-5)$.
But this means $f(a) = 9$, the value we found before.
So $a$ must be a value such that $f(a) = 9$ twice.
Let's solve the second equation for $n = 4$, we get $f(f(f(4))) = 8(4) - 7$, or $f(f(f(4))) = 25$.
But from the first equation, we know $f(f(f(4))) = f(f(8)) = f(2f(4) + 1) = f(2(2f(2) + 1) + 1) = f(4f(2) + 3)$.
Substituting $f(4f(2) + 3) = 25$ gives $4f(2) + 3 = f^{-1}(25)$. But $f(a) = 9$ (where $a = f^{-1}(9)$) implies $f^{-1}(25) = 9 + 4 = 13$, and we know $f(2) = 2f(1) + 1 = 2a + 1 = 2*9 + 1 = 19$.
Then we can now check $f(f(f(1))) = 8(1) - 7$, or $f(f(f(1))) = -5$. But since we know $f(a) = f^{-1}(9) = 9$ and $f(f(a)) = -5$, we get $f(f(1)) = a = 9$.
Then using $n = 9$ in the first equation, we have $f(f(f(9))) = 8(9) - 7$, or $f(f(f(9))) = 55$.
But $f(f(f(9))) = f(f(18)) = f(2f(9) + 1) = f(2(2f(4) + 1) + 1) = f(4f(4) + 3)$. Putting values, $4f(4) + 3 = f^{-1}(55)$ so $4f(4) = 52$ or $f(4) = 13$. Again, since $f(2) = 19$, we use $n=4$ in second equation, to get
$13 = 2f(2) + 1$ so that $f(2) = 6$. So $f(2) = 2f(1)+1$, or $6 = 2f(1)+1$, giving $f(1) = \frac {5}{2}$.
Since $f$ maps integers to integers, we must have made a mistake somewhere. It turns out that our previous calculations were correct but this function doesn't map 1 to any integer, so this method doesn't work. The original solution seems incorrect. For $n=1$, we have $f(f(f(1))) = -5$, But $f(f(f(1)))$ cannot be negative as all $f(n)$ returns a Natural Number. Perhaps the value of $f(1)$ was incorrect, but from we found $f(1)$ we would then have a problem calculating $f(2)$, $f(4)$, etc.. Let's re-examine our equations and start by $f(f(f(n)))$=$8n$-7 and try to guess a value of $f(1)$: Let's guess $f(1)$ = 3. Then using $n = 1$, in $f(f(f(n)))$ = $8n$ - 7, we get $f(f(f(1)))$ = $8*1 - 7$ implies $f(f(f(1)))$ = 1. And using first equation this gives us $f(f(3))$ =1 which further gives $f(3)$ = $f^{-1}(1)$. Now if we use $n = 3$ in second equation $f(2n)$ = $2f(n)$ + 1. We get $f(6)$ = $2f(3)$ + 1 $ \Longrightarrow$ $ f(6)$ = $2 * f^{-1}(1) + 1$. But as $f(3)$ = $f^{-1}(1)$ we get $f(6)$ = $2*3 + 1$ = 7. Putting these values in $f(2n)$ = $2f(n)$ + 1 for n=3 we get indeed $f(6)$ = 7 , which checks okay. From the same equation for n = 1 we would also expect $f(2)$ = $2f(1)$ + 1 = $2*3 + 1$ = 7 but this would clearly contradict the result $f(2)$ = 19 that we found earlier by using this same method, based on the assumption $f(1)$ = 1. Thus our earlier solution from this method was wrong because it contradicted other values found by the same method when using different values of n. Our guess that $f(1)$ = 3 looks more reasonable; and going on from this we could compute $f(2)$ correctly from $f(2n)$ = $2f(n)$+1 and it would match perfectly with the value obtained earlier using the same method in a non-contradictory way. We find $f(2)$ = $2*3 + 1$ =7 and then putting $f(2)$ in 2nd equation when $n = 3$ we get $f(6)$ = $2*7 +

Question (hint: positive numerical answer):
"A function $f: \mathbb N \to \mathbb N$ satisfies the following two conditions for all positive integers $n$:$f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$ and $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$. Calculate $f(100)$."
Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:


Setting $n=1$ in the given functional equation, we have:
\[f(f(f(1)))=8(1)-7=1.\]
Therefore $f(f(f(1)))=1.$ Since $f$ is a mapping from $\mathbb{N}$ to $\mathbb{N}$, $f(f(f(1)))=1$ implies that $f(1)$ is a positive integer. So $f(1)=1.$

Then we see:
\[f(f(1))=f(1)=1,\]which implies $f(f(1))=1$. Again since $f(1)$ is a positive integer, $f(1)=1$.

Similarly, we have $f(1)=1$ implies:
\[f(1)=1,\]which means $f(1)=1$. 

Substitute $n=1$ into the second functional equation, we have:
\[f(2)=2f(1)+1=2(1)+1=3.\]That means $f(2)=3$.

Substitute $n=2$ into the second functional equation, we have:
\[f(4)=2f(2)+1=2(3)+1=7.\]That means $f(4)=7$.

Substitute $n=4$ into the second functional equation, we have:
\[f(8)=2f(4)+1=2(7)+1=15.\]That means $f(8)=15$.

Continue in this manner, and we can find $f(16)=31$, $f(32)=63$, $f(64)=127$, and so on.  By examining a pattern, we discover that $f(2^k)=2^k-1$ for all positive integers $k$. So $f(100)= 2^{6}-1=\boxed{63}.$ The answer is: 63

Question (hint: positive numerical answer):
"A function $f: \mathbb N \to \mathbb N$ satisfies the following two conditions for all positive integers $n$:$f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$ and $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$. Calculate $f(100)$."
Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:


To compute $f(100)$, we need to find a pattern or relationship in the function $f$. 
We know that $f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$. 
We can start by trying to find $f(n)$ for a simple value like $n=1$.
From the second equation, if $n=1$, we have $f(2)=2f(1)+1$. 
Let's say $f(1)=a$, then we have $f(2)=2a+1$. 
Using the second equation again, for $n=2$, we have $f(4)=2f(2)+1=2(2a+1)+1=4a+3$.
Again using the second equation for $n=\frac{4}{2}=2$, we have $f(4)=2f(2)+1=2(2a+1)+1=4a+3$.
Now we can substitute the value of $f(2)$ into this equation: $f(4)=2(2a+1)+1=4a+3$. This simplifies to $f(4)=4a+3$.
Comparing this with $f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$, we have $f(f(f(1)))=8*1-7=1$. 
But from the pattern we found, $f(f(f(1)))=f(f(a))=f(4a+3)=4a+3$.
So, we have the equation $4a+3=1$, which gives us $a=-0.5$.
However, function values are always integers, so we must have gone wrong in our calculation. Let's try it again.
Let's return to $f(2)=2f(1)+1$ and this time assume that $f(1)=b$. Then we get $f(2)=2b+1$.
Using the second equation for $n=1$, we get $f(2)=2f(1)+1=2b+1$.
Using the second equation for $n=\frac{2}{2}=1$, we get $f(2)=2f(1)+1=2b+1$.
Now, substituting the value of $f(1)$ into this equation, we have $f(2)=2b+1$. 
Comparing this with $f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$, we have $f(f(f(1)))=8*1-7=1$.
But from the pattern we found, $f(f(f(1)))=f(f(b))=f(2b+1)=2b+1$.
So, we have the equation $2b+1=1$, which gives us $b=0$.
Therefore, $f(1)=0$.
Using the second equation for $n=1$, we now have $f(2)=2f(1)+1=2*0+1=1$.
And then using the second equation for $n=2$, we get $f(4)=2f(2)+1=2*1+1=3$.
And so on. Continuing in this way, we find a pattern: $f(2^k)=1$ for all non-negative integers $k$, 
and for other values of $n$, $f(n)$ is the smallest integer $m$ such that $f(m)=1$.
So, to compute $f(100)$, we find the smallest integer $m$ such that $f(m)=1$, which turns out to be $m=2^7=128$.
So $f(100)=f(128)$, and again, the smallest integer $k$ such that $f(k)=1$ is $k=2^8=256$. Therefore, $f(100)=f(128)=256$.
The value of $f(100)$ is $256$. The answer is: $256$

"A function $f: \mathbb N \to \mathbb N$ satisfies the following two conditions for all positive integers $n$:$f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$ and $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$. Calculate $f(100)$."
Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:


We know that $f(f(f(100)))=8(100)-7=793$. By the second given equation, we have that $f(f(f(100)))=f(f(x))=793$ for some $x$. Hence substituting $n=x$ into the second given equation gives $f(2x)=2f(x)+1=793$, so $f(x)=\frac{793-1}{2}=396$. Substituting $n=x=396$ into the first equation gives $$f(f(f(396)))=f(f(y))=8(396)-7=3169,$$so for some $y$, $f(y)=3169$, implying $f(396)=3169$. Finally, substitute $n=396$ into the second equation to obtain $f(2\cdot396)=2f(396)+1=2\cdot 3169 +1 =6339$. So $f(100)=6339$. The solution is: $6339$.
The answer is: $\boxed{6339}$

"A function $f: \mathbb N \to \mathbb N$ satisfies the following two conditions for all positive integers $n$:$f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$ and $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$. Calculate $f(100)$."
Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:


We start by calculating $f(100)$ using the second condition: $f(2\cdot50) = 2f(50)+1.$ Let's denote $f(50)$ as $x.$ We can then express $f(100)$ as follows: $f(100) = 2x+1.$ We will use the first condition to find $x$.
By applying the first condition twice, we have: $f(f(f(50)))=8\cdot50-7 = 393.$ Then we have: $f(f(x)) = 393.$ Applying the first condition again, we have: $f(2f(x)+1) = 393.$ Plugging in $f(100) = 2x+1$ into this equation, we get: $f(2x+1) = 393.$
Now, from the second condition $f(2n) = 2f(n)+1$, we know $f(2x) = 2f(x)+1.$ Therefore, we may think about replacing $2x+1$ in the previous equation with $f(2x)$:
\[f(f(2x)) = 393.\]
From the first condition we know $f(f(f(x))) = 8x - 7 = 393$. This gives us the equation $8x - 7 = 393$, which can be solved to find that $x = 50.$ Therefore, we substitute $x=50$ back into $f(100) = 2x+1$ and find $f(100) = 2\cdot50+1=101$. So the answer is $\boxed{101}$.
The value of $f(100)$ is 101. The answer is: 101.

Question (hint: positive numerical answer):
"A function $f: \mathbb N \to \mathbb N$ satisfies the following two conditions for all positive integers $n$:$f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$ and $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$. Calculate $f(100)$."
Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:


Let's start by evaluating $f(100)$. 
Using the second given equation, we know that $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$. This equation gives us a way to find $f(100)$ if we know $f(50)$. 
To find $f(50)$ we can use the equation again with $n=25$. This gives us:
\[f(50) = 2f(25) + 1.\]
But to find $f(25)$ we can use the equation again with $n=12.5$, but in the context of the function $f$ we are dealing with only natural numbers, not fractional values. Therefore this way doesn't seem to be helpful for us. We should try another approach for $f(50)$.

We return to the first given equation: $f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$. If we put $n=50$, we have:
\[f(f(f(50))) = 8\cdot50 - 7 = 393.\]
This means that the value that $f(50)$ is first mapped to by applying $f$ three times equals $393$. Now let's examine the second given equation to see if anything helps us. We notice that for any natural number $k$, $f(2k) = 2f(k) + 1$. Let's try letting $k$ equal $f(k)$ for a moment. That would mean:
\[f(2f(k)) = 2f(f(k)) + 1\]
And then:
\[f(f(f(k))) = 2f(f(k)) + 1 - 2f(k).\]
We know that $f(f(f(50))) = 393$, so we have the equation:
\[393 = 2f(f(50)) + 1 - 2f(50).\]
Now this doesn't seem to help us much, but an equivalent relation is much easier to solve:
If we recall $f(f(f(50)))=8\cdot50-7 = 393$, and the equation we derived above $f(f(f(50))) = 2f(f(50)) + 1 - 2f(50)$, combining the two we get:
\[393 = 2f(f(50)) + 1 - 2f(50) \Longrightarrow 392 = 2f(f(50)) - 2f(50).\]
Factor out a 2 and you get $392 = 2(f(f(50)) - f(50))$. Dividing both sides by 2 results in $196 = f(f(50)) - f(50)$. Therefore:
\[f(f(50)) = f(50) + 196.\]
This is not particularly helpful in and of itself since now the question becomes, "What is $f(50)$?" To find this value, we have some options. One is to try different values for $f(50)$ until we stumble upon a value that satisfies this last equation, but that seems like a cumbersome task. Let's set up a little system of equations and see if we can solve for $f(50)$ using that approach as well. If we let $f(50) = A$, then $f(f(50)) = f(A)$, and our equation becomes:
\[f(A) = A + 196.\]
From our original equation, $f(f(50)) = 2f(50) + 1 - 2 \cdot 50 \Longrightarrow f(A) = 2A + 1 - 100$. Now our system of equations is:
\[\left\{
\begin{array}{lr}
f(A) = A + 196\\
f(A) = 2A - 99
\end{array}
\right.
\]
Equating these expressions for $f(A)$, gives $A + 196 = 2A - 99 \Longrightarrow A = 295$. So, the value of $f(50) = A = 295$. Now we can substitute this value back into the equation $f(f(50)) = 2f(50) + 1 - 2 \cdot 50$, giving us $f(295) = 2 \cdot 295 + 1 - 100 \Longrightarrow f(295) = 591$. Finally, substituting $f(50) = 295$ into our original equation $f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$ gives us $f(f(f(50)))=8\cdot50-7 \Longrightarrow f(591) = 393$. We know $f(591) = f(295)$, so this makes sense. Now, we know that 295 must be the value for $f(50)$ and 591 must be the value for $f(295)$.

By the second given equation, $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$, we have:
\[f(100)=2f(50)+1=2\cdot295+1=591.\]
Now that we have solved for $f(100)$, the solution is \[\boxed{591}.\]

Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:


We are given the functional equation $f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$ and $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$.
We are asked to find $f(100)$.
We can start by applying the second equation to find $f(100)$.
Since $100=2\times50$, we have $f(100)=2f(50)+1$.
Now, we need to find $f(50)$.
Applying the same equation with $50=2\times25$, we have $f(50)=2f(25)+1$.
Next, we need to find $f(25)$.
Since $25=5\times5$, we can apply the equation to get $f(25)=f(f(5))$.
Applying the equation again with $5=f(f(1))$, we have $f(25)=f(f(f(1)))$.
Now, we can substitute the first equation to get $f(25)=8\times1-7=1$.
Now, substituting $f(25)=1$ into the equation $f(50)=2f(25)+1$, we get $f(50)=2\times1+1=3$.
Finally, substituting $f(50)=3$ into the equation $f(100)=2f(50)+1$, we get $f(100)=2\times3+1=7$.
So, $f(100)=7$.
The answer is $\boxed{7}$.

Question (hint: positive numerical answer):
"A function $f: \mathbb N \to \mathbb N$ satisfies the following two conditions for all positive integers $n$:$f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$ and $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$. Calculate $f(100)$."
Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:


For $n = 1,$ we have that $f(f(f(1)))=8(1)-7 = -5.$ But $f(f(f(1)))$ must be a nonnegative integer, so that implies $f(1) = 1,$ because the only value that would make -5 a nonnegative integer is when $f(1) = 1.$

Then for $n=2,$ we know that $f(f(f(2)))=8(2)-7 = 9,$ but substituting in $f(2n) = 2f(n)+1,$ we can find $f(f(f(2)))=f(f(4))=2f(2)+1.$ If we know $f(2),$ we can then find $f(4).$

And because if we know $f(4)$ , we can then find $f(f(4))$ because of the first given equation, and that would let us check if $f(f(4))$ indeed equals 9.

Let's try it out:

With $f(2n) = 2f(n)+1,$ we have $f(4) = 2f(2)+1,$ but wait, if we substitute $n=1$ into $f(2n) = 2f(n)+1,$ we obtain $$f(2) = 2f(1)+1 = 2(1)+1=3,$$and thus $$f(4) = 2(3)+1 = 7.$$Now $f(f(4))=f(7),$ from $f(f(f(2)))=9$ we can get \[f(7)=8(1)-7=1.\]But $f(7)$ can not equal 1.

The value of $f(2)$ we got in the middle of the steps above, turns out to be incorrect. To correct this, we go back to $f(f(f(2)))=f(f(4))=2f(2)+1=9,$ we use $f(4) = 2f(2),$ but this time use $f(2) = 2f(1)+1=2(1)+1=3$ (from the updated step), we get
\[f(f(4))=f(f(7))=2(3)+1=7.\]It implies that $f(7) = 8(2)-7=9$. However, this makes $f(f(7))=f(9)=8(3)-7=17$, and after three rounds of $f$ we get a value (17), which is not in the form of $8n-7$. The value we got for $f(2)$ is incorrect.

To correct this, we use the following equation: $f(2n) = 2f(n)+1,$ replacing $n$ with $\frac{2}{2}=1$, gives $f(2)=2f(1)+1=2(1)+1=3$, a value that is too big, but by how much?

From the given $f(f(f(n)))=8n-7,$ putting $n = 1,$ we get $f(f(f(1)))=8(1)-7 = 1.$ That means $f(1) = 1.$ So we should go back, correct the mistake and try again.

Now we know $f(1) = 1.$ Then we can correctly find
\[f(2) = 2f(1)+1 = 2(1) + 1= 3.\]Now we put $n = 2$ again into $f(2n) = 2f(n)+1,$ but this time with the corrected value for $f(2)$, and get
\[f(4) = 2f(2)+1 = 2(3)+1 = 7.\]Now go back and check if $f(f(4))=9$:
\[f(f(4))=f(7)=8(1)-7=1.\]As expected, this does not equal 9. The only way to adjust our work to find $f(2)$ and $f(4)$ correctly is to change the value of $f(1)$. We assume $f(1)=1$ first, but then changed it to $f(1) = 2,$ because that seemed necessary when we calculated $f(4)$ in the previous steps.

Actually, the value of $f(1)$ did not need to change. Our mistake was in the calculations above in the case where $n=1$. We tried to make $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$ to match $f(f(f(1)))=1$, but what actually fit this is:
\[f(2) = 2f(1)+1 = 2(1)+1=3.\]This was wrong -- it should instead be
\[f(2) = 2f(1)-1 = 2(1)-1 = 1.\]We changed the plus in $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$ to a minus! So we'd better correct our steps accordingly:

Substitute $f(1) = 1$ into $f(2n) = 2f(n)-1,$ we can obtain that \[f(2) = 2(1)-1 = 1.\]Substitute $f(2)$ into $f(4)=2f(2)-1,$ we get \[f(4) = 2(1)-1 = 1.\]So we get $f(1) = 1, f(2) = 1$ and $f(4) = 1$. Putting these together in the equation $f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$, when $n=1,2,4$, you can easily verify they work.

Therefore, $f(1) = 1, f(2) = 1, f(3)$ we get from $f(2n)=2f(n)-1$, and so $f(3)=2(1)-1=1$. For $n=4,$ you can check yourself that $f(4)=1.$ By induction (on $n$), it is easy to see that $f(n) = 1$ for all $n$.

This actually works: for any $n,$ $f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$ becomes \[f(f(f(n)))=f(f(n))=f(n)=8n-7,\]because both $f(n) = 1$ for all $n$ from our calculation and $f(f(n))=f(n)=1$ from $f(2n) = 2f(n)-1.$

Putting it all together for $n=100$, $f(100) = 1.$ The answer is: $1$

Question (hint: positive numerical answer):
"A function $f: \mathbb N \to \mathbb N$ satisfies the following two conditions for all positive integers $n$:$f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$ and $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$. Calculate $f(100)$."
Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:


First, let's try to find $f(1)$. Using the second equation, we have $f(2 \cdot 1) = 2f(1) + 1$, so $f(2) = 2f(1) + 1$. But we also know that $f(f(f(1))) = 8 \cdot 1 - 7 = 1$, and since $f(f(f(1))) = f(f(2)) = f(2f(1) + 1) = 1$, we must have $f(2) = 2f(1) + 1 = 1$, so $f(1) = 0$.
Now, let's find $f(2)$. Using the second equation, we have $f(2 \cdot 2) = 2f(2) + 1$, so $f(4) = 2f(2) + 1 = 2(1) + 1 = 3$. But we also know that $f(f(f(2))) = 8 \cdot 2 - 7 = 9$, and since $f(f(f(2))) = f(f(4)) = f(3)$, we must have $f(3) = 9$.
Continuing in this manner, we can find that $f(3) = 9$, $f(2) = 1$, and $f(1) = 0$.
Now let's try to find $f(100)$ using the given equations and already known values of $f(1)$, $f(2)$, and $f(3)$. We have:
$f(200) = 2f(100) + 1$ (from the second equation)
$f(100) = f(f(f(100))) = 8 \cdot 100 - 7 = 793$. Substituting this into the first equation gives:
$f(200) = 2 \cdot 793 + 1 = 1587$. Substituting this into the second equation gives:
$f(100) = f(1587) = f(f(f(1587))) = 8 \cdot 1587 - 7 = 12695$.
However, this doesn't match the pattern we've observed, so we must have made a mistake somewhere.
Indeed, we made an error in the calculation. Let's try again:
$f(200) = 2f(100) + 1$. But we know from the second equation that $f(2n) = 2f(n) + 1$, so: $2f(100) + 1 = 2(8 \cdot 100 - 7) + 1 = 2(793) + 1 = 1587$. Using this value in the first equation again, we get $f(200) = 2(1587) + 1 = 3175$. Substituting this into the second equation gives:
$f(100) = f(3175) = f(f(f(3175))) = 8 \cdot 3175 - 7 = 25393$.
Finally, substituting this back into the second equation gives:
$f(200) = 2f(100) + 1 = 2(25393) + 1 = 50787$. But we know $f(200)$ cannot be greater than $100$ by the domain of our function, so we have made another mistake.
The mistake comes from the third equation, $f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$. We must have used the wrong number here.
Let's reconsider the values we have calculated:
$f(1) = 0, f(2) = 1, f(3) = 9$, and $f(100) = 25393$, but when we substitute this into the third equation:
$f(f(f(100))) = f(f(25393)) = f(?) = 8 \cdot 100 - 7 = 793$. Now we need to find the value $n$ such that $f(n) = 25393$. Trial and error, or knowing that our function $f$ must be a bijection (a one-to-one and onto function), indicates that no such $n$ exists. Instead, we must find another equation.
Let's go back to the original problem:
Since $f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$ and $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$ are equivalent statements for $f: \mathbb N \to \mathbb N$. Combining these we get: $f(f(f(2f(n)+1)))=8(2f(n)+1)-7$. After much manipulation we deduce $f(f(2f(n)+1))=f(8f(n)+3)$. This makes sense since if $f(k)=m$, then looking at the function as $f(f(f^{-1}(m)))=8f^{-1}(m)-7$, $f(2m+1)=8f^{-1}(m)-7+1$.
Applying the second equation and the new one derived above to $f(2 \cdot 100) = 2f(100) + 1$, we have $f(200) = 2f(100) + 1$ and $f(2f(100)+1)=f(8f(100)+3)$. Therefore $f(2 \cdot 25393 + 1)=f(8 \cdot 25393 + 3)$, giving
$f(50787)=f(203151)$. Since $f(50787)$ is an input and $f(203151)$ is the corresponding output, they must be equal if $f$ is an actual function. Now set these equal to each other and solve:
$f(n) = 50787$ when $8n - 7 = 203151$, meaning $8n = 203158$, thus $n = 25394.75$. But as mentioned previously, this obviously can't be a correct value for $n$. 
We need another idea. From previous results, since $f(f(f(2 \cdot n)) = 8 \cdot 2n - 7 = 16n - 7$, then let's set $m = f(f(n))$, then $f(m) = 8n - 7$. Writing instead with $n$, we have that $f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$, then if we apply the second function on both sides, $f(2f(f(n

Question (hint: positive numerical answer):
"A function $f: \mathbb N \to \mathbb N$ satisfies the following two conditions for all positive integers $n$:$f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$ and $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$. Calculate $f(100)$."
Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:


We have two equations here:
1) $f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$
2) $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$

Let's first plug in $n=1$ into the second equation to find $f(2)$:
$f(2)=2f(1)+1$. From this equation, we won't be able to find $f(1)$ directly using only the given equations. But we notice a hint in the first equation, namely $f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$. If we assume that $f(1)=1$ just for a moment and see if it leads to a sensible solution, we have:
$f(f(f(1)))=f(f(1))=f(1)=1$ for LHS of the first equation, whilst for RHS:
$8*1 - 7=1$.
Therefore, assuming $f(1)=1$, fulfills the first requirement. Now let's test $f(2)$:
$f(2*1)=2f(1)+1$ which leads to $f(2)=2*1+1=3$ upon substituting $f(1)=1$. Using this value, we find,
$f(f(f(2)))=f(f(3))=f(5)$ and from the first equation, $f(5)=8*2-7=9$, but that would mean $f(3) = 5$, and since $f(2)=3$ and $f(1)=1$ then $f(3)=2*1+1=3$ which is a contradiciton to $f(3)=5$. So $f(1)=1$ is not a legitimate solution and thus we now assume another value such that $f(1)=2$. With this updated assumption $f(1)=2$ let's evaluate $f(2)$ using second equation $f(2*1)=2f(1)+1$, we get $f(2)=2*2+1=5$. Now use these values to find $f(3)$:
$f(2*1.5)=2f(.5)+1$, but $2f(.5)$ is undefined since $f$ only accepts positive integers.
Looking at the equation 2) again but with integer values we can say that we can't have an equation that depends on half of $n$. So this way seems fruitless to solve it directly but we can look at this equation from another perspective. We observed an interesting property that when $n=1$, $f(1)=1$ it doesn't hold true, and we assumed it to equal two to get it right for $f(2)$ by using the function $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$. Let's try applying the same tactic to $n=2$ by assuming that $f(2)=2$, then we substitute in the 2nd equation and solve for $f(4)$:
$$f(2 \cdot 2)=2f(2)+1=2(2)+1=5 .$$
Now we need to use the first main equation: $f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$ with $n=2$ and see if it holds true when $f(2)=4$.

$$f(f(f(2)))=8 \cdot2 -7=9.$$ With $f(2)=4$, $f(f(2))=f(4)=5$, which fulfills it because $$f(f(2))=f(4)=5$$, and for the second condition
$$f(f(4))=f(5)=9$$ and using $f(2n) = 2f(n)+1$, then: $$f(10)=2f(5)+1=19.$$But this cannot be because $f(10)$ by this logic is equal to $2f(5)+1 = 2(9)+1 = 19$ which is equal to $f(10)$. And by symmetry $f(5) = 9$, but this contradicts what we found that $f(5)= 5$. Hence assuming that $f(2)=4$ is a false statement. Then only choice left for $f(2)$ is that it equals to 5; i.e. $f(2)=5$.
Now let's follow the same procedure for $n=3$. With $f(3)=3$, we use the second equation to find:
$$f(2 \cdot 3)=2f(3)+1 \Rightarrow f(6)=2 \cdot 3+ 1=7.$$ From this we see that $f(f(3))=f(3)=3$:
$$f(f(3))=f(3)=3.$$ Now we will test the values in the first given equation for the validity:
$f(f(f(3)))=f(f(3))=f(3)=3$ whilst for RHS:
$8 \cdot 3 - 7=19.$ This shows that the $f(3)$cannot equal to $3$, thus disproving our assumption that $f(3)=3$. Then testing a possible integer for $f(3)$, we let $f(3)=5$:
$$f(f(3))=f(5).$$ The first equation reads:
$$f(f(3))=f(5)=5.$$
And for RHS: $8 \cdot 3 - 7=19,$ clearly equal, proving this to be valid: $f(5) = 9$. Now we move on to the next integer value of $n$ which is $n=4$. Now since $f(6) = 7$, then $f(3) =5$, in accordance to $f(2n) = 2f(n)+1$.
Using $f(2n) = 2f(n)+1$ again for $f(4)$:
$$f(2 \cdot 2)=2f(2)+1 \Rightarrow f(4)=2f(2)+ 1.$$ Since we already found that $f(2) =5$, then:
$$f(4)=2 \cdot (5) + 1 = 11.$$ Again using the first equation $f(f(4))=f(11)$ and then for the check, the first equation with $n=4$: $f(f(4))=f(11)$
$8 \cdot 4-7 = 27.$ By now having the values for $f(2)$ and $f(4)$:
$f(2) = 5$ and $f(4) = 11$, we apply the second equation to find $f(8)$. For this purpose, use:
$$f(2 \cdot 4)=2f(4)+ 1 \Rightarrow f(8)=2 \cdot (11)+ 1 = 23.$$ The first equation gives: $f(f(8))=f(23)$. For checking we have $8 \cdot 8-7 = 59$. We now calculate the values for $f(5)$ and $f(10)$: Since we know $f(6) = 7$, and with function $f(2n) = 2f(n)+

Question (hint: positive numerical answer):
"A function $f: \mathbb N \to \mathbb N$ satisfies the following two conditions for all positive integers $n$:$f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$ and $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$. Calculate $f(100)$."
Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:



First, let's compute the first few values of the function $f$ starting from $f(1)$.
From the second condition we know that $f(2) = 2f(1) + 1$.
To find $f(1)$, we apply the first condition when $n=1$ and plug in the expression we got for $f(2)$:
$f(f(f(1))) = 8(1) - 7$.
But we also know from the second condition that $f(f(1)) = 2f(1) + 1$.
So we get $f(2f(1) + 1) = 1$.
And then applying the second condition again we get $f(2) = 2f(f(1)) + 1$.
Using the result for $f(2)$, we get $2f(1) + 1 = 2(2f(1) + 1) + 1$.
Simplifying we get $2f(1) + 1 = 4f(1) + 3$.
Rearranging we get $2f(1) = 2$ so $f(1) = 1$.
Now we plug $f(1) = 1$ back into the expression for $f(2)$:
$f(2) = 2(1) + 1 = 3$.

With $f(1) = 1$ and $f(2) = 3$, we can compute $f(3)$ using the second condition:
$f(2(1)) = 2f(1) + 1 \implies f(3) = 2(1) + 1 = 3$.
But we also have $f(f(f(1)) = 8(1) - 7 \implies f(3) = 1$.
Since we get two different values for $f(3)$, we must have made a mistake somewhere.
We need to re-examine our work to identify what went wrong.

While re-examining the original problem again, we notice that the second condition includes $2f(n)+1$. That means the argument inside the function, $f()$, must be odd for it to work. Let's assume the function $f()$ keeps the parity of its argument, meaning odd will always become odd, and even will always become even. Let's test the first condition for the values of $f(3)$ we found:
With $f(3) = 1$, we have $f(f(f(1))) = f(f(3)) = f(1) = 1$ and $8(1) - 7 = 1$, satisfying the condition.
With $f(3) = 3$, we have $f(f(f(1))) = f(f(3)) = f(3) = 3$, and $8(1) - 7 = 1$, which does not satisfy the condition. So we conclude that $f(3) = 1$.
Using this assumption, and continuing to compute some more values, we find:
$f(4) = f(2(2)) = 2f(2) + 1 = 2(3) + 1 = 7$.
$f(5) = f(f(f(3))) = f(f(1)) = f(1) = 1$.
$f(6) = f(2(3)) = 2f(3) + 1 = 2(1) + 1 = 3$.
These values agree with the first condition when $n=3$, so our assumption that the function keeps the parity of its argument is correct.

Now we need to find the value of $f(100)$.
We can observe a pattern based on the first few computed values:
$f(1) = 1$
$f(2) = 3$
$f(3) = 1$
$f(4) = 7$
$f(5) = 1$
$f(6) = 3$
And so on. It seems like the function $f$ takes on the values $1, 3, 1, 7, 1, 3, 1, 15, 1, 3, 1, 7, \ldots$ in a cycle of length $4$.
To find $f(100)$, we divide $100$ by $4$ and find the remainder.
$100 \div 4 = 25$ with a remainder of $0$. So $f(100)$ is the same as $f(4)$ in the pattern, which is $7$.
The value of $f(100)$ is $7$.
The answer is: $7$

"A function $f: \mathbb N \to \mathbb N$ satisfies the following two conditions for all positive integers $n$:$f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$ and $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$. Calculate $f(100)$."
Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:


We know that $f(f(f(100)))=8(100)-7=793$. We want to find an $x$ such that $f(x) = 100$.
Since we know $f(f(f(100)))=793$, we can substitute $x$ into the equation to find $f(f(x)) = 793$.
Using the second equation, $f(2x)=2f(x)+1$, we can set $2x = f(x)$, so $x = \frac{f(x)}{2}$.
Substitute $x = \frac{f(x)}{2}$ into $f(f(x)) = 793$ to get
\[f\left(f\left(\frac{f(x)}{2}\right)\right) = 793.\]From $f(f(f(100)))=793$, we know that
\[f\left(f\left(\frac{f(100)}{2}\right)\right) = 793,\]so $\frac{f(100)}{2} = 100$, which implies $f(100) = \boxed{200}$. The answer is $\boxed{200}$

Question (hint: positive numerical answer):
"A function $f: \mathbb N \to \mathbb N$ satisfies the following two conditions for all positive integers $n$:$f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$ and $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$. Calculate $f(100)$."
Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:


First, we can calculate $f(1)$ by substituting $n = 1$ into the equation $f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$:
$$f(f(f(1))) = 8(1) - 7 \implies f(f(f(1))) = 1.$$ 
Now, since $f(f(f(1))) = 1$, then by substituting $f(1)$ in the equation $f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$ for $n = 1$, we get $f(f(f(1))) = f(f(1)) = 1$. Again, substituting $f(1)$ in the equation $f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$ for $n = f(1) = 1$, we obtain $f(f(f(f(1)))) = f(1) = 1$. In fact, we can continue this substitution process for any positive integer $k$, and we always get $f(f(f(k))) = 1$. Hence, we have
\[f(f(f(n))) = 1 \qquad \text{for all } n \in \mathbb{N}.\]
Then from the given equation $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$, we have:
\[f(2) = 2f(1) + 1 = 2(1) + 1 = 3,\]
and
\[f(4) = 2f(2) + 1 = 2(3) + 1 = 7.\]
And further calculating, we get $f(8) = 2f(4) + 1 = 2(7) + 1 = 15$, and so forth. 

Notice that the values of $f(2^k)$ form the sequence $1,3,7,15,\cdots$. And indeed, this is the sequence of the odd positive numbers. Because when we calculate recursively: $f(1) = 1$, $f(2)=2f(1)+1=3$, $f(4)=2f(2)+1=7$, $f(8)=2f(4)+1=15$, and so on, we find a pattern where $f(2^k)$ follows the sequence of odd numbers beginning with 1, and $f(2^{k+1}) = 2f(2^k) + 1$.

Therefore, if $n = 2^k \cdot m$, where $m$ is an odd number, by the function's property of linearity, we could obtain $f(n) = 2^{k-1} \cdot m + 1$. Now we know
\[f(100) = f(2^2 \cdot 25) = 2^{2-1} \cdot 25 + 1 = 25 + 1 = 26.\]
Thus, $f(100) = 26$.
The answer is: $26$

Step-by-step Solution:


The function $f$ is defined on the set of positive integers $\mathbb N$ and maps to $\mathbb N$ as well. 
We are given two conditions that describe the function: $f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$ and $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$.
We want to find the value of $f(100)$.
By the second condition, we have $f(2\cdot50) = 2f(50) + 1$. 
Since we know $f(100)$, we can use the first condition to relate this to $f(50)$ and $f(25)$:
$$f(f(f(50))) = 8\cdot50 - 7 = 393.$$ 
If we substitute $f(100)$ for $f(f(f(50)))$, we have 
$$f(f(f(50))) = f(f(100)) = 393.$$
Continuing to substitute:
$$f(f(100)) = f(2f(50)+1).$$
Now we have
$$393 = f(2f(50)+1).$$
By the second condition again with $n = 50$, we have
$$f(2\cdot50) = 2f(50)+1.$$ This gives us
$$f(100) = 2f(50) + 1.$$
So we can substitute this into the equation $393 = f(2f(50)+1)$:
$$393 = f(2f(50)+1)= f(f(100)) = f(2f(50)+1).$$
This simplifies to:
$$393 = 8f(50) - 7.$$
To continue, we can express $f(50)$ in terms of $f(25)$:
$$f(50) = 2f(25)+1.$$
Plugging that into the equation, we have
$$393 = 8(2f(25)+1) - 7$$ which simplifies to
$$393 = 16f(25) + 8 - 7$$ further simplifying to
$$393 = 16f(25) + 1.$$
Therefore $16f(25) = 392$  and so $$f(25) = \frac{392}{16} = 24.5.$$ This is a contradiction since $f(25)$ must be a natural number, so there was a mistake in our reasoning somewhere.
By rereading the question, we realize that our mistake was confusing the conditions $f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$ and $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$. Let's focus on the first condition $f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$. 
Setting $n=50$, we obtain $f(f(f(50)))=8 \cdot 50 - 7=393$. This implies that $f(f(50))=50$ since there is no $n$ such that $f(n)=393$. Similarly, by setting $n=25$, we have $f(f(f(25)))=8 \cdot 25 - 7=193$, and therefore, $f(f(25))=25$ since there is no $n$ such that $f(n)=193$.
Now we can easily see that $f(50)=25$ from the condition $f(f(25))=25$. Also, if we substitute $f(50)=25$ into the equation $f(100) = 2f(50) + 1$, we have $f(100)=2\cdot25+1=51$. 
Finally, by substituting $f(100)=51$ into the equation $f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$, we can check that $f(f(f(100)))=8 \cdot 100 - 7=793$, which does not equal to 51. So our calculations are incorrect again.
However, we overlooked the condition $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$. If we apply this condition successively, we have
\[f(2 \cdot 50) = 2f(50) + 1 \Rightarrow f(100) = 2f(50) + 1, \]
\[f(2 \cdot 25) = 2f(25) + 1 \Rightarrow f(50) = 2f(25) + 1. \]
By substituting $f(50)=25$ into $f(100) = 2f(50) + 1$, we obtain $f(100)=2\cdot25+1=51$, which satisfies the first condition $f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$. Therefore, $f(100) = 51$ indeed holds.
The solution is $f(100) = 51$. The answer is: $51$

Question (hint: positive numerical answer):
"A function $f: \mathbb N \to \mathbb N$ satisfies the following two conditions for all positive integers $n$:$f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$ and $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$. Calculate $f(100)$."
Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:


To solve this problem, we will first need to use the second given equation to find an expression for $f(f(n))$.
Using the second equation, we have $f(2n) = 2f(n) + 1$. Let $n = f(k)$ for some $k$, then this implies that $f(2f(k)) = 2f(f(k)) + 1$.
We can substitute this into the first given equation, we have $f(f(f(n))) = f(f(2f(k))) = 2f(f(f(k))) + 1 = 8n - 7$.
This means that $2f(f(f(k))) = 8f(k) - 6$. 

Now we can substitute $f(f(k)) = m$, so we get $2m = 8f(k) - 6$.
Simplify this we have $m = 4f(k) - 3$. 
So the expression for $f(f(n))$ is $f(f(n)) = 4n - 3$.
Now we can use this expression to find the value of $f(100)$. 
We have $f(f(100)) = 4*100 - 3 = 397$. 
Then substitute $n=100$ into the first given equation: $f(f(f(100))) = f(397) = 8*100 - 7 = 793$.
But we also know that $f(f(f(100))) = 793$, so we have $f(397) = 793$.
Hence $f(100) = 397$. 

The answer is: $397$.
The value of f(100) is 397. The answer is: $\boxed{397}$.

"A function $f: \mathbb N \to \mathbb N$ satisfies the following two conditions for all positive integers $n$:$f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$ and $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$. Calculate $f(100)$."
Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:


We have two equations:
$$f(f(f(n)))=8n-7,$$ and
$$f(2n)=2f(n)+1.$$
To find $f(100)$, we need to substitute $n=50$ into the second equation because $2 \cdot 50 = 100$. So we get
$$f(100) = 2f(50) + 1.$$
Now, let's substitute $f(100)$ into the first equation. We get
$$f(f(f(100)))=8 \cdot 100 - 7 = 793.$$
Substituting $f(100) = 2f(50) + 1$ into this equation, we get
$$f(f(f(2f(50) + 1)))=793.$$
And, since $f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$, we have
$$8(2f(50) + 1) - 7 = 793.$$
Simplifying, we get
$$16f(50) + 8 - 7 = 793,$$
$$16f(50) + 1 = 793,$$
$$16f(50) = 792,$$
$$f(50) = \frac{792}{16} = 49.5.$$
But $f(50)$ should be a natural number, this contradiction indicates that we have made a mistake.
However, since the second equation given in the problem is very simple and straightforward, and we didn't use it cleverly, it might be a sign that we need to change our approach.


Notice that in the first equation, $f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$, the result is very close to an expression of the form $f(something) = n$, which is exactly what we want to find in order to get $f(100)$.
So let's try to find a number $n$ such that $f(n)=50$. From the first equation, we get
$$f(f(50)) = 8\cdot 50 - 7 = 393.$$
Substituting $n = 50$ into the second equation, we get
$$f(100) = 2f(50) + 1 = 2\cdot 50 + 1 = 101.$$
But $f(f(50)) = 393$, and according to our work above, $f(f(50))$ should equal 50. This results in another contradiction.

However, we made an error when we substituted $f(100) = 2f(50) + 1$ into the first equation. If we instead substitute $n = f(50) = 50$, the first equation gives us $f(f(f(50)))=8 \cdot f(50) - 7 = 8 \cdot 50 - 7 = 393$, which matches the value we calculated earlier.

So going back to the equation $f(f(50)) = 50$, we substitute $n = 50$ into the second equation to get
$$f(100) = 2f(50) + 1 = 2 \cdot 50 + 1 = 101.$$
Thus, $f(100) = 101$.
Therefore, the value of $f(100)$ is 101.
The answer is $\boxed{101}$.
