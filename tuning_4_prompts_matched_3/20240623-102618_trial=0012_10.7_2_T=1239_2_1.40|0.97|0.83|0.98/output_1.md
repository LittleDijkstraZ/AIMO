Question (hint: positive numerical answer):
"What is the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ when $x$ and $y$ range over all real numbers such that $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$?"
Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:


To maximize the value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$, we need to find the relationship between $x$ and $y$ from the given equation $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$ and then substitute that relationship into the expression $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$.

First, let's simplify the equation:

$|x-2y| + |y-2x| = |x-2y| + |2y-x| = 40$, so we have $2|x-2y| = 40$.

Divide both sides of the equation by 2 to get $|x-2y| = 20$.

Then we know $x - 2y = \pm20$ because the absolute value equals to a non-negative number. 

Next, we have to solve the two equations: $x - 2y = 20$ and $x - 2y = -20$ for $y$. 

Solve $x - 2y = 20$ for $y$ to get: $y = \frac{x-20}{2}$.

Solve $x - 2y = -20$ for $y$ to get: $y = \frac{x+20}{2}$.

Now we need to substitute these expressions for $y$ into the expression $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ to find the minimum value.

Case 1: When $y = \frac{x-20}{2}$:

Let's substitute this into $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ to get:

$5x^2 + 5(\frac{x-20}{2})^2 - 8x*\frac{x-20}{2}$.

Simplify this to get:

$5x^2 + \frac{5}{4}(x^2 - 40x + 400) - 4x^2 + 40x$,

$5x^2 + \frac{5x^2}{4} - 50x + 500 - 4x^2 + 40x$,

$\frac{x^2}{4} - 10x + 500$.

Let $f(x) = \frac{x^2}{4} - 10x + 500$, then $f'(x) = \frac{x}{2} - 10$.

Setting $f'(x)$ to 0, we can solve for $x$: $\frac{x}{2} - 10 = 0$, then $x = 20$.

This gives us the minimum value of $f(x)$ at $x = 20$: $f(20) = \frac{20^2}{4} - 10*20 + 500 = 100 - 200 + 500 = 400$.

Case 2: When $y = \frac{x+20}{2}$:

Do the same as above, you will get a similar function in the end of the day. It will result in the same minimum value which is $400$.

The minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ when $x$ and $y$ range over all real numbers such that $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$ is $400$. So the numerical answer is $400$. 
The answer is $\boxed{400}$.

Question (hint: positive numerical answer):
"What is the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ when $x$ and $y$ range over all real numbers such that $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$?"
Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:


First, note that $|x - 2y| + |y - 2x| = 40$ can be rewritten as $|2y - x| + |2x - y| = 40$ using the property $|a| = |-a|$.
Now, let's rewrite this equation as $f(x, y) = |2y - x| + |2x - y| = 40$.

By the triangle inequality, $|a| + |b| \geq |a + b|$, so we have $f(x, y) = |2y - x| + |2x - y| \geq |(2y - x) + (2x - y)| = |y| = y$ when $y \geq 0$ and $|-y| = y$ when $y < 0$.
Similarly, $f(x, y) = |2y - x| + |2x - y| \geq |(2y - x) - (2x - y)| = |-x| = x$ when $x \geq 0$ and $|-x| = x$ when $x < 0$.
Therefore, $f(x, y) \geq |x| + |y|$. The equation $f(x, y) = 40$ implies that $|x| + |y| = 40$.

Now, consider the expression $5x^2 + 5y^2 - 8xy = (5x^2 - 8xy + 5y^2) = (5x^2 - 10xy + 5y^2) + 2xy = (5(x - y)^2) + 2xy$.
We want to minimize this expression, given the constraint $|x| + |y| = 40$.

By the triangle inequality again, we know that $|x| + |y| \geq |x + y|$. Equality occurs when $x$ and $y$ have the same sign (or one of them is 0), so we take $x$ and $y$ to have the same sign. Now we have $|x + y| = |x| + |y| = 40$.
Setting $z = x + y$, we have $|z| = 40$, so we need to minimize $(5z^2)/4 + 2(z/2)(z/2)$ subject to the condition $z = \pm 40$. Let $A = 5z^2/4$, $B = 2(z/2)(z/2) = z^2/2$, then minimizing $(5z^2)/4 + 2(z/2)(z/2)$ is equivalent to finding the minimum value of $A + B$ subject to $z = \pm 40$.

By the AM-GM inequality, we have $A + B = (5/4)z^2 + (1/2)z^2 = (13/4)z^2 \geq 2\sqrt{(5/4)(1/2)z^4} = z^2$. Equating the first and last term gives equality, so the minimum value is achieved when $z = \pm 40$. Substituting $z = 40$ (or $z = -40$) back into $A + B = (13/4)z^2$, we find the minimum value of $(5z^2)/4 + 2(z/2)(z/2)$ is $(13/4)(40^2) = 1300$.

Therefore, the minimum value of $5x^2 + 5y^2 - 8xy$ is 1300, given the constraint $|x - 2y| + |y - 2x| = 40$. The answer is: $1300$

Question (hint: positive numerical answer):
"What is the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ when $x$ and $y$ range over all real numbers such that $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$?"
Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:


We know that $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$.

Firstly, note that $|x-2y| = |-(2x-y)| = |-1*(2x-y)| = |2x-y|$ by the property of absolute value $|a| = |-a|$. Also, $|y-2x| = |-1*(2y-x)| = |2y-x|$.
Thus the given equation can be written as $|2x-y| + |2y-x| = 40$.

Next, we use the identity $|a| + |b| = |a+b| + |a-b|/2$. By letting $a = 2x-y$ and $b = 2y-x$, we have $|2x-y| + |2y-x| = |(2x-y)+(2y-x)| + |(2x-y)-(2y-x)|/2 = |x| + |-x| = 2|x|$. This means that $2|x| = 40$, and thus $|x| = 20$.

Therefore, $x = 20$ or $x = -20$. When $x=20$, we substitute it into $2y - x = 0$ to solve for $y$, finding $y=10$. When $x=-20$, by the same procedure we can get $y=-10$. So, the possible solutions for the $(x, y)$ pairs are (20, 10) and (-20, -10).

Now, substituting these pair into $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$, we obtain when $(x, y) = (20, 10)$:
\[5*20^2+5*10^2-8*20*10= 2000+500-1600 = 1900.\]
When $(x, y) = (-20, -10)$:
\[5*(-20)^2+5*(-10)^2-8*(-20)*(-10) = 2000+500-1600 = 1900.\]

Therefore, the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ under the constraint of $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$ is $1900$. The answer is: $1900$

Question (hint: positive numerical answer):
"What is the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ when $x$ and $y$ range over all real numbers such that $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$?"
Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:


First, we note that the given condition $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$ can be rewritten as $|x-2y| + |2y-x| = 40$, which means that $|x-2y| = |2y-x|$. Because the absolute value of a number is always nonnegative, we can drop the absolute value signs and write $x-2y = 2y-x$. This simplifies to $x = 2y$.
Now, we substitute $x = 2y$ into the expression $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ to get
$$5(2y)^2 + 5y^2 - 8(2y)(y) = 20y^2 + 5y^2 - 16y^2 = 9y^2.$$
So, the original expression simplifies to $9y^2$, and we are looking for the minimum value of $9y^2$ where $y$ ranges over all real numbers. Since $y^2$ is always nonnegative (since it is the square of a real number), $9y^2$ is always nonnegative as well. The minimum value of $9y^2$ occurs when $y = 0$, in which case $9y^2 = 0$.

Therefore, the minimum value of the expression $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ subject to the condition $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$ is $0$. The answer is: $0$.

Question (hint: positive numerical answer):
"What is the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ when $x$ and $y$ range over all real numbers such that $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$?"
Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:



Firstly, we'll solve the constraint equation $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$ for some value of $x$ and $y$. We can rewrite the constraint equation as $|x-2y| + |2y-x| = 40$. The absolute value function $|a-b|$ is equivalent to $|b-a|$, so we have
\[|x-2y| + |- (x-2y)| = 40 \implies |x-2y| + |x-2y| = 40.\]
This simplifies to $2|x-2y| = 40$ which implies $|x-2y| = 20$. Again, using the definition of absolute value, we've got two possibilities:
\begin{align*}
x-2y &= 20 \quad \text{or} \\
x-2y &= -20.
\end{align*}Now we'll find the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ while considering these cases.

Case 1: $x-2y = 20$. Solving for $x$ we get $x = 2y + 20$. Substituting this into the function gives
\begin{align*}
5(2y+20)^2 + 5y^2 - 8(2y+20)y &= 5(4y^2 + 80y + 400) + 5y^2 - 16y^2 -160y\\
&= 20y^2 + 400y + 2000 + 5y^2 - 16y^2 -160y\\
&= (20 - 16)y^2 + (400 - 160)y + 2000\\
&= 4y^2 + 240y + 2000.
\end{align*}To minimize this expression, we can find its minimum point. Completing the square,
\begin{align*}
4y^2 + 240y + 2000 &= 4(y^2 + 60y) + 2000 \\
&= 4[(y^2 + 60y + 900) - 900] + 2000 \\
&= 4[(y+30)^2 - 900] + 2000 \\
&= 4(y+30)^2 - 3600 + 2000 \\
&= 4(y+30)^2 - 1600.
\end{align*}Since the square of a real number is always nonnegative, $4(y+30)^2 \ge 0$, and thus the minimum value of this expression is $-1600$.

Case 2: $x-2y = -20$. Solving for $x$ gives $x = 2y - 20$, and substituting this into the function gives
\begin{align*}
5(2y-20)^2 + 5y^2 - 8(2y-20)y &= 5(4y^2 - 80y + 400) + 5y^2 - 16y^2 +160y\\
&= 20y^2 - 400y + 2000 + 5y^2 - 16y^2 +160y\\
&= (20 - 16)y^2 - (400 - 160)y + 2000\\
&= 4y^2 - 240y + 2000.
\end{align*}Again, to minimize this expression, we complete the square:
\begin{align*}
4y^2 - 240y + 2000 &= 4(y^2 - 60y) + 2000 \\
&= 4[(y^2 - 60y + 900) - 900] + 2000 \\
&= 4[(y-30)^2 - 900] + 2000 \\
&= 4(y-30)^2 - 3600 + 2000 \\
&= 4(y-30)^2 - 1600.
\end{align*}Therefore, the minimum value is also $-1600$.

Since both cases give the same minimum value of the function, we conclude that the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ when $x$ and $y$ range over all real numbers such that $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$ is $-1600$.

The answer is: $-1600$

Question (hint: positive numerical answer):
"What is the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ when $x$ and $y$ range over all real numbers such that $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$?"
Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:


Since $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$, we can use the Triangle Inequality to get an inequality based on $x$ and $y$. The Triangle Inequality says that $|a| + |b| \geq |a+b|$, so we have $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = |(x-2y) + (y-2x)| = |-x - y| \geq |-3(x+y)| = 3|x+y|$. Hence, $3|x+y| = 40$ and $|x+y| = \frac{40}{3}$.
Now consider the quantity $5x^2+5y^2-8xy = 5(x^2+y^2)-8xy = 5[(x+y)^2 - 2xy] - 8xy = 5(x+y)^2 - 18xy$. We know that $x+y = \pm\frac{40}{3}$.
Substituting $|x+y| = \frac{40}{3}$ gives $18xy = 5\left(\frac{40}{3}\right)^2 - 18xy \Rightarrow xy = \frac{800}{9}$.
Substituting this value of $xy$ back into $5(x+y)^2 - 18xy$ gives the minimum value. 
So, the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ is $5\left(\frac{40}{3}\right)^2 - 18\cdot\frac{800}{9} = \frac{8000}{9} - \frac{14400}{9} = -\frac{6400}{9}$. 
However, this is not the minimum value as it should be non-negative, so there seems to be an error somewhere.
Let's re-examine the given equation $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$. This equation is equal to $|-x + 2y| + |-y + 2x| = 40$. Now we use the property of absolute values $|a| = |-a|$. This gives us $|-x + 2y| + |-y + 2x| = |2y - x| + |2x - y| = 40$. Now this is similar to our previous equation with $x$ and $y$ swapped, therefore if $(x, y)$ is a solution to the original equation, then $(y, x)$ is also a solution.
This observation helps us to restrict our attention to the case where $x \geq y$, because if $x < y$, then $(y, x)$ would be our case, and we'd just get the same minimum value for $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$. 
When $x \geq y$, we have $|x - 2y| = x - 2y$ and $|y - 2x| = -y + 2x$ because $x - 2y \geq 0$ and $y - 2x < 0$. So the equation becomes $(x - 2y) + (-y + 2x) = 40$. Simplifying gives $3x - 3y = 40$, or $x - y = \frac{40}{3}$. 
Now we substitute $x - y = \frac{40}{3}$ into the expression we want to minimize $5x^2+5y^2-8xy = 5(x+y)^2 - 18xy$. 
We already know that $x+y = \frac{40}{3}$, we can square this equation to get $(x+y)^2 = \left(\frac{40}{3}\right)^2 = \frac{1600}{9}$, substitute into the expression to get $5\left(\frac{1600}{9}\right) - 18xy$. 
To get the minimum value, we need to minimize $xy$. This can be done by completing the square in the equation $x - y = \frac{40}{3}$, which gives $x = \frac{40}{3} + y$, and substitue this into the equation $x^2 + y^2 - 8xy = 0$, then we can solve for $xy$ to get $xy = \frac{200}{9}$. 
Hence, the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy = 5\left(\frac{1600}{9}\right) - 18\cdot\frac{200}{9} = \frac{8000}{9} - \frac{3600}{9} = \frac{4400}{9}$. 
This value is non-negative, indicating that our derivation is correct. 
Therefore the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ is $\boxed{\frac{4400}{9}}$.

The answer is: $$\boxed{\frac{4400}{9}}$$

Question (hint: positive numerical answer):
"What is the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ when $x$ and $y$ range over all real numbers such that $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$?"
Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:


First, we solve the constraint equation $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$.
Without loss of generality, assume $x \geq 2y$. Then, we can rewrite the equation as $(x-2y) + (2x-y) = 40$,
which simplifies to $3x-3y = 40$ and $x-y = \frac{40}{3}$. Then, $y = x - \frac{40}{3}$. 
Now, substitute this into the expression $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$:
\begin{align*}
5x^2+5y^2-8xy &= 5x^2+5\left(x - \frac{40}{3}\right)^2 - 8x\left(x - \frac{40}{3}\right) \\
&= 5x^2 + 5 \left(x^2 - \frac{80x}{3} + \frac{1600}{9}\right) - 8x^2 + \frac{320x}{3} \\
&= 5x^2 + 5x^2 - \frac{400x}{3} + \frac{800}{3} - 8x^2 + \frac{320x}{3} \\
&= 2x^2 - \frac{80x}{3} + \frac{800}{3}.
\end{align*}
This expression is a quadratic in $x$, with a leading coefficient of $2 > 0$. 
To find its minimum value, we can take the derivative with respect to $x$, set it equal to zero, 
and solve for $x$:
\[\frac{d}{dx} \left(2x^2 - \frac{80x}{3} + \frac{800}{3}\right) = 4x - \frac{80}{3}.\]
Setting the derivative equal to zero gives us $4x - \frac{80}{3} = 0$, 
which simplifies to $x = \frac{20}{3}$. 
Then, we can substitute this value back into the equation $y = x - \frac{40}{3}$ to find
\[y = \frac{20}{3} - \frac{40}{3} = -\frac{20}{3}.\]
Now, we can substitute $x = \frac{20}{3}$ and $y = -\frac{20}{3}$ back into 
$2x^2 - \frac{80x}{3} + \frac{800}{3}$ to find that the minimum value is
\[2\left(\frac{20}{3}\right)^2 - \frac{80}{3}\cdot \frac{20}{3} + \frac{800}{3} = \frac{800}{9} - \frac{1600}{9} + \frac{800}{3} = 0.\]
Therefore, the minimum value is $\boxed{0}$. The answer is: 0

"What is the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ when $x$ and $y$ range over all real numbers such that $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$?"
Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:


By the triangle inequality,
\begin{align*}
|x - 2y| + |y - 2x| &= |x - 2y| + |2x - y| \\
&\ge |(x - 2y) + (2x - y)| \\
&= |3x - 3y| = 3|x - y| = 40.
\end{align*}Therefore, $|x - y| = \frac{40}{3}$.
Now substitute $y = x + \frac{40}{3}$ or $y = x - \frac{40}{3}$ into $5x^2 + 5y^2 - 8xy$, we get
\begin{align*}
5x^2 + 5\left(x + \frac{40}{3}\right)^2 - 8x\left(x + \frac{40}{3}\right) &= -\frac{800}{3}, \\
5x^2 + 5\left(x - \frac{40}{3}\right)^2 - 8x\left(x - \frac{40}{3}\right) &= -\frac{800}{3}.
\end{align*}Therefore, the minimum value of $5x^2 + 5y^2 - 8xy$ when $|x - 2y| + |y - 2x| = 40$ is $-\frac{800}{3}$. The answer is: $-\frac{800}{3}$

Question (hint: positive numerical answer):
"What is the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ when $x$ and $y$ range over all real numbers such that $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$?"
Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:


We can rewrite the constraint as $|x-2y| + |-y+2x| = 40$ and using the properties of absolute value, we have $|x-2y| + |2x-y| = 40$.
Using the definition of absolute value, we split each into two cases:
Case 1: $x-2y \ge 0$ and $2x-y \ge 0$. In this case, we have $x-2y + 2x-y = 40 \implies 3x-3y = 40 \implies x-y = \frac{40}{3}$.
Case 2: $x-2y < 0$ and $2x-y < 0$. In this case, we have $-(x-2y) - (2x-y) = 40 \implies -x+2y -2x+y = 40 \implies -3x + 3y = 40 \implies x-y = -\frac{40}{3}$.
The two cases lead to a contradiction because $x-y$ cannot both be equal to $\frac{40}{3}$ and $-\frac{40}{3}$ at the same time. Therefore, there must be another combination of cases to consider.
Let's consider cases where exactly one of the expressions inside the absolute value is negative:
Case 3: $x-2y \ge 0$ and $2x-y < 0$. In this case, we have $x-2y - (2x-y) = 40 \implies -x+y = 40 \implies y = x+40$.
Case 4: $x-2y < 0$ and $2x-y \ge 0$. In this case, we have $-(x-2y) + 2x-y = 40 \implies x-2y + 2x-y = 40 \implies 3x-3y = 40 \implies y = x-\frac{40}{3}$.
Substituting either $y = x+40$ or $y = x-\frac{40}{3}$ into the expression $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$, we have:
\[5x^2+5(x\pm40)^2-8x(x\pm40).\]
Expanding and simplifying, we get:
\[5x^2+5x^2\pm400x+8000-8x^2\mp320x = 2x^2\pm120x+8000.\]
Completing the square, we have:
\[2(x^2\mp60x+900)+8000-1800 = 2(x-30)^2 + 6200.\]
The minimum value of $2(x-30)^2 + 6200$ is achieved when $(x-30)^2 = 0$, which means $x=30$.
Substituting $x=30$ back into either $y = x+40$ or $y = x-\frac{40}{3}$, we find $y = 70$ or $y = 10$, respectively.
However, only $y=10$ satisfies the constraint $|x-2y| + |2x-y| = 40$ with $x=30$.
So the minimum value of the expression $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ given the constraint is:
\[2(30-30)^2 + 6200 = 6200.\]
Therefore, the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ given the constraint is 6200. The answer is:
$\boxed{6200}$.

Question (hint: positive numerical answer):
"What is the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ when $x$ and $y$ range over all real numbers such that $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$?"
Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:


First, let's rewrite the equation $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$ as $|2y-x| + |2x-y| = 40$.
By the triangle inequality, we have $|2y-x| + |2x-y| \ge |(2y-x) - (2x-y)| = |y-3x|$, so $|y-3x| = 40$.
Let $u = x - 2y$, then $y - 2x = -u$, we have $|y-2x| = |-u| = |u|$. So the equation becomes $|2y-x| + |2x-y| = |u| + |-u| = 2|u| = 40$, thus $|u| = 20$. This gives us $u = \pm 20$ which leads to two systems of equations:
Case 1: $u = x - 2y = 20$. Then we have the system of equations:
$x - 2y = 20$,
$y - 2x = -20$.
Adding these two equations together gives $-3x = 0$, which implies $x = 0$. Substituting $x = 0$ into the first equation of the system gives $y = -10$.

Case 2: $u = x - 2y = -20$. Then we have the system of equations:
$x - 2y = -20$,
$y - 2x = 20$.
Adding these two equations together gives $-3x = 0$, which implies $x = 0$. Substituting $x = 0$ into the first equation of the system gives $y = 10$.

So we have found two points $(x, y) = (0, -10)$ and $(0, 10)$ that satisfy the original equation. Now we substitute these points into $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$:
For $(0, -10)$, we get $5(0)^2 + 5(-10)^2 - 8(0)(-10) = 500$.
For $(0, 10)$, we get $5(0)^2 + 5(10)^2 - 8(0)(10) = 500$.
So in both cases, the value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ is 500. Therefore, the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ is 500 when $(x, y)$ satisfies $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$. The answer is: $500$

"What is the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ when $x$ and $y$ range over all real numbers such that $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$?"
Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:


First, we note that $|x-2y| + |y-2x|$ can be rewritten as $|x-2y| + |2y-x|$ using the property $|a| = |-a|$.
We know that $|a| + |b|$ is minimized when $a$ and $b$ have the same sign. So we have:
\[|x-2y| + |2y-x| = (x-2y) + (2y-x) = 0.\]
This means that $x=2y$.
Now we can substitute $x=2y$ into the expression $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$:
\[5(2y)^2+5y^2-8(2y)(y) = 20y^2+5y^2-16y^2 = 9y^2.\]
This expression is minimized when $y=0$, so the minimum value is $9(0)^2 = 0$. However, this would make $x=2y=0$, which does not satisfy $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$.
Let's try another approach.
We rewrite the given equation as $|x-2y| = 40 - |y-2x|$. Since the absolute values on both sides are equal, the expressions inside the absolute values must be equal or negatives of each other:
\[(x-2y) = 40 - (y-2x) \quad \text{or} \quad (x-2y) = -(40 - (y-2x)).\]
Solving the first equation gives:
\[x-2y = 40 - y + 2x \implies y = 40.\]
This makes $x = 2y = 80$. However, this solution does not satisfy the given equation $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$.
Solving the second equation gives:
\[x-2y = y-2x - 40 \implies 3x = 3y - 40 \implies x = y - \frac{40}{3}.\]
Substituting this into the given equation gives:
\[|y - \frac{40}{3} - 2y| + |2y - y + \frac{40}{3}| = 40.\]
Simplifying, we get:
\[\left|\frac{40}{3} - y\right| + \left|y + \frac{40}{3}\right| = 40.\]
This is a well-known equation which has a unique solution $y=0$. Therefore, $x = 2y = 0$.
So the only solution is $(x, y) = (0, 0)$, but this does not satisfy $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$.
There might be a mistake in our solution. Let's try a different approach.
Consider the expression $f(x, y) = 5x^2+5y^2-8xy = 5(x^2 - \frac{8}{5}xy + y^2) = 5[(x-y)^2 + \frac{3}{5}y^2]$.
By the Trivial Inequality $(a+b)^2 \geq 0$, we have $(x-y)^2 \geq 0$, so $(x-y)^2 + \frac{3}{5}y^2 \geq \frac{3}{5}y^2$. This implies $f(x, y) \geq \frac{3}{5}y^2$.
Since $y^2 \geq 0$, we have $f(x, y) \geq 0$. Therefore, the minimum value of $f(x, y)$ is 0. However, this would imply $(x, y) = (0, 0)$, which does not satisfy $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$.
Let's try another approach.
Note that $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = |x-2y| + |2y-x| = |x - 2y| + |- (x - 2y)| = 2|x - 2y|$. This implies $|x-2y| = 20$.
Since $|x-2y|$ is the absolute value of a quantity, it can't be negative. Therefore, we must have $x - 2y = \pm 20$. Let's consider both cases separately.
Case 1: $x - 2y = 20$. Rearranging gives $x = 20 + 2y$. Substituting into the expression $5x^2 + 5y^2 - 8xy$ gives:
\[f(x, y) = 5(20 + 2y)^2 + 5y^2 - 8y(20 + 2y) = 5(400 + 80y + 4y^2) + 5y^2 - 160y - 16y^2.\]
Expanding and simplifying gives $f(x, y) = 2000 + 400y + 20y^2 + 5y^2 - 160y - 16y^2 = 2000 + 240y - 16y^2 = -16(y - 7.5)^2 + 2025$.
This expression is minimized when $y = 7.5$, and the minimum value is $f(x, y) = -16(0)^2 + 2025 = 2025$.
Case 2: $x - 2y = -20$. Rearranging gives $x = 2y - 20$. Substituting into the expression $5x^2 + 5y^2 - 8xy$ gives:
\[f(x, y) = 5(2y - 20)^2 + 5y^2 - 8y(2y - 20) = 5(4y^2 - 80y + 400) + 5y^2 - 16y^2 + 160y = 2000 - 400y + 20y^2 + 5y^2 - 16y^2 + 160y = 2000 - 240y + 20y^2 = -16(y - 7.5)^2 + 2025.\]
This expression is also minimized when $y = 7.5$, and the minimum value is $f(x, y) = -16(0)^2 + 2025 = 2025$.
In both cases, the minimum value of the expression $5x^2 + 5y^2 - 8xy$ is 2025. However, this would imply that $(x, y) = (20, 7.5)$, which does satisfy $|

Question (hint: positive numerical answer):
"What is the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ when $x$ and $y$ range over all real numbers such that $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$?"
Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:



First, we need to solve the inequality $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$.
Using the absolute value properties, we have:
If $x-2y \ge 0$ and $y-2x \ge 0$, then $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = (x-2y) + (y-2x) = -x + 2y + y - 2x = -3x + 3y = 40$. Rearranging terms, we get $3x - 3y = -40$, or $x - y = -\frac{40}{3}$.
If $x-2y \ge 0$ and $y-2x < 0$, then $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = (x-2y) + (2x-y) = x - 2y + 2x - y = 3x - 3y = 40$, giving us $x - y = \frac{40}{3}$.
If $x-2y < 0$ and $y-2x \ge 0$, then $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = -(x-2y) + (y-2x) = -x + 2y + y - 2x = -3x + 3y = 40$, giving us $x - y = -\frac{40}{3}$.
If $x-2y < 0$ and $y-2x < 0$, then $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = -(x-2y) + -(y-2x) = -x + 2y - y + 2x = x - y = \frac{40}{3}$.
From these cases, we conclude that the only possible solution is $x - y = \frac{40}{3}$.
Let $y = x - \frac{40}{3}$. Substituting this into the expression $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$, we get:
$$5x^2 + 5 \left(x - \frac{40}{3}\right)^2 - 8x \left(x - \frac{40}{3}\right)$$
$$= 5x^2 + 5 \left(x^2 - \frac{80}{3}x + \frac{1600}{9}\right) - 8x^2 + \frac{320}{3}x$$
$$= 5x^2 + 5x^2 - \frac{400}{3}x + \frac{1600}{9} - 8x^2 + \frac{320}{3}x$$
$$= -3x^2 + \frac{40}{3}x + \frac{1600}{9}$$
To find the minimum value of this expression, we can take the derivative with respect to $x$ and set it equal to zero:
$$-6x + \frac{40}{3} = 0 \Rightarrow x = \frac{20}{9}$$
Substituting this back into $y = x - \frac{40}{3}$, we get $y = \frac{20}{9} - \frac{40}{3} = -\frac{20}{3}$.
Now we can evaluate $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ at these values of $x$ and $y$:
$$5 \left(\frac{20}{9}\right)^2 + 5 \left(-\frac{20}{3}\right)^2 - 8 \left(\frac{20}{9}\right) \left(-\frac{20}{3}\right)$$
$$= 5 \cdot \frac{400}{81} + 5 \cdot \frac{400}{9} + \frac{3200}{27} = \frac{2000}{81} + \frac{2000}{9} + \frac{3200}{27}$$
$$= \frac{2000 \cdot 3 + 2000 \cdot 27 + 3200 \cdot 9}{27} = \frac{6000 + 54000 + 28800}{27} = \frac{88800}{27} = \frac{29600}{9}$$
Thus, the minimum value is $\frac{29600}{9}$. However, that is not an integer.

We went wrong when we took the derivative, as it should be $-6x + \frac{40}{3} = 0$. Solving for $x$, we get $x = \frac{20}{9}$.

Let's retry the problem.
We know that $x - y = \frac{40}{3} \Rightarrow y = x - \frac{40}{3}$, and we substitute that into $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$:
$$5x^2 + 5 \left(x - \frac{40}{3}\right)^2 - 8x \left(x - \frac{40}{3}\right)$$
$$= 5x^2 + 5 \left(x^2 - \frac{80}{3}x + \frac{1600}{9}\right) - 8x^2 + \frac{320}{3}x$$
$$= 5x^2 + 5x^2 - \frac{400}{3}x + \frac{1600}{9} - 8x^2 + \frac{320}{3}x$$
$$= -3x^2 + \frac{40}{3}x + \frac{1600}{9}$$
Take the derivative with respect to $x$:
$$-6x + \frac{40}{3} = 0 \Rightarrow x = \frac{20}{9}.$$
And find the corresponding $y$ value:
$$y = x - \frac{40}{3} = \frac{20}{9} - \frac{40}{3} = -\frac{20}{3}.$$
Finally, we evaluate the expression $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ at these values of $x$ and $y$:
$$5 \left(\frac{20}{9}\right)^2 + 5 \left(-\frac{20}{3}\right)^2 - 8 \left(\frac{20}{9}\right) \left(-\frac{20}{3}\right)$$
$$= 5 \cdot \frac{400}{81} + 5 \cdot \frac{400}{9} + \frac{3200}{27} = \frac{2000}{81} + \frac{2000}{9} + \frac{3200}{27}$$
$$= \frac{

Question (hint: positive numerical answer):
"What is the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ when $x$ and $y$ range over all real numbers such that $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$?"
Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:


First, we need to simplify the equation $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$.
Using the property $|a| + |b| = |a+b|$ whenever $ab \geq 0$, we rewrite the equation as
$|x-2y + (y-2x)| = 40 \implies |-x-y| = 40 \implies x+y = \pm 40$.
Now, let's substitute $y = \pm 40 - x$ into the expression $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$:
\[5x^2 + 5(40 - x)^2 - 8x(40 - x) = 5x^2 + 5(x^2 - 80x + 1600) - 8x^2 + 320x = -3x^2 + 320x + 8000.\]
To minimize this expression, we take its derivative with respect to $x$ and set it equal to 0:
\[\frac{d}{dx}(-3x^2 + 320x + 8000) = -6x + 320 = 0 \implies x = \frac{320}{6} = \frac{160}{3}.\]
Substituting this value back into the equation $x + y = \pm 40$, we get
\[\frac{160}{3} + y = 40 \implies y = \frac{40}{3}.\]
So the point $(x, y) = \left(\frac{160}{3}, \frac{40}{3}\right)$ minimizes the expression $5x^2 + 5y^2 - 8xy$.
Substituting this point into the expression, we get
\[5\left(\frac{160}{3}\right)^2 + 5\left(\frac{40}{3}\right)^2 - 8\left(\frac{160}{3}\right)\left(\frac{40}{3}\right) = 8000.\]
Therefore, the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ is 8000 when $x$ and $y$ range over all real numbers satisfying $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$. The answer is: 8000.

"What is the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ when $x$ and $y$ range over all real numbers such that $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$?"
Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:


Using the property $|a| + |b| \geq |a+b|$, we have
\[|x-2y| + |y-2x| \geq |(x-2y) + (y-2x)| = |x-2y+y-2x| = |-x-y| = |-(x+y)| = |x+y|.\]Then $|x+y| = 40$. Now we want to minimize $f(x, y) = 5x^2+5y^2-8xy$. We can write this as
\[f(x, y) = 5(x^2 + y^2) - 8xy = 5[(x+y)^2 - 2xy] - 8xy = 5[(x+y)^2 - 2xy] - 8xy = 5(40^2 - 2xy) - 8xy = 8000 - 10xy - 8xy = 8000 - 18xy.\]Since $|x+y| = 40$, we have $x+y = \pm 40$. Without loss of generality, we can assume $x+y = 40$. Then
\[xy = \frac{(x+y)^2 - (x^2 + y^2)}{2} = \frac{(x+y)^2 - ( (x+y)^2 - 2xy)}{2} = \frac{2xy}{(x+y)^2}.\]So
\[xy = \frac{(40)^2 - ( (40)^2 - 2xy)}{2} = \frac{2xy}{40^2}.\]Simplifying this equation gives $xy = \frac{(40)^2}{2} = 800$. Therefore,
\[f(x, y) = 8000 - 18xy = 8000 - 18(800) = 8000 - 14400 = -6400.\]Therefore, the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ when $x$ and $y$ range over all real numbers such that $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$ is $-6400$. The answer is: $-6400$

Question (hint: positive numerical answer):
"What is the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ when $x$ and $y$ range over all real numbers such that $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$?"
Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:


Using the given equation $|x - 2y| + |y - 2x| = 40,$ we can see that it represents the sum of the absolute values of two differences. We can rewrite this equation using the properties of absolute values:
\[|x - 2y| + |y - 2x| = |x - 2y| + |2x - y| = 40.\]
Now, let's consider the expression $5x^2 + 5y^2 - 8xy$. We can rewrite this as follows:
\[5x^2 + 5y^2 - 8xy = \left( \frac{9}{2}(x^2 + y^2) - \frac{1}{2} (x - y)^2 \right).\]
Notice that $(x^2 + y^2) - (x - y)^2 = 2xy$. So we can rewrite the given expression again as follows:
\[5x^2 + 5y^2 - 8xy = \frac{9}{2}(x^2 + y^2) - \frac{1}{2} (x - y)^2 = \frac{9}{2} \left( (x^2 + y^2) - \frac{2}{9} (x - y)^2 \right) = \frac{9}{2} \left( \frac{1}{9} (x^2 + y^2 - 2xy + 2xy) - \frac{2}{9} (x - y)^2 \right) = \frac{9}{2} \left( \frac{1}{9} ((x - y)^2 + 2xy) - \frac{2}{9} (x - y)^2 \right) = \frac{1}{2} (x - y)^2 + \frac{9}{2} (2xy). \]
Now, let's substitute the given equation $|x - 2y| + |y - 2x| = 40$ into this expression. Since $|x - 2y| + |y - 2x| = 40$, we have $(x - y)^2 + 4xy = 1600$. Therefore, our expression becomes
\[\frac{1}{2} (x - y)^2 + \frac{9}{2} (2xy) = \frac{1}{2} (1600 - 4xy) + 9xy = 800 - 2xy + 18xy = 800 + 16xy.\]

We want to minimize this expression. Since the expression involves only the product of $x$ and $y$, it will be minimized when the product $xy$ is maximized. From the equation $(x - y)^2 + 4xy = 1600$, we know that $xy$ cannot be greater than $400$. In fact, the maximum value of $xy$ occurs when $x = y$, so we have $x^2 + x^2 - 2x^2 + 4x^2 = 1600$, or $2x^2 = 1600$, so $x^2 = 800$, which implies $|x| = \sqrt{800}$. Thus $xy_{\max} = x^2 = 800$.
Therefore, the minimum value of the expression $5x^2 + 5y^2 - 8xy$ is
\[\frac{1}{2} (1600 - 4xy_{\max}) + 9xy_{\max} = \frac{1}{2} (1600 - 4*800) + 9*800 = \frac{1}{2} (1600 - 3200) + 7200 = -800 + 7200 = 6400.\]
However, this is a negative value, which contradicts the fact that the expression represents a sum of squares and therefore must be non-negative. Therefore, our approach of maximizing $xy$ was wrong.

We need to revisit the equation $(x - y)^2 + 4xy = 1600$ to find another way to maximize $xy$. From this equation, we see that $(x - y)^2 = 1600 - 4xy$. Since $(x - y)^2$ is always non-negative, we must have
\[1600 - 4xy \geq 0 \implies 4xy \leq 1600 \implies xy \leq 400.\]
Now, equality holds if $x = 2y$ or $y = 2x$. Without loss of generality, suppose $x = 2y$. Then the equation $|x - 2y| + |y - 2x| = 40$ becomes $|x - x| + |y - \frac{x}{2}| = 40$, or $|y - \frac{x}{2}| = 40$. Substituting $x = 2y$ into this equation, we get $|y - y| = 40$, or $0 = 40$, which is a contradiction. So we must have $y = 2x$. Substituting this into the equation, we get
\[|x - 2*2x| + |2x - 4x| = 40 \implies |-x| + |-2x| = 40 \implies x = -20.\]
Therefore, we have $y = -40$.

Now, plugging these values of $x$ and $y$ into the expression $5x^2 + 5y^2 - 8xy$, we get
\[5(-20)^2 + 5(-40)^2 - 8(-20)(-40) = 2000 + 8000 - 6400 = 3600.\]
Therefore, the minimum value of the expression $5x^2 + 5y^2 - 8xy$ is $3600$.
So, the solution to this problem is $\boxed{3600}$. The negative numerical answer does not work. That's why we can discard it. We are given an inequality which says that x and y have a constraint, so we will need to use this constraint to get the equation to a much simpler expression to minimize or maximize. Here in this question as well, the same concept has been used: firstly you write the expression you have in the simplest mathematical form. Then use the constraints to reach at your answer. Therefore, in this way, you reach to your desired simplified form! Hence the Minimum value is 3600.
The minimum value is 3600. Therefore, it can’t take a positive numerical value

Question (hint: positive numerical answer):
"What is the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ when $x$ and $y$ range over all real numbers such that $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$?"
Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:


Let $u = x - 2y$ and $v = y - 2x$. Then we have $|u| + |v| = 40$. 
We can write $u = (x - 2y)$ and $v = -(y - 2x) = -y + 2x$. 
So we have $|u| + |-v| = 40$. 
Using the property $|a| + |b| \geq |a + b|$, we get $|u - (-v)| \geq |u + (-v)| = |u - v| = 40$. 
Since $|u - v| = |(x - 2y) - (-y + 2x)| = |x - 2y + y - 2x| = |-x - y| = |-(x + y)| = |x + y|$, 
we have $|x + y| = 40$. 
Now let's go back to the expression $5x^2 + 5y^2 - 8xy$. We can rewrite it as $\frac{1}{2} [(5x^2 - 8xy + 5y^2) + (5x^2 + 8xy + 5y^2)]$.
We recognize $(5x^2 - 8xy + 5y^2)$ as $(3x - y)^2$ and $(5x^2 + 8xy + 5y^2)$ as $(3y + x)^2$. 
So we have $\frac{1}{2}[(3x - y)^2 + (3y + x)^2] = \frac{1}{2} [(3x - y)^2 + (x + 3y)^2]$.
Note that $(3x - y)^2 + (x + 3y)^2 \geq 0$ for all $x, y$. 
We want to find the minimum value of this expression, given that $|x + y| = 40$. 
We can use the substitution method to solve for one variable in terms of the other.
From the equation $|x + y| = 40$, we can square both sides to get $(x + y)^2 = 1600$.
Expanding, we get $x^2 + 2xy + y^2 = 1600$. 
Now we substitute $2xy = (3x - y)^2 + (x + 3y)^2 - (x^2 + y^2)$ into the equation:
$x^2 + 2xy + y^2 = 1600$ gives us $x^2 + ((3x - y)^2 + (x + 3y)^2 - (x^2 + y^2)) + y^2 = 1600$.
Simplifying, we get $(3x - y)^2 + (x + 3y)^2 = 3200$.
Therefore, we have shown that the minimum value of $5x^2 + 5y^2 - 8xy$ is $\frac{1}{2}(3200) = 1600$. Thus, the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ when $x$ and $y$ range over all real numbers such that $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$ is $1600$. The answer is: $1600$
