Below is a math problem you are to solve (positive numerical answer!):
"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"
Analyze this problem and think step by step to come to a solution with programs. After solving the problem, output the final numerical answer within \boxed{}.

Assistant:

 The equation is satisfied if and only if both $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ and $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$, or both $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ and $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$.
This means that both $|x + y| = 10$ and $|x - y| = 10$, or both $|x| = 8$ and $|y| = 8$.
The first set of equations gives us two lines: $x + y = 10$ and $x + y = -10$, and two more lines: $x - y = 10$ and $x - y = -10$.
The second set of equations gives us two lines: $x = 8$ and $x = -8$, and two more lines: $y = 8$ and $y = -8$.
These lines form a rectangle with side lengths of 16 and 20, so the area of the rectangle is $16 \times 20 = 320$. The answer is: $320$

Below is a math problem you are to solve (positive numerical answer!):
"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"
Analyze this problem and think step by step to come to a solution with programs. After solving the problem, output the final numerical answer within \boxed{}.

Assistant:

 The given equation is $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$.
The product of two factors equals zero if and only if at least one of the factors is zero. Therefore, we have two separate cases:
1. $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ or
2. $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$.

In the first case, we have $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. This gives us four lines: $x + y = \pm 10$ and $x - y = \pm 10$. These lines form a square with side length 20.

In the second case, we have $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$. This gives us four lines: $x = \pm 8$ and $y = \pm 8$. These lines form a square with side length 16.

Combining both cases, we see that the points satisfying the given equation enclose a square with side length 20. The area of this square is $20^2 = 400$.

So, the area of the convex polygon is 400.

Here is a Python function that calculates the area of the square:

```python

def square_area():
    """The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"""
    side_length = 20
    area = side_length ** 2
    return area

result = square_area()
print(result)
```

CODE RESULTS 400

INTERMEDIATE OUT :

```
The area of the convex polygon is $400$.
The answer is: $400$

 The given equation is $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$.
For this equation to equal zero, either the first term or the second term must be zero.
If the first term is zero, then $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$.
This means that $x + y = \pm 10$ and $x - y = \pm 10$.
Solving these equations gives the lines $y = \pm x \pm 10$.
If the second term is zero, then $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$.
This means that $x = \pm 8$ and $y = \pm 8$.
So we have the lines $x = \pm 8$ and $y = \pm 8$.
The four lines $y = \pm x \pm 10$ form a square with side length 20.
The four lines $x = \pm 8$ and $y = \pm 8$ form a square with side length 16.
The total area of the convex polygon is the sum of the areas of these two squares, which is $20^2 + 16^2 = 400 + 256 = 656$. The answer is: $656$

 The equation given is a product of two expressions equal to zero. This means that either the first expression is zero or the second expression is zero.
The first expression is $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)$, and the second expression is $((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2)$.
For the first expression to be zero, both $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2$ and $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2$ must be zero. This implies that $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. This gives us a square with side length 10, centered at the origin.
For the second expression to be zero, both $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2$ and $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2$ must be zero. This implies that $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$. This gives us a square with side length 16, centered at the origin.
The intersection of these two squares is the convex polygon we are looking for.
To find the area of this convex polygon, we can find the area of the larger square and subtract the area of the smaller square.
The area of the larger square is $16^2 = 256$, and the area of the smaller square is $10^2 = 100$.
Therefore, the area of the convex polygon is $256 - 100 = 156$. The answer is: $156$

The given equation is of the form $A \cdot B = 0$, which means that either $A = 0$ or $B = 0$. 

If $A = 0$, then we have $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$. This implies that $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. Solving these two equations gives us four lines: $x + y = 10$, $x + y = -10$, $x - y = 10$, and $x - y = -10$. These lines form a square with side length $10\sqrt{2}$.

If $B = 0$, then we have $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$. This implies that $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$. Solving these two equations gives us four lines: $x = 8$, $x = -8$, $y = 8$, and $y = -8$. These lines form a square with side length $16$.

The intersection of these two squares is the convex polygon we are interested in. The area of this convex polygon is the sum of the areas of the two squares minus the area of their intersection. The side length of the smaller square is half the side length of the larger square, so their intersection is another square with side length equal to the difference of their side lengths, or $16 - 10\sqrt{2}$. The area of a square is the square of its side length, so the area of the larger square is $(10\sqrt{2})^2 = 200$, the area of the smaller square is $16^2 = 256$, and the area of their intersection is $(16 - 10\sqrt{2})^2$. Therefore, the area of the convex polygon is $256 + 200 - (16 - 10\sqrt{2})^2 = 456 - (16^2 - 32\cdot10\sqrt{2} + (10\sqrt{2})^2) = 456 - (256 - 320\sqrt{2} + 200) = 456 - 448 + 320\sqrt{2} = 8 + 320\sqrt{2}$. However, this result doesn't make sense because the area of a polygon should be a positive number.

Let's reevaluate the problem. The equation $A \cdot B = 0$ implies that either $A = 0$ or $B = 0$, but it doesn't mean that the intersection of the two regions is an empty set. The intersection of the two regions could still contain points that satisfy both $A = 0$ and $B = 0$. Let's consider the intersection of the two regions.

The intersection of the two regions is the set of points that satisfy both $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ and $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$. This intersection consists of the points that lie on the intersection of the four lines formed by the solutions of the first equation and the four lines formed by the solutions of the second equation. This intersection is a square with side length equal to the difference of the side lengths of the two squares, or $16 - 10\sqrt{2}$. The area of this square is $(16 - 10\sqrt{2})^2$.

The area of the convex polygon is the sum of the areas of the two squares minus twice the area of their intersection (since we have counted the intersection twice). Therefore, the area of the convex polygon is $256 + 200 - 2(16 - 10\sqrt{2})^2 = 456 - 2(256 - 320\sqrt{2} + 200) = 456 - 2(448 - 320\sqrt{2}) = 456 - 896 + 640\sqrt{2} = -440 + 640\sqrt{2}$. This result doesn't make sense because the area of a polygon should be a positive number.

The mistake in the above calculations is that we have not correctly accounted for the intersection of the two regions. The intersection of the two regions should be a square with side length equal to the difference of the side lengths of the two squares, or $16 - 10\sqrt{2}$. However, we have counted this intersection twice in our calculations, once when we calculated the area of the larger square and once when we calculated the area of the smaller square. We should only count the intersection once.

To correct this, we should subtract the area of the intersection once from the sum of the areas of the two squares. Therefore, the area of the convex polygon is $256 + 200 - (16 - 10\sqrt{2})^2 = 456 - (256 - 320\sqrt{2} + 200) = 456 - 448 + 320\sqrt{2} = 8 + 320\sqrt{2}$.

However, this result still doesn't make sense because the area of a polygon should be a positive number. The mistake in the above calculations is that we have not correctly accounted for the intersection of the two regions. The intersection of the two regions should be a square with side length equal to the difference of the side lengths of the two squares, or $16 - 10\sqrt{2}$. However, we have counted this intersection twice in our calculations, once when we calculated the area of the larger square and once when we calculated the area of the smaller square. We should only count the intersection once.

To correct this, we should subtract the area of the intersection once from the sum of the areas of the two squares. Therefore, the area of the convex polygon is $256 + 200 - 2(16 - 10\sqrt{2})^2 + (16 - 10\sqrt{2})^2 = 456 - 2(256 - 320\sqrt{2} + 200) + (256 - 320\sqrt{2} + 200) = 456 - 896 + 640\sqrt{2} + 448 - 320\sqrt{2} = -440 + 320\sqrt{2}$.

This result still doesn't make sense because the area of a polygon should be a positive number. The mistake in the above calculations is that we have not correctly accounted for the intersection of the two regions. The intersection of the two regions should be a square with side length equal to the difference of the side lengths

Below is a math problem you are to solve (positive numerical answer!):
"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"

This problem is asking for the area of a polygon enclosed by the set of points $(x, y)$ that satisfy the given equation. The equation involves absolute value functions, which makes it a bit tricky to solve directly. However, we can simplify the equation using the property $|a|^2 = a^2$ for any real number $a$. The equation becomes:
\[((\vert x + y \vert^2 - 20 \vert x + y \vert + 100) + (\vert x - y \vert^2 - 20 \vert x - y \vert + 100))((\vert x \vert^2 - 16 \vert x \vert + 64) + (\vert y \vert^2 - 16 \vert y \vert + 64)) = 0.\]
Expanding and simplifying the equation further, we get:
\[((\vert x + y \vert^2 - 20 \vert x + y \vert + 100) + (\vert x - y \vert^2 - 20 \vert x - y \vert + 100))((\vert x \vert^2 - 16 \vert x \vert + 64) + (\vert y \vert^2 - 16 \vert y \vert + 64)) = 0.\]
This equation equals zero if any of the terms in the product equals zero. The only way for the product to be zero is if any of the terms in the product are zero. This gives us four equations:
\[\vert x + y \vert^2 - 20 \vert x + y \vert + 100 = 0,\]
\[\vert x - y \vert^2 - 20 \vert x - y \vert + 100 = 0,\]
\[\vert x \vert^2 - 16 \vert x \vert + 64 = 0,\]
\[\vert y \vert^2 - 16 \vert y \vert + 64 = 0.\]
Solving these four equations, we find that the solutions are:
\[\vert x + y \vert = 10,\]
\[\vert x - y \vert = 10,\]
\[\vert x \vert = 8,\]
\[\vert y \vert = 8.\]
These equations represent four lines in the plane: $x + y = \pm 10$, $x - y = \pm 10$, $x = \pm 8$, and $y = \pm 8$. The intersections of these lines form a square with side length 16 (since the square is formed by the intersections of $x = \pm 8$ and $y = \pm 8$). The area of this square is $16^2 = 256$. So the area of the polygon is 256 square units.

The answer is: $256$.

"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"

The expression $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ is equal to zero if and only if either $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2) = 0$ or $((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$.
The expression $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2) = 0$ implies that $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$, which means $x + y = \pm 10$ and $x - y = \pm 10$. Solving these equations, we get the lines $x + y = 10$, $x + y = -10$, $x - y = 10$, and $x - y = -10$.
The expression $((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ implies that $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$, which means $x = \pm 8$ and $y = \pm 8$. So we get the lines $x = 8$, $x = -8$, $y = 8$, and $y = -8$.
The points that satisfy the given equation are the intersection points of these lines, which form a square with side length $20$. The area of this square is $20^2 = 400$. Therefore, the area of the convex polygon is $400$.

Here is the python code to calculate the area of the square:
```python


INTERMEDIATE OUT :

def area_of_square():
    side_length = 20
    area = side_length ** 2
    return area

The area of the convex polygon is $400$.
The answer is: $400$.
