"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"

Approach:



For the equation $A \cdot B = 0$, if A = 0 or B = 0.
Thus, either $ ((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2) = 0$ or $ ((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$
The first condition implies $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$ which form a square with side length 10. The square's vertices are $\pm(8,8), \pm(8,-8), \pm(-8,8), \pm(-8,-8)$. The area of the square is $10^2 = 100$.
The second condition implies $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$ which is a square of side length 8. The area of this square is $8^2 = 64$.
Therefore, the area of the convex polygon enclosed by the points satisfying the given equation is the union of these two squares, so the total area is $100 + 64 = 164$. The answer is: $164$

Approach:


The equation given is a product of two terms equal to zero, so either of the terms must be zero. That gives us two systems of absolute value equations to solve.
1. $(|x + y| - 10)^2 = 0 \implies |x + y| = 10$
2. $(|x - y| - 10)^2 = 0 \implies |x - y| = 10$
3. $(|x| - 8)^2 = 0 \implies |x| = 8$
4. $(|y| - 8)^2 = 0 \implies |y| = 8$

Solving the absolute value equations gives us the vertices of the polygon:
1. For $|x + y| = 10$, we have $x + y = 10$ and $x + y = -10$.
2. For $|x - y| = 10$, we have $x - y = 10$ and $x - y = -10$.
3. For $|x| = 8$, we have $x = 8$ and $x = -8$.
4. For $|y| = 8$, we have $y = 8$ and $y = -8$.

By solving these systems of equations, we find the vertices of the polygon to be:
$(8, 2)$, $(8, -10)$, $(-8, 10)$, $(-8, -2)$, $(2, 8)$, $(-10, 8)$, $(10, -8)$, $(-2, -8)$.
These points form a square with side length 16. The area of a square is given by the square of the side length, so the area of the polygon is $16^2 = 256$.

So, the area of the convex polygon is 256. The answer is: $256$

Approach:


The product of two numbers is zero if and only if at least one of them is zero. Thus, the equation $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ holds if and only if at least one of the following two equations is satisfied:
1. $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$
2. $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$
For equation 1., both $\vert x + y \vert - 10 = 0$ and $\vert x - y \vert - 10 = 0$ must hold, which implies $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. This only happens when $x = \pm 10$ and $y = \pm 10$.
For equation 2., both $\vert x \vert - 8 = 0$ and $\vert y \vert - 8 = 0$ must hold, which implies $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$. This only happens when $x = \pm 8$ and $y = \pm 8$.
The points $\left(x, y\right)$ that satisfy the original equation are therefore either of the form $(10, 10)$, $(-10, 10)$, $(10, -10)$, or $(-10, -10)$, or of the form $(8, 8)$, $(-8, 8)$, $(8, -8)$, or $(-8, -8)$. These points form a square with side length 20, or a smaller square with side length 16.
The area of the square with side length 20 is $20^2 = 400$, and the area of the square with side length 16 is $16^2 = 256$. Therefore, the area of the convex polygon is $400$. The answer is: $400$

Assistant:

Approach:


The given equation is a product of two expressions equaling zero, so one or both of the expressions must be zero. This gives us two cases to consider:
1. $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + (\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$
2. $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + (\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$

For case 1, both terms must be zero:
$(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0 \implies \vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0 \implies \vert x - y \vert = 10$. This is the condition for a square with side length 10.

For case 2, both terms must be zero:
$(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0 \implies \vert x \vert = 8 \implies -8 \leq x \leq 8$ and $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0 \implies \vert y \vert = 8 \implies -8 \leq y \leq 8$. This is a square with side length 16.

The intersection of these two cases is the square with side length 10. So the area of the convex polygon is the area of this square, which is $10^2 = 100$.

So, the area of the convex polygon is 100. The answer is $\boxed{100}$.

Solve the following problem with a Python Script (positive numerical answer):
"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"

Approach:


We first need to analyze the given equation:
$$((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$$

Since the product of two numbers is zero if and only if at least one of the numbers is zero, we have two cases:
Case 1: $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$. This implies that $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$, which means $x + y = \pm 10$ and $x - y = \pm 10$. By solving these system of equations, we can determine that the points satisfying these conditions form a square with side length $20$. The area of this square is $400$.

Case 2: $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$. This implies that $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$, which means $x = \pm 8$ and $y = \pm 8$. By plotting these points on a graph, we can determine that the points form a square with side length $16$. The area of this square is $256$.

Combining the results from both cases, we see that the total area of the convex polygon is the sum of the areas of the two squares, which is $400 + 256 = 656$.

Therefore, the area of the convex polygon is $656$.
The answer is: $\boxed{656}$.

Solve the following problem with a Python Script (positive numerical answer):
"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"

Approach:

 The product of two terms is zero if and only if at least one of the terms is zero. So the equation $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + (\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + (\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ must hold for any point $(x, y)$ that lies on the boundary of the polygon.

For the first equation to hold, we must have $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. These equations represent the equations of four lines, and their intersection points are the vertices of the polygon.

For the second equation to hold, we must have $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$, which also represent the equations of four lines, and their intersection points are also the vertices of the polygon.

So all the vertices of the polygon are the intersection points of these eight lines. We can find these intersection points by solving the system of equations formed by pairs of these lines. There are a total of 16 intersection points.

Then, we can find the area of the polygon by using the Shoelace Formula. The Shoelace Formula states that if the vertices of a polygon are $(x_1, y_1), (x_2, y_2), ..., (x_n, y_n)$ in counterclockwise order, then the area of the polygon is given by:
$$
\frac{1}{2} \vert (x_1y_2 + x_2y_3 + ... + x_{n-1}y_n + x_ny_1) - (y_1x_2 + y_2x_3 + ... + y_{n-1}x_n + y_nx_1) \vert
$$
Applying this formula to our 16 vertices, we can compute the area of the polygon. After calculating the area using the Shoelace Formula, we find that the area is 256 square units.
The answer is: $256$

Solve the following problem with a Python Script (positive numerical answer):
"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"

Approach:

 The equation given represents the product of two quadratic expressions being equal to zero. Hence, either $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$.

For the first equation to be true, both $\vert x + y \vert - 10 = 0$ and $\vert x - y \vert - 10 = 0$. Solving these two equations gives us $x = y = \pm 10$.

For the second equation to be true, both $\vert x \vert - 8 = 0$ and $\vert y \vert - 8 = 0$, which gives us $x = y = \pm 8$.

Thus, the points which satisfy the given equation are $(\pm 10, \pm 10)$ and $(\pm 8, \pm 8)$.

These points form a square with side length 20 units (formed by the points $(\pm 10, \pm 10)$), and another square with side length 16 units (formed by the points $(\pm 8, \pm 8)$).

To find the area of the convex polygon (the union of these two squares), we simply add the areas of the two squares.

The area of a square with side length $a$ is $a^2$, so the area of the larger square is $20^2 = 400$, and the area of the smaller square is $16^2 = 256$.

Therefore, the area of the convex polygon is $400 + 256 = 656$.

So, the area of the convex polygon is 656 square units. The answer is: $656$

Approach:


The product of two numbers is zero if and only if at least one of the numbers is zero. So, we have two cases to consider:

Case 1: $ ((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2) = 0 $
This means $|x+y|=10$ and $|x-y|=10$. The solution to these equations gives us a square with side length 10 and diagonals of length 10$\sqrt{2}$.

Case 2: $ ((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0 $
This means $|x|=8$ and $|y|=8$. The solution to these equations gives us a square with side length 8 and diagonals of length 8$\sqrt{2}$.

Now, we need to find the area of the intersection of these two squares. The intersection is a square with side length 8 (the smaller square) and diagonals of length 8$\sqrt{2}$.

To find the area of the convex polygon, we use the formula for the area of a square, which is side length squared. The side length of the square in the intersection is 8, so its area is $8^2 = 64$. Therefore, the area of the convex polygon is 64 square units.

The answer is: $64$

The equation $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + (\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ has a solution only when $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. This implies $x + y = \pm 10$ and $x - y = \pm 10$. Solving these simultaneous equations gives us the vertices of the polygon: $(8, 2)$, $(8, -2)$, $(-8, 2)$, and $(-8, -2)$.

Similarly, the equation $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + (\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ has a solution only when $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$, which implies $x = \pm 8$ and $y = \pm 8$. Therefore, the other vertices of the polygon are $(8, 8)$, $(8, -8)$, $(-8, 8)$, and $(-8, -8)$.

The polygon formed by these points is a square with side length $16$. The area of a square is given by side length squared, so the area of this polygon is $16^2 = 256$.
The answer is $\boxed{256}$.

Assistant:

Approach:


To find the area of the convex polygon formed by the points satisfying the equation, we need to analyze the equation. 
Since the product of two numbers is zero if and only if at least one of the numbers is zero, we can separate the two equations into:
$$(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0 \text{ or }(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$$
$$(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0 \text{ or } (\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0.$$

From these, we have:
$$\vert x + y \vert = 10, \vert x - y \vert = 10, \vert x \vert = 8, \text{and } \vert y \vert = 8.$$

This implies that the values for x and y are:
$$x + y = 10 \text{ or } x + y = -10,$$
$$x - y = 10 \text{ or } x - y = -10,$$
$$x = 8 \text{ or } x = -8,$$
$$y = 8 \text{ or } y = -8.$$

We can analyze these equations to find the vertices of the polygon:
If $x + y = 10$ and $x = 8$, then $y = 2$.
If $x + y = 10$ and $y = 8$, then $x = 2$.
If $x + y = -10$ and $x = 8$, then $y = -18$.
If $x + y = -10$ and $y = 8$, then $x = -18$.
If $x - y = 10$ and $x = 8$, then $y = -2$.
If $x - y = 10$ and $y = 8$, then $x = 18$.
If $x - y = -10$ and $x = 8$, then $y = 18$.
If $x - y = -10$ and $y = 8$, then $x = -2$.
If $x = 8$ and $y = 8$, then $x + y = 16$ and $x - y = 0$.
If $x = 8$ and $y = -8$, then $x + y = 0$ and $x - y = 16$.
If $x = -8$ and $y = 8$, then $x + y = 0$ and $x - y = -16$.
If $x = -8$ and $y = -8$, then $x + y = -16$ and $x - y = 0$.

The vertices of the polygon are:
$(8, 2), (2, 8), (-18, -8), (-8, -18), (8, -2), (18, 8), (-8, 18), (-2, 8), (8, 8), (8, -8), (-8, 8),$ and $(-8, -8)$.

However, it is not necessary to determine all of the vertices. Notice that the polygon formed by these points is a square with side length 16. The area of a square is side length squared, so the area of this polygon is $16^2 = 256$.

So the area of the convex polygon is 256. The answer is: $256$
