Below is a math problem you are to solve (positive numerical answer!):
"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"
Analyze this problem and think step by step to come to a solution with programs. After solving the problem, output the final numerical answer within \boxed{}.

Assistant:

 The equation given in the problem, $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$, is equivalent to either $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$.

The first equation, $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$, can only be true if $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. This means $x + y = \pm 10$ and $x - y = \pm 10$. Solving these equations gives us the vertices of the square: $(0, 10)$, $(0, -10)$, $(10, 0)$, and $(-10, 0)$.

The second equation, $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$, can only be true if $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$. This means $x = \pm 8$ and $y = \pm 8$. Solving these equations gives us the vertices of the square: $(8, 0)$, $(-8, 0)$, $(0, 8)$, and $(0, -8)$.

The convex polygon formed by these points is a larger square with side length 10. The area of this square is $10^2 = 100$.

Therefore, the area of the convex polygon is 100.
The answer is: $100$

"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"

Assistant:

 The given equation is equal to zero if and only if both factors are equal to zero.
The first factor is equal to zero if and only if $|x + y| = 10$ or $|x - y| = 10$.
These are the equations of two pairs of parallel lines, so they form a rectangle.
The second factor is equal to zero if and only if $|x| = 8$ or $|y| = 8$.
These are the equations of two pairs of parallel lines, so they form a square.
Therefore, the points that satisfy the given equation are the vertices of a rectangle with side lengths 16 and 20.
The area of a rectangle is given by the product of its side lengths, so the area of the convex polygon is $16 \times 20 = 320$. The answer is: $320$

Below is a math problem you are to solve (positive numerical answer!):
"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"
Analyze this problem and think step by step to come to a solution with programs. After solving the problem, output the final numerical answer within \boxed{}.

Assistant:

 The given equation is equal to zero if and only if both of its factors are equal to zero. Therefore, we have two cases to consider:

1. $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ and $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ and $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$.
2. $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ and $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ and $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$.

For the first case, we have $\vert x + y \vert = 10$, $\vert x \vert = 8$, and $\vert y \vert = 8$. This gives us the vertices of the square $(8, 2), (8, -2), (-8, -2), (-8, 2)$.

For the second case, we have $\vert x - y \vert = 10$, $\vert x \vert = 8$, and $\vert y \vert = 8$. This gives us the vertices of the square $(2, 8), (2, -8), (-2, -8), (-2, 8)$.

The union of these two squares forms a larger square with side length $10$, so its area is $10^2 = 100$. Therefore, the area of the convex polygon is $100$. The answer is: $100$

"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"
Analyze this problem and think step by step to come to a solution with programs. After solving the problem, output the final numerical answer within \boxed{}.

Assistant:

 The given equation is a product of two terms, each of which is a square. The product is zero if and only if at least one of the terms is zero. Therefore, the points that satisfy the equation must either satisfy $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$, $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$, $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$, or $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$.

From $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$, we have $\vert x + y \vert = 10$, which gives us two lines: $x + y = 10$ and $x + y = -10$.

From $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$, we have $\vert x - y \vert = 10$, which gives us two more lines: $x - y = 10$ and $x - y = -10$.

From $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$, we have $\vert x \vert = 8$, which gives us two lines: $x = 8$ and $x = -8$.

From $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$, we have $\vert y \vert = 8$, which gives us two more lines: $y = 8$ and $y = -8$.

These lines form a square with side length 16. The area of this square is $16^2 = 256$.
The answer is: $256$

"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"

Assistant:

 The given equation is a product of two expressions equal to zero. Therefore, either the first expression is zero or the second expression is zero.

If $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$, then $\vert x + y \vert = 10$, which implies $x + y = \pm 10$.
If $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$, then $\vert x - y \vert = 10$, which implies $x - y = \pm 10$.

If $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$, then $\vert x \vert = 8$, which implies $x = \pm 8$.
If $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$, then $\vert y \vert = 8$, which implies $y = \pm 8$.

These equations describe a square with vertices at $(8,8)$, $(8,-8)$, $(-8,-8)$, and $(-8,8)$. The side length of the square is $16$, so the area of the square is $16^2 = 256$. Therefore, the area of the convex polygon is $256$. The answer is: $256$

Below is a math problem you are to solve (positive numerical answer!):
"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"
Analyze this problem and think step by step to come to a solution with programs. After solving the problem, output the final numerical answer within \boxed{}.

Assistant:

 The given equation is equal to zero if and only if both of the factors are equal to zero. The factors are:
\[((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)\]
and
\[((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2).\]
The first factor equals zero if and only if $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$.
The second factor equals zero if and only if $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$.
The first set of equations represents a square with side length 20, centered at the origin. The second set of equations represents a square with side length 16, also centered at the origin. The intersection of these two squares is the convex polygon whose area we want to find.
The area of a square is given by the square of the length of its side, so the area of the first square is $20^2 = 400$, and the area of the second square is $16^2 = 256$. The intersection of these two squares is a square with side length equal to the smaller side length, which is 16. Therefore, the area of the convex polygon is $16^2 = 256$. The answer is: $256$

"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"

Assistant:


The given equation is a product of two terms equal to zero, so either the first term is zero or the second term is zero.
The first term is zero when either $|x+y| - 10 = 0$ or $|x-y| - 10 = 0$, which means $|x+y| = 10$ or $|x-y| = 10$.
The second term is zero when either $|x| - 8 = 0$ or $|y| - 8 = 0$, which means $|x| = 8$ or $|y| = 8$.
The solutions to these equations are the vertices of the polygon.
The vertices of the polygon are the intersections of the lines $x+y = \pm 10$, $x-y = \pm 10$, $x = \pm 8$, and $y = \pm 8$.
The polygon is a square with side length 16 (the distance between the points $(8,0)$ and $(-8,0)$).
The area of the square is $16^2 = 256$. The answer is: $256$
