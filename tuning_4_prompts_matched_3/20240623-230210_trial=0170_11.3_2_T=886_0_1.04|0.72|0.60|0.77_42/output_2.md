 To solve this problem, we need to analyze the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ and find the number of values of $m$ for which it has 4 distinct solutions.

The equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ can be rewritten as two separate equations: $\vert x-1 \vert -2 = \frac{m}{100}$ and $\vert x-1 \vert -2 = -\frac{m}{100}$.

Each of these equations can be further split into two sub-equations:

1. For the first equation, we have:
   a. $\vert x-1 \vert = 2 + \frac{m}{100}$ and
   b. $\vert x-1 \vert = 2 - \frac{m}{100}$.

2. For the second equation, we have:
   a. $\vert x-1 \vert = 2 - \frac{m}{100}$ and
   b. $\vert x-1 \vert = 2 + \frac{m}{100}$.

Each of these sub-equations will have two more sub-equations based on the absolute value:

1. For the first equation, we have:
   a. $x-1 = 2 + \frac{m}{100}$ and $x-1 = -(2 + \frac{m}{100})$,
   b. $x-1 = 2 - \frac{m}{100}$ and $x-1 = -(2 - \frac{m}{100})$.

2. For the second equation, we have:
   a. $x-1 = 2 - \frac{m}{100}$ and $x-1 = -(2 - \frac{m}{100})$,
   b. $x-1 = 2 + \frac{m}{100}$ and $x-1 = -(2 + \frac{m}{100})$.

Solving each of these sub-equations will give us the distinct solutions for $x$. The number of distinct solutions will depend on the value of $m$. By analyzing the solutions, we find that the equation has 4 distinct solutions when $100 < m < 200$. Therefore, the number of positive integers $m$ for which the equation has 4 distinct solutions is the number of integers in the interval $(100, 200)$, which is $100$.

So, the answer is $\boxed{100}$.

Here is a Python code to calculate the number of positive integers $m$:

```python


INTERMEDIATE OUT :

def count_m():
    return len(range(101, 200))

result = count_m()
print(result)
```

CODE RESULTS 99

INTERMEDIATE OUT :
```output
99
```
However, we made a mistake in our reasoning. The equation has 4 distinct solutions when $0 < m < 100$. Therefore, the number of positive integers $m$ for which the equation has 4 distinct solutions is the number of integers in the interval $(0, 100)$, which is $100$.

So, the correct answer is $\boxed{100}$.

The Python code remains the same.

Assistant:

 The number of distinct solutions to the equation $| |x - 1| - 2| = \frac{m}{100}$ is equal to 4 if and only if $\frac{m}{100} = 1$.
This is because the expression $| |x - 1| - 2|$ is a piecewise function with 4 pieces, each of which corresponds to a range of values of $m$.
The value of $m$ that gives 4 distinct solutions is the value that makes $\frac{m}{100} = 1$.
Solving this equation gives $m = 100$.
Therefore, there is only 1 positive integer $m$ that makes the equation have 4 distinct solutions, and that integer is 100. The answer is: $1$

Assistant:

 The equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has $4$ distinct solutions if and only if $\frac{m}{100} = 1$. This is because the expression inside the absolute value, $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert$, oscillates between $0$ and $4$ as $x$ varies over the real numbers. The equation has $4$ distinct solutions when this oscillation is exactly $1$, which occurs when $\frac{m}{100} = 1$. Therefore, $m = 100$. So the number of positive integers $m$ that satisfy the condition is $1$.

The answer is: $1$

To solve this problem, we need to analyze the equation \[\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}\] and find the values of $m$ for which it has $4$ distinct solutions.

The equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ is a piecewise function that can be solved for each case of the absolute value separately. The function will have four distinct solutions when the value of $\frac{m}{100}$ falls into a specific range.

After analyzing the piecewise function, we find that the equation has $4$ distinct solutions when $\frac{m}{100}$ is between $2$ and $3$, inclusive. This gives us the inequality $2 \leq \frac{m}{100} \leq 3$.

To find the values of $m$ that satisfy this inequality, we can multiply all parts of the inequality by $100$:
\[200 \leq m \leq 300.\]

So the positive integer values of $m$ that satisfy the equation are the integers from $200$ to $300$, inclusive. To find the number of these integers, we subtract the smallest integer from the largest and add $1$:
\[300 - 200 + 1 = 101.\]

Therefore, there are $101$ positive integer values of $m$ for which the equation has $4$ distinct solutions. The answer is: $101$

Assistant:

 The problem is asking for how many positive integers $m$ the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has $4$ distinct solutions.

The number of distinct solutions to this equation depends on the value of $m$. The equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ is a piecewise function, and its solutions depend on the value of $\frac{m}{100}$.

For $\frac{m}{100} < 2$, the equation has no solutions.
For $\frac{m}{100} = 2$, the equation has two solutions.
For $2 < \frac{m}{100} < 3$, the equation has four solutions.
For $\frac{m}{100} = 3$, the equation has two solutions.
For $\frac{m}{100} > 3$, the equation has no solutions.

So the equation has four distinct solutions when $2 < \frac{m}{100} < 3$. This means $\frac{m}{100}$ must be in the interval $(2,3)$. To find the corresponding range of $m$, we can multiply all parts of the inequality by $100$:
\[2 \cdot 100 < m < 3 \cdot 100,\]
or
\[200 < m < 300.\]

The positive integers $m$ in this range are $201, 202, \ldots, 299$. To find the number of these integers, we can subtract the smallest integer from the largest and add $1$:
\[299 - 201 + 1 = 99.\]

Therefore, there are $99$ positive integers $m$ for which the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has $4$ distinct solutions. The answer is: $99$.

Assistant:

 The equation $| |x - 1| - 2 | = \frac{m}{100}$ has 4 distinct solutions if and only if $\frac{m}{100}$ is equal to the positive difference between 2 and 0, 2 and 4, or 0 and 2. This means $\frac{m}{100}$ must be equal to 2, 2, or 2. Therefore, $m = 200$.

We can verify this by graphing the equation. The graph of $| |x - 1| - 2 | = \frac{m}{100}$ with $m = 200$ will have 4 distinct solutions.

Here is a Python code snippet to solve the problem:
```python


INTERMEDIATE OUT :

def number_of_solutions():
    """For how many positive integers $m$ does the equation \[\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}\] have $4$ distinct solutions?"""
    m = 200
    return m

result = number_of_solutions()
print(result)
```

CODE RESULTS 200

INTERMEDIATE OUT :
```output
200
```
The value of $m$ for which the equation $| |x - 1| - 2 | = \frac{m}{100}$ has 4 distinct solutions is 200. Therefore, the number of positive integers $m$ that satisfy this condition is 1, namely $m = 200$. The answer is: $1$

"For how many positive integers $m$ does the equation \[\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}\] have $4$ distinct solutions?"

Assistant:

 The equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has $4$ distinct solutions when $\frac{m}{100}$ is equal to the positive difference between the roots of the equation $\vert x-1 \vert = 2$.

To find the roots of $\vert x-1 \vert = 2$, we consider two cases:
1. If $x-1 \geq 0$, then $x-1 = 2$, so $x = 3$.
2. If $x-1 < 0$, then $-(x-1) = 2$, so $x = -1$.

The positive difference between these roots is $3 - (-1) = 4$. Therefore, $\frac{m}{100} = 4$, and $m = 400$.

So, the only positive integer $m$ for which the equation has $4$ distinct solutions is $m = 400$. The answer is: $1$
