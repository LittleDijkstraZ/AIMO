Below is a math problem you are to solve (positive numerical answer!):
"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"
Analyze this problem and think step by step to come to a solution with programs. After solving the problem, output the final numerical answer within \boxed{}.

Assistant:

 The equation given is equivalent to the product of two equations being zero:
\[((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2) = 0\]
\[((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0\]

For the first equation to be zero, we need both $\vert x + y \vert - 10 = 0$ and $\vert x - y \vert - 10 = 0$, which implies $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. This means that the points $(x, y)$ are on the lines $x + y = 10$ and $x - y = 10$. These lines intersect at $(5, 5)$.

For the second equation to be zero, we need both $\vert x \vert - 8 = 0$ and $\vert y \vert - 8 = 0$, which implies $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$. This means that the points $(x, y)$ are on the lines $x = 8$ and $y = 8$. These lines intersect at $(8, 8)$.

So the points $(x, y)$ that satisfy the given equation are on the lines $x + y = 10$, $x - y = 10$, $x = 8$, and $y = 8$. These lines form a square with vertices at $(5, 5)$, $(8, 2)$, $(2, 8)$, and $(8, 8)$. The side length of the square is the distance from $(5, 5)$ to $(8, 2)$, which is $\sqrt{(8 - 5)^2 + (2 - 5)^2} = \sqrt{9 + 9} = \sqrt{18} = 3\sqrt{2}$. Therefore, the area of the square is $(3\sqrt{2})^2 = 18$.
The answer is: $18$

The equation $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + (\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ and $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + (\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ both hold if and only if $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$.
The equations $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$ imply that $x = 0$ and $y = \pm 10$ or $x = \pm 10$ and $y = 0$.
The equations $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$ imply that $x = \pm 8$ and $y = \pm 8$.
Combining these results, we see that the points $\left(x, y\right)$ that satisfy the given equation are $\left(\pm 8, \pm 8\right)$, $\left(0, \pm 10\right)$, and $\left(\pm 10, 0\right)$. These points form a square with side length $20$.
The area of this square is $20^2 = 400$.

 The expression $A \cdot B = 0$ implies that at least one of the expressions $A$ or $B$ is equal to zero. Therefore, the given equation is equivalent to either $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$.

The solutions to $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ are given by $\vert x + y \vert = 10$, which implies $x + y = 10$ or $x + y = -10$. Similarly, the solutions to $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ are given by $\vert x - y \vert = 10$, which implies $x - y = 10$ or $x - y = -10$. The solutions to $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ are given by $\vert x \vert = 8$, which implies $x = 8$ or $x = -8$. Similarly, the solutions to $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ are given by $\vert y \vert = 8$, which implies $y = 8$ or $y = -8$.

These equations represent a square with side length 16, so the area of the square is $16^2 = 256$. The answer is: $256$

The given equation is equal to zero if and only if both factors are equal to zero. This gives us the following four equations:

1. $|x + y| - 10 = 0$,
2. $|x - y| - 10 = 0$,
3. $|x| - 8 = 0$,
4. $|y| - 8 = 0$.

Solving these equations, we get the vertices of the polygon:

1. From $|x + y| - 10 = 0$, we have $|x + y| = 10$, which gives us the vertices $(8,2)$, $(8,-2)$, $(-2,8)$, and $(-2,-8)$.
2. From $|x - y| - 10 = 0$, we have $|x - y| = 10$, which gives us the same vertices.
3. From $|x| - 8 = 0$, we have $|x| = 8$, which gives us the vertices $(8,0)$, $(-8,0)$.
4. From $|y| - 8 = 0$, we have $|y| = 8$, which gives us the vertices $(0,8)$, $(0,-8)$.

These eight points form a square with side length 16. The area of this square is $16^2 = 256$. Therefore, the area of the convex polygon is 256.
The answer is: $256$

"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"

This problem is a bit tricky, but let's solve it step by step.

First, we notice that the product of two numbers is zero if and only if at least one of the numbers is zero. This means that either $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$.

If $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$, then $\vert x + y \vert = 10$, which means $x + y = \pm 10$.
If $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$, then $\vert x - y \vert = 10$, which means $x - y = \pm 10$.
If $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$, then $\vert x \vert = 8$, which means $x = \pm 8$.
If $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$, then $\vert y \vert = 8$, which means $y = \pm 8$.

Now we can find the intersections of these lines to get the vertices of the polygon.
The vertices are: $(8,0)$, $(0,8)$, $(-8,0)$, $(0,-8)$, $(8,8)$, $(8,-8)$, $(-8,8)$, and $(-8,-8)$.

The polygon is a square with side length 16.
To find the area of the square, we use the formula $s^2$, where $s$ is the side length. So the area is $16^2 = 256$.
The answer is: $256$

"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"

 The given equation is equivalent to the product of two equations being equal to zero:
$$((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2) = 0 \quad \text{or} \quad ((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0.$$
The first equation implies that $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$, which means that the points $(x, y)$ lie on a square with side length 10 and vertices at $(\pm 10, 0)$ and $(0, \pm 10)$.
The second equation implies that $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$, which means that the points $(x, y)$ lie on a square with side length 16 and vertices at $(\pm 8, 0)$ and $(0, \pm 8)$.
The intersection of these two squares is a square with side length 10 and area $10^2 = 100$. Therefore, the area of the convex polygon is 100 square units. The answer is: $100$

"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"

The given equation is of the form $A \cdot B = 0$, which means that either $A = 0$ or $B = 0$. Therefore, the points that satisfy the equation are either on the curve defined by $A = 0$ or on the curve defined by $B = 0$.

The curves $A = 0$ and $B = 0$ are:

1. $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + (\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$
2. $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + (\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$

From equation 1, we have $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. This gives us four lines: $x + y = 10$, $x + y = -10$, $x - y = 10$, and $x - y = -10$.

From equation 2, we have $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$. This gives us four lines: $x = 8$, $x = -8$, $y = 8$, and $y = -8$.

The intersection points of these lines are the vertices of the polygon. By calculating these intersection points, we find that the polygon is a square with side length 16.

The area of this square is $16^2 = 256$.

Therefore, the area of the convex polygon is 256. The answer is: $256$
