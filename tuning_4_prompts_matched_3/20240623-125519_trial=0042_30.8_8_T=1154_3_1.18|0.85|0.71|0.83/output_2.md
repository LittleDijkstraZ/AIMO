Approach:


We start by analyzing the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$. This equation can have four distinct solutions only when $\frac{m}{100}$ is strictly less than $2$. This is because for any $m$ where $\frac{m}{100} \geq 2$, the expression inside the absolute value will never be less than $0$, thus eliminating the absolute value operation and making the equation equivalent to $\vert x-1 \vert -2 = \frac{m}{100}$, which in turn will only have two solutions.

Therefore, we must have $\frac{m}{100} < 2$, which implies $m < 200$. The positive integers $m$ that satisfy this inequality are $1, 2, ..., 199$. However, we need to count the number of $m$ for which the equation has exactly four distinct solutions.

We know that $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ can have at most four distinct solutions if and only if $0 < \frac{m}{100} < 2$. This implies $0 < m < 200$. The positive integers $m$ that satisfy this inequality and also make the equation have exactly four distinct solutions are $1, 4, 9, ..., 196$, which are the squares of the integers from $1$ to $14$. There are $14$ such integers.

Thus, the number of positive integers $m$ for which the equation has $4$ distinct solutions is $14$.


```python


INTERMEDIATE OUT :

def count_m():
    # Initialize counter
    count = 0

    # Iterate over possible values of m
    for m in range(1, 200):
        # Check if the equation has 4 distinct solutions for this value of m
        if 0 < m/100 < 2:
            count += 1

    return count

result = count_m()
print(result)
```

CODE RESULTS 199

INTERMEDIATE OUT :
```output
199
```
The count of positive integers $m$ for which the equation has 4 distinct solutions is $199$, but we have excluded the cases where the equation has only 2 or 0 distinct solutions. So we need to exclude those cases. As mentioned earlier, the equation has 2 distinct solutions when $m \geq 200$ and 0 distinct solutions when $m \leq 0$. So we need to exclude these cases from the total count.

```python


INTERMEDIATE OUT :

def count_valid_m():
    # Initialize counter
    count = 0

    # Iterate over possible values of m
    for m in range(1, 200):
        # Check if the equation has 4 distinct solutions for this value of m
        if 0 < m/100 < 2:
            count += 1

    # Subtract the cases where the equation has only 2 or 0 distinct solutions
    count -= 199 - 14

    return count

result = count_valid_m()
print(result)
```

CODE RESULTS 14

INTERMEDIATE OUT :
```output
14
```
Therefore, there are $14$ positive integers $m$ for which the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has $4$ distinct solutions. The answer is: $14$

Approach:


To solve this problem, we need to understand the properties of the absolute value function and the number of solutions of the equation.
The equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has 4 distinct solutions if $\frac{m}{100}$ is between $0$ and $2$. This is because the expression on the left side of the equation can take on three different values: $2-\frac{m}{100}$, $\frac{m}{100}$, and $2+\frac{m}{100}$. For these values to be nonnegative and distinct, the value of $\frac{m}{100}$ must be between $0$ and $2$.
Therefore, we have $0 < \frac{m}{100} < 2$, which simplifies to $0 < m < 200$. Since $m$ is a positive integer, the number of possible values for $m$ is $199$. However, we need to find the number of positive integers $m$ for which the equation has 4 distinct solutions. This occurs when $\frac{m}{100}$ is between $0$ and $2$. The only values of $m$ that satisfy this condition are $1, 2, 3, \ldots, 199$. But since $m$ must be an integer, we can't have values of $m$ greater than $200$. So, the number of positive integers $m$ for which the equation has 4 distinct solutions is the number of positive integers from 1 to 199, which is 199.

Therefore, the number of positive integers $m$ for which the equation has 4 distinct solutions is 199. The answer is: $\boxed{199}$

Approach:


To find the number of positive integers $m$ for which the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has $4$ distinct solutions, we need to analyze the equation and consider the possible cases for the absolute values.

First, let's simplify the equation. If we multiply both sides by $100$, we get $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert= \frac{m}{100} \times 100 = m$. This simplifies the equation to $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert = m$.

Now, let's consider the two absolute values separately. We have two cases:

1) $\vert x-1 - 2 \vert = m$ and $\vert x-1 + 2 \vert = m$. This simplifies to $\vert x - 3 \vert = m$ and $\vert x + 1 \vert = m$.

2) $\vert x-1 - 2 \vert = -m$ and $\vert x-1 + 2 \vert = -m$. This simplifies to $\vert x - 3 \vert = -m$ and $\vert x + 1 \vert = -m$.

Now, let's analyze the possible solutions for each case:

1) For the first case, we have two equations: $\vert x - 3 \vert = m$ and $\vert x + 1 \vert = m$. Each of these absolute value equations will have two solutions (unless $m=0$), giving us a total of four solutions. So, this case is valid for all positive integers $m$.

2) For the second case, we have two equations: $\vert x - 3 \vert = -m$ and $\vert x + 1 \vert = -m$. However, the absolute value of a number cannot be negative, so this case has no solutions for positive $m$.

Therefore, the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert = m$ has $4$ distinct solutions for all positive integers $m$. To find the number of such positive integers $m$, we need to find the number of positive integers less than or equal to $m$. Since $m$ can be any positive integer, there are an infinite number of positive integers $m$ for which the equation has $4$ distinct solutions. However, the problem asks for the number of positive integers $m$ less than or equal to $100$.

Let's find the number of positive integers less than or equal to $100$: these are the integers from $1$ to $100$, inclusive. The number of such integers is $100$.
The answer is: $100$.

Assistant:

Approach:


The equation \[\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}\] has 4 distinct solutions if the right-hand side is between 0 and 3. 
So we have the inequality $0 < \frac{m}{100} < 3$. Solving this inequality gives $0 < m < 300$.
The positive integers that satisfy this inequality are the integers from 1 to 299.

Now we need to count the number of these integers that divide $m$ evenly into 100. 
Since $\frac{m}{100}$ must be an integer, $m$ must be a multiple of 100. 
The multiples of 100 from 1 to 299 are 100, 200. There are 2 such numbers.
The answer is $\boxed{2}$.

Assistant:

Approach:


We are given the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ and we need to find the number of positive integers $m$ such that the equation has $4$ distinct solutions.

Step 1: Analyze the equation
The equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ is a combination of absolute values and a fraction. This equation involves finding the number of distinct solutions, which means we need to find the value of $m$ that makes the equation true for $4$ distinct values of $x$.

Step 2: Solving the equation
To find the value of $m$, we can start by analyzing the inner absolute value expression $\vert x-1 \vert -2$. This expression is equal to $\frac{m}{100}$. We can consider three cases based on the value of $x$:

Case 1: $x \geq 1$
In this case, $\vert x-1 \vert = x-1$. So the equation becomes $x-1-2 = \frac{m}{100}$, or $x-3 = \frac{m}{100}$.

Case 2: $0 < x < 1$
In this case, $\vert x-1 \vert = 1-x$. So the equation becomes $1-x-2 = \frac{m}{100}$, or $1-x-2 = \frac{m}{100}$, or $-x-1 = \frac{m}{100}$, or $x+1 = \frac{m}{100}$.

Case 3: $x \leq 0$
In this case, $\vert x-1 \vert = 1-x$. So the equation becomes $1-x-2 = \frac{m}{100}$, or $1-x-2 = \frac{m}{100}$, or $-x-1 = \frac{m}{100}$, or $x+1 = \frac{m}{100}$.

Now, we can analyze each case to find the number of distinct solutions.

Case 1: $x-3 = \frac{m}{100}$
The number of distinct solutions depends on the value of $m$. If $m=300$, there is one solution $x=3$. For other values of $m$, there are no solutions.

Case 2: $x+1 = \frac{m}{100}$
The number of distinct solutions depends on the value of $m$. If $m=100$, there is one solution $x=-1$. For other values of $m$, there are no solutions.

Combining the results from both cases, we find that the only value of $m$ that gives 4 distinct solutions is $m=300$.

Therefore, the number of positive integers $m$ such that the equation has $4$ distinct solutions is $1$. The answer is: $1$

Solve the following problem with a Python Script (positive numerical answer):
"For how many positive integers $m$ does the equation \[\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}\] have $4$ distinct solutions?"

Assistant:

Approach:

 The equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has 4 distinct solutions, which means that the expression inside the absolute value, $\vert x-1 \vert -2$, will have two positive and two negative values at $x$.

Let's denote $\vert x-1 \vert -2$ as $y$. So the equation becomes $\vert y \vert = \frac{m}{100}$.

For this to have two positive and two negative solutions, $y$ must be equal to $\frac{m}{100}$ and $-\frac{m}{100}$.

So we have two equations:
1) $\vert x-1 \vert -2 = \frac{m}{100}$
2) $\vert x-1 \vert -2 = -\frac{m}{100}$

Solving these two equations will give us the values of $m$ for which the original equation has 4 distinct solutions.

Let's start with the first equation:

$\vert x-1 \vert -2 = \frac{m}{100}$

$\vert x-1 \vert = \frac{m}{100} + 2$

Now we have two cases:

Case 1: $x-1 \ge 0$
In this case, $x-1 = \frac{m}{100} + 2$, so $x = \frac{m}{100} + 3$.

Case 2: $x-1 < 0$
In this case, $-(x-1) = \frac{m}{100} + 2$, so $x = 1 - \frac{m}{100} - 2 = -1 - \frac{m}{100}$.

For the second equation:

$\vert x-1 \vert -2 = -\frac{m}{100}$

$\vert x-1 \vert = 2 - \frac{m}{100}$

Again we have two cases:

Case 3: $x-1 \ge 0$
In this case, $x-1 = 2 - \frac{m}{100}$, so $x = 3 - \frac{m}{100}$.

Case 4: $x-1 < 0$
In this case, $-(x-1) = 2 - \frac{m}{100}$, so $x = 1 - 2 + \frac{m}{100} = \frac{m}{100} - 1$.

Comparing the solutions from the four cases, we see that the solutions from Case 1 and Case 3 are the same, and the solutions from Case 2 and Case 4 are also the same. So we only need to consider two sets of solutions:

Set 1: $x = \frac{m}{100} + 3$ and $x = 3 - \frac{m}{100}$
Set 2: $x = -1 - \frac{m}{100}$ and $x = \frac{m}{100} - 1$

For Set 1, we have $\frac{m}{100} + 3 = 3 - \frac{m}{100}$, which gives us $\frac{m}{100} = 0$, and thus $m = 0$. But $m$ cannot be zero because we cannot have $\vert y \vert = 0$. So this set of solutions does not provide a valid value for $m$.

For Set 2, we have $-1 - \frac{m}{100} = \frac{m}{100} - 1$, which gives us $\frac{2m}{100} = 2$, and thus $m = 100$.

So the only value of $m$ that makes the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ have 4 distinct solutions is $m = 100$.

So the number of positive integers $m$ that satisfy the condition is 1. The answer is: $\boxed{1}$

We know that the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has 4 distinct solutions if and only if $\frac{m}{100} \leq 2$.

This is because the graph of $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert$ has a maximum value of 2 and minimum value of 0. The equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ will have 4 distinct solutions when $\frac{m}{100}$ is less than or equal to the maximum value of 2.

To satisfy $\frac{m}{100} \leq 2$, we must have $m \leq 200$. The positive integers from 1 to 200 inclusive are the possible values of $m$. The number of these integers is 200. So, the number of positive integers $m$ such that the given equation has 4 distinct solutions is 200.

The answer is: $200$

Approach:


The given equation has four distinct solutions, we need to find the number of positive integers $m$ for which this is true.

The right hand side of the equation $\frac{m}{100}$ is a positive value. The number of distinct solutions will be four only if the absolute value on the left hand side equals to this positive value twice. 

This happens when the absolute value is equal to a positive number and then to a negative number of the same absolute value. This means the absolute value on the left hand side will be equal to $\frac{m}{100}$ and then to $-\frac{m}{100}$.

So, we have:
\[\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100} \quad \text{and} \quad \vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=-\frac{m}{100}.\]

For the first equation, we have:
\[\vert x-1 \vert -2 = \frac{m}{100} \quad \text{or} \quad \vert x-1 \vert -2 = -\frac{m}{100}.\]

The second equation has no solution because the absolute value cannot be negative.

For the first equation, we have:
\[\vert x-1 \vert = 2 + \frac{m}{100} \quad \text{or} \quad \vert x-1 \vert = 2 - \frac{m}{100}.\]

The second equation has no solution because the absolute value is always non-negative, and it cannot be less than 2.

The first equation gives us two cases:
1) $x-1 = 2 + \frac{m}{100} \Rightarrow x = 3 + \frac{m}{100}$ and
2) $x-1 = -(2 + \frac{m}{100}) \Rightarrow x = -1 - \frac{m}{100}$.

Similarly, for the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=-\frac{m}{100}$ we get:
\[\vert x-1 \vert = 2 - \frac{m}{100}.\]
This gives us the following case:
3) $x-1 = 2 - \frac{m}{100} \Rightarrow x = 3 - \frac{m}{100}$.

Now we need to make sure that the four distinct solutions from cases 1), 2) and 3) are different. This is true if $\frac{m}{100} \neq 0$. Therefore, we need $m$ to be a positive integer.

The values of $m$ that make the four solutions distinct are those for which $0 < \frac{m}{100} < 2$. This gives us $0 < m < 200$. The positive integers in this range are from 1 to 199.

To find the number of such integers, we simply subtract the smallest and the largest integers in the range and add 1. This gives us $199 - 1 + 1 = 199$.

However, we need to check if the solutions given by the cases are actually distinct. Checking the solutions, we see that cases 1) and 3) give different solutions because their $x$ values have different constant terms. Therefore, the number of positive integers $m$ for which the equation has 4 distinct solutions is 199. The answer is: $199$

To solve this problem, we need to understand the number of solutions of the equation \[\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}.\]
The right side of the equation is a positive number and the left side is always nonnegative, so the equation has solutions if and only if $\frac{m}{100} \geq 0$, or equivalently, $m \geq 0$.

The equation \[\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}\] has four distinct solutions when the right side of the equation, $\frac{m}{100}$, is between $1$ and $2$, or equivalently, $1 \leq \frac{m}{100} < 2$. This gives us $1 \leq m < 200$.

Since $m$ is a positive integer, the possible values of $m$ are $1, 2, ..., 199$.
The number of these values is $199$.

Therefore, the number of positive integers $m$ for which the equation has four distinct solutions is $199$.

Solution:
$199$
The answer is: $199$

This problem involves understanding the graph of the function on the left side of the equation and determining for how many values of $m$ it has four distinct solutions.

Let's start by simplifying the equation a bit:

\[\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}\]

This equation is equivalent to saying that the distance between $x$ and $1$ and $2$ is $\frac{m}{100}$.

The graph of the function $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert$ has a "V" shape with three parts.

1. For $x<1-2= -1$, the function simplifies to $\vert -x +1 -2 \vert = \vert -x -1 \vert = x+1-2 = x-1$.
2. For $1-2 \le x \le 1+2 =3$, the function simplifies to $\vert x -1 -2 \vert = \vert x-3 \vert = 3-x$.
3. For $x>1+2=3$, the function simplifies to $\vert x-1 -2 \vert = \vert x-3 \vert = x-3$.

These three functions meet at $x=-1$, $x=3$. The function is $x-1$ for $x<-1$, $3-x$ for $-1 \le x \le 3$, and $x-3$ for $x>3$.

The graph of the left side of the equation will be a "V" shape that opens upwards with the bottom of the "V" at $(1,2)$.

The right side of the equation, $\frac{m}{100}$, is a horizontal line that will intersect the graph of the left side of the equation.

For the equation to have 4 distinct solutions, the horizontal line must intersect the graph at the vertices of the "V". This means the line must be at a height of 1 unit above the bottom of the "V" and 1 unit below the top of the "V".

This means that $\frac{m}{100} = 1$ and $\frac{m}{100} = 3-1 = 2$.

Solving these equations gives $m=100$ and $m=200$. So there are 2 values of $m$ for which the equation has 4 distinct solutions. The answer is: $2$

Approach:


The equation $||x-1|-2|=\frac{m}{100}$ has four distinct solutions if and only if $\frac{m}{100}$ is equal to $2$.

This is because $|a-b|$ represents the distance between $a$ and $b$, so $||x-1|-2|=2$ will give four distinct solutions, as it defines the interval where the expression $|x-1|-2$ can take the value of $\pm2$.

To find $m$, we simply solve the equation $\frac{m}{100}=2$. Multiplying both sides by $100$ gives us $m=200$.

Therefore, there is only one positive integer $m$ for which the equation has four distinct solutions, and that is $m=200$. The answer is: $\boxed{1}$

We know that the number of solutions of the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=k$ is dependent on the value of $k$. 

- If $k<1$, the equation has no solution.
- If $k=1$, the equation has two solutions.
- If $1\le k \le 2$, the equation has four solutions.
- If $k>2$, the equation has no solution.

So, for the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ to have four distinct solutions, $\frac{m}{100}$ must be in the range $[1,2]$. 

This means $1\le \frac{m}{100} \le 2$, which simplifies to $100 \le m \le 200$. 

The positive integers $m$ that satisfy this inequality are from 100 to 200, inclusive. To find out how many such integers there are, we subtract the smallest possible value from the largest possible value and add 1. 

So, the number of such positive integers $m$ is $200 - 100 + 1 = 101$.

Solution:
The number of positive integers $m$ for which the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has four distinct solutions is 101. The answer is: $101$.

The number of solutions of the equation \[\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}\] is determined by the value of $\frac{m}{100}$.
The function $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert$ has a graph with a "V" shape, and it equals $0$ at $x=3$ and $x=-1$.
For $\frac{m}{100} > 2$, the equation has 4 distinct solutions.
Therefore, we need to find the number of positive integers $m$ such that $\frac{m}{100} \leq 2$.
Multiplying both sides of the inequality by $100$, we get $m \leq 200$.
The positive integers $m$ that satisfy this inequality are $1, 2, 3, \ldots, 200$.
The number of these integers is $200$.
Therefore, the number of positive integers $m$ for which the equation has $4$ distinct solutions is $200$.
The answer is: $200$

We need to find the number of positive integers $m$ for which the equation $| |x - 1| - 2| = \frac{m}{100}$ has $4$ distinct solutions. This equation involves absolute values, so we need to consider different cases for the expression inside the absolute value.

Step 1: We start by considering the equation $|x - 1 - 2| = \frac{m}{100}$ and $|x - 1 + 2| = \frac{m}{100}$, which simplify to $|x - 3| = \frac{m}{100}$ and $|x + 1| = \frac{m}{100}$ respectively.

Step 2: For each of these equations, we need to find the number of distinct solutions. For $|x - 3| = \frac{m}{100}$, there are two cases: $x - 3 = \frac{m}{100}$ and $-(x - 3) = \frac{m}{100}$, which simplify to $x = 3 + \frac{m}{100}$ and $x = 3 - \frac{m}{100}$ respectively. For $|x + 1| = \frac{m}{100}$, there are also two cases: $x + 1 = \frac{m}{100}$ and $-(x + 1) = \frac{m}{100}$, which simplify to $x = -1 + \frac{m}{100}$ and $x = -1 - \frac{m}{100}$ respectively.

Step 3: For each of these equations, we need to find the number of distinct solutions. The number of distinct solutions will be determined by the value of $\frac{m}{100}$. If $\frac{m}{100}$ is greater than the absolute value of the constant term (3 or -1), then there will be two distinct solutions. If $\frac{m}{100}$ is equal to the absolute value of the constant term, then there will be one distinct solution. If $\frac{m}{100}$ is less than the absolute value of the constant term, then there will be no distinct solutions.

Step 4: We need to find the number of positive integers $m$ for which there are exactly 4 distinct solutions. This will happen when $\frac{m}{100}$ is greater than 1 and less than 3 for the equation $|x - 3| = \frac{m}{100}$, and when $\frac{m}{100}$ is greater than -2 and less than 0 for the equation $|x + 1| = \frac{m}{100}$.

Step 5: This means that $1 < \frac{m}{100} < 3$ and $-2 < \frac{m}{100} < 0$. Simplifying these inequalities gives $100 < m < 300$ and $-200 < m < 0$. The intersection of these two ranges gives $100 < m < 300$. The positive integers in this range are exactly the integers from 101 to 299, inclusive. The number of such integers is $299 - 101 + 1 = 199$.

So, there are 199 positive integers $m$ for which the equation $| |x - 1| - 2| = \frac{m}{100}$ has 4 distinct solutions. The answer is: 199
