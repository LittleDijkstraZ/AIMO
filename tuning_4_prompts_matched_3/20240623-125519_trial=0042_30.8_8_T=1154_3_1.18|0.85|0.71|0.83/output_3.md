Solve the following problem with a Python Script (positive numerical answer):
"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"

Approach:

 The expression $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ implies that either one of the two factors is zero. This translates to either one of the following two conditions must be satisfied:

1. $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$, or
2. $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$.

For the first condition to be true, it implies that both $\vert x + y \vert - 10 = 0$ and $\vert x - y \vert - 10 = 0$, which further simplifies to $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. These are the equations of two lines in the coordinate plane.

For the second condition to be true, it implies that both $\vert x \vert - 8 = 0$ and $\vert y \vert - 8 = 0$, which further simplifies to $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$. These are the equations of two circles in the coordinate plane.

The points that satisfy either of these conditions are the points that form the boundary of the polygon. The polygon itself is a square with side length 10 units (since the distance between the parallel lines $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$ is 10 units, which is the same as the distance between the parallel lines $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$).

The area of a square is given by side length squared. Therefore, the area of the polygon is $10^2 = 100$ square units.
The answer is: $100$

Solve the following problem with a Python Script (positive numerical answer):
"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"

Approach:


The expression $f(x, y) = ((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2)$ is zero if and only if either of the factors is zero. This means that either $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$.

For the first factor to be zero, we must have $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. This gives us four lines in the plane: $x + y = 10$, $x + y = -10$, $x - y = 10$, and $x - y = -10$. These lines form a square with side length 10 and diagonals of length $10\sqrt{2}$.

For the second factor to be zero, we must have $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$, which gives us four lines in the plane: $x = 8$, $x = -8$, $y = 8$, and $y = -8$. These lines form a square with side length 16 and diagonals of length $16\sqrt{2}$.

The intersection of these two squares is the convex polygon we are interested in. The side length of the smaller square is half the side length of the larger square, so the ratio of their areas is the square of the ratio of their side lengths. The area of the smaller square is therefore 1/4 the area of the larger square. The area of the larger square is $10^2 \times 2 = 200$, so the area of the smaller square is $200/4 = 50$.
The answer is: $\boxed{50}$

Solve the following problem with a Python Script (positive numerical answer):
"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"

Approach:


The expression $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2)$ equals to zero if and only if at least one of the factors is zero. This gives us two sets of equations to solve:
1. $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ and $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$.
2. $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ and $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$.

The solutions to the first set of equations are $x = \pm 8$ and $y = \pm 8$. The solutions to the second set of equations are $x = y = \pm 10$. These solutions correspond to the vertices of the convex polygon.

Now, we need to calculate the area of this polygon. The polygon is a square with side length $10$ (since the vertices are at $(\pm 10, 0)$, $(0, \pm 10)$ and the side length is the distance between $(\pm 10, 0)$ and $(0, \pm 10)$ which is $10$ by the distance formula). The area of the square is therefore $10^2 = 100$.

The Python script to calculate the area is as follows:

```python


INTERMEDIATE OUT :

def calculate_area():
    side_length = 10
    area = side_length ** 2
    return area

result = calculate_area()
print(result)
```

CODE RESULTS 100

INTERMEDIATE OUT :
```output
100
```
The area of the convex polygon is $100$. The answer is: $100$

Solve the following problem with a Python Script (positive numerical answer):
"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"

Approach:



The equation is defined as $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$. For the product of two numbers to be zero, either one of the numbers must be zero. This gives us two separate cases to consider:

1. $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$. This implies $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. This is the equation of a square with side length 20.
2. $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$. This implies $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$, which forms a square with side length 16.

The solution to the given problem is the area of the union of the two squares. The side lengths of the squares are 20 and 16, so the areas are $20^2 = 400$ and $16^2 = 256$ respectively.

The area of the union of the two squares is the sum of their areas minus the area of their intersection. The intersection of the two squares is another square, this time with side length equal to the difference of the side lengths of the original squares divided by 2, which is $(20 - 16)/2 = 2$. The area of this square is $2^2 = 4$.

Therefore, the area of the union of the two squares is the sum of their areas minus the area of their intersection: $400 + 256 - 4 = 652$.

So, the area of the convex polygon is 652 square units. The answer is: $652$

Solve the following problem with a Python Script (positive numerical answer):
"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"

Approach:



This problem is based on the identity $ab = 0$ if and only if $a = 0$ or $b = 0$. So the equation in the problem is satisfied if either of the following two equations is true:
1. $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$
2. $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$

For equation 1 to be true, we must have $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. This is the set of points that lie on two perpendicular lines, each 10 units away from the origin.

For equation 2 to be true, we must have $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$. This is a square with side length 16 units.

The solution is the intersection of these two sets of points, which forms a square with side length 10 units. The area of this square is $10^2 = 100$. So the area of the convex polygon is 100.

The answer is: $\boxed{100}$
