Below is a math problem you are to solve (positive numerical answer!):
"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"
Analyze this problem and think step by step to come to a solution with programs. After solving the problem, output the final numerical answer within \boxed{}.

The given equation is $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$.

For the product of two numbers to be zero, either one of them must be zero. Therefore, we have two cases:

1. $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$. In this case, both $\vert x + y \vert - 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert - 10$ must be zero, which means $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. The only way this can happen is if $x = y = \pm 10$. This gives us four points: $(10,10)$, $(10,-10)$, $(-10,10)$, and $(-10,-10)$.

2. $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$. In this case, both $\vert x \vert - 8$ and $\vert y \vert - 8$ must be zero, which means $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$. The only way this can happen is if $x = y = \pm 8$. This gives us four more points: $(8,8)$, $(8,-8)$, $(-8,8)$, and $(-8,-8)$.

Therefore, the eight points $(\pm 10, \pm 10)$ and $(\pm 8, \pm 8)$ form a square with side length 20. The area of this square is $20^2 = 400$. So, the area of the convex polygon is 400 square units. The answer is: $400$

"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"

The equation $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ is satisfied only when either $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$, $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$, $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$, or $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$.
The first two equations are satisfied when $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$, which are the equations of two lines in the coordinate plane. The last two equations are satisfied when $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$, which are the equations of two circles with radius 8 centered at the origin.

The intersection of these lines and circles will form a square with side length 16. Therefore, the area of this square is $16^2 = 256$.

So the area of the convex polygon is 256 square units. The answer is: $256$

The given equation is a product of two expressions equal to zero, so either the first expression is zero or the second expression is zero.

If $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$, then $\vert x + y \vert = 10$, which means $x + y = \pm 10$.
If $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$, then $\vert x - y \vert = 10$, which means $x - y = \pm 10$.
If $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$, then $\vert x \vert = 8$, which means $x = \pm 8$.
If $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$, then $\vert y \vert = 8$, which means $y = \pm 8$.

These conditions define a square with side length 16 (the maximum value of $x$ or $y$ minus the minimum value). The area of this square is $16^2 = 256$. Therefore, the area of the convex polygon is 256. The answer is: $256$

The given equation is $0$ only when at least one of the factors is $0$. Thus, we have two cases to consider:

1. $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$. This implies $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ or $\vert x - y \vert = 10$.
2. $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$. This implies $\vert x \vert = 8$ or $\vert y \vert = 8$.

From the first case, we have four lines: $x + y = \pm 10$ and $x - y = \pm 10$. From the second case, we have four lines: $x = \pm 8$ and $y = \pm 8$. These lines form a square with side length $20$.

The area of the square is side length squared, so the area is $20^2 = 400$.

So, the area of the convex polygon is $400$. The answer is: $400$

Assistant:

 The problem statement contains a mistake. The expression $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ implies that $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$, which is only possible when $x = \pm 10$ and $y = \pm 10$. Similarly, the expression $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ implies that $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$, which is only possible when $x = \pm 8$ and $y = \pm 8$. The points $(x, y)$ that satisfy both conditions are the vertices of a square with side length $20$. The area of this square is $20^2 = 400$. Therefore, the area of the convex polygon is $400$. The answer is: $400$

The given equation is a product of two expressions equal to zero. Therefore, either the first expression is zero or the second expression is zero. This gives us two systems of equations to solve:

1. $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ and $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$
2. $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ and $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$

For each system, we have:

1.a. $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x \vert = 8$
1.b. $\vert y \vert = 8$

2.a. $\vert x - y \vert = 10$
2.b. $\vert y \vert = 8$

From 1.a and 1.b we get the vertices of the first triangle: $(8, 8), (8, -8), (-8, 8)$.
From 2.a and 2.b we get the vertices of the second triangle: $(8, 8), (-8, -8), (-8, 8)$.

The two triangles form a square with side length 16. The area of the square is $16^2 = 256$. The answer is: $256$

The problem involves the absolute value function, which can make it difficult to solve directly. However, the key to this problem is to recognize that the product of two numbers is zero if and only if at least one of the numbers is zero. This means that we can set each factor equal to zero and solve for the possible values of $x$ and $y$.

Let's solve the equations:

1. $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0 \Rightarrow \vert x + y \vert = 10 \Rightarrow x + y = \pm 10$
2. $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0 \Rightarrow \vert x - y \vert = 10 \Rightarrow x - y = \pm 10$
3. $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0 \Rightarrow \vert x \vert = 8 \Rightarrow x = \pm 8$
4. $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0 \Rightarrow \vert y \vert = 8 \Rightarrow y = \pm 8$

From these equations, we can find the vertices of the polygon by solving the systems of equations formed by the combinations of the above equations. 

The polygon is a square with side length of 16 units (the absolute values of the differences between the possible values of $x$ and $y$). The area of a square is side length squared, so the area of this polygon is $16^2 = 256$. The answer is: $256$
