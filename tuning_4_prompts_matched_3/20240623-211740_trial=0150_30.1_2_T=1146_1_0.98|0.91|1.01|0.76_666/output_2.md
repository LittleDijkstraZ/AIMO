Interesting, let's analyze step by step:



We are given the equation $ \vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ and we want to find the number of positive integer values for $m$ such that this equation has 4 distinct solutions.

Step 1: We can rewrite the equation as $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$. The right hand side of the equation is always non-negative, so the left hand side must be non-negative as well. This means $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert \ge 0$, which simplifies to $\vert x-1 \vert \ge 2$. Therefore, $x-1 \le -2$ or $x-1 \ge 2$, which leads to $x \le -1$ or $x \ge 3$. 

Step 2: Now we need to consider the two cases separately: $x \le -1$ and $x \ge 3$.

Case 1: For $x \le -1$, we have $\vert x-1 \vert -2 = -(x-1) - 2 = -x + 1 - 2 = -x - 1$. So the equation becomes $\vert -x - 1 \vert = \frac{m}{100}$, which simplifies to $\vert x+1 \vert = \frac{m}{100}$. This equation has two solutions: $x = -1 - \frac{m}{100}$ and $x = -1 + \frac{m}{100}$. For these solutions to be less than or equal to -1, we need $-1 - \frac{m}{100} \le -1$ and $-1 + \frac{m}{100} \le -1$, which simplifies to $\frac{m}{100} \ge 0$ and $\frac{m}{100} \le 0$. The only way this can happen is if $\frac{m}{100} = 0$, which implies $m = 0$. But $m$ cannot be zero, so there are no solutions for this case.

Case 2: For $x \ge 3$, we have $\vert x-1 \vert -2 = x - 1 - 2 = x - 3$. So the equation becomes $\vert x - 3 \vert = \frac{m}{100}$. This equation has two solutions: $x = 3 - \frac{m}{100}$ and $x = 3 + \frac{m}{100}$. For these solutions to be greater than or equal to 3, we need $3 - \frac{m}{100} \ge 3$ and $3 + \frac{m}{100} \ge 3$, which simplifies to $\frac{m}{100} \le 0$ and $\frac{m}{100} \ge 0$. Both of these conditions are satisfied. So we have two solutions $x = 3 - \frac{m}{100}$ and $x = 3 + \frac{m}{100}$. For these to be distinct, we need $3 - \frac{m}{100} \neq 3 + \frac{m}{100}$, which simplifies to $\frac{m}{100} \neq 0$. This is true for all $m > 0$.

Step 3: To have 4 distinct solutions, we need the two solutions in each case to be distinct from each other and from the solutions in the other case. This is true for all $m > 0$. So we just need to find the number of positive integer values of $m$ such that $\frac{m}{100} < 2$. This simplifies to $m < 200$. The positive integer values of $m$ that satisfy this condition are the numbers from 1 to 199.

Step 4: To verify that the number of positive integer values of $m$ is indeed 199, we can simply count the number of integers from 1 to 199. There are 199 positive integers in this range.

So the number of positive integer values of $m$ such that the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has 4 distinct solutions is 199.

The answer is: $199$

The absolute value equation $| |x-1|-2|=\frac{m}{100}$ has 4 distinct solutions. This implies that the value of $\frac{m}{100}$ must be the difference of two numbers that are each greater than 2. The only such possibility is $\frac{m}{100}=1$, so $m=100$. Therefore, there is only one possible value of $m$ that satisfies the given condition, and that value is $100$. Since $100$ is a positive integer, our answer is valid. The answer is: $\boxed{1}$.

Interesting, let's analyze step by step:



The equation has four distinct solutions. This means that the expression inside the absolute value, i.e., $|x-1|-2$ must take the value $\frac{m}{100}$ twice and its negative $-\frac{m}{100}$ twice. So, $|x-1|-2$ must be one of the following: $\frac{m}{100}, -\frac{m}{100}, \frac{2m}{100}, -\frac{2m}{100}$.

This translates to the following system of equations:
\[|x-1|-2 = \frac{m}{100}\]
\[|x-1|-2 = -\frac{m}{100}\]
\[|x-1|-2 = \frac{2m}{100}\]
\[|x-1|-2 = -\frac{2m}{100}\]

We can simplify each equation to:
\[|x-1| = 2 + \frac{m}{100}\]
\[|x-1| = 2 - \frac{m}{100}\]
\[|x-1| = 2 + \frac{2m}{100}\]
\[|x-1| = 2 - \frac{2m}{100}\]

We know that $|x-1|$ is always non-negative, so the second and fourth equations will not have any solutions for $x$ unless $2 - \frac{m}{100} \geq 0$ and $2 - \frac{2m}{100} \geq 0$. This implies that $m \leq 200$. Also, $2 + \frac{m}{100} > 2 - \frac{m}{100}$ and $2 + \frac{2m}{100} > 2 - \frac{2m}{100}$, so the first and third equations will have more solutions than the second and fourth equations respectively. Therefore, we only need to consider the first and third equations.

Now we need to solve these two equations:

1. $|x-1| = 2 + \frac{m}{100}$
2. $|x-1| = 2 + \frac{2m}{100}$

For equation 1, we have two cases:
- $x-1 = 2 + \frac{m}{100}$, which gives $x = 3 + \frac{m}{100}$
- $x-1 = -(2 + \frac{m}{100})$, which gives $x = -1 - \frac{m}{100}$

For equation 2, we have two cases:
- $x-1 = 2 + \frac{2m}{100}$, which gives $x = 3 + \frac{2m}{100}$
- $x-1 = -(2 + \frac{2m}{100})$, which gives $x = -1 - \frac{2m}{100}$

For each of these cases, we need to ensure that the solutions are distinct and satisfy the conditions $2 + \frac{m}{100} > 0$ and $2 + \frac{2m}{100} > 0$, which implies $m < 50$.

After checking these conditions for each case, we find that only $m=25$ satisfies all the conditions.

Substituting $m=25$ into the equations, we find that the four distinct solutions are:
\[x = 3 + \frac{25}{100} = 3.25\]
\[x = -1 - \frac{25}{100} = -1.25\]
\[x = 3 + \frac{2*25}{100} = 3.5\]
\[x = -1 - \frac{2*25}{100} = -1.5\]

Therefore, the only positive integer value of $m$ that satisfies the conditions is $m=25$.
The answer is: $25$

Interesting, let's analyze step by step:



The equation has four distinct solutions, which means the right side of the equation $\frac{m}{100}$ must be $2$. This is because the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert$ can have at most four distinct solutions. When $\frac{m}{100}=2$, the equation becomes $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=2$, and this equation indeed has four distinct solutions.

So we have $m=200$. Now we need to check if $m=200$ is a positive integer. Obviously it is.

So the number of positive integers $m$ is $1$.
The answer is: $1$

We want to find the number of positive integers $m$ such that the equation \[\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}\] has $4$ distinct solutions.

This equation is a piecewise function with four cases, based on the absolute value inside. We can solve each case separately and then sum up the number of solutions for each case.

Case 1: $\vert x-1 \vert -2 = \frac{m}{100}$
Case 2: $-\vert x-1 \vert +2 = \frac{m}{100}$
Case 3: $-\vert x-1 \vert -2 = \frac{m}{100}$
Case 4: $\vert x-1 \vert +2 = \frac{m}{100}$

For each of these cases, we need to solve for $x$, and then count the number of distinct solutions. The total number of distinct solutions is the sum of the solutions for each case.

To implement this in sympy, we can use `sympy.solveset` to solve each equation for $x$, and `sympy.cardinality` to count the number of distinct solutions.

However, as we are asked to find the number of positive integers $m$, it is more efficient to analyze the piecewise function directly and count the number of solutions for each case.

After analyzing the piecewise function, we find that only the first and fourth cases have 2 distinct solutions each. The second and third cases have no solutions. Therefore, the total number of distinct solutions is 4.

This means that for any positive integer $m$, the equation \[\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}\] has exactly 4 distinct solutions.

To verify that the number of solutions is indeed 4, we can substitute $m = 200$ into the equation and solve it for $x$. The equation becomes:

\[\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{200}{100}\]
\[\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=2\]

Solving this equation, we find that it indeed has 4 distinct solutions: $x = -1, 3, 5, 7$.

Therefore, the number of positive integers $m$ such that the equation has 4 distinct solutions is 1.
The answer is: $1$

Interesting, let's analyze step by step:



1. Let's denote $f(x) = \vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert$. We need to find $m$ such that the equation $f(x) = \frac{m}{100}$ has 4 distinct solutions.
2. The function $f(x)$ will be equal to $\frac{m}{100}$ at 4 different points. The function $f(x)$ is a "V" shape with the points of the "V" at $x=1-2 = -1$ and $x=1+2 = 3$. So, $f(x) = \frac{m}{100}$ will have 4 solutions if $\frac{m}{100}$ falls strictly between the values of $f(x)$ at the endpoints of the interval where $f(x)$ is decreasing.
3. The function $f(x)$ is decreasing on the interval $[-1, 3]$. The value of $f(x)$ at $x=-1$ is $\vert \vert -1 - 1 \vert - 2 \vert = \vert -2 - 2 \vert = 4$. The value of $f(x)$ at $x=3$ is $\vert \vert 3 - 1 \vert - 2 \vert = \vert 2 - 2 \vert = 0$. So, $f(x) = \frac{m}{100}$ will have 4 solutions if $0 < \frac{m}{100} < 4$.
4. Multiplying through by 100, we see that $0 < m < 400$. The number of possible integer values of $m$ is therefore 399. But we must subtract 1 to exclude the case where $m=0$, so there are 398 possible values of $m$.
5. However, we are asked to find the number of positive integer values of $m$. Since $m=0$ is excluded, there are 398 positive integer values of $m$.

Now, we need to find out how many of these 398 values satisfy the condition that $f(x) = \frac{m}{100}$ has exactly 4 distinct solutions. This would require a more detailed analysis of the behavior of $f(x)$ and the solutions of the equation $f(x) = \frac{m}{100}$ for each value of $m$. However, we can simplify this problem and realize that for each value of $m$, the equation $f(x) = \frac{m}{100}$ will have exactly 4 distinct solutions if and only if $\frac{m}{100}$ falls strictly between the values of $f(x)$ at the endpoints of the interval where $f(x)$ is decreasing. This happens exactly once for each value of $m$ in the range $0 < m < 400$. Therefore, the number of positive integer values of $m$ for which the equation $f(x) = \frac{m}{100}$ has exactly 4 distinct solutions is also 398.

Therefore, the number of positive integer values of $m$ for which the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has $4$ distinct solutions is 398. This value is indeed a positive integer, so it's valid.

The value of $m$ for which the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has $4$ distinct solutions is 398. The answer is: $398$

Interesting, let's analyze step by step:



The equation \[\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}\] has $4$ distinct solutions. 

This equation involves absolute values, which can be tricky to work with. However, we know that the absolute value function $|x|$ can be written as:
\[ |x| = \begin{cases} 
      x & \text{if } x \geq 0 \\
      -x & \text{if } x < 0 
   \end{cases}
\]
This means that we can split the absolute value function into two separate cases: one for when the value inside the absolute value is positive, and one for when it's negative.

So, we can rewrite our equation as:
\[\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100} \rightarrow \begin{cases} 
      \vert x-1 \vert -2 = \frac{m}{100} \\
      -\vert x-1 \vert +2 = \frac{m}{100} 
   \end{cases}\]

Now, we can solve each case separately:

For the first case, $\vert x-1 \vert -2 = \frac{m}{100}$:
\[\vert x-1 \vert = \frac{m}{100} + 2\]
\[x-1 = \frac{m}{100} + 2 \text{ or } x-1 = -\frac{m}{100} - 2\]
\[x = \frac{m}{100} + 3 \text{ or } x = -\frac{m}{100} + 1\]

For the second case, $-\vert x-1 \vert +2 = \frac{m}{100}$:
\[-\vert x-1 \vert = \frac{m}{100} - 2\]
\[\vert x-1 \vert = - \frac{m}{100} + 2\]
\[x-1 = -\frac{m}{100} + 2 \text{ or } x-1 = \frac{m}{100} - 2\]
\[x = -\frac{m}{100} + 3 \text{ or } x = \frac{m}{100} - 1\]

So, we have a total of 8 possible solutions:
\[x = \frac{m}{100} + 3, -\frac{m}{100} + 3, \frac{m}{100} - 1, -\frac{m}{100} + 1\]

For the equation to have 4 distinct solutions, two of these solutions must be equal. This happens when the absolute values inside the equations are equal. Let's set these equal to each other:
\[\frac{m}{100} + 3 = -\frac{m}{100} + 3 \Rightarrow \frac{m}{50} = 0 \Rightarrow m = 0\]
\[\frac{m}{100} + 3 = \frac{m}{100} - 1 \Rightarrow 3 = -1 \text{ (This is not possible)}\]
\[\frac{m}{100} + 3 = -\frac{m}{100} - 1 \Rightarrow \frac{m}{50} = -4 \Rightarrow m = -80 \text{ (This is not positive)}\]
\[-\frac{m}{100} + 3 = \frac{m}{100} - 1 \Rightarrow \frac{m}{50} = 4 \Rightarrow m = 200 \text{ (This is positive)}\]

Thus, the only value of $m$ that results in 4 distinct solutions is $m = 200$. Since $200$ is a positive integer, the answer is $\boxed{1}$.
The answer is: 1
