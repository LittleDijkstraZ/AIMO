Approach:


To have four distinct solutions for the equation $| |x-1| - 2 | = \frac{m}{100}$,
the right-hand side $\frac{m}{100}$ must be strictly greater than $2$.
Thus, we have $\frac{m}{100} > 2$, which implies $m > 200$.
Now, we consider the number of integers between $200$ and $10000$ (inclusive) that satisfy the equation.
For each integer $m$ in this range, we can determine the number of solutions by checking the number of times the absolute value expression $| |x-1| - 2 |$ is equal to $\frac{m}{100}$.

For example, when $m=201$, we have $| |x-1| - 2 | = 2.01$.
Since the absolute value of a real number cannot be equal to a number that is not an integer,
this equation has no solutions.
Similarly, for $m=202$, we have $| |x-1| - 2 | = 2.02$, which also has no solutions.
However, for $m=203$, we have $| |x-1| - 2 | = 2.03$.
The absolute value expression $| |x-1| - 2 |$ is equal to $2.03$ at $x = 3.015$ and $x = 0.985$,
which are both distinct solutions.

We can continue this process for each integer $m$ in the range $200 < m \le 10000$.
The number of integers $m$ that result in four distinct solutions is the number of integers $m$ for which the absolute value expression $| |x-1| - 2 |$ is equal to $\frac{m}{100}$ exactly four times.

After performing the above process, we find that there is only one such integer $m$, which is $m=203$.
Therefore, there is only one positive integer $m$ for which the equation has four distinct solutions.
The answer is: 1

Approach:



We are given the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ and we want to find how many positive integer values of $m$ make the equation have 4 distinct solutions.

Step 1: Analyze the equation

The equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ is a piecewise function with 4 cases to consider. The function splits into 4 cases based on the absolute value expression inside the absolute value, i.e., $\vert x-1 \vert -2$. The cases are as follows:

Case 1: $x \ge 3$, the equation becomes $\vert x-3 \vert = \frac{m}{100}$.
Case 2: $1 < x < 3$, the equation becomes $\vert x-1-2 \vert = \vert x-3 \vert = \frac{m}{100}$.
Case 3: $x = 1$, the equation becomes $\vert -2 \vert = 2 = \frac{m}{100}$.
Case 4: $x \le 1$, the equation becomes $\vert 1-x-2 \vert = \vert -x-1 \vert = \frac{m}{100}$.

Step 2: Determine the possible values of m

From case 3, we have $2 = \frac{m}{100}$, so $m = 200$.
From cases 1 and 4, we can see that the left side of the equation is always non-negative. Therefore, the right side $\frac{m}{100}$ must be non-negative, so $m \ge 0$.
From cases 1 and 2, the left side of the equation is always less than or equal to 2, therefore, the right side $\frac{m}{100}$ must be less than or equal to 2, so $m \le 200$.

Step 3: Count the number of positive integer values of m

The positive integer values of $m$ that satisfy $0 \le m \le 200$ are the integers from 1 to 200. Since we know that $m=200$ makes the equation have 4 distinct solutions, we need to count the other values of $m$ that also result in 4 distinct solutions.

After analyzing the cases, we can see that the equation has 4 distinct solutions when $\frac{m}{100}$ is strictly between 0 and 2. This corresponds to the integer values of $m$ from 1 to 199.

Therefore, the number of positive integer values of $m$ that make the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ have 4 distinct solutions is the number of integers from 1 to 199, inclusive.

Counting these integers gives us 199. However, we have already counted $m=200$ in our analysis, so we must add 1 to account for this.

Therefore, the number of positive integer values of $m$ that make the equation have 4 distinct solutions is 199 + 1 = 200.
The answer is: $200$

Approach:


To have four distinct solutions for the given equation, the expression inside the absolute value on the right-hand side, which is $\frac{m}{100}$, must be equal to either $2$ or $0$. 

1. If $\frac{m}{100}=2$, we get $m=200$.
2. If $\frac{m}{100}=0$, we get $m=0$.

However, the problem asks for positive integers $m$, so $m=0$ is not a valid solution. Therefore, there is only one value of $m$ that makes the equation have four distinct solutions, which is $m=200$.

```python


INTERMEDIATE OUT :

def count_positive_integers():
    # Define the value of m
    m = 200

    # Count the number of positive integers
    count = 1 if m > 0 else 0

    return count

result = count_positive_integers()
print(result)
```

Approach:


The absolute value equation $|x - 1| - 2 = \frac{m}{100}$ has 4 distinct solutions if and only if the value of $\frac{m}{100}$ lies strictly between 2 and 3. This is because the equation $|x - 1| - 2 = y$ has 4 distinct solutions if and only if $0 < y < 1$. In our case, $y = \frac{m}{100}$, so we need $0 < \frac{m}{100} < 1$, which gives $0 < m < 100$. Therefore, the number of positive integers $m$ that satisfy this condition is the number of integers from 1 to 99, which is 99.

So, the number of positive integers $m$ for which the equation $||x - 1| - 2| = \frac{m}{100}$ has 4 distinct solutions is 99. The answer is: $99$

Approach:

 To count the number of positive integer solutions, we need to find the number of values of $m$ such that the equation $| |x - 1| - 2| = \frac{m}{100}$ has 4 distinct solutions. We know that the expression $| |x - 1| - 2|$ can take on a maximum of 3 values for different values of $x$. So we need to find the number of values of $m$ such that the equation has exactly 4 distinct solutions.

The equation $| |x - 1| - 2| = \frac{m}{100}$ has 4 distinct solutions if and only if $\frac{m}{100}$ is strictly less than 2 but strictly greater than 0. This is because $| |x - 1| - 2|$ can take on exactly 4 distinct values when it is equal to a number strictly less than 2 but strictly greater than 0.

This gives us the inequality $0 < \frac{m}{100} < 2$. Multiplying all sides of the inequality by 100 gives $0 < m < 200$. So the positive integer solutions for $m$ are the integers from 1 to 199. Therefore, there are 199 positive integer solutions.

The answer is: $199$

"For how many positive integers $m$ does the equation \[\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}\] have $4$ distinct solutions?"
Write comments to indicate the steps you take. Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Assistant:

Approach:


The equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has $4$ distinct solutions if and only if $\frac{m}{100} = 1$. This is because the function $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert$ has $4$ distinct maximum and minimum values on the interval $[0, 3]$. These maximum and minimum values are $3$ and $1$ respectively.

Solution:
Setting $\frac{m}{100} = 1$, we can solve for $m$ as follows:
\[m = 100.\]

So the only positive integer $m$ for which the equation has $4$ distinct solutions is $100$. Therefore, the answer is $\boxed{1}$.

Note: This solution is based on the observation that the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has $4$ distinct solutions if and only if $\frac{m}{100}$ is equal to one of the maximum or minimum values of the function $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert$ on the interval $[0, 3]$. Since the maximum and minimum values of this function are $3$ and $1$ respectively, and we are looking for the case where $\frac{m}{100}$ equals one of these values, we find that the only such value is $1$. Hence, $m=100$ is the only positive integer value that satisfies the condition. The answer is: $1$
