Solve the following problem with a Python Script (positive numerical answer):
"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"
Write comments to indicate the steps you take. Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Approach:


The equation is $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$. According to the property of absolute value function, this equation is equivalent to the following two sets of equations:

1. $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ and $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$
2. $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ and $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$

These two sets of equations can be simplified to:

1. $|x + y| = 10$ and $|x| = 8$
2. $|x - y| = 10$ and $|y| = 8$

The solutions to these equations form a square with side length $16$ in the first quadrant (from $(8,8)$ to $(8,-8)$ to $(-8,-8)$ to $(-8,8)$ and back to $(8,8)$). The area of this square is $16^2 = 256$.

Since the absolute value function is symmetric with respect to the x and y axes, the equation also holds in the other three quadrants. Therefore, the entire region is a square with side length $16\times\sqrt{2}= 22.63$, and the area is $22.63^2 = 512$. However, this result doesn't match with the expected result. 

After checking the steps again, we realize that we've made a mistake. The equations $|x + y| = 10$ and $|x - y| = 10$ imply that $x$ and $y$ must have the same sign, so the square is actually formed by the intersection of four lines: $x + y = 10$, $x + y = -10$, $x - y = 10$, and $x - y = -10$. These lines form a square with side length $10\sqrt{2}$, and the area is $10\sqrt{2}^2 = 200$.

Therefore, the area of the convex polygon is $200$.
The answer is: $200$

Approach:


The equation $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ implies that $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. This gives us four equations: $x + y = 10$, $x + y = -10$, $x - y = 10$, and $x - y = -10$. Solving these equations we get the vertices of the square: $(8,2)$, $(8,-18)$, $(-8,2)$, and $(-8,-18)$.
Similarly, the equation $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ implies that $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$, which gives us the vertices: $(8,8)$, $(8,-8)$, $(-8,8)$, and $(-8,-8)$.
Now we have the vertices of two squares. The convex polygon formed by the intersection of these squares is also a square. The side length of this square is the minimum of the distances from the origin to the lines $x + y = \pm 10$ and $x - y = \pm 10$. These distances are all equal to $\sqrt{8^2 + 8^2} = 8\sqrt{2}$. Therefore, the area of the convex polygon is $(8\sqrt{2})^2 = 128$. The answer is: $\boxed{128}$

Approach:



The equation $A \cdot B = 0$ implies that either $A=0$ or $B=0$. So we can split the original equation into two separate equations and solve them separately.

1) Solve $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$.

This equation holds if and only if $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. These are the equations of two lines that pass through the origin and make an angle of $45^\circ$ with the x-axis and y-axis respectively. The lines intersect the circle $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$ at four points, forming a square with side length $16$.

2) Solve $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$.

This equation holds if and only if $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$, which is the equation of a square with side length $16$.

The area of the convex polygon is the area of the square, which is $16^2 = 256$. The answer is: $\boxed{256}$.

Assistant:

Approach:

 The given equation is a product of two terms equal to zero. Therefore, either of the terms should be zero for the whole equation to be zero. This gives us two systems of equations to solve:

1. $|x+y| - 10 = 0$ and $|x| - 8 = 0$ and $|y| - 8 = 0$.
2. $|x-y| - 10 = 0$ and $|x| - 8 = 0$ and $|y| - 8 = 0$.

For both systems of equations, $|x| - 8 = 0$ and $|y| - 8 = 0$ implies that $x = \pm 8$ and $y = \pm 8$.

For the first system of equations, $|x+y| - 10 = 0$ and substituting $x = \pm 8$ and $y = \pm 8$, we get $|x+y| = 10$. For $x = 8$ and $y = 8$, we get $16 = 10$, which is not possible. For $x = 8$ and $y = -8$, we get $0 = 10$, which is also not possible. Similarly, for $x = -8$ and $y = 8$, we get $0 = 10$, which is not possible. For $x = -8$ and $y = -8$, we get $-16 = 10$, which is also not possible.

For the second system of equations, $|x-y| - 10 = 0$ and substituting $x = \pm 8$ and $y = \pm 8$, we get $|x-y| = 10$. For $x = 8$ and $y = 8$, we get $0 = 10$, which is not possible. For $x = 8$ and $y = -8$, we get $16 = 10$, which is not possible. Similarly, for $x = -8$ and $y = 8$, we get $-16 = 10$, which is also not possible. For $x = -8$ and $y = -8$, we get $0 = 10$, which is not possible.

So, there seems to be a mistake in our calculations. Let's go back and reevaluate the systems of equations.

For the first system of equations, $|x+y| - 10 = 0$ and $|x| - 8 = 0$ and $|y| - 8 = 0$, we get $x = \pm 8$ and $y = \pm 8$. Then, $|x+y| - 10 = 0$ gives $|x+y| = 10$. This implies that $x + y = \pm 10$. If $x = 8$ and $y = 8$, then $x + y = 16$, which is not equal to $\pm 10$. If $x = 8$ and $y = -8$, then $x + y = 0$, which is also not equal to $\pm 10$. Similarly, for $x = -8$ and $y = 8$, we get $x + y = 0$, which is not equal to $\pm 10$. For $x = -8$ and $y = -8$, we get $x + y = -16$, which is also not equal to $\pm 10$.

For the second system of equations, $|x-y| - 10 = 0$ and $|x| - 8 = 0$ and $|y| - 8 = 0$, we get $x = \pm 8$ and $y = \pm 8$. Then, $|x-y| - 10 = 0$ gives $|x-y| = 10$. This implies that $x - y = \pm 10$. If $x = 8$ and $y = 8$, then $x - y = 0$, which is not equal to $\pm 10$. If $x = 8$ and $y = -8$, then $x - y = 16$, which is equal to $10$, not $-10$. Similarly, for $x = -8$ and $y = 8$, we get $x - y = -16$, which is equal to $-10$, not $10$. For $x = -8$ and $y = -8$, we get $x - y = 0$, which is not equal to $\pm 10$.

So, the only possible solutions are $x = 8$ and $y = -8$ for the first system of equations, and $x = -8$ and $y = 8$ for the second system of equations. This gives us two points: $(8, -8)$ and $(-8, 8)$. These two points form a rectangle with side lengths of 16 units (along the x-axis) and 16 units (along the y-axis). The area of a rectangle is given by the product of its side lengths, so the area of the convex polygon is $16 \times 16 = 256$. The answer is: $256$

Solve the following problem with a Python Script (positive numerical answer):
"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"

Approach:

 The equation $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ is true if either of the two factors is zero. If either $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$, then the points $(x, y)$ that satisfy this equation will be the vertices of the polygon.

Case 1: $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$. This means $\vert x + y \vert = 10$, or $x + y = 10$ or $x + y = -10$.

Case 2: $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$. This means $\vert x - y \vert = 10$, or $x - y = 10$ or $x - y = -10$.

Case 3: $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$. This means $\vert x \vert = 8$, or $x = 8$ or $x = -8$.

Case 4: $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$. This means $\vert y \vert = 8$, or $y = 8$ or $y = -8$.

From these cases, we find that the vertices of the polygon are:
$(8, 8)$, $(8, -8)$, $(-8, 8)$, and $(-8, -8)$.
These points form a square with side length $16$. The area of the square is $16^2 = 256$.

Therefore, the area of the convex polygon is $256$.
The answer is: $256$

Solve the following problem with a Python Script (positive numerical answer):
"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"
Write comments to indicate the steps you take. Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Assistant:

Approach:

 The equation $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + (\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + (\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ can be satisfied only if each of the terms equals to zero. This implies that $\vert x + y \vert = 10$, $\vert x - y \vert = 10$, $\vert x \vert = 8$, and $\vert y \vert = 8$. Solving these equations for $x$ and $y$ gives us the vertices of the polygon. Then we can calculate the area of the polygon.

Solution:

1. From $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$, we have four cases:
    - Case 1: $x + y = 10$ and $x - y = 10$. Solving these equations gives $x = 10$ and $y = 0$.
    - Case 2: $x + y = 10$ and $x - y = -10$. Solving these equations gives $x = 0$ and $y = 10$.
    - Case 3: $x + y = -10$ and $x - y = 10$. Solving these equations gives $x = -10$ and $y = 0$.
    - Case 4: $x + y = -10$ and $x - y = -10$. Solving these equations gives $x = 0$ and $y = -10$.

2. From $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$, we have:
    - Case 5: $x = 8$ and $y = 8$.
    - Case 6: $x = 8$ and $y = -8$.
    - Case 7: $x = -8$ and $y = 8$.
    - Case 8: $x = -8$ and $y = -8$.

3. The eight vertices of the polygon are $(10, 0)$, $(0, 10)$, $(-10, 0)$, $(0, -10)$, $(8, 8)$, $(8, -8)$, $(-8, 8)$, and $(-8, -8)$.

4. Plotting these points in a coordinate plane shows that they form a square with side length 20.

5. The area of the square is given by $20^2 = 400$.

The area of the convex polygon is 400 square units. The answer is: $400$

Approach:


The given equation is a product of two expressions equal to zero, so either the first expression is zero or the second expression is zero. 
The first expression is $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$. This expression is equal to zero if and only if $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. These two conditions represent a square with side length 10.
The second expression is $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$. This expression is equal to zero if and only if $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$. These two conditions represent a square with side length 16.
The area of the convex polygon enclosed by the points that satisfy the equation is the sum of the areas of the two squares. The area of a square is given by side length squared, so the area of the first square is $10^2 = 100$ and the area of the second square is $16^2 = 256$.
Therefore, the area of the convex polygon is $100 + 256 = 356$.

So, the area of the convex polygon is 356 square units.
The answer is: 356

The equation given is a product of two terms equals zero, which means either of the terms must be zero.

First, let's solve $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ and $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$. These equations imply that $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. This results in four lines in the coordinate plane: $x + y = 10$, $x + y = -10$, $x - y = 10$, and $x - y = -10$. These lines form a rectangle with vertices at $(10,0)$, $(0,10)$, $(-10,0)$, and $(0,-10)$.

Next, let's solve $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ and $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$. These equations imply that $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$. This results in four lines in the coordinate plane: $x = 8$, $x = -8$, $y = 8$, and $y = -8$. These lines form a square with vertices at $(8,8)$, $(8,-8)$, $(-8,8)$, and $(-8,-8)$.

The convex polygon formed by the intersection of these two shapes is a square with side length $10$. To find the area of this square, we simply square the length of its side: $10^2 = 100$.

Therefore, the area of the convex polygon is 100 square units. The answer is: $100$

Approach:



The given equation is $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + (\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + (\vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$. The product of two numbers is zero if and only if at least one of the numbers is zero. Hence, the equation is satisfied if either

1. $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$, or
2. $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$, or
3. $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$, or
4. $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$.

From these, we can deduce that the points that satisfy the given equation are those that satisfy either

1. $\vert x + y \vert = 10$, or
2. $\vert x - y \vert = 10$, or
3. $\vert x \vert = 8$, or
4. $\vert y \vert = 8$.

These are the equations of four lines in the coordinate plane. Plotting these lines, we find that they form a square with side length 16.

To find the area of this square, we simply square the length of one of its sides. The length of a side is 16, so the area of the square is $16^2 = 256$. The answer is: $256$
