Below is a math problem you are to solve (positive numerical answer!):
"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"
Analyze this problem and think step by step to come to a solution with programs. After solving the problem, output the final numerical answer within \boxed{}.

 The given equation is a product of two terms equal to zero, which means either of the terms has to be zero for the whole expression to be zero. So we have two cases:

1. $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ or $\vert x + y \vert = 10$. This means $x + y = 10$ or $x + y = -10$.
2. $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ or $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. This means $x - y = 10$ or $x - y = -10$.
3. $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ or $\vert x \vert = 8$. This means $x = 8$ or $x = -8$.
4. $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ or $\vert y \vert = 8$. This means $y = 8$ or $y = -8$.

The solutions to these equations are the vertices of the polygon. By plotting these vertices on a graph and calculating the area enclosed by the polygon, we can find the area of the polygon. The vertices of the polygon are $(8, 2)$, $(8, -2)$, $(-8, 2)$, $(-8, -2)$, $(2, 8)$, $(-2, 8)$, $(2, -8)$, and $(-2, -8)$. The polygon is a square with side length of 16 units. The area of the square is $16^2 = 256$. So the area of the convex polygon is 256 square units. The answer is: $256$

 The given equation is of the form $(A)(B) = 0$, which means that either $A = 0$ or $B = 0$.
For the first part, $A = (\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$. This implies that $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. This gives us the lines $x + y = 10$, $x + y = -10$, $x - y = 10$, and $x - y = -10$. These lines form a rectangle.
For the second part, $B = (\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$. This implies that $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$, which gives us the lines $x = 8$, $x = -8$, $y = 8$, and $y = -8$. These lines form a square.
The intersection of the two sets of lines is a square with side length 10, so the area of the convex polygon is $10^2 = 100$. The answer is: $100$

The equation given is a product of two terms equal to zero, so either the first term is zero or the second term is zero. Let's analyze each term separately.

For the first term, we have $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ and $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$. This implies that $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. This gives us four lines: $x + y = 10$, $x + y = -10$, $x - y = 10$, and $x - y = -10$. These lines form a rectangle with vertices at $(10, 0)$, $(0, 10)$, $(-10, 0)$, and $(0, -10)$.

For the second term, we have $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ and $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$. This implies that $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$. This gives us four lines: $x = 8$, $x = -8$, $y = 8$, and $y = -8$. These lines form a rectangle with vertices at $(8, 8)$, $(-8, 8)$, $(-8, -8)$, and $(8, -8)$.

The intersection of the two rectangles is a square with side length 10 (the smaller of the two lengths). The area of this square is $10^2 = 100$. So, the area of the convex polygon is 100.

Here is a Python function to calculate the area of the polygon:
```python


INTERMEDIATE OUT :

def polygon_area():
    """The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"""
    side_length = 10
    area = side_length ** 2
    return area

result = polygon_area()
print(result)
```

CODE RESULTS 100

INTERMEDIATE OUT :
```output
100
```
The area of the convex polygon is $100$. The answer is $\boxed{100}$.

Analyze this problem and think step by step to come to a solution with programs. After solving the problem, output the final numerical answer within \boxed{}.

Assistant:

 The equation given is $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$. For the product of two numbers to be zero, either one of the numbers must be zero. Thus, we have two cases:

1. $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$.
2. $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ and $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$.

For the first case, if $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$, then both $\vert x + y \vert - 10 = 0$ and $\vert x - y \vert - 10 = 0$, which implies $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. This gives us four lines: $x + y = \pm10$ and $x - y = \pm10$. The intersection points of these lines form a square with side length 20. The area of this square is $20^2 = 400$.

For the second case, if $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$, then both $\vert x \vert - 8 = 0$ and $\vert y \vert - 8 = 0$, which implies $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$. This gives us four lines: $x = \pm8$ and $y = \pm8$. The intersection points of these lines form a square with side length 16. The area of this square is $16^2 = 256$.

However, the second case is not possible because it would mean both $\vert x + y \vert - 10 = 0$ and $\vert x - y \vert - 10 = 0$ which contradicts the first case. Therefore, the area of the convex polygon is 400. The answer is: $400$

The given equation is equal to zero if and only if both factors are equal to zero. 
For the first factor, we have $|x+y| - 10 = 0$ and $|x-y| - 10 = 0$, which means $|x+y| = 10$ and $|x-y| = 10$.
For the second factor, we have $|x| - 8 = 0$ and $|y| - 8 = 0$, which means $|x| = 8$ and $|y| = 8$.

The solutions to $|x+y| = 10$ are all points $(x, y)$ such that $x+y = 10$ or $x+y = -10$.
The solutions to $|x-y| = 10$ are all points $(x, y)$ such that $x-y = 10$ or $x-y = -10$.
The solutions to $|x| = 8$ are all points $(x, y)$ such that $x = 8$ or $x = -8$.
The solutions to $|y| = 8$ are all points $(x, y)$ such that $y = 8$ or $y = -8$.

The intersection of these solutions forms a square with side length 16. The area of this square is $16^2 = 256$. So the area of the convex polygon is 256 square units.

The python code to calculate the area of the square is:

```python


INTERMEDIATE OUT :

def area_of_square():
    side_length = 16
    area = side_length ** 2
    return area

result = area_of_square()
print(result)
```

```output

```
The area of the convex polygon is 256 square units. The answer is $\boxed{256}$.

"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"

 The equation given is a product of two expressions equal to zero. This means that either the first expression is zero or the second expression is zero.

The first expression is $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)$ and the second expression is $((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2)$.

If the first expression is zero, then $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. This implies that $x + y = \pm 10$ and $x - y = \pm 10$. Solving these equations gives us the coordinates of the vertices of the polygon.

Similarly, if the second expression is zero, then $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$. This implies that $x = \pm 8$ and $y = \pm 8$. Solving these equations gives us the coordinates of the vertices of the polygon.

The polygon is a square with side length 16. The area of a square is given by the square of its side length. Therefore, the area of the polygon is $16^2 = 256$.
The answer is: $256$
