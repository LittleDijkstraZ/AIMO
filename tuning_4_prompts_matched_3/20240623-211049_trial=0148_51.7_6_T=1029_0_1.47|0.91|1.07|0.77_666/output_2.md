 The problem asks for the number of positive integer values of $m$ for which the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has 4 distinct solutions.

To determine the number of solutions, we need to consider how many times the expression $\frac{m}{100}$ intersects the graph of the function $f(x) = \vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert$.

The graph of $f(x)$ is a series of V-shapes, each of height 1 and base 4. The intersections occur at every 0.01 units above the base of the V-shape (except for the top of each V-shape). Therefore, the number of integer values of $m$ for which the equation has 4 distinct solutions is equal to the number of spaces (not including the tops) between the V-shapes of $f(x)$.

From the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$, we can see that the "troughs" of the V-shapes occur at $x = 1 \pm 2$, giving $x = -1, 3$. Therefore, the distance between the troughs is 4, and the number of "gaps" (the number of integer values of $m$) is the distance minus 1, or 3.

So, the number of positive integer values of $m$ for which the equation has 4 distinct solutions is 3.
The value of $m$ is 3.
The answer is: $3$

 The function $| |x-1| -2 |$ has a graph which is a ${\bf ‘V’}$ shape, with the ‘bottom’ of the ‘V’ at $x = 1$. This means that the equation $||x-1| -2| = \frac{m}{100}$ has four solutions exactly when $0 < \frac{m}{100} \le 2$. Solving the inequalities, we get $0 < m \le 200$. But $m$ has to be an integer, so the number of integers in this range from 1 to 200 is 200.

But we need to start counting from 1 in the range 0 to 200. Therefore, the integer values of $m$ are the first 200 positive integers. However, $m$ must be a positive integer, and thus we have to list the positive integers from 1 to 200 exactly once. The number of positive integers from 1 to 200, inclusive, is 200. Therefore, the number of positive integers $m$ is 200. The answer is: $200$

 This problem involves the number of solutions of an absolute value equation and understanding the properties of absolute value functions.

To solve the given equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ which has $4$ distinct solutions, we need to analyze the function $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert$.

The function $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert$ takes on the value of $0$ at $x=1\pm2$, and hence takes on the value of $2-2=0$ at $x=3$ and $x=-1$. This is because the function $\vert x-1 \vert$ equals to $1$ when $x=1$, and the function $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert$ equals to $0$ when $\vert x-1 \vert = 2$, hence $x=1\pm2$.

So the graph of $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert$ consists of two pieces of graph, one for $x \le -1$, and the other for $x \ge 3$. Each piece is a "V" shape graph. For $x \le -1$, the "V" shape is upside down, reaching its minimum value at $x=-1$, where the function equals to $0$. For $x \ge 3$, the "V" shape is right side up, reaching its minimum value at $x=3$, where the function also equals to $0$. The distance between the two "horns" of each "V" shape graph is $2$.

The equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ will have $4$ distinct solutions if $\frac{m}{100}=2$, that is, $m=200$.
So, there is only one positive integer $m$ that satisfies this condition, namely $m=200$. Therefore, the number of positive integers $m$ for which the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has $4$ distinct solutions is $1$. The answer is: $1$

Below is a math problem you are to solve (positive numerical answer!):
"For how many positive integers $m$ does the equation \[\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}\] have $4$ distinct solutions?"
Analyze this problem and think step by step to come to a solution with programs. After solving the problem, output the final numerical answer within \boxed{}.

Assistant:

 First, we can set $y = |x - 1| - 2$ so the original equation is $|y| = \frac{m}{100}$.
Solving this gives two cases:
- $y = \frac{m}{100}$
- $-y = \frac{m}{100}$ or $y = -\frac{m}{100}$.

Now, we have two sub-equations:
1) $|x - 1| - 2 = \frac{m}{100}$
2) $|x - 1| - 2 = -\frac{m}{100}$.

For the first equation, $|x - 1| = \frac{m}{100} + 2$. This equation has two solutions if $\frac{m}{100} + 2 > 0$.

For the second equation, $|x - 1| = 2 - \frac{m}{100}$. This equation has two solutions if $2 - \frac{m}{100} > 0$.

So we need to find the range of $m$ for which both conditions are satisfied. This happens when $0 < \frac{m}{100} + 2 < 2 - \frac{m}{100}$, or equivalently, $-2 < \frac{m}{100} < 0$. 

To translate this into an interval for $m$, we multiply all parts of the inequality by $100$, to obtain $-200 < m < 0$. 

However, since $m$ is a positive integer, there are no positive integers in this interval, so no positive integer values of $m$ work. 

Now, we reconsider the absolute value equations. Notice that the conditions for the two equations to have 2 solutions are mutually exclusive (the solutions cannot both exist for the same value of $m$). However, we know that a total of 4 solutions is desired.

When $m = 0$, the original equation becomes $| |x - 1| - 2 | = 0$, or $|x - 1| = 2$. This yields two solutions: $x = 3$ and $x = -1$. So $m = 0$ is not a valid solution.

The only way for the original equation to have 4 solutions is for each of the two equations to have exactly one solution (in other words, to pinch one of the absolute value functions at $y = 0$). This occurs when one of the sub-equations has no solution and the other has exactly two solutions.

Let's examine the two sub-equations again.
For the first equation, $|x - 1| - 2 = \frac{m}{100}$, it has exactly two solutions when $\frac{m}{100} + 2 > 0$.
For the second equation, $|x - 1| - 2 = -\frac{m}{100}$, it has exactly two solutions when $2 - \frac{m}{100} > 0$.
We need to satisfy one of the inequalities and not the other. 

After some analysis, we find that the first equation has exactly two solutions when $m > 200$ and the second equation has exactly two solutions when $m < 200$. So the only value of $m$ that works is $m = 200$. However, this would mean the two sub-equations become the same, so this cannot be the case.

After further analysis, we realize that our logic is incorrect. We should not think of the two sub-equations as "pinching" the original equation at $y = 0$. In fact, there's no reason for both equations to have the same number of solutions, as they correspond to two completely separate absolute value functions. We should simply require one of the equations to have two solutions and the other to have none, and the two solutions should come from different sub-equations (this prevents the two sub-equations from "colliding" and losing a solution in the process).

After further analysis, we find that the first equation, $|x - 1| - 2 = \frac{m}{100}$, has two solutions when $\frac{m}{100} + 2 > 0$, which simplifies to $m > -200$. The second equation, $|x - 1| - 2 = -\frac{m}{100}$, has no solution when $2 - \frac{m}{100} \leq 0$, which simplifies to $m \geq 200$. The intersection of these two conditions is $200 > m > -200$, which allows us to conclude that $m = 200$ is the only solution that works.

Therefore, the value of $m$ that makes the equation $| |x - 1| - 2 | = \frac{m}{100}$ have exactly 4 distinct solutions is $m = 200$. The problem statement asks for a numerical answer, so our final answer is $\boxed{200}$. However, due to our error in the initial logic, we realize we have misunderstood the problem. The question is asking for how many positive integers $m$ such that the equation has $4$ distinct solutions. The problem was wrongly analyzed by initially considering the solutions of the sub-equations as "pinching" the original equation. We've reanalyzed the problem and found that the only value of $m$ that makes the equation have 4 solutions is indeed $m = 200$. The confusion comes from the misunderstanding of the problem. We wrongly assumed the solutions from the two sub-equations "pinch" the original equation, but in reality, this is not the case. By reanalyzing the problem and considering the cases carefully, we realized that there was an error in our initial logic. In fact, the two sub-equations are completely separate and there's no reason for them to have the same number of solutions. The original problem seems to confuse the concept of pinching with the number of solutions. However, by carefully analyzing the problem and considering different cases, we are able to find the correct solution. It is true that $m = 200$ makes the equation have exactly 4 solutions, but the problem was asking for how many positive integers $m$ such that the equation has $4$ distinct solutions. The confusion comes from our misunderstanding the problem. We wrongly assumed the solutions from the sub-equations pinch the original equation. In reality, this is not the case.

Assistant:

 The inequality $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has four distinct solutions.
By applying the property of absolute value, we can rewrite the inequality into two cases:
\[
\vert x - 1 \vert - 2 = \pm \frac{m}{100} \ \Rightarrow \ \vert x - 1 \vert = 2 \pm \frac{m}{100}.
\]Solving the above equation, we have two sets of solution:
\[
\begin{align*}
x - 1 = 2 \pm \frac{m}{100} &\Rightarrow x = 3 \pm \frac{m}{100}, \\
x - 1 = -(2 \pm \frac{m}{100}) &= -2 \mp \frac{m}{100} \Rightarrow x = -1 \mp \frac{m}{100}.
\end{align*}
\]In order to have four distinct solutions, the two inner terms must be distinct. This requires $-1 + \frac{m}{100} \neq 3 - \frac{m}{100} \Rightarrow 4 \neq \frac{2m}{100} \Rightarrow m \neq 100$, and also $-1 - \frac{m}{100} \neq 3 + \frac{m}{100} \Rightarrow 4 \neq \frac{2m}{100} \Rightarrow m \neq 100$. 
Since $m$ is a positive integer, we only need to find the values of $m$ such that $-1 \pm \frac{m}{100}$ and $3 \pm \frac{m}{100}$ are four distinct numbers. That is,
\[-1 - \frac{m}{100} < 3 - \frac{m}{100} < -1 + \frac{m}{100} < 3 + \frac{m}{100}.\]From the left inequality, we get $-4 < 0$, which is true. From the right inequality, we get $4 < \frac{2m}{100}$, which simplifies to $m > 100$. The middle two inequalities yield $2 < \frac{2m}{100}$ or $m > 100$, and $-4 < \frac{2m}{100}$ or $m < 100$. 
Thus, the inequality we want is $0 < m < 100$.
The number of such positive integers $m$ is $99$. So, there are 99 values of $m$ for which the equation has four distinct solutions. Therefore, the final numerical answer is 99. The solution is $\boxed{99}$.

Assistant:

 This question is a challenging one that involves a deep understanding of absolute value equations and the number of their solutions. It's also a very time-consuming problem to solve directly using code (especially without any specific library support for complex analysis), but with a careful analysis, it can be solved analytically.
The graph of the function $f(x) = | |x - 1| - 2|$ consists of V's and is invariant under $x \to x + 1$. The graph is also invariant under $y \to -y$.
The function intersects the $x$-axis four times if and only if $0 < \frac{m}{100} < 1$. Thus $100 < m < 100$.
There is exactly one positive integer $m$ in this range, namely $m = 100$.
Therefore there is only one positive integer $m$ for which the equation $| ||x - 1| - 2 | = \frac{m}{100}$ has four distinct solutions, so $m = 100$.
The answer is: 1

 For this problem, we are looking for a positive integer $m$ such that the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has $4$ distinct solutions.
This equation has the shape of a "two-way" equation, which means that it will have 4 solutions if we can determine two values $A$ and $B$ such that the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=A$ has two solutions, and the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=B$ has two solutions, with $A \neq B$. Moreover, the value of $\frac{m}{100}$ must be somewhere between $A$ and $B$.

After graphing the function $y=\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert$,
we notice that it intersects the line $y=\frac{m}{100}$ exactly twice when $\frac{m}{100}=1$. Hence, let $A=1$,
and $B$ must be a number slightly greater than $1$.
We can test this value by setting $\frac{m}{100}=1.1$ and testing how many roots the equation has.
We find that for $\frac{m}{100}=1.1$, the equation has four distinct solutions. So, $m=110$ is a possible value that works. The answer is: $\boxed{110}$

 This problem requires a deep understanding of the absolute value function and how to solve equations involving it. Let's solve this step by step:

Step 1: Analyze the equation
The equation given is $ \vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100} $. The number of distinct solutions to this equation depends on the value of $ \frac{m}{100} $.

Step 2: Solving for distinct solutions
The equation has four distinct solutions when $ \frac{m}{100} = 2 $, $ 0 < \frac{m}{100} < 2 $, or $ \frac{m}{100} < 0 $.

For $ \frac{m}{100} = 2 $, we have $ m = 200 $.
For $ 0 < \frac{m}{100} < 2 $, we can multiply by $ 100 $ to get $ 0 < m < 200 $.
For $ \frac{m}{100} < 0 $, we get $ m < 0 $. However, $ m $ is a positive integer, so this case is not applicable.

Step 3: Combine results
Combining the results from the second step, the positive integer values of $ m $ for which the equation has four distinct solutions are the integers from $ 1 $ to $ 200 $ inclusive of both ends. However, we want the number of positive integers that $ m $ can take. To find this, we simply calculate the number of integers in the range $ 1 $ to $ 200 $ which is $ 200 - 1 + 1 = 200 $.

Hence, the number of positive integers $ m $ for which the equation has four distinct solutions is $ 200 $. This is our final answer.

Here is the python code that computes the same:
