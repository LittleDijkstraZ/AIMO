Approach:



The number of solutions of the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ depends on the value of $m/100$. The equation can be rewritten as $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=0.01m$. The absolute value function splits into two cases: $\vert x-1 \vert -2=0.01m$ or $\vert x-1 \vert -2=-0.01m$. 

These further simplify to $\vert x-1 \vert = 2 + 0.01m$ or $\vert x-1 \vert = 2 - 0.01m$. 

This results in four distinct solutions when $0< 2 - 0.01m \le 2 + 0.01m$. This simplifies to $0 < m \le 200$. So the positive integer values of $m$ for which the equation has 4 distinct solutions are the integers from 1 to 200.

Counting these integers gives the number of values of $m$.

Counting the number of positive integers from 1 to 200:

We can use the formula for the sum of an arithmetic series to calculate the number of integers in the range from 1 to 200. The formula is $\frac{n}{2}(a + l)$ where $n$ is the number of terms, $a$ is the first term, and $l$ is the last term. Here, $n = 200$, $a = 1$, and $l = 200$. Substituting these into the formula gives $\frac{200}{2}(1 + 200) = 100 \cdot 201 = 20100$.

However, we only want the number of positive integers from 1 to 200, so we need to subtract 1 from the result. Therefore, the number of positive integers from 1 to 200 is $20100 - 1 = 20099$.

But this is incorrect. The correct number of positive integers from 1 to 200 is simply 200.

So the question asks for the number of positive integers $m$ such that the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=0.01m$ has 4 distinct solutions. We found that this happens when $0 < m \le 200$. The positive integers in this range are from 1 to 200, inclusive. So the number of such integers is the number of integers from 1 to 200, which is simply 200.

Therefore, the number of positive integers $m$ for which the equation has 4 distinct solutions is 200.
The answer is: 200

Approach:

 The absolute value function $|\cdot|$ makes the expression inside non-negative, which means that the equation $|\vert x-1 \vert -2|=\frac{m}{100}$ will have four distinct solutions if and only if the right-hand side $\frac{m}{100}$ is less than $2$ and greater than $0$.

The inequality $0 < \frac{m}{100} < 2$ is equivalent to $0 < m < 200$. Therefore, the number of positive integer values of $m$ for which the equation has four distinct solutions is equal to the number of positive integers from $1$ to $199$.

This number is simply $199$.

```python

Solve the following problem with a Python Script (positive numerical answer):
"For how many positive integers $m$ does the equation \[\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}\] have $4$ distinct solutions?"
Write comments to indicate the steps you take. Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Assistant:

Approach:


The given equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has $4$ distinct solutions means that $\frac{m}{100}$ is half of the distance between two consecutive vertical lines of the function $\vert x-1 \vert -2$. Therefore, we need to find the value of $m$ such that $\frac{m}{100}=1$. This implies $m=100$.

Now let's check if this value of $m$ satisfies the condition. Substituting $m=100$ into the equation, we get:
\[\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{100}{100}=1.\]
This equation simplifies to $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=1$.

To solve this equation, we consider two cases:
1) If $\vert x-1 \vert -2 \geq 0$, then the equation becomes $\vert x-1 \vert -2=1$, which simplifies to $\vert x-1 \vert=3$. Solving this equation, we get $x-1=3$ or $x-1=-3$, which gives us $x=4$ or $x=-2$. 

2) If $\vert x-1 \vert -2 < 0$, then the equation becomes $-\vert x-1 \vert +2=1$, which simplifies to $\vert x-1 \vert=1$. Solving this equation, we get $x-1=1$ or $x-1=-1$, which gives us $x=2$ or $x=0$.

So, the solutions of the equation are $x=4$, $x=-2$, $x=2$, and $x=0$. Therefore, the value $m=100$ satisfies the condition.

Therefore, the only positive integer $m$ for which the equation has $4$ distinct solutions is $m=100$. So the answer is $1$.
The answer is $\boxed{1}$

Assistant:

Approach:


The equation $| |x-1| - 2 | = \frac{m}{100}$ has 4 distinct solutions, it must be in the form of $ |x - 1| = 2 + \frac{m}{100}$ or $ |x - 1| = 2 - \frac{m}{100}$.
The first case $|x - 1| = 2 + \frac{m}{100}$ gives us two solutions: $x = 3 + \frac{m}{100}$ and $x = -1 + \frac{m}{100}$. The second case $|x - 1| = 2 - \frac{m}{100}$ gives us two solutions: $x = 3 - \frac{m}{100}$ and $x = -1 - \frac{m}{100}$.
For the four solutions to be distinct, the two cases must satisfy $2 + \frac{m}{100} > 2 - \frac{m}{100}$, which simplifies to $m < 0$, and $2 + \frac{m}{100} > 0$ and $2 - \frac{m}{100} > 0$, which simplifies to $-200 < m < 200$. The intersection of these conditions is $-200 < m < 0$. Since $m$ is a positive integer, there are no solutions for this case.
Therefore, we must have $2 - \frac{m}{100} > 0$, which simplifies to $m < 200$. And we need the two cases to produce two solutions each. This happens when $0 < 2 - \frac{m}{100} < 2 + \frac{m}{100}$, which simplifies to $0 < m < 200$.
The number of positive integers $m$ in the range $(0, 200)$ is 199.
So, the number of positive integers $m$ for which the equation $| |x-1| - 2 | = \frac{m}{100}$ has 4 distinct solutions is 199. The answer is: $199$

Approach:



The equation \[\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}\] has 4 distinct solutions means that the expression inside the absolute value, $\vert x-1 \vert -2$, needs to change its sign exactly twice as $x$ varies over the real numbers. This will happen if and only if the value of $\frac{m}{100}$ is exactly equal to $2$. Thus, we have $m = 200$.

So the only value of $m$ that results in 4 distinct solutions is 200. Therefore, the number of positive integers $m$ for which the equation has 4 distinct solutions is 1.

Approach:


To solve this problem, we need to find the number of positive integers $m$ for which the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has 4 distinct solutions.

Step 1: Rewrite the equation in a more convenient form
The equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ can be rewritten as $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=0.01m$.

Step 2: Analyze the absolute value equation
The absolute value equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=0.01m$ has 4 distinct solutions if and only if $0.01m$ is a number between 1 and 2 but not equal to 1 or 2. This is because the expression inside the absolute value, $\vert x-1 \vert -2$, will have 4 distinct values when it equals to a number between 1 and 2.

Step 3: Solve for $m$
If $0.01m$ is between 1 and 2, then $1 \leq 0.01m < 2$. Multiplying all sides of the inequalities by 100, we get $100 \leq m < 200$. Therefore, $m$ is an integer from 100 to 199, inclusive. There are 100 such integers.

Therefore, there are 100 positive integers $m$ for which the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has 4 distinct solutions. The answer is: $100$

Approach:

 We know that the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has $4$ distinct solutions if $\frac{m}{100}$ is a number between $1$ and $2$, because the function $f(x)=\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert$ has its maximum value at $2$ and minimum value at $1$, and all values in between $1$ and $2$ will result in $4$ distinct solutions. So, we have $1 \leq \frac{m}{100} < 2$, which gives $100 \leq m < 200$. The positive integers $m$ that satisfy this inequality are the integers from $100$ to $199$, inclusive. So, the number of such positive integers $m$ is $100$.
The answer is: $100$.

Solve the following problem with a Python Script (positive numerical answer):
"For how many positive integers $m$ does the equation \[\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}\] have $4$ distinct solutions?"
Write comments to indicate the steps you take. Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Assistant:

Approach:


We first look at the number of solutions to the equation \[\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}.\] We know that the expression on the left-hand side is always nonnegative, and it equals $\frac{m}{100}$ which is also nonnegative. This means that for the equation to have solutions, $\frac{m}{100}$ must be nonnegative. Therefore, $m$ must be nonnegative as well.
Next, we know that the absolute value function creates a "V" shape graph. The graph of $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert$ consists of four line segments with slopes of $\pm 1$ and $0$. Each segment intersects the x-axis at $x=1\pm2$, i.e., $x=-1$ and $x=3$. This means that the graph of $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert$ is bounded between $0$ and $2$. Therefore, $\frac{m}{100}$ must be a number in the interval $[0,2]$ in order for the equation to have solutions. This implies that $0\leq \frac{m}{100}\leq 2$, which gives $0\leq m\leq 200$.
Now, we know that the equation \[\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}\] has 4 distinct solutions if and only if the value of $\frac{m}{100}$ crosses the "V" shape graph exactly 4 times. This happens when $\frac{m}{100}$ is equal to the height of the "V" shape graph at the midpoint of the segments. The midpoint of the segments is at $x=1$, and the value of $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert$ at $x=1$ is 2. Therefore, we need $\frac{m}{100}=2$, which implies $m=200$.
Therefore, the only positive integer $m$ for which the equation \[\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}\] has 4 distinct solutions is $m=200$.

The answer is: 1

Approach:

 To find the number of positive integers $m$ for which the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has $4$ distinct solutions, we need to analyze the graph of the equation and find out how many times it intersects the line $y=\frac{m}{100}$.

Let's first simplify the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$.

The expression $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert$ represents a "bump function" that equals $0$ for $x \in [1-2, 1+2] = [-1, 3]$, equals $3-x$ for $x < -1$, and equals $x-3$ for $x > 3$. Therefore, the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has 4 distinct solutions if and only if $0 < \frac{m}{100} < 3$, or equivalently, $0 < m < 300$.

The number of positive integers $m$ in this range is $299$.
The answer is: $299$

Approach:

 We need to find the number of positive integers $m$ such that the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has exactly $4$ distinct solutions.
Let's consider the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$.
For this equation to have $4$ distinct solutions, the value of $\frac{m}{100}$ must be between $1$ and $2$, because the absolute value function creates a "V" shape graph with the vertex at the point where the value inside the absolute value is $0$.
Therefore, $1 \leq \frac{m}{100} < 2$, which gives $100 \leq m < 200$.
The positive integers $m$ in this range are the integers from $100$ to $199$, inclusive. So, there are $100$ such positive integers $m$. The answer is: $100$

Approach:


To have four distinct solutions for the equation $| |x-1|-2|=\frac{m}{100}$,
we need to find the number of $m$ such that the right-hand side ($\frac{m}{100}$) falls into the range where the absolute value equation has four distinct solutions.

The equation $| |x-1|-2|=\frac{m}{100}$ has four distinct solutions when the right-hand side ($\frac{m}{100}$) is strictly greater than $2$ and strictly less than $4$.
This is because the graph of $| |x-1|-2|$ has a shape of a "V" with the vertex at $(1,2)$,
and it has four distinct solutions when the right-hand side is within the range $(0,4)$.

Solving the inequalities:
$\frac{m}{100} > 2$ gives $m > 200$.
$\frac{m}{100} < 4$ gives $m < 400$.

So the positive integers $m$ that satisfy both conditions are those strictly greater than $200$ and strictly less than $400$.
The number of such integers is $400 - 201 = 199$.
The answer is: $199$
