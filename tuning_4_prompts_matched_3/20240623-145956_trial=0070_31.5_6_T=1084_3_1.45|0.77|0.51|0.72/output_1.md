Approach:


We can rewrite the given equation as $|(2y - x)| + |(2x - y)| = 40$. This equation represents the sum of the distances between the point $(x, y)$ and the points $(0, 0)$ and $(1, 1)$ in the plane. Therefore, the set of all possible points $(x, y)$ forms a rhombus with vertices at $(0, 0)$, $(1, 1)$, $(2, 2)$, and $(1, 0)$.
The function $5x^2 + 5y^2 - 8xy$ is a quadratic form, and its minimum value on a compact set is attained at one of the vertices of the rhombus.
To find the minimum value of the function, we can evaluate it at each vertex of the rhombus.
The vertices of the rhombus are $(0, 0)$, $(1, 1)$, $(2, 2)$, and $(1, 0)$.
At the vertex $(0, 0)$, the value of the function is $5(0)^2 + 5(0)^2 - 8(0)(0) = 0$.
At the vertex $(1, 1)$, the value of the function is $5(1)^2 + 5(1)^2 - 8(1)(1) = 2$.
At the vertex $(2, 2)$, the value of the function is $5(2)^2 + 5(2)^2 - 8(2)(2) = 20$.
At the vertex $(1, 0)$, the value of the function is $5(1)^2 + 5(0)^2 - 8(1)(0) = 5$.
The minimum value of the function is $0$, which is attained at the vertex $(0, 0)$.
Therefore, the minimum value of $5x^2 + 5y^2 - 8xy$ is $0$. The answer is: $0$

Approach:


To find the minimum value of the expression $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ under the constraint $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$, we can use the method of Lagrange multipliers.
Let $f(x, y) = 5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ and $g(x, y) = |x-2y| + |y-2x| - 40$. We want to find the minimum of $f(x, y)$ subject to the constraint $g(x, y) = 0$.
To do this, we form the function $F(x, y, \lambda) = f(x, y) - \lambda g(x, y)$. Then we find the gradient of $F$ and set it equal to the zero vector.

\[\nabla F(x, y, \lambda) = \begin{bmatrix} \frac{\partial F}{\partial x} \\ \frac{\partial F}{\partial y} \\ \frac{\partial F}{\partial \lambda} \end{bmatrix} = \begin{bmatrix} 10x - 8y - \lambda (1 - 2) \\ 10y - 8x - \lambda (1 - 2) \\ |x - 2y| + |y - 2x| - 40 \end{bmatrix} = \begin{bmatrix} 0 \\ 0 \\ 0 \end{bmatrix}\]

This gives us the system of equations:

1. $10x - 8y + \lambda = 0$
2. $10y - 8x + \lambda = 0$
3. $|x - 2y| + |y - 2x| = 40$

From equations (1) and (2), we have $10x - 8y = 10y - 8x$, which simplifies to $18x = 16y$. Thus, $\frac{x}{y} = \frac{8}{9}$.

Substituting $x = \frac{8}{9}y$ into equation (3), we get

\[| \frac{8}{9}y - 2y | + | y - \frac{16}{9}y | = 40\]
\[| \frac{-y}{9} | + | \frac{-7y}{9} | = 40\]
\[\frac{8}{9}y = 40\]
\[y = \frac{40 \cdot 9}{8} = 45.\]

Substituting $y = 45$ into $x = \frac{8}{9}y$, we get $x = \frac{8}{9} \cdot 45 = 40$.

Now we substitute $x = 40$ and $y = 45$ into the expression $5x^2 + 5y^2 - 8xy$:

\[5(40)^2 + 5(45)^2 - 8(40)(45) = 8000 + 9450 - 14400 = 3050.\]

Therefore, the minimum value of $5x^2 + 5y^2 - 8xy$ is $3050$ when $x = 40$ and $y = 45$. The answer is: $3050$

Approach:


We first note that the condition $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$ can be simplified as follows:
\[|x-2y| + |y-2x| = |x-2y| + |2y-x| = |x-2y| - |x-2y| = 0.\]This leads to a contradiction as $0$ cannot equal $40$. Hence, we must have made an error in our simplification. Let's correct that.
\[|x-2y| + |y-2x| = |x-2y| - |x-2y| = 0.\]
This implies that $x = 2y$ or $y = 2x$.
Let's substitute $x = 2y$ into the expression $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$:
\[5(2y)^2 + 5y^2 - 8(2y)(y) = 20y^2 + 5y^2 - 16y^2 = 9y^2.\]
Similarly, substitute $y = 2x$:
\[5x^2 + 5(2x)^2 - 8x(2x) = 5x^2 + 20x^2 - 16x^2 = 9x^2.\]
Hence, the expression simplifies to $9x^2$ or $9y^2$, both of which are always nonnegative. Therefore, the minimum value is $0$.
Now, let's check if this minimum value satisfies the condition $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$.
If $x = 2y$, then $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = |0| + |-3x| = 0 + 3|x| = 3|x|$. Since $|x|$ is always nonnegative, $3|x|$ is always nonnegative. Thus, $x = 2y$ does not satisfy the condition.
Similarly, if $y = 2x$, then $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = |-3x| + |0| = 3|x| + 0 = 3|x|$. Again, $3|x|$ is always nonnegative, and thus $y = 2x$ does not satisfy the condition either.
Since neither $x = 2y$ nor $y = 2x$ satisfy the condition, we must have made an error in our calculations. Let's reevaluate the expression $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ when $x = 2y$ and $y = 2x$.
If $x = 2y$, then the expression becomes $5(2y)^2 + 5y^2 - 8(2y)(y) = 20y^2 + 5y^2 - 16y^2 = 9y^2$.
Similarly, if $y = 2x$, then the expression becomes $5x^2 + 5(2x)^2 - 8x(2x) = 5x^2 + 20x^2 - 16x^2 = 9x^2$.
In both cases, the expression simplifies to $9x^2$ or $9y^2$, both of which are always nonnegative. Therefore, the minimum value is $0$.
Since the minimum value of the expression $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ is $0$, we must reconsider the condition $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$.
Recall that $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = |x-2y| - |x-2y| = 0$. This is a contradiction since $0$ cannot equal $40$.
Hence, we must have made an error in our calculations. Let's reevaluate the condition $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$.
We made an error in our simplification. The correct simplification is:
\[|x-2y| + |y-2x| = |x-2y| - |x-2y| = 0.\]
This leads to a contradiction as $0$ cannot equal $40$.
Therefore, we must reconsider the problem.
The expression $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ can be rewritten as $9x^2 - 8xy + y^2$ or $9y^2 - 8xy + x^2$.
The first expression is a quadratic in $x$ with coefficients $9$, $-8y$, and $y^2$. The discriminant of this quadratic is $(-8y)^2 - 4(9)(y^2) = 64y^2 - 36y^2 = 28y^2$. Since the discriminant is always nonnegative, the quadratic has real roots for all $y$. Therefore, the minimum value of the expression $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ is achieved when the quadratic has equal roots, which occurs when its discriminant is $0$. This gives us the equation $28y^2 = 0$, or $y = 0$.
Similarly, the second expression is a quadratic in $y$ with coefficients $9$, $-8x$, and $x^2$. The discriminant of this quadratic is $(-8x)^2 - 4(9)(x^2) = 64x^2 - 36x^2 = 28x^2$. Since the discriminant is always nonnegative, the quadratic has real roots for all $x$. Therefore, the minimum value of the expression $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ is achieved when the quadratic has equal roots, which occurs when its discriminant is $0$. This gives us the equation $28x^2 = 0$, or $x = 0$.
Therefore, the minimum value of the expression $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ occurs when $x = 0$ and $y = 0$. Substituting these values into the expression, we get $5(0)^2 + 5(0)^2 - 8(0)(0) = 0$.
Therefore, the minimum value of the expression $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ is $0$ when $x = 0$ and $y = 0$. However, this does not satisfy the condition $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$. Therefore, we must reconsider the problem.
Recall that the condition $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$ is equivalent to $|x-2y| = |y-2x| = 20$. This implies that the distance between $(x, 2y)$ and $(y, 2x)$ is $20$ in the coordinate plane. Since $(0, 0)$ lies on the line segment joining $(x, 2y)$ and $(y, 2x)$, the minimum distance between $(x, 2y)$ and $(y, 2x)$ is achieved when $(x, 2y)$ and $(y, 2x)$

Approach:


This problem is a classic example of a Lagrange multiplier problem. The function to be minimized is $f(x, y) = 5x^2 + 5y^2 - 8xy$ and the constraint is $g(x, y) = |x - 2y| + |y - 2x| - 40 = 0$. We need to find the critical points of the function $L(x, y, \lambda) = f(x, y) - \lambda g(x, y)$ and then evaluate the function $f$ at these points.

However, solving the constraint equation $g(x, y) = 0$ is not straightforward. Instead, we can use the fact that $|x - 2y| + |y - 2x| = 40$ implies that $(x - 2y)(y - 2x) \leq 0$. Expanding and simplifying, we get $3x^2 - 6xy + 3y^2 = 40$, or $x^2 - 2xy + y^2 = \frac{40}{3}$.

Now, we substitute $u = x - y$ and $v = x + y$. Then, we have $u^2 + v^2 = \frac{40}{3}$ and $y = \frac{v - u}{2}$. Substituting this into the function $f$, we get $f(u, v) = 5\left(\frac{v^2 - u^2}{4}\right) - 4\left(\frac{uv}{4}\right) = \frac{5}{4}(v^2 - u^2) - uv$.

To find the minimum of $f(u, v)$, we can take the partial derivatives with respect to $u$ and $v$ and set them equal to zero. We get
$\frac{\partial f}{\partial u} = -\frac{5}{4} \cdot 2u - v = -\frac{5u}{2} - v = 0$ and
$\frac{\partial f}{\partial v} = \frac{5}{4} \cdot 2v - u = \frac{5v}{2} - u = 0$.

Solving these equations, we find $u = \frac{5v}{6}$ and substituting this into $u^2 + v^2 = \frac{40}{3}$, we get $v^2 = 4$ and $v = \pm 2$. The corresponding values of $u$ are $u = \pm \frac{5}{3}$.

Substituting these values of $u$ and $v$ back into $f(u, v)$, we get $f\left(\frac{5}{3}, 2\right) = \frac{5}{4}(4) - \frac{5}{3}(2) = 5 - \frac{10}{3} = \frac{5}{3}$ and $f\left(-\frac{5}{3}, -2\right) = \frac{5}{4}(4) + \frac{5}{3}(2) = 5 + \frac{10}{3} = \frac{25}{3}$.

Therefore, the minimum value of $5x^2 + 5y^2 - 8xy$ is $\frac{5}{3}$.
The answer is: $\boxed{\frac{5}{3}}$

Approach:

 This is a constrained optimization problem. First, we need to express the function $f(x, y) = 5x^2 + 5y^2 - 8xy$ in terms of a single variable using the constraint equation $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$. We can simplify the constraint equation as follows:

\[|x-2y| + |y-2x| = |x-2y| + |2y-x| = 40.\]

This simplifies to $|x-2y| - |2y-x| = 0$, which implies $|x-2y| = |2y-x|$. Squaring both sides, we get $(x-2y)^2 = (2y-x)^2$. Expanding and simplifying gives $4y^2 - 4xy = 0$, which simplifies to $y^2 - xy = 0$. Then $y^2 = xy$, so $y = x$ or $y = 0$.

Case 1: $y = x$. The constraint equation then becomes $|x-2x| + |x-2x| = 40$, which simplifies to $0 = 40$, a contradiction. Therefore, $y \neq x$.

Case 2: $y = 0$. The constraint equation then becomes $|x-0| + |0-2x| = 40$, which simplifies to $|x| + |-2x| = 40$. Since $|x| = |-x|$, we have $|x| + |2x| = 40$. This simplifies to $|x| + 2|x| = 40$, which gives $3|x| = 40$, so $|x| = \frac{40}{3}$. Since $y = 0$, we substitute this value into $f(x, y)$ to get $f(x, 0) = 5x^2 - 8x^2 = -3x^2$. We want to minimize this function over the interval $-\frac{40}{3} \le x \le \frac{40}{3}$.

The function $f(x, 0) = -3x^2$ is a parabola that opens downwards, so it attains its minimum at the vertex. The vertex of a parabola $ax^2 + bx + c$ is given by $-\frac{b}{2a}$. In this case, $a = -3$ and $b = 0$, so the vertex is $x = -\frac{0}{2(-3)} = 0$.

Substitute $x = 0$ into $f(x, 0)$ to get $f(0, 0) = -3(0)^2 = 0$. Therefore, the minimum value of $f(x, y)$ subject to the constraint is 0. The answer is: $0$

Approach:


To solve this problem, we can use the AM-GM inequality (Arithmetic Mean - Geometric Mean inequality). First, let's rewrite the given expression as follows:
\[5x^2+5y^2-8xy = \frac{1}{2}[(5x^2 - 8xy + 5y^2) + (5x^2 - 8xy + 5y^2)]\]
\[= \frac{1}{2}[(5x^2 - 2xy + y^2) + (x^2 - 6xy + 5y^2)]\]
\[= \frac{1}{2}[(5x - y)^2 + (x - 5y)^2].\]
By the AM-GM inequality, we have
\[\frac{(5x - y)^2 + (x - 5y)^2}{2} \geq \sqrt{(5x - y)^2 \cdot (x - 5y)^2},\]
with equality if and only if $5x - y = x - 5y$, i.e., $x = y$.
Now, let's consider the condition $|x - 2y| + |y - 2x| = 40$. If $x = y$, then the left-hand side of the equation becomes $0$, which is not equal to $40$. However, if we set $x = 2y$, then the left-hand side of the equation becomes $|x - 2y| + |y - 2x| = |x - x| + |y - 2x| = |y - 2x| = |y - 2(2y)| = | - 3y| = 3|y|$. Thus, $3|y| = 40$, which implies $|y| = \frac{40}{3}$. Since $y = x/2$, we have $x = 2y = \frac{80}{3}$. Now we can substitute $x = \frac{80}{3}$ and $y = \frac{40}{3}$ into the expression $\frac{1}{2}[(5x - y)^2 + (x - 5y)^2]$ to find the minimum value:
\[\frac{1}{2}[(5 \cdot \frac{80}{3} - \frac{40}{3})^2 + (\frac{80}{3} - 5 \cdot \frac{40}{3})^2] = \frac{1}{2}[(400)^2 + (0)^2] = 8000.\]
So the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ when $x$ and $y$ range over all real numbers such that $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$ is $8000$.
The answer is: $8000$.

Approach:



To solve this problem, we first need to simplify the given equation $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$.

We can rewrite the equation as $|x-2y| + |2y-x| = 40$, and then using the property $|a| = |-a|$, we get $|x-2y| + |2y-x| = |x-2y| + |x-2y| = 2|x-2y| = 40$.

Then, we can solve for $|x-2y| = 20$.

Now, we need to find the minimum value of the function $f(x, y) = 5x^2+5y^2-8xy$.

Notice that the function $f(x, y)$ is a quadratic function. We can complete the square to simplify it:

\[f(x, y) = 5(x^2- \frac{8}{5}xy + y^2) = 5[(x^2 - \frac{8}{5}xy + \frac{16}{25}y^2) - \frac{16}{25}y^2 + y^2] = 5[ (x - \frac{4}{5}y)^2 + \frac{11}{25}y^2].\]

Now, we want to minimize $f(x, y)$ subject to the constraint $|x-2y| = 20$.

Using the constraint $|x-2y| = 20$, we can rewrite it as $x-2y = \pm 20$.

We can consider two cases:

Case 1: $x-2y = 20$. From this equation, we can solve for $x = 2y + 20$.

Substitute $x = 2y + 20$ into the function $f(x, y)$, we get
\[f(x, y) = 5[(2y+20 - \frac{4}{5}y)^2 + \frac{11}{25}y^2] = 5[(2y + 20 - \frac{8}{5}y)^2 + \frac{11}{25}y^2] = 5[(\frac{2}{5}y + 20)^2 + \frac{11}{25}y^2].\]

Now, we can find the minimum value of this function by taking the derivative with respect to $y$ and setting it to zero.

The derivative is:
\[\frac{df}{dy} = 5[2(\frac{2}{5}y + 20) \cdot \frac{2}{5} + \frac{22}{25}y] = 0.\]

Solving this equation, we get $y = -\frac{100}{11}$.

Substitute $y = -\frac{100}{11}$ back into the equation $x = 2y + 20$, we get $x = \frac{180}{11}$.

So, the minimum value of the function $f(x, y)$ in this case is
\[f(\frac{180}{11}, -\frac{100}{11}) = 5[(\frac{2}{5}(-\frac{100}{11}) + 20)^2 + \frac{11}{25}(-\frac{100}{11})^2] = -\frac{8000}{11}.\]

Case 2: $x-2y = -20$. From this equation, we can solve for $x = 2y - 20$.

Substitute $x = 2y - 20$ into the function $f(x, y)$, we get
\[f(x, y) = 5[(2y - 20 - \frac{4}{5}y)^2 + \frac{11}{25}y^2] = 5[(2y - 20 - \frac{8}{5}y)^2 + \frac{11}{25}y^2] = 5[(\frac{2}{5}y - 20)^2 + \frac{11}{25}y^2].\]

Similar to Case 1, we can find the minimum value of this function by taking the derivative with respect to $y$ and setting it to zero.

The derivative is:
\[\frac{df}{dy} = 5[2(\frac{2}{5}y - 20) \cdot \frac{2}{5} + \frac{22}{25}y] = 0.\]

Solving this equation, we get $y = \frac{100}{11}$.

Substitute $y = \frac{100}{11}$ back into the equation $x = 2y - 20$, we get $x = -\frac{180}{11}$.

So, the minimum value of the function $f(x, y)$ in this case is
\[f(-\frac{180}{11}, \frac{100}{11}) = 5[(\frac{2}{5}(\frac{100}{11}) - 20)^2 + \frac{11}{25}(\frac{100}{11})^2] = -\frac{8000}{11}.\]

Therefore, the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ when $x$ and $y$ range over all real numbers such that $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$ is $-\frac{8000}{11}$.
The answer is: ${}-\frac{8000}{11}$

"What is the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ when $x$ and $y$ range over all real numbers such that $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$?"
Write comments to indicate the steps you take. Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Assistant:

Approach:


We first notice that the given condition $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$ implies that $x=y$. This is because $|a-b| + |b-a|$ is always equal to $2|a-b|$, so the equation can be rewritten as $2|x-2y| = 40$, which simplifies to $|x-2y| = 20$. Expanding the absolute value gives two possible cases: $x-2y = 20$ or $x-2y = -20$. But these are essentially the same equation (since $y-2x = -(x-2y)$) and we can simply consider $x-2y = 20$. Solving for $y$ in terms of $x$ gives $y = \frac{x-20}{2}$.

Now we substitute $y = \frac{x-20}{2}$ into the expression $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ to get a single variable expression:
$$5x^2 + 5\left(\frac{x-20}{2}\right)^2 - 8x\left(\frac{x-20}{2}\right) = 5x^2 + \frac{5(x-20)^2}{4} - 4x(x-20).$$

Simplify this expression to get:
$$5x^2 + \frac{5(x^2 - 40x + 400)}{4} - 4x^2 + 80x = 5x^2 + \frac{5x^2}{4} - 50x + 100 - 4x^2 + 80x = \frac{15x^2}{4} + 30x + 100.$$

To find the minimum value of this expression, we take the derivative with respect to $x$ and set it equal to zero:
$$\frac{15x}{2} + 30 = 0 \Rightarrow x = -\frac{60}{15} = -4.$$

Substitute $x=-4$ back into the equation $y = \frac{x-20}{2}$ to find $y = \frac{-4-20}{2} = -12$.

Finally, substitute $x=-4$ and $y=-12$ into the original expression $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ to find its minimum value:
$$5(-4)^2 + 5(-12)^2 - 8(-4)(-12) = 80 + 720 - 384 = 496.$$

Therefore, the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ is 496.
The answer is: $496$

Approach:


This is a problem of finding the minimum value of a function under a constraint. We will use the method of Lagrange multipliers to solve this problem. Define a new function $F(x, y, \lambda) = 5x^2 + 5y^2 - 8xy + \lambda (|x-2y| + |y-2x| - 40)$. To find the minimum value, we need to find the points where the gradient of $F$ is zero, i.e., $\nabla F = 0$.

Solution:

First, we need to handle the absolute value terms in the function $F$. We can do this by considering four cases depending on the signs of $x-2y$ and $y-2x$. However, considering the symmetry of the problem, we can simplify the cases to just considering two cases:
1. When $x \geq 2y$ and $y \geq 2x$, we have $|x-2y| = x-2y$ and $|y-2x| = y-2x$.
2. When $x < 2y$ and $y < 2x$, we have $|x-2y| = 2y-x$ and $|y-2x| = 2x-y$.

Now, we compute the gradient of $F$ and set it equal to zero:
$\nabla F = \begin{bmatrix} 10x - 8y + \lambda(-1) \\ 10y - 8x + \lambda(-1) \end{bmatrix} = 0$.

From the first case, we have $10x - 8y - \lambda = 0$ and $10y - 8x - \lambda = 0$. Solving these two equations, we get $x = y$. Substituting this into the constraint equation $|x-2x| + |x-2x| = 40$, we get $2|x| = 40$, which gives $|x| = 20$. Since $x = y$, we have $x = y = \pm 20$. The minimum value occurs at the point $(20, 20)$, and the minimum value of the function $5x^2 + 5y^2 - 8xy$ is $5(20)^2 + 5(20)^2 - 8(20)(20) = 2000$.

From the second case, we have $10x - 8y + \lambda = 0$ and $10y - 8x + \lambda = 0$. Solving these two equations, we get $x = y$. Substituting this into the constraint equation $|x-2x| + |x-2x| = 40$, we get $2|x| = 40$, which gives $|x| = 20$. Since $x = y$, we have $x = y = \pm 20$. The minimum value occurs at the point $(20, 20)$, and the minimum value of the function $5x^2 + 5y^2 - 8xy$ is $5(20)^2 + 5(20)^2 - 8(20)(20) = 2000$.

Conclusion:

Thus, the minimum value of the function $5x^2 + 5y^2 - 8xy$ when $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$ is 2000. The answer is: $2000$
