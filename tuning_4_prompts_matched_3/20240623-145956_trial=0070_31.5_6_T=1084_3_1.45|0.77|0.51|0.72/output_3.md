Solve the following problem with a Python Script (positive numerical answer):
"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"

Approach:

 The given equation is $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$. This equation equals to zero if either of the two factors equals to zero. 

The first factor equals to zero when $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ or $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. These two equations represent a square with side length 10, centered at the origin, and its vertices at $(\pm 10, 0)$, $(0, \pm 10)$.

The second factor equals to zero when $\vert x \vert = 8$ or $\vert y \vert = 8$. These two equations represent a square with side length 16, centered at the origin, and its vertices at $(\pm 8, 0)$, $(0, \pm 8)$.

The intersection of the two squares is the convex polygon that we are looking for. This polygon is a square with side length 10, centered at the origin, and its vertices at $(\pm 10, 0)$, $(0, \pm 10)$.

To find the area of the square, we simply square the side length, so the area is $10^2 = 100$.
The answer is: 100.

Solve the following problem with a Python Script (positive numerical answer):
"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"

Approach:



The equation given in the problem is a product of two terms equal to zero, which means either one of the terms is zero or both are zero. This gives us four conditions to consider:

1. $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ and $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ and $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ and $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$.

For each of these conditions, we have four absolute value equations which can be split into two cases each: the argument is non-negative or negative.

By solving these cases, we find the vertices of the polygon:

- For the first condition, the vertices are $(8,8)$, $(-8,8)$, $(8,-8)$, and $(-8,-8)$.
- For the second condition, the vertices are $(10,0)$, $(-10,0)$, $(0,10)$, and $(0,-10)$.
- For the third condition, the vertices are $(8,8)$, $(-8,8)$, $(8,-8)$, and $(-8,-8)$.
- For the fourth condition, the vertices are $(10,0)$, $(-10,0)$, $(0,10)$, and $(0,-10)$.

By plotting these points, we find that the polygon is a square with side length 16 units.

The area of a square is given by the square of its side length, so the area of the polygon is $16^2 = 256$.

The answer is: $\boxed{256}$.

Solve the following problem with a Python Script (positive numerical answer):
"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"

Assistant:

Approach:


The given equation is $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + (\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + (\vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$. For the product of two numbers to be zero, either of the numbers has to be zero. Therefore, the solutions of the equation are obtained by setting each factor equal to zero.

Let's consider the first factor:

$(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ which implies $\vert x + y \vert = 10$. This is a square with vertices at $(10,0)$, $(-10,0)$, $(0,10)$ and $(0,-10)$.

Similarly, $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ gives $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. This is a square with vertices at $(10,0)$, $(-10,0)$, $(0,-10)$ and $(0,10)$. So these two squares are the same.

Now let's consider the second factor:

$(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ which implies $\vert x \vert = 8$. This is a square with vertices at $(8,0)$, $(-8,0)$, $(0,8)$ and $(0,-8)$.

And $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ implies $\vert y \vert = 8$, which is also a square with vertices at $(8,0)$, $(-8,0)$, $(0,8)$ and $(0,-8)$.

The intersection of these two squares is the square with vertices at $(8,0)$, $(-8,0)$, $(0,8)$ and $(0,-8)$.

Therefore, the convex polygon is a square with side length 8. The area of a square is given by the square of its side length. So the area of the square is $8^2 = 64$.

So, the area of the convex polygon is 64.
The answer is: $64$

Solve the following problem with a Python Script (positive numerical answer):
"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"

Assistant:

Approach:

 The equation $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ is satisfied only when either $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$.
For the first case, we have $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. This implies that $x + y = \pm 10$ and $x - y = \pm 10$. Solving these equations gives us the coordinates of the vertices of the polygon: $(5,5)$, $(5,-5)$, $(-5,5)$, and $(-5,-5)$. These points form a square with side length $10$.
For the second case, we have $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$. This implies that $x = \pm 8$ and $y = \pm 8$. Solving these equations gives us the coordinates of the vertices of the polygon: $(8,8)$, $(8,-8)$, $(-8,8)$, and $(-8,-8)$. These points form a square with side length $16$.
The area of the polygon is the sum of the areas of these two squares. The area of a square with side length $a$ is $a^2$. Therefore, the area of the first square (with side length $10$) is $10^2 = 100$, and the area of the second square (with side length $16$) is $16^2 = 256$. The total area of the polygon is $100 + 256 = 356$.

The area of the convex polygon is 356.
The answer is: 356

Approach:


The equation $f(x, y) = 0$ where $f(x, y) = ((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2)$ implies that either $f_1(x, y) = (\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ or $f_2(x, y) = (\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$. 
For $f_1(x, y) = 0$, we have $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$, which implies that the points $(x, y)$ lie on the rectangle with vertices at $(8, 10), (8, -10), (-8, -10), (-8, 10)$.
For $f_2(x, y) = 0$, we have $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$, which implies that the points $(x, y)$ lie on a square with side length $16$ and vertices at $(8, 8), (8, -8), (-8, -8), (-8, 8)$.
The intersection of these two regions is a square with side length $16$, and the area of this square is $16^2 = 256$.

Approach:

 The given equation is of the form $f(x,y) = 0$, which means the set of points $(x,y)$ that satisfy this equation forms the boundary of a region. To find the area of this region, we need to determine the shape of the region enclosed by the boundary.

The equation $f(x,y) = 0$ is equivalent to the conjunction of the following two equations:

1. $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$, which implies $\vert x + y \vert = 10$.
2. $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$, which implies $\vert x - y \vert = 10$.
3. $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$, which implies $\vert x \vert = 8$, or $x = 8$ or $x = -8$.
4. $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$, which implies $\vert y \vert = 8$, or $y = 8$ or $y = -8$.

From the above equations, we can see that the region is a square with side length 20. The area of this square is $20^2 = 400$. Therefore, the area of the convex polygon is 400 square units. The answer is: $400$

"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"

Assistant:

Approach:



The equation given in the problem is a product of two expressions equal to zero, which means either one of the expressions must be zero. We have two cases to consider:

1. $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ and $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$
2. $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ and $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$

From the first case, we have $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. This gives us four lines: $x + y = 10$, $x + y = -10$, $x - y = 10$, and $x - y = -10$. These lines form a rectangle with vertices at $(10, 0)$, $(-10, 0)$, $(0, 10)$, and $(0, -10)$.

From the second case, we have $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$. This gives us four lines: $x = 8$, $x = -8$, $y = 8$, and $y = -8$. These lines form a square with vertices at $(8, 8)$, $(-8, 8)$, $(-8, -8)$, and $(8, -8)$.

The intersection of these two figures is a square with side length $10$ (since the side length of the rectangle is the maximum absolute value of $x$ or $y$, and the side length of the square is the maximum absolute value of $x$ and $y$).

The area of a square is given by the square of the side length, so the area of the convex polygon is $10^2 = 100$. The answer is: $\boxed{100}$

Approach:



The equation is $0$ if and only if one of the factors is $0$. So we can split it into two cases:

1. $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$. This equation implies that $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. This is only possible when both conditions are true at the same time. That is, $x + y = 10$ and $x - y = 10$ or $x + y = -10$ and $x - y = -10$. These two cases result in the lines $y = x - 10$ and $y = -x + 10$.

2. $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$. This equation implies that $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$. That is, $x = 8$ or $x = -8$ and $y = 8$ or $y = -8$. These four lines are $x = 8$, $x = -8$, $y = 8$, and $y = -8$.

The intersection of these lines form a rectangle with length $16$ and width $20$. The area of this rectangle is $16 \times 20 = 320$. The value of the area of the polygon is thus $320$. The answer is: $320$.

Approach:

 The equation $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ implies that either $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2) = 0$ or $((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$.

If $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2) = 0$, then $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$, which implies that $x + y = \pm 10$ and $x - y = \pm 10$. Solving these equations gives us the vertices of the square $(4,6), (4,-6), (-4,-6), (-4,6)$.

If $((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$, then $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$, which implies that $x = \pm 8$ and $y = \pm 8$. Solving these equations gives us the vertices of the square $(-8,8), (8,8), (8,-8), (-8,-8)$.

Therefore, the points that satisfy the equation enclose a square with side length 16. The area of a square is given by the square of its side length, so the area of the convex polygon is $16^2 = 256$.
The answer is: 256

Approach:

 The equation $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ is true if either of the two factors is zero.

This gives us two sets of equations:

1. $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$
2. $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$

The first set of equations represents a square with side length 10 centered at the origin. The second set of equations represents a square with side length 16 centered at the origin.

The intersection of these two squares is the convex polygon we are looking for. This is also a square, with side length equal to the smaller side length of the two squares, which is 10.

The area of a square with side length $s$ is $s^2$. Therefore, the area of the convex polygon is $10^2 = 100$. The answer is: $\boxed{100}$

Write comments to indicate the steps you take. Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Assistant:

Approach:


The equation given in the problem, $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$, is satisfied if and only if at least one of the factors is zero. Therefore, we have two cases:

Case 1: $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$. This case implies that $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. This means that $x + y = \pm 10$ and $x - y = \pm 10$, which gives us the four lines $x + y = \pm 10$ and $x - y = \pm 10$. The points where these lines intersect form a square with side length 20.

Case 2: $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$. This case implies that $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$, which means that $x = \pm 8$ and $y = \pm 8$. This gives us a square with side length 16.

The area of the convex polygon formed by the union of the two cases is the sum of the areas of the two squares. The area of a square is given by the square of the length of its side, so the area of the square from Case 1 is $20^2 = 400$, and the area of the square from Case 2 is $16^2 = 256$. Therefore, the total area of the convex polygon is $400 + 256 = 656$.

The answer is: $656$

Approach:


The given equation implies that either $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$. Each of these gives us a system of equations that we need to solve. Once we solve these equations, we get the coordinates of the vertices of the polygon. Then we use the shoelace formula to find the area of the polygon.

The equations are as follows:
1. $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0 \Rightarrow \vert x + y \vert = 10 \Rightarrow x + y = \pm 10$.
2. $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0 \Rightarrow \vert x - y \vert = 10 \Rightarrow x - y = \pm 10$.
3. $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0 \Rightarrow \vert x \vert = 8 \Rightarrow x = \pm 8$.
4. $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0 \Rightarrow \vert y \vert = 8 \Rightarrow y = \pm 8$.

Solving these equations, we get the vertices of the polygon: $(8,8), (8,-8), (-8,8), (-8,-8)$. These are the vertices of a square with side length 16.

The shoelace formula for the area of a polygon with vertices $(x_1, y_1), (x_2, y_2), \ldots, (x_n, y_n)$ is given by:
$$\frac{1}{2} \sum_{i=1}^{n} (x_i y_{i+1} - x_{i+1} y_i)$$
where the indices are to be taken modulo $n$. For a square with side length $a$, the area is $a^2$. Thus, the area of the given square with side length 16 is $16^2 = 256$.

The area of the convex polygon is 256. The answer is: $\boxed{256}$
