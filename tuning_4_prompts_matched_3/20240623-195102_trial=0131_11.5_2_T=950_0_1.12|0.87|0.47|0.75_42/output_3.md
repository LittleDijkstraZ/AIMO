"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"
Analyze this problem and think step by step to come to a solution with programs. After solving the problem, output the final numerical answer within \boxed{}.

Assistant:

 The given equation is a product of two terms equal to zero. Therefore, either the first term is zero or the second term is zero. 

The first term is zero when $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. This implies that $x + y = \pm 10$ and $x - y = \pm 10$. Solving these four equations gives the vertices of a square with side length 20.

The second term is zero when $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$. This implies that $x = \pm 8$ and $y = \pm 8$. Solving these four equations gives the vertices of a square with side length 16.

The convex polygon formed by the union of these two squares is a larger square with side length 20. The area of this square is $20^2 = 400$. Therefore, the area of the convex polygon is 400.

Below is a math problem you are to solve (positive numerical answer!):
"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"

The equation given is a product of two expressions equal to zero, so either $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$.
If $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$, then $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$, which implies $x + y = \pm 10$ and $x - y = \pm 10$. Solving these equations gives $x = y = 5$ or $x = -y = -5$. This means the points lie on the lines $x + y = 10$, $x + y = -10$, $x - y = 10$, and $x - y = -10$.
If $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$, then $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$, which implies $x = \pm 8$ and $y = \pm 8$. This means the points lie on the lines $x = 8$, $x = -8$, $y = 8$, and $y = -8$.
The points satisfying both conditions are the vertices of a square with side length 10, so the area of the square is $10^2 = 100$. Therefore, the area of the convex polygon is 100. The answer is: $100$

Below is a math problem you are to solve (positive numerical answer!):
"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"
Analyze this problem and think step by step to come to a solution with programs. After solving the problem, output the final numerical answer within \boxed{}.

 To solve this problem, we need to analyze the equation and understand when it equals zero. The equation is:
$$((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$$
For the product of two terms to be zero, either one of the terms must be zero. This gives us two cases:
Case 1: $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$
Case 2: $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$

For Case 1, both $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2$ and $( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2$ must be zero. This implies that $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. Solving these equations, we get the lines $x + y = 10$, $x + y = -10$, $x - y = 10$, and $x - y = -10$. These lines form a rectangle with side lengths 20 and 10.

For Case 2, both $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2$ and $( \vert y \vert - 8)^2$ must be zero. This implies that $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$. Solving these equations, we get the lines $x = 8$, $x = -8$, $y = 8$, and $y = -8$. These lines form a square with side length 16.

The intersection of the solutions from Case 1 and Case 2 is the convex polygon we are looking for. This polygon is a rectangle with side lengths 20 and 10, and a square with side length 16.

The area of the rectangle is $20 \times 10 = 200$, and the area of the square is $16 \times 16 = 256$. Adding these two areas together, we get the total area of the convex polygon:
$$\text{Area} = 200 + 256 = 456$$
Therefore, the area of the convex polygon is 456. The answer is: 456

"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"

The equation $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + (\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ implies that $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$, which means $x + y = \pm 10$ and $x - y = \pm 10$. Solving these four equations gives us the vertices of the square: $(8, 2)$, $(8, -2)$, $(-8, -2)$, and $(-8, 2)$.

The equation $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + (\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ implies that $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$, which means $x = \pm 8$ and $y = \pm 8$. This forms a square with side length $16$.

The vertices of the first square are also the vertices of the second square, so the area of the convex polygon is the area of the square with side length $16$. The area of a square is side length squared, so the area of the convex polygon is $16^2 = 256$.

So, the area of the convex polygon is $256$.
The answer is: $256$

Below is a math problem you are to solve (positive numerical answer!):
"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"
Analyze this problem and think step by step to come to a solution with programs. After solving the problem, output the final numerical answer within \boxed{}.

Assistant:


The equation is given as $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$. This equation is true if either of the two factors is zero. 

The first factor is zero when $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ or $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. This gives us four lines in the plane: $x + y = 10$, $x + y = -10$, $x - y = 10$, and $x - y = -10$. 

The second factor is zero when $\vert x \vert = 8$ or $\vert y \vert = 8$. This gives us four lines in the plane: $x = 8$, $x = -8$, $y = 8$, and $y = -8$. 

The intersection points of these lines are the vertices of the polygon. By calculating these intersection points, we find that the polygon is a square with side length 16. 

The area of this square is $16^2 = 256$. 

So, the area of the convex polygon is 256. The answer is: $256$

"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"

This problem requires a deep understanding of absolute value and inequalities. The equation
\[((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0\]
can be true if and only if either of the two factors is equal to zero. This gives us four conditions to consider:

1. $\vert x + y \vert - 10 = 0$, which implies $\vert x + y \vert = 10$.
2. $\vert x - y \vert - 10 = 0$, which implies $\vert x - y \vert = 10$.
3. $\vert x \vert - 8 = 0$, which implies $\vert x \vert = 8$.
4. $\vert y \vert - 8 = 0$, which implies $\vert y \vert = 8$.

These conditions define a square with side length 16 (since the square is formed by the intersections of the lines $\vert x + y \vert = 10$, $\vert x - y \vert = 10$, $\vert x \vert = 8$, and $\vert y \vert = 8$). The area of this square is $16^2 = 256$. Therefore, the area of the convex polygon is 256.
