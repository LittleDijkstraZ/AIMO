Interesting, let's analyze step by step:



The only way the product of two numbers is 0 is if one or both numbers are 0. Therefore, either $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$.

If $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$, then $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. These conditions imply that $x + y = \pm 10$ and $x - y = \pm 10$. Solving these equations, we get four lines: $x + y = 10$, $x + y = -10$, $x - y = 10$, and $x - y = -10$. These lines form a rectangle with vertices at $(10, 0)$, $(-10, 0)$, $(0, 10)$, and $(0, -10)$.

If $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$, then $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$. This implies that $x = \pm 8$ and $y = \pm 8$. Solving these equations, we get four lines: $x = 8$, $x = -8$, $y = 8$, and $y = -8$. These lines form a square with vertices at $(8, 8)$, $(-8, 8)$, $(-8, -8)$, and $(8, -8)$.

The intersection of these two sets of lines forms a square with side length 16 and vertices at $(8, 8)$, $(-8, 8)$, $(-8, -8)$, and $(8, -8)$. The area of this square is $16^2 = 256$.
The answer is: $256$.

Interesting, let's analyze step by step:



1. List the variables and known values from the problem.
Variables: $x, y$
Known values: None, all other values are derived from the equations.

2. Outline the steps using sympy to solve the problem:
- Identify the sympy functions required for each step.
  We require: `Abs`, `Symbol`, `Eq`, `solve` and `Integral`.
- Implement these functions step-by-step, commenting each line for clarity.

Since the problem asks for the area of a convex polygon, we know that the points that satisfy the equation are the vertices of the polygon. The equation given is:
$$((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$$
This equation is satisfied only when both terms are equal to 0, which means that $\vert x + y \vert = 10$, $\vert x - y \vert = 10$, $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$.
Solving these equations, we get the vertices of the polygon as:
$x, y = \{ (8,0), (0,8), (-8,0), (0,-8), (8,-8), (-8,8), (8,8), (-8,-8) \}$.

To find the area of the polygon, we can use the formula for the area of a polygon given the vertices:
$$A = \frac{1}{2} \left| \sum_{i=1}^n (x_i y_{i+1} - x_{i+1} y_i) \right|,$$
where $n$ is the number of vertices, and $(x_i, y_i)$ are the vertices of the polygon.

Here we have 8 vertices, so $n=8$. We can calculate the area using python as follows:

```python


INTERMEDIATE OUT :

from sympy import Matrix, Abs

def polygon_area():
    # Vertices of the polygon
    vertices = [(8, 0), (0, 8), (-8, 0), (0, -8), (8, -8), (-8, 8), (8, 8), (-8, -8)]

    # Number of vertices
    n = len(vertices)

    # Calculate the area using the formula
    area = Abs(sum((vertices[i][0]*vertices[(i+1)%n][1] - vertices[(i+1)%n][0]*vertices[i][1]) for i in range(n))) / 2

    return area

result = polygon_area()
print(result)
```

CODE RESULTS 96

INTERMEDIATE OUT :
```output
96
```
The area of the polygon is 96. Since it is a positive integer, our calculation is correct.

3. Calculate the final answer and verify it's a positive integer.
We have calculated the area of the polygon to be 96, which is a positive integer.

4. Output the result within the correct box. The area of the polygon is $\boxed{96}$. The answer is: 96

Interesting, let's analyze step by step:


1- The condition given is the product of two quantities equal to zero, which implies that each quantity must be zero. So, we have two equations: $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ and $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$, and $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ and $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$.
2- For each equation of the form $(\vert z \vert - a)^2 = 0$, the only solution is $\vert z \vert = a$, which implies $z = a$ or $z = -a$. Thus, we get the following system of equations: $\vert x + y \vert = 10$, $\vert x - y \vert = 10$, $\vert x \vert = 8$, and $\vert y \vert = 8$.
3- This system implies $x + y = \pm 10$, $x - y = \pm 10$, $x = \pm 8$, and $y = \pm 8$.
4- Considering all possible combinations, we get the vertices of the polygon: $(8, 2)$, $(8, -2)$, $(-8, 2)$, $(-8, -2)$, $(2, 8)$, $(-2, 8)$, $(2, -8)$, and $(-2, -8)$.
5- To find the area of the polygon, we can use the shoelace formula. The shoelace formula for a polygon with vertices $(x_1, y_1), (x_2, y_2), ..., (x_n, y_n)$ is given by: $A = \frac{1}{2} \vert (x_1y_2 + x_2y_3 + ... + x_ny_1) - (y_1x_2 + y_2x_3 + ... + y_nx_1) \vert$. Applying the formula to our polygon, we get: \[A = \frac{1}{2} \vert (8\cdot2 + 8\cdot(-2) + (-8)\cdot2 + (-8)\cdot(-2) + 2\cdot8 + (-2)\cdot8 + 2\cdot(-8) + (-2)\cdot(-8)) - (2\cdot8 + (-2)\cdot(-8) + 8\cdot2 + (-8)\cdot(-2) + 8\cdot(-2) + 2\cdot8 + (-2)\cdot(-8) + (-8)\cdot2) \vert = \frac{1}{2} \vert 0 - 0 \vert = 0$.

However, we made a mistake in our calculations. The vertices of the polygon should be $(8, 2)$, $(8, -2)$, $(-8, 2)$, $(-8, -2)$, $(2, 8)$, $(2, -8)$, $(-2, 8)$, and $(-2, -8)$. Let's redo the calculations: \[A = \frac{1}{2} \vert (8\cdot2 + 8\cdot(-2) + (-8)\cdot2 + (-8)\cdot(-2) + 2\cdot8 + 2\cdot(-8) + (-2)\cdot8 + (-2)\cdot(-8)) - (2\cdot8 + (-2)\cdot(-8) + 8\cdot2 + (-8)\cdot(-2) + 8\cdot(-2) + (-2)\cdot8 + (-8)\cdot2 + 2\cdot(-8)) \vert = \frac{1}{2} \vert 0 - 0 \vert = 0.\]

The area of the polygon is 0, but this doesn't seem correct for a polygon. Let's reconsider the problem. The equation $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ implies $\vert x + y \vert = 10$, which means $x + y = \pm 10$. Similarly, $\vert x - y \vert = 10$ implies $x - y = \pm 10$. And $\vert x \vert = 8$ implies $x = \pm 8$, and $\vert y \vert = 8$ implies $y = \pm 8$. By considering all possible combinations, we get the vertices of the polygon as $(8, 2)$, $(8, -2)$, $(-8, 2)$, $(-8, -2)$, $(2, 8)$, $(2, -8)$, $(-2, 8)$, and $(-2, -8)$. These vertices form a square with side length $10$. Therefore, the area of the polygon is the area of the square, which is $10^2 = 100$.

The area of the convex polygon is $100$.
The answer is: $100$

Interesting, let's analyze step by step:



1. The given equation is a product of two terms equal to zero. This means either the first term is zero or the second term is zero. Let's denote the two terms as $A = ((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)$ and $B = ((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2)$. So, we have $A = 0$ or $B = 0$.

2. Solving $A = 0$ gives $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. These are four lines in the plane: $x + y = 10$, $x + y = -10$, $x - y = 10$, and $x - y = -10$. The intersections of these lines form a rectangle with vertices at $(8,2)$, $(8,-18)$, $(-18,2)$, and $(-18,-18)$.

3. Solving $B = 0$ gives $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$. These are four lines in the plane: $x = 8$, $x = -8$, $y = 8$, and $y = -8$. The intersections of these lines form a square with vertices at $(8,8)$, $(8,-8)$, $(-8,8)$, and $(-8,-8)$.

4. The convex polygon is the intersection of the two regions defined by $A = 0$ and $B = 0$. It's the square formed by the points $(8,8)$, $(8,-8)$, $(-8,8)$, and $(-8,-8)$.

5. The area of this square is the side length squared, and the side length is 16 (since the distance from $(8,0)$ to $(-8,0)$ is 16), so the area is $16^2 = 256$.

So, the area of the convex polygon is $256$. This is a positive integer, as requested.

```python


INTERMEDIATE OUT :

def polygon_area():
    """The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"""
    # Side length of the square
    side_length = 16

    # Area of the square
    area = side_length**2

    return area

result = polygon_area()
print(result)
```

CODE RESULTS 256

INTERMEDIATE OUT :
```output

```
The area of the convex polygon is $256$. Therefore, the answer is $\boxed{256}$.

Interesting, let's analyze step by step:



The given expression is $0$, thus, either of the two terms must be $0$, because the product of two numbers is $0$ if and only if at least one of the numbers is $0$.

Let's consider the two terms separately:

1) $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2) = 0$

This is possible only if both $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2$ and $( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2$ are $0$. This can happen only if $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$, which implies $x + y = \pm10$ and $x - y = \pm10$. Solving these equations, we find the four vertices of the square are $(0, 10), (10, 0), (0, -10), (-10, 0)$.

2) $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$

This is possible only if both $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2$ and $( \vert y \vert - 8)^2$ are $0$. This can happen only if $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$, which implies $x = \pm8$ and $y = \pm8$. Solving these equations, we find the four vertices of the square are $(8, 8), (8, -8), (-8, 8), (-8, -8)$.

Combining the results from both terms, the convex polygon formed is a $8 \times 10$ rectangle. The area of the rectangle is $8 \times 10 = 80$.

So, the area of the convex polygon is $80$. This is a positive integer.

Therefore, the answer is $\boxed{80}$.

We know that a product of two quantities is zero if and only if at least one of the quantities is zero. So we have two cases:

1. $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0 \Rightarrow \vert x + y \vert = 10$, or
2. $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0 \Rightarrow \vert x - y \vert = 10$, or
3. $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0 \Rightarrow \vert x \vert = 8$, or
4. $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0 \Rightarrow \vert y \vert = 8$.

In the first case, $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ implies that $-10 \leq x + y \leq 10$. Similarly, $\vert x - y \vert = 10$ implies that $-10 \leq x - y \leq 10$, $\vert x \vert = 8$ implies that $-8 \leq x \leq 8$, and $\vert y \vert = 8$ implies that $-8 \leq y \leq 8$. These conditions form a square with side length $20$, so its area is $400$. The answer is: $400$

Interesting, let's analyze step by step:



We know the condition is $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$. This condition can be true only when either $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$. 

Now, let's recall that if $a^2 = 0$, then $a = 0$. So the above conditions are satisfied only when either $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$ or $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$. 

For the former condition to be true, $x + y = \pm 10$ and $x - y = \pm 10$. Solving these equations gives us four points: $(5,5), (5,-5), (-5,5), (-5,-5)$.

For the latter condition to be true, $x = \pm 8$ and $y = \pm 8$. This gives us four more points: $(8,8), (8,-8), (-8,8), (-8,-8)$.

So the total eight points are: $(5,5), (5,-5), (-5,5), (-5,-5), (8,8), (8,-8), (-8,8), (-8,-8)$.

The eight points enclose a square, with side length 10 (the distance between the points $(5,5)$ and $(5,-5)$, or $(8,8)$ and $(8,-8)$, for example). The area of a square is side length squared, so the area of this square is $10^2 = 100$.
The answer is: 100

The expression is $0$ only when either of its factors is $0$, hence we have two sets of equations:

1. $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$, which implies $\vert x + y \vert = 10$. This is the equation of two lines: $y = -x + 10$ and $y = -x - 10$.

2. $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$, which implies $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. This is also the equation of two lines: $y = x - 10$ and $y = x + 10$.

3. $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$, which implies $\vert x \vert = 8$, or $x = 8$ and $x = -8$.

4. $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$, which implies $\vert y \vert = 8$, or $y = 8$ and $y = -8$.

These lines form a square with side length $20$. The area of this square is $20^2 = 400$.

Interesting, let's analyze step by step:



1) Identify the sympy functions required for each step.

This problem doesn't actually need sympy for solving the problem. The equation is a product of two equations, and it equals 0. This means that either the first equation equals 0, the second equation equals 0, or both equal 0. The absolute value function makes this a bit tricky, but we can still solve it by considering different cases for the signs of $x$ and $y$. The final solution will be a polygon, and we can find its vertices by considering each case separately and finding the points where the absolute value functions change their sign. Then we can find the area of the polygon.

2) Implement these functions step-by-step, commenting each line for clarity.

Let's analyze each absolute value function and consider the different cases for the signs of $x$ and $y$.

For the equation $|x+y|-10=0$, it means $|x+y|=10$. This happens when $(x+y)=10$ or $(x+y)=-10$. So we have two cases to consider:

- Case 1: $(x+y)=10$ and $(x-y)=10$. Solving these two equations simultaneously gives $x=y=5$.
- Case 2: $(x+y)=-10$ and $(x-y)=-10$. Solving these two equations simultaneously gives $x=-y=-5$.

For the equation $|x|-8=0$, it means $|x|=8$. This happens when $x=8$ or $x=-8$.

Similarly, for the equation $|y|-8=0$, it means $|y|=8$. This happens when $y=8$ or $y=-8$.

Combining these results, we have four vertices for the polygon: $(8,8)$, $(8,-8)$, $(-8,8)$, and $(-8,-8)$.

Now we can find the area of the polygon. It's a square with side length 16 (since the distance between $(8,8)$ and $(8,-8)$ is 16), so its area is $16^2=256$.

3) Calculate the final answer and verify it's a positive integer.

The area of the polygon is 256, which is a positive integer.

4) Output the result within the correct format.

The area of the polygon is 256. The answer is: $256$.
