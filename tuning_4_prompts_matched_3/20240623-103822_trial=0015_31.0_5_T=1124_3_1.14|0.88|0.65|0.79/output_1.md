Approach:


We will use the Cauchy-Schwarz inequality to solve this problem.

First, let's rewrite the given equation $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$ as follows:
\[|x-2y| + |y-2x| = |x-2y| + |2y-x| = |(x-2y) - (2y-x)| = |2(x-y)| = 40.\]
Thus, $|x-y| = 20$.

Now, let's consider the expression $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$. We can rewrite it as:
\[5(x^2+y^2) - 8xy = 5[(x-y)^2 + 2xy] - 8xy = 5[(x-y)^2 + 2xy] - 8xy.\]
Since $|x-y| = 20$, we know that $(x-y)^2 = 400$.

We can substitute this into the expression:
\[5[(x-y)^2 + 2xy] - 8xy = 5[400 + 2xy] - 8xy = 2000 + 10xy - 8xy = 2000 + 2xy.\]
To minimize this expression, we need to minimize $2xy$. By the Cauchy-Schwarz inequality, we have:
\[(1+1)(x^2+y^2) \geq (x+y)^2.\]
Thus, $2(x^2+y^2) \geq (x+y)^2$. Since $|x-y| = 20$, we know that $|x+y| \leq |x-y| + 2|y| = 20 + 2|y|$.

Then,
\[2(x^2+y^2) \geq (x+y)^2 \geq (20 + 2|y|)^2.\]
Expanding and simplifying, we get:
\[2(x^2+y^2) \geq 400 + 80|y| + 4|y|^2.\]
Taking the expectation value of both sides:
\[2E(x^2+y^2) \geq 400 + 80E|y| + 4E|y|^2.\]
Since $x$ and $y$ are random variables, we can assume they have the same distribution, so $E(x^2) = E(y^2)$ and $E|x| = E|y|$. Thus, we can write:
\[2[2E(x^2)] \geq 400 + 80E|y| + 4E|y|^2.\]
Simplifying, we get:
\[4E(x^2) \geq 400 + 80E|y| + 4E|y|^2.\]
Since $E|y|$ and $E|y|^2$ are both non-negative, the minimum value of the right-hand side is achieved when $E|y| = 0$ and $E|y|^2 = 0$. This implies that $y = 0$ with probability 1.

Since $y = 0$, we have $x = \pm 10$. Thus, the minimum value of the expression $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ is achieved when $x = 10$ and $y = 0$, or when $x = -10$ and $y = 0$. In either case, the minimum value is the same:
\[5(10^2) + 5(0^2) - 8(10)(0) = 500.\]
So, the minimum value of the expression $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ under the condition $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$ is $500$. The answer is: $500$

Approach:


To find the minimum value of the expression $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ given the constraint $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$, we can use the Cauchy-Schwarz inequality. The Cauchy-Schwarz inequality states that for any real numbers $a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n$ and $b_1, b_2, \dots, b_n$, we have
\[(a_1^2 + a_2^2 + \dots + a_n^2)(b_1^2 + b_2^2 + \dots + b_n^2) \ge (a_1b_1 + a_2b_2 + \dots + a_nb_n)^2.\]
In our case, we can set $a_1 = x - 2y$, $a_2 = y - 2x$, $b_1 = 1$, and $b_2 = 1$. Then we have
\[(a_1^2 + a_2^2)(b_1^2 + b_2^2) \ge (a_1b_1 + a_2b_2)^2,\]
which simplifies to
\[((x - 2y)^2 + (y - 2x)^2)(1 + 1) \ge (x - 2y + y - 2x)^2.\]
Simplifying further gives
\[(x^2 - 4xy + 4y^2 + y^2 - 4xy + 4x^2)(2) \ge (-x - y)^2.\]
This simplifies to
\[(5x^2 - 8xy + 5y^2)(2) \ge (x + y)^2,\]
which simplifies to
\[10x^2 - 16xy + 10y^2 \ge x^2 + 2xy + y^2.\]
This further simplifies to
\[9x^2 - 18xy + 9y^2 \ge 0.\]
This can be written as
\[9(x^2 - 2xy + y^2) \ge 0,\]
or
\[9(x - y)^2 \ge 0.\]
Since $(x - y)^2$ is always non-negative, this inequality holds true.

Now, we know that $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$ implies that $(x - 2y)^2 + (y - 2x)^2 = 40^2$. We can rewrite this as
\[5(x^2 - 2xy + y^2) = 1600.\]
From the inequality we derived above, we have
\[5(x^2 - 2xy + y^2) \ge 0,\]
which means that $5(x^2 - 2xy + y^2) = 1600$ implies that equality holds in the Cauchy-Schwarz inequality. This means that the vectors $\begin{pmatrix} x - 2y \end{pmatrix}$ and $\begin{pmatrix} 1 \end{pmatrix}$ are proportional, or $x - 2y = k$ for some constant $k$. Similarly, we can show that $y - 2x = -k$. Solving these equations simultaneously gives $x = 4k$ and $y = -2k$. Substituting these values into the constraint equation gives
\[|4k + 4k| + |-2k + 8k| = 40,\]
which simplifies to
\[8k + 6k = 40,\]
or
\[14k = 40,\]
which gives $k = \frac{20}{7}$.

Substituting $x = 4k$ and $y = -2k$ into the expression $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ gives
\[5(4k)^2 + 5(-2k)^2 - 8(4k)(-2k) = 5(16k^2) + 5(4k^2) - 8(-8k^2) = 80k^2 + 20k^2 + 64k^2 = 164k^2.\]
Substituting $k = \frac{20}{7}$ gives
\[164 \left(\frac{20}{7}\right)^2 = \frac{65600}{49}.\]
The minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ given the constraint $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$ is $\frac{65600}{49}$. However, this value is not an integer. We made a mistake in our reasoning.

Let's go back and look at the Cauchy-Schwarz inequality again. The correct inequality should be
\[(a_1^2 + a_2^2)(b_1^2 + b_2^2) \ge (a_1b_1 - a_2b_2)^2.\]
In our case, we can set $a_1 = x - 2y$, $a_2 = y - 2x$, $b_1 = 1$, and $b_2 = -1$. Then we have
\[(a_1^2 + a_2^2)(b_1^2 + b_2^2) \ge (a_1b_1 - a_2b_2)^2,\]
which simplifies to
\[((x - 2y)^2 + (y - 2x)^2)(1 + 1) \ge (x - 2y - y + 2x)^2.\]
Simplifying further gives
\[(x^2 - 4xy + 4y^2 + y^2 - 4xy + 4x^2)(2) \ge (3x - 3y)^2.\]
This simplifies to
\[(5x^2 - 8xy + 5y^2)(2) \ge 9x^2 - 18xy + 9y^2.\]
This further simplifies to
\[10x^2 - 16xy + 10y^2 \ge 9x^2 - 18xy + 9y^2,\]
which simplifies to
\[x^2 + 2xy - y^2 \ge 0,\]
or
\[(x + y)^2 \ge 0.\]
Since $(x + y)^2$ is always non-negative, this inequality holds true.

Now, we know that $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$ implies that $(x - 2y)^2 + (y - 2x)^2 = 40^2$. We can rewrite this as
\[5(x^2 - 2xy + y^2) = 1600.\]
From the inequality we derived above, we have
\[(x + y)^2 \ge 0,\]
which means that $(x + y)^2 = 0$ implies that $x + y = 0$, or $y

Approach:


This is an optimization problem with a constraint. To solve it, we can use the method of Lagrange multipliers. Let's define a new function $F(x, y, \lambda) = 5x^2 + 5y^2 - 8xy + \lambda(|x - 2y| + |y - 2x| - 40)$. The condition $|x - 2y| + |y - 2x| = 40$ must hold, so we want to find the minimum of $F(x, y, \lambda)$ subject to this constraint. To find the minimum, we need to solve the system of equations given by $\nabla F = 0$.

1. $\frac{\partial F}{\partial x} = 10x - 8y + \lambda(-1 + 2\delta(x - 2y)) = 0$
2. $\frac{\partial F}{\partial y} = 10y - 8x + \lambda(1 - 2\delta(y - 2x)) = 0$
3. $\frac{\partial F}{\partial \lambda} = |x - 2y| + |y - 2x| - 40 = 0$

Here, $\delta(x)$ is the Dirac delta function, which is 1 if $x \geq 0$ and 0 otherwise. To simplify the system, we can consider the four cases for the signs of $x - 2y$ and $y - 2x$. However, due to the symmetry of the problem, we only need to consider two cases:

Case 1: $x - 2y \geq 0$ and $y - 2x \geq 0$. Then, $\delta(x - 2y) = 1$ and $\delta(y - 2x) = 1$. The system becomes:

1. $10x - 8y - \lambda = 0$
2. $10y - 8x + \lambda = 0$
3. $x - 2y + y - 2x = 40$

From equations 1 and 2, we get $x = y$. Substituting this into the third equation gives $0 = 40$, which is a contradiction. Therefore, this case does not give any solutions.

Case 2: $x - 2y < 0$ and $y - 2x < 0$. Then, $\delta(x - 2y) = 0$ and $\delta(y - 2x) = 0$. The system becomes:

1. $10x - 8y = 0$
2. $10y - 8x = 0$
3. $-x + 2y - y + 2x = 40$

From equations 1 and 2, we get $x = y$. Substituting this into the third equation gives $x = 20$. Therefore, the solution is $(x, y) = (20, 20)$. Substituting this into the original function gives the minimum value:

$5(20)^2 + 5(20)^2 - 8(20)(20) = 2000$.

So, the minimum value of $5x^2 + 5y^2 - 8xy$ is $2000$ under the constraint $|x - 2y| + |y - 2x| = 40$.

The answer is: $2000$

Solve the following problem with a Python Script (positive numerical answer):
"What is the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ when $x$ and $y$ range over all real numbers such that $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$?"

Approach:



To solve this problem, we will first find the relationship between $x$ and $y$ from the equation $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$. Then we substitute this relationship into the expression $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ and find its minimum value.

Step 1: From the equation $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$, we can deduce that $x-2y$ and $y-2x$ must have the same absolute value, because the sum of their absolute values is a constant. This gives us two possibilities:

1) $x - 2y = y - 2x$, which simplifies to $3x = 3y$, or $x = y$.

2) $x - 2y = 2x - y$, which simplifies to $x = 4y$.

Step 2: Now we substitute these two possibilities into the expression $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$.

For the first possibility $x = y$, the expression becomes $5x^2+5x^2-8x^2 = 2x^2$.

For the second possibility $x = 4y$, the expression becomes $5(4y)^2+5y^2-8(4y)y = 80y^2+5y^2-32y^2 = 57y^2$.

Step 3: To find the minimum value of these expressions, we can take the derivative with respect to $x$ or $y$ and set it to zero. 

For the expression $2x^2$, the derivative is $4x$, setting it to zero gives $x = 0$.

For the expression $57y^2$, the derivative is $114y$, setting it to zero gives $y = 0$.

But $x = y = 0$ doesn't satisfy the equation $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$. So we discard this solution.

Step 4: We then substitute $x = y$ into the equation $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$, we get $|x-2x| + |x-2x| = 40$, which simplifies to $2|x-2x| = 40$, or $2|x| = 40$, so $|x| = 20$, which means $x = \pm 20$.

Step 5: Substitute $x = 20$ into the expression $2x^2$, we get $2(20)^2 = 800$. Substitute $x = -20$ into the expression $2x^2$, we also get $2(-20)^2 = 800$.

Step 6: Therefore, the minimum value of the expression $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ is $800$ under the condition $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$.

The answer is: $800$

Approach:


To solve this problem, we first observe that the condition $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$ is equivalent to $|x-2y| = |2x-y|$, which implies that $x-2y = 2x-y$ or $x-2y = -(2x-y)$. Solving these equations gives $x = 2y$ or $y = 2x$. Substituting these values into the expression $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$, we can find its minimum value.

The given expression can be written as $5x^2+5y^2-8xy = 5(x^2 + y^2) - 8xy$. Now, we use the identity $x^2 + y^2 = (x-y)^2 + 2xy$ to rewrite the expression as $5((x-y)^2 + 2xy) - 8xy = 5(x-y)^2 + 2xy$.

For $x = 2y$, the expression becomes $5(3y^2) + 2(4y^2) = 15y^2 + 8y^2 = 23y^2$. For $y = 2x$, the expression becomes $5(3x^2) + 2(-4x^2) = 15x^2 - 8x^2 = 7x^2$.

Since the minimum value of $x^2$ or $y^2$ is $0$, the minimum value of the expression is achieved when either $x = 2y$ or $y = 2x$. In this case, both yield the same minimum value, which is $0$. However, the condition $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$ is not satisfied when $x = 2y$ or $y = 2x$. Therefore, we need to find another way to minimize the given expression.

We can rewrite the expression as $5(x^2 + y^2) - 8xy = 5(x^2 + 2xy + y^2 - 2xy) - 8xy = 5((x+y)^2 - 2xy) - 8xy = 5(x+y)^2 - 13xy$.

By AM-GM inequality, $(x+y)^2 \ge 4xy$, so $5(x+y)^2 \ge 20xy$. Thus, $5(x+y)^2 - 13xy \ge 7xy$. To minimize this expression, we want to minimize $xy$.

From the condition $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$, we know that $x - 2y$ and $y - 2x$ have the same absolute value. This implies that either $x - 2y = y - 2x$ or $x - 2y = -(y - 2x)$. Solving these equations gives $x = 2y$ or $y = 2x$. However, these solutions do not satisfy the condition $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$.

Therefore, we need to consider another possibility. We can rewrite the condition as $|x-2y| = |2x-y|$ as we did before. If $x - 2y = 2x - y$, then $y = x$. If $x - 2y = -(2x - y)$, then $x = y$. Both of these solutions do not satisfy the condition $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$. However, if we consider the equation $x - 2y = -(y - 2x)$, we get $x - 2y = -y + 2x$, which simplifies to $x = 4y$. Substituting this into the condition gives $|3y| + |-7y| = 40$, which simplifies to $10|y| = 40$, and thus $|y| = 4$. The minimum value of $xy$ is achieved when $x = 4y$, so $xy = (4y)(y) = 4y^2$. Substituting $|y| = 4$ gives $xy = 4(4^2) = 64$.

Therefore, the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ is achieved when $x = 4y$, and is equal to $5(x+y)^2 - 13xy = 5(5y)^2 - 13(64) = 125y^2 - 832$. Substituting $|y| = 4$ gives $125(4^2) - 832 = 2000 - 832 = 1168$.

However, we made a mistake in the calculation. Let's recompute the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ when $x = 4y$.

Substituting $x = 4y$ into the expression $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$, we get $5(4y)^2 + 5y^2 - 8(4y)(y) = 80y^2 + 5y^2 - 32y^2 = 53y^2$. Substituting $|y| = 4$ gives $53(4^2) = 53(16) = 848$.

The mistake came from the fact that when $x = 4y$, the expression is actually $5(x^2 + y^2) - 8xy = 5(16y^2 + y^2) - 8(4y)(y) = 95y^2 - 32y^2 = 63y^2$. Substituting $|y| = 4$ gives $63(4^2) = 63(16) = 1008$.

However, this still doesn't match our previous result of $1168$. The mistake in our previous calculation was in the step $5(x+y)^2 - 13xy = 5(5y)^2 - 13(64) = 125y^2 - 832$. The correct calculation should be $5(x+y)^2 - 13xy = 5(5y)^2 - 13(16y^2) = 125y^2 - 208y^2 = 27y^2$. Substituting $|y| = 4$ gives $27(4^2) = 27(16) = 432$.

This still doesn't match our previous result of $848$. The mistake in our previous calculation was in the step $5(x^2 + y^2) - 8xy = 5(16y^2 + y^2) - 8(4y)(y) = 95y^2 - 32y^

Approach:


To solve this problem, we will use the AM-GM inequality (Arithmetic Mean-Geometric Mean inequality). The AM-GM inequality states that for any non-negative real numbers $a$ and $b$, $(a+b)/2 \geq \sqrt{ab}$. We will use this inequality to find a lower bound for the function $f(x,y) = 5x^2 + 5y^2 - 8xy$.

First, let's simplify the constraint equation $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$. By the triangle inequality, $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = |x-2y + (y-2x)| = |-(x-2y+y-2x)| = |-(-x+y)| = |-(-1)(x-y)| = |-1||x-y| = |x-y| = 40$. Therefore, we have $|x-y| = 40$.

Now, let's consider the function $f(x,y) = 5x^2 + 5y^2 - 8xy = 5(x^2 + y^2) - 8xy$. We can rewrite this as $f(x,y) = 5[(x-y)^2 + 2xy] - 8xy$.

Using the AM-GM inequality, we have $2xy \geq 2\sqrt{(x-y)^2} = 2|x-y| = 80$. Therefore, $f(x,y) = 5[(x-y)^2 + 2xy] - 8xy \geq 5[(x-y)^2 + 80] - 8xy$.

Since $(x-y)^2 \geq 0$, we have $f(x,y) \geq 5[0 + 80] - 8xy = 400 - 8xy$.

Now, we want to minimize $f(x,y)$. By the AM-GM inequality, $8xy \leq 8\sqrt{(x-y)^2} = 8|x-y| = 320$. Therefore, $f(x,y) = 400 - 8xy \geq 400 - 320 = 80$.

So, the minimum value of $5x^2 + 5y^2 - 8xy$ is 80 when $|x-y| = 40$.

Therefore, the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ is 80. The answer is: $80$

Approach:


To find the minimum value of the expression $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ subject to the constraint $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$, we can use the Cauchy-Schwarz inequality. The Cauchy-Schwarz inequality states that for any real numbers $a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n$ and $b_1, b_2, \dots, b_n$, we have
$$(a_1^2 + a_2^2 + \dots + a_n^2)(b_1^2 + b_2^2 + \dots + b_n^2) \geq (a_1b_1 + a_2b_2 + \dots + a_nb_n)^2.$$
In this case, we can let $a_1 = x - 2y$, $a_2 = y - 2x$, $b_1 = 1$, and $b_2 = 1$. Then, the left side of the inequality becomes
$$(a_1^2 + a_2^2)(b_1^2 + b_2^2) = ((x - 2y)^2 + (y - 2x)^2)(1^2 + 1^2) = 2((x - 2y)^2 + (y - 2x)^2),$$
and the right side becomes $(a_1b_1 + a_2b_2)^2 = (x - 2y + y - 2x)^2 = (0)^2 = 0$.
Thus, we have
$$2((x - 2y)^2 + (y - 2x)^2) \geq 0.$$
Since $(x - 2y)^2 + (y - 2x)^2 \geq 0$ for all $x$ and $y$, the equality holds if and only if $x - 2y = y - 2x$, or $x = y$.
Now, substituting $x = y$ into the constraint equation, we get
$$|x - 2x| + |x - 2x| = | -x| + |-x| = 2|x| = 40,$$
which implies $|x| = 20$, so $x = \pm 20$. Since the expression we want to minimize, $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$, is symmetric in $x$ and $y$, we can assume without loss of generality that $x = 20$. Then $y = 20$ as well.
Substituting $x = y = 20$ into the expression we want to minimize, we get
$$5x^2 + 5y^2 - 8xy = 5(20)^2 + 5(20)^2 - 8(20)(20) = 2000 + 2000 - 3200 = 800.$$
Thus, the minimum value of $5x^2 + 5y^2 - 8xy$ subject to the constraint is 800. The answer is: $800$

The given expression $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ can be rewritten as $5(x^2+y^2) - 8xy = 5[(x-y)^2 + 2xy] - 8xy = 5(x-y)^2 + 3xy$.

We want to find the minimum value of this expression under the condition $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$.

The condition $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$ can be rewritten as $|x-2y| + |2y-x| = 40$. By the triangle inequality, $|a| + |b| \geq |a+b|$, we know that $|x-2y| + |2y-x| \geq |(x-2y) + (2y-x)| = 0$. The equality occurs when $(x-2y)$ and $(2y-x)$ have the same sign, which implies $x=2y$ or $y=2x$.

If $x=2y$, we substitute into the condition to get $|x-x| + |x-2x| = 0 + |-x| = |x| = 40$, so $x=\pm 20$. Similarly, if $y=2x$, we substitute into the condition to get $|2x-x| + |x-4x| = |x| + |-3x| = 4|x| = 40$, so $x=\pm \frac{20}{3}$.

So the possible pairs of $(x, y)$ are $(\pm 20, \pm 10)$ and $(\pm \frac{20}{3}, \pm \frac{20}{3})$. Now we substitute these pairs into the expression $5(x-y)^2 + 3xy$ to find the minimum value.

For $(x, y) = (20, 10)$, we get $5(20-10)^2 + 3*20*10 = 5*100^2 + 600 = 5000 + 600 = 5600$.

For $(x, y) = (-20, -10)$, we get $5(-20+10)^2 + 3*(-20)*(-10) = 5*100^2 + 600 = 5000 + 600 = 5600$.

For $(x, y) = (\frac{20}{3}, \frac{20}{3})$, we get $5(\frac{20}{3}-\frac{20}{3})^2 + 3*\frac{20}{3}*\frac{20}{3} = 5*0 + 400 = 400$.

For $(x, y) = (-\frac{20}{3}, -\frac{20}{3})$, we get $5(-\frac{20}{3}+\frac{20}{3})^2 + 3*(-\frac{20}{3})*(-\frac{20}{3}) = 5*0 + 400 = 400$.

So the minimum value of the expression is $400$. The answer is: $400$

This is a problem in optimization. The main idea is to use the condition $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$ to express $y$ in terms of $x$, and then substitute it into the expression $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$, and simplify it to a single variable function. Then we can find the minimum of this function.

First, let's rewrite the condition $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$ as follows:

If $x \geq 2y$, then $x - 2y + y - 2x = 40 \Rightarrow -x - y = 40 \Rightarrow y = -x - 40$.

If $x < 2y$, then $2y - x + 2x - y = 40 \Rightarrow y + x = 40 \Rightarrow y = 40 - x$.

So, we have two cases:

1) $y = -x - 40$

2) $y = 40 - x$

Now, we substitute these expressions of $y$ into the expression $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$:

Case 1: $y = -x - 40$, we have $5x^2+5(-x - 40)^2-8x(-x - 40) = 5x^2+5(x^2+80x+1600)-8x^2+320x = 5x^2+5x^2+400x+8000-8x^2+320x = 2x^2+720x+8000$.

Case 2: $y = 40 - x$, we have $5x^2+5(40 - x)^2-8x(40 - x) = 5x^2+5(1600 - 80x + x^2)-8x(40 - x) = 5x^2+8000-400x + 5x^2 - 320x + 8x^2 = 18x^2-720x+8000$.

Both cases give us a single variable function $f(x) = 2x^2+720x+8000$ and $g(x) = 18x^2-720x+8000$.

To find the minimum value of these functions, we take the derivative and set it to zero:

For $f(x)$: $f'(x) = 4x + 720 = 0 \Rightarrow x = -180$.

For $g(x)$: $g'(x) = 36x - 720 = 0 \Rightarrow x = 20$.

Now we need to check which of these two values gives the minimum value for the function. We can do this by checking the second derivative:

For $f(x)$: $f''(x) = 4 > 0$, so $x = -180$ is a minimum point.

For $g(x)$: $g''(x) = 36 > 0$, so $x = 20$ is a minimum point.

Now we substitute these values into the original functions to find the minimum values:

For $f(x)$: $f(-180) = 2*(-180)^2+720*(-180)+8000 = 64800-129600+8000 = -62800$.

For $g(x)$: $g(20) = 18*(20)^2-720*20+8000 = 7200-14400+8000 = 8000$.

Since $8000 > -62800$, the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ under the condition $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$ is $-62800$. However, this is not possible because the minimum value of a quadratic function is always non-negative. Therefore, we made a mistake in our calculations.

Let's re-examine our steps:

1. When we solved the condition $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$, we divided into two cases, but we didn't consider the case when $x < 2y$ and $y < 2x$. This case should be $x < 2y < 4x$, which implies $x < 2y$ and $y < 2x$. This leads to $y = 2x - \frac{40}{3}$.

2. Substituting this into the expression $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$, we get $5x^2+5(2x-\frac{40}{3})^2-8x(2x-\frac{40}{3})$.

3. Simplifying this expression, we get a single variable function $h(x) = 13x^2 - \frac{320}{3}x + \frac{6400}{9}$.

4. Taking the derivative and setting it to zero, we get $h'(x) = 26x - \frac{320}{3} = 0 \Rightarrow x = \frac{320}{78} = \frac{160}{39}$.

5. Substituting this into $h(x)$, we get $h(\frac{160}{39}) = 13*(\frac{160}{39})^2 - \frac{320}{3}*\frac{160}{39} + \frac{6400}{9} = \frac{6400}{9}$.

Therefore, the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ under the condition $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$ is $\frac{6400}{9}$.

The answer is: $\boxed{\frac{6400}{9}}$

Solve the following problem with a Python Script (positive numerical answer):

Approach:


We first notice that the equation $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$ is symmetric in $x$ and $y$. Therefore, we can assume that $x \geq y$. Then the equation simplifies to $3y - x = 40$, or $x = 3y - 40$. We substitute this into the expression $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ to get
\[5(3y - 40)^2 + 5y^2 - 8(3y - 40)y.\]
Expanding and simplifying, we get
\[90y^2 - 2400y + 6000 + 5y^2 - 24y^2 + 320y = 0,\]
which simplifies to
\[20y^2 - 2080y + 6000 = 0.\]
Dividing through by 20, we get
\[y^2 - 104y + 300 = 0.\]
Using the quadratic formula, we find that the roots of this equation are
\[y = \frac{104 \pm \sqrt{104^2 - 4 \cdot 300}}{2} = \frac{104 \pm \sqrt{10816 - 1200}}{2} = \frac{104 \pm \sqrt{9616}}{2} = \frac{104 \pm 98}{2}.\]
So the roots are $y = 101$ and $y = 2$.

Substituting $y = 101$ into the equation $x = 3y - 40$, we get $x = 283$. Substituting $y = 2$ into the equation $x = 3y - 40$, we get $x = -34$.

We substitute $x = 283$ and $y = 101$ into the expression $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ to get
\[5(283)^2 + 5(101)^2 - 8(283)(101) = 399640.\]
We substitute $x = -34$ and $y = 2$ into the expression $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ to get
\[5(-34)^2 + 5(2)^2 - 8(-34)(2) = -680.\]

Therefore, the minimum value of the expression $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ subject to the condition $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$ is $-680$. The answer is: $\boxed{-680}$.

Approach:


We can start by using the Cauchy-Schwarz inequality to find a lower bound for the expression $5x^2 + 5y^2 - 8xy$. Then, we can use the given condition $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$ to find a relationship between $x$ and $y$.

First, we know that $(a^2 + b^2)(c^2 + d^2) \geq (ac + bd)^2$ for all real numbers $a$, $b$, $c$, and $d$. So, applying this to our expression $5x^2 + 5y^2 - 8xy$, we have:
\[(5x^2 + 5y^2 - 8xy)^2 \geq ( \sqrt{5x^2} \cdot \sqrt{5y^2} - \sqrt{8xy} \cdot \sqrt{8xy} )^2 = (5xy - 8xy)^2 = ( - 3xy )^2 = 9x^2y^2.\]
So, $5x^2 + 5y^2 - 8xy \geq -3xy$.

Next, we use the given condition $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$. Without loss of generality, we can assume that $x \geq 2y$ (otherwise, we can simply replace $x$ with $2y$ and $y$ with $\frac{x}{2}$). Then, $|x-2y| = x-2y$ and $|y-2x| = 2x-y$. So, the condition becomes:
\[(x - 2y) + (2x - y) = 40 \implies 3x - 3y = 40 \implies x - y = \frac{40}{3}.\]
Substituting $y = x - \frac{40}{3}$ into $-3xy$, we get:
\[-3x \left( x - \frac{40}{3} \right) = -3x^2 + 40x = -3 \left( x^2 - \frac{40}{3} x \right) = -3 \left( x^2 - \frac{40}{3} x + \left( \frac{20}{3} \right)^2 - \left( \frac{20}{3} \right)^2 \right) = -3 \left( \left( x - \frac{20}{3} \right)^2 - \left( \frac{20}{3} \right)^2 \right) = -3 \left( x - \frac{20}{3} \right)^2 + 400/3.\]
So, $-3xy$ is minimized when $x = \frac{20}{3}$ and $y = \frac{4}{3}$, and the minimum value is $400/3$.

Therefore, the minimum value of $5x^2 + 5y^2 - 8xy$ is at least $\frac{400}{3}$. To show that this is achievable, we can simply set $x = \frac{20}{3}$ and $y = \frac{4}{3}$. Plugging these values into the expression $5x^2 + 5y^2 - 8xy$, we get:
\[5 \left( \frac{20}{3} \right)^2 + 5 \left( \frac{4}{3} \right)^2 - 8 \cdot \frac{20}{3} \cdot \frac{4}{3} = \frac{400}{3},\]
which confirms that the minimum value is indeed $\frac{400}{3}$.

Therefore, the minimum value of $5x^2 + 5y^2 - 8xy$ is $\frac{400}{3}$. The answer is: $\frac{400}{3}$

This problem involves finding the minimum value of a quadratic function $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ subject to the constraint $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$.

The first step is to express the constraint in a simpler form. We have $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$. By the absolute value property, we know that $|a| = |-a|$ for any real number $a$. So, we can rewrite the constraint as:

$|x-2y| + |-y+2x| = 40$.

Now, we can apply the property of absolute values that $|a+b| = |a| + |b|$ for any real numbers $a$ and $b$. This gives us:

$|x-2y| + |y-2x| = |x-2y| + |-(y-2x)| = |x-2y| + |2x-y| = 40$.

This simplifies the constraint to $|x-2y| + |2x-y| = 40$.

Next, we consider the function $f(x, y) = 5x^2+5y^2-8xy$. We can rewrite this function as:

$f(x, y) = (5x^2-8xy+5y^2) = (5x^2-10xy+5y^2) + (0-2xy) = (5(x-y)^2) - 2xy$.

To minimize this function, we want to maximize the term $-2xy$ subject to the constraint $|x-2y| + |2x-y| = 40$.

By the Cauchy-Schwarz inequality, we know that $(x^2+y^2)((1)^2+(2)^2) \ge (x*1 + y*2)^2$, which simplifies to $5(x^2+y^2) \ge 5(x-2y)^2 + 5(2x-y)^2$. This inequality tells us that $x^2+y^2 \ge (x-2y)^2 + (2x-y)^2$.

Now, consider the expression $(x-2y)^2 + (2x-y)^2$. By expanding this, we get $5x^2-8xy+5y^2$. This is exactly the same as the function $f(x, y) = 5x^2+5y^2-8xy$.

So, we can conclude that $f(x, y) \le x^2+y^2$. Therefore, to minimize $f(x, y)$, we need to minimize $x^2+y^2$ subject to the constraint $|x-2y| + |2x-y| = 40$.

The minimum value of $x^2+y^2$ subject to the constraint $|x-2y| + |2x-y| = 40$ is achieved when $x = y = 0$. This can be verified by substituting these values back into the constraint and checking that it holds true.

Finally, substituting $x=0$ and $y=0$ into the function $f(x, y)$, we get $f(0, 0) = 0$. So, the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ subject to the constraint $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$ is $0$.

The answer is: 0

Approach:


This problem is a bit tricky due to the absolute value function in the constraint. However, we can simplify the constraint equation by using the properties of absolute value and the fact that $x$ and $y$ are real numbers.

Let's start by considering the two cases for each absolute value term in the constraint equation:

1. For $|x-2y|$:
   - If $x-2y \geq 0$, then $|x-2y| = x-2y$.
   - If $x-2y < 0$, then $|x-2y| = -(x-2y) = 2y - x$.
2. For $|y-2x|$:
   - If $y-2x \geq 0$, then $|y-2x| = y-2x$.
   - If $y-2x < 0$, then $|y-2x| = -(y-2x) = 2x - y$.

Now we can rewrite the constraint equation $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$ based on these cases:

1. If $x-2y \geq 0$ and $y-2x \geq 0$, then the constraint equation becomes:
   $x - 2y + y - 2x = 40 \Rightarrow -y = 40$, which is not possible for real $y$.
2. If $x-2y < 0$ and $y-2x < 0$, then the constraint equation becomes:
   $2y - x + 2x - y = 40 \Rightarrow y = 40$, which is not possible for real $y$.
3. If $x-2y \geq 0$ and $y-2x < 0$, then the constraint equation becomes:
   $x - 2y + 2x - y = 40 \Rightarrow 3x - 3y = 40 \Rightarrow x - y = \frac{40}{3}$.
4. If $x-2y < 0$ and $y-2x \geq 0$, then the constraint equation becomes:
   $2y - x + y - 2x = 40 \Rightarrow 3y - 3x = 40 \Rightarrow y - x = \frac{40}{3}$.

From cases 3 and 4, we see that the constraint equation simplifies to $x - y = \frac{40}{3}$. We can solve for $y$ in terms of $x$ and substitute it into the expression we want to minimize:

$y = x - \frac{40}{3}$.

Now we substitute this into the expression we want to minimize:

$5x^2 + 5(x - \frac{40}{3})^2 - 8x(x - \frac{40}{3})$.

To find the minimum value, we can take the derivative with respect to $x$ and set it equal to 0:

$\frac{d}{dx}(5x^2 + 5(x - \frac{40}{3})^2 - 8x(x - \frac{40}{3})) = 0$.

Solving this equation for $x$ can be quite complicated. However, we can use the method of completing the square to simplify the expression and make it easier to solve.

After completing the square and simplifying, we find that the minimum value occurs at $x = 4$. Substituting $x = 4$ back into the equation for $y$ gives $y = 4 - \frac{40}{3} = -\frac{4}{3}$.

Now we substitute $x = 4$ and $y = -\frac{4}{3}$ into the expression we want to minimize:

$5(4)^2 + 5(-\frac{4}{3})^2 - 8(4)(-\frac{4}{3}) = 80 + \frac{64}{9} + \frac{128}{3} = \frac{80 \cdot 9 + 64 + 384}{9} = \frac{896}{9}$.

Therefore, the minimum value of the expression $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ under the constraint $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$ is $\frac{896}{9}$. The answer is: $\frac{896}{9}$

Approach:

 To find the minimum value of the expression $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ under the condition $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$, we can use the fact that the square of the Euclidean distance between two points in the plane is $d^2 = (x-2y)^2 + (y-2x)^2 = (x-2y)^2 + (2x-y)^2 = |x-2y|^2 + |y-2x|^2$.
Setting this equal to $40^2 = 1600$, we have
\[(x-2y)^2 + (2x-y)^2 = 1600.\]
Expanding the left-hand side gives
\[x^2 - 4xy + 4y^2 + 4x^2 - 4xy + y^2 = 1600,\]
which simplifies to
\[5x^2 + 5y^2 - 8xy = 1600.\]

So the value of the expression $5x^2 + 5y^2 - 8xy$ under the given condition is always 1600. Therefore, the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ is 1600.
The answer is: $1600$

To find the minimum value of the expression $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ given the condition $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$,
we can first use the condition to simplify the expression.

Solution:
By the Triangle Inequality, we have
\[|x - 2y| + |y - 2x| \ge |(x - 2y) - (y - 2x)| = |x - 2y - y + 2x| = |3x - 3y| = 3|x - y|.\]
So we have $3|x - y| = 40$, which implies $|x - y| = \frac{40}{3}$.
Now, consider the expression $5x^2 + 5y^2 - 8xy$. We can rewrite it as
\[5(x^2 + y^2) - 8xy = 5[(x - y)^2 + 2xy] - 8xy = 5(x - y)^2 + 3xy.\]
By substituting $|x - y| = \frac{40}{3}$, we have
\[5\left(\frac{40}{3}\right)^2 + 3xy.\]
To minimize this expression, we want to minimize $xy$. By the AM-GM inequality, we have
\[xy \ge \frac{(x - y)^2}{4} = \frac{1600}{9 \cdot 4} = \frac{400}{9},\]
with equality when $x = 2y$ or $y = 2x$.
So the minimum value of $5x^2 + 5y^2 - 8xy$ is
\[5\left(\frac{40}{3}\right)^2 + 3\cdot \frac{400}{9} = \frac{8000}{9} + \frac{1200}{9} = \frac{9200}{9}.\]
Therefore, the minimum value of $5x^2 + 5y^2 - 8xy$ is $\frac{9200}{9}$. The answer is: $\frac{9200}{9}$

Approach:



The expression $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ can be rewritten as $5(x^2 + y^2 - \frac{8}{5}xy) = 5[(x - \frac{4}{5}y)^2 + (\frac{3}{5}y)^2]$. This is obviously always non-negative.

On the other hand, the equation $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$ can be rewritten as $|2y-x| + |2x-y| = 40$. By the triangle inequality, $|a| + |b| \geq |a+b|$, so we have $|2y-x| + |2x-y| \geq |(2y-x) + (2x-y)| = |y| = |2x-y|$. Thus, we have $|y| = 40$. So, $y = \pm 20$.

When $y = 20$, we have $|x-40| + |40-2x| = 40$. By the triangle inequality, we have $|x-40| + |40-2x| \geq |(x-40) + (40-2x)| = |x-20|$. Thus, we have $|x-20| = 40$, so $x = 60$ or $x = -20$.

When $y = -20$, we have $|x+40| + |-40-2x| = 40$. Similarly, we have $|x+40| + |-40-2x| \geq |(x+40) + (-40-2x)| = |-x-20|$, so we have $|-x-20| = 40$, so $x = 20$ or $x = -60$.

Thus, we have four pairs of $(x, y)$: $(60, 20)$, $(-20, 20)$, $(20, -20)$, and $(-60, -20)$. We can plug these into the expression $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ to find the minimum value.

After calculating, we find that the minimum value is achieved at $(x, y) = (20, -20)$ or $(x, y) = (-20, 20)$, and the minimum value is $0$. So, the minimum value of the expression $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ under the condition $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$ is 0.

```python


INTERMEDIATE OUT :

def min_value():
    # Calculate the value of the expression for each pair of (x, y)
    values = [(60, 20), (-20, 20), (20, -20), (-60, -20)]
    min_val = float('inf')
    for x, y in values:
        val = 5*x**2 + 5*y**2 - 8*x*y
        if val < min_val:
            min_val = val
    return min_val

result = min_value()
print(result)
```

This seems incorrect. Let's check our calculations:

For $(x, y) = (60, 20)$, we have $5x^2+5y^2-8xy = 5(60)^2 + 5(20)^2 - 8(60)(20) = 7200$.
For $(x, y) = (-20, 20)$, we have $5x^2+5y^2-8xy = 5(-20)^2 + 5(20)^2 - 8(-20)(20) = 7200$.
For $(x, y) = (20, -20)$, we have $5x^2+5y^2-8xy = 5(20)^2 + 5(-20)^2 - 8(20)(-20) = 0$.
For $(x, y) = (-60, -20)$, we have $5x^2+5y^2-8xy = 5(-60)^2 + 5(-20)^2 - 8(-60)(-20) = 7200$.

The minimum value is indeed achieved at $(x, y) = (20, -20)$ or $(x, y) = (-20, 20)$, and the minimum value is 0. Therefore, the minimum value of the expression $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ under the condition $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$ is 0.

Therefore, the answer is $\boxed{0}$.
