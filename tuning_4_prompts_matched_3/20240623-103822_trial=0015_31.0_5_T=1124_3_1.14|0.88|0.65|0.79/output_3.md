Approach:

 The equation $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ equals zero if either of the two factors equals zero. This means that either $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$.
For the first factor to be zero, both $\vert x + y \vert - 10 = 0$ and $\vert x - y \vert - 10 = 0$, which implies $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$.
This gives us four lines: $x + y = 10$, $x + y = -10$, $x - y = 10$, and $x - y = -10$. These lines form a square with side length 10.
For the second factor to be zero, both $\vert x \vert - 8 = 0$ and $\vert y \vert - 8 = 0$, which implies $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$.
This gives us four lines: $x = 8$, $x = -8$, $y = 8$, and $y = -8$. These lines form a square with side length 16.
The convex polygon formed by the intersection of these two squares is a smaller square with side length 10.
Therefore, the area of the convex polygon is $10^2 = 100$. The answer is: $100$.

The given equation is a product of two expressions, set equal to zero. This means that either the first expression is zero or the second expression is zero. Let's analyze each case:

1. $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ implies that $\vert x + y \vert = 10$. This gives us two lines: $x + y = 10$ and $x + y = -10$.
2. $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ implies that $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. This gives us two more lines: $x - y = 10$ and $x - y = -10$.
3. $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ implies that $\vert x \vert = 8$. This gives us two lines: $x = 8$ and $x = -8$.
4. $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ implies that $\vert y \vert = 8$. This gives us two more lines: $y = 8$ and $y = -8$.

These lines enclose a rectangle with vertices at $(8, 8), (8, -8), (-8, 8),$ and $(-8, -8)$. The length of the rectangle is $16$ and the width is $16$, so its area is $16 \times 16 = 256$.

Therefore, the area of the convex polygon is $256$. The answer is: $256$

The product of two numbers is zero if and only if at least one of the numbers is zero. This gives us two cases to consider:

Case 1: $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$.

This implies that both $\vert x + y \vert - 10 = 0$ and $\vert x - y \vert - 10 = 0$, which means $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$.

This gives us the following system of equations:

- $x + y = \pm 10$
- $x - y = \pm 10$

Solving this system, we find that the points $(x, y)$ that satisfy this case are $(5, 5)$, $(-5, -5)$, $(5, -5)$, and $(-5, 5)$.

Case 2: $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$.

This implies that both $\vert x \vert - 8 = 0$ and $\vert y \vert - 8 = 0$, which means $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$.

This gives us the following system of equations:

- $x = \pm 8$
- $y = \pm 8$

Solving this system, we find that the points $(x, y)$ that satisfy this case are $(8, 8)$, $(-8, -8)$, $(8, -8)$, and $(-8, 8)$.

Combining the solutions from both cases, we see that the points $(x, y)$ that satisfy the given equation are $(5, 5)$, $(-5, -5)$, $(5, -5)$, $(-5, 5)$, $(8, 8)$, $(-8, -8)$, $(8, -8)$, and $(-8, 8)$. These points form a square with side length $10$, and thus the area of the square is $10^2 = 100$.
The answer is: $100$

Solve the following problem with a Python Script (positive numerical answer):
"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"

Approach:



The equation $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ is satisfied if either of the factors is zero. 

For the first factor to be zero, we need $\vert x + y \vert - 10 = 0$ and $\vert x - y \vert - 10 = 0$. Solving these equations gives us $x = \pm 10, y = \pm 10$. 

For the second factor to be zero, we need $\vert x \vert - 8 = 0$ and $\vert y \vert - 8 = 0$. Solving these equations gives us $x = \pm 8, y = \pm 8$. 

The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying either of these conditions form a square with side length 20. The area of this square is $20^2 = 400$. 

So the area of the convex polygon enclosed by the points $\left(x, y\right)$ is 400.
The answer is: $400$

Approach:

 The equation is a product of two expressions being equal to zero. Hence, either the first expression should be zero or the second one. We will consider each case separately.

Case 1: $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$
For the sum of squares to be zero, each square should be zero. Hence, we have:
$\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$
This means that the points must lie on the lines $x + y = 10$ and $x - y = 10$ or their reflections across the x and y axes. These lines form a square with side length 10âˆš2. The area of this square is $(10\sqrt{2})^2 = 200$.

Case 2: $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$
Similar to the first case, the sum of squares being zero means each square should be zero. Hence, we have:
$\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$
This means that the points must lie on the lines $x = 8$ and $y = 8$ or their reflections across the x and y axes. These lines form a square with side length 16. The area of this square is $16^2 = 256$.

However, the intersection of the two cases is the trivial solution $(0,0)$, which does not satisfy the original equation. Therefore, the convex polygon formed by the intersection of the points from both cases is the area of the square formed by the lines $x + y = 10$, $x - y = 10$, $x = 8$, and $y = 8$ minus the area of the unit square formed by their intersection (the trivial solution).

The intersection of the lines $x + y = 10$ and $x = 8$ gives $y = 2$. The intersection of the lines $x - y = 10$ and $y = 8$ gives $x = 18$. So, the intersection of the lines is at the point $(8,2)$.

The side length of the outer square is $10\sqrt{2}$, and the side length of the inner square is 8. Therefore, the area of the convex polygon is the area of the outer square minus the area of the inner square, which is $200 - 64 = 136$.
The answer is: $136$

Approach:


The equation $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ is equal to zero if and only if either the first term or the second term is equal to zero.
This means that either $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$.
If $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$, then both $\vert x + y \vert - 10 = 0$ and $\vert x - y \vert - 10 = 0$, which implies $x + y = \pm 10$ and $x - y = \pm 10$.
Solving these equations, we find that the points $\left(x, y\right)$ that satisfy this condition are $(0, 10)$, $(10, 0)$, $(-10, 0)$, and $(0, -10)$.
If $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$, then both $\vert x \vert - 8 = 0$ and $\vert y \vert - 8 = 0$, which implies $x = \pm 8$ and $y = \pm 8$.
Solving these equations, we find that the points $\left(x, y\right)$ that satisfy this condition are $(8, 8)$, $(8, -8)$, $(-8, 8)$, and $(-8, -8)$.
The points $\left(x, y\right)$ that satisfy the given equation are the vertices of a square with side length 16.
To find the area of this square, we use the formula $A = s^2$, where $s$ is the side length of the square. In this case, $s = 16$, so the area $A = 16^2 = 256$. The answer is: $256$

Solve the following problem with a Python Script (positive numerical answer):
"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"

Approach:


The equation given in the problem, $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$, is equivalent to the product of two equations being equal to zero. This means that either the first equation is zero or the second equation is zero.

For the first equation, $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$, this equation will be zero if and only if $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. Solving these equations gives us the vertices of the square, which is the convex polygon.

For the second equation, $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$, this equation will be zero if and only if $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$. This gives us the vertices of the square that is centered at the origin and has side length 16.

The convex polygon is the intersection of these two squares. It is a square with side length 10 (since it is contained inside the larger square with side length 16 and is centered at the origin).

The area of a square with side length $s$ is $s^2$. Therefore, the area of the convex polygon is $10^2 = 100$.

```python


INTERMEDIATE OUT :

def area_of_polygon():
    side_length = 10
    area = side_length ** 2
    return area

result = area_of_polygon()
print(result)
```

CODE RESULTS 100

INTERMEDIATE OUT :
```output
100
```
The area of the convex polygon is $100$. The answer is: $100$
