Interesting, let's analyze step by step:



The equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has 4 distinct solutions. This means that the right side of the equation, $\frac{m}{100}$, must be equal to 2.

So, we have $\frac{m}{100}=2$, which gives us $m=200$.

Now, we need to check if $m=200$ is a positive integer. It is, so the number of positive integers $m$ that satisfy the equation is 1.

Therefore, the number of positive integers $m$ for which the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has 4 distinct solutions is 1.
The answer is: $1$

Interesting, let's analyze step by step:



The equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has 4 distinct solutions. This means that the right-hand side $\frac{m}{100}$ must be equal to 2.

So, we have $\frac{m}{100}=2$, which implies $m=200$.

Therefore, there is only one positive integer $m$ that makes the equation have 4 distinct solutions, and that is $m=200$.

However, this doesn't seem to be the answer we're looking for. Let's try a different approach.

We know that the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has 4 distinct solutions. The expression $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert$ represents a "V" shape on the graph, with the "bottom" of the "V" at $\frac{m}{100}$. The height of the "V" is 4, and the width is 4. This means that the "bottom" of the "V" must be at a point where the "V" intersects the x-axis twice.

The "V" intersects the x-axis when $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=0$, which simplifies to $\vert x-1 \vert =2$. This gives us two equations: $x-1=2$ and $x-1=-2$. Solving these gives us $x=3$ and $x=-1$. So the "V" intersects the x-axis at $x=-1$ and $x=3$.

The width of the "V" is the distance between these two points, which is $3-(-1)=4$. So the width of the "V" is 4.

Since the height of the "V" is 4, the "bottom" of the "V" must be at a point where the height is equal to the width divided by 2. This means that the "bottom" of the "V" must be at a height of 2.

So we have $\frac{m}{100}=2$, which implies $m=200$.

Therefore, there is only one positive integer $m$ that makes the equation have 4 distinct solutions, and that is $m=200$.

The equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has 4 distinct solutions. This means that the right side of the equation, $\frac{m}{100}$, must be equal to 2.

So, we have $\frac{m}{100} = 2$, which gives $m = 200$.

Now, we need to verify that $m = 200$ is indeed a positive integer. Since $m$ is a positive integer, we can conclude that $m = 200$ is indeed a positive integer.

Therefore, the number of positive integers $m$ for which the equation has 4 distinct solutions is 1. The answer is: $1$

Interesting, let's analyze step by step:



The equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has 4 distinct solutions. We want to find out for how many positive integers $m$ this is true.

Step 1: Set up the equation
We can rewrite the equation as $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$.

Step 2: Analyze the equation
The equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has 4 distinct solutions. This means that the right side of the equation, $\frac{m}{100}$, must be equal to 2.

Step 3: Solve for $m$
If $\frac{m}{100}=2$, then $m=200$.

Step 4: Check if $m$ is a positive integer
The value we found for $m$ is 200, which is a positive integer.

So, the number of positive integers $m$ for which the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has 4 distinct solutions is 1.

The answer is: $1$

Interesting, let's analyze step by step:



The equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has 4 distinct solutions. This means that the right side of the equation, $\frac{m}{100}$, must be equal to 2. This is because the absolute value function $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert$ can only equal 2 for 4 distinct solutions. So we have $\frac{m}{100}=2$, which gives $m=200$.

Now, we need to check if $m=200$ is a positive integer. It is, so $m=200$ is the only value that satisfies the condition. Therefore, the number of positive integers $m$ for which the equation has 4 distinct solutions is 1.
The answer is: $1$
