Interesting, let's analyze step by step:



The equation is given as:
$$((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$$

This equation is equal to zero if either of the two terms is equal to zero. Therefore, we have two sets of equations:

1. $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ and $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$
2. $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ and $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$

For the first set of equations:
1. From $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$, we have $\vert x + y \vert = 10$. This implies $x + y = 10$ or $x + y = -10$.
2. From $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$, we have $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$, which implies $x = 8$ or $x = -8$, and $y = 8$ or $y = -8$.

For the second set of equations:
1. From $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$, we have $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. This implies $x - y = 10$ or $x - y = -10$.
2. From $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$, we have $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$, which implies $x = 8$ or $x = -8$, and $y = 8$ or $y = -8$.

By analyzing the possible combinations of the equations from the first and second sets, we find that the points that satisfy the equation are:

$(8,8)$, $(8,-8)$, $(-8,8)$, and $(-8,-8)$.

These points form a square with side length 16. The area of this square is $16^2 = 256$.

So, the area of the convex polygon is 256. The answer is: $256$

Interesting, let's analyze step by step:



The equation is $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$.

This equation equals to zero if and only if both terms equal to zero. So we have two cases:

1. $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ and $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$.
2. $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ and $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$.

For the first case, we have $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x \vert = 8$, $\vert y \vert = 8$. This gives us a square with side length 16.

For the second case, we have $\vert x - y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x \vert = 8$, $\vert y \vert = 8$. This also gives us a square with side length 16.

Therefore, the points satisfying the equation form two squares with side length 16. The area of the convex polygon is the sum of the areas of these two squares.

The area of a square is given by side length squared. So the area of each square is $16^2 = 256$. Since there are two squares, the total area of the convex polygon is $2 * 256 = 512$.

So the area of the convex polygon is 512. Since we are asked for a positive integer, the answer is $\boxed{512}$.
The answer is: $512$

Interesting, let's analyze step by step:



The equation is $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + (\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + (\vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$.

For the product of two numbers to be zero, either one of the numbers must be zero. So, we have two cases:

1. $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ and $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + (\vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$.
2. $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ and $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + (\vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$.

From the first case, we have $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x \vert = 8$, $\vert y \vert = 8$. This gives us the rectangle with vertices at $(8, 8)$, $(8, -8)$, $(-8, 8)$, and $(-8, -8)$.

From the second case, we have $\vert x - y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x \vert = 8$, $\vert y \vert = 8$. This gives us the rectangle with vertices at $(8, -8)$, $(-8, 8)$, $(-8, -8)$, and $(8, 8)$.

These two rectangles are actually the same, so the area of the convex polygon is the area of one of the rectangles. The length of the rectangle is $16$ (from $8$ to $-8$) and the width is $16$ (from $8$ to $-8$), so the area is $16 \times 16 = 256$.

Therefore, the area of the convex polygon is $256$. The answer is: $256$

Interesting, let's analyze step by step:



The equation is $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + (\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + (\vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$.

This equation equals to zero if and only if both $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ and $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ and $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ and $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$.

This implies $\vert x + y \vert = 10$, $\vert x - y \vert = 10$, $\vert x \vert = 8$, and $\vert y \vert = 8$.

Solving these equations, we get the following four lines:

1. $x + y = 10$, $x + y = -10$, $x - y = 10$, and $x - y = -10$.
2. $x = 8$, $x = -8$, $y = 8$, and $y = -8$.

These lines form a square with side length 10. The area of this square is $10^2 = 100$.

Therefore, the area of the convex polygon is 100. The answer is: $100$

Interesting, let's analyze step by step:



The equation is given as:
\[((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0\]

This equation is equal to zero if either of the two factors is equal to zero. This gives us two sets of equations to solve:

1. $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ and $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$
2. $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ and $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$

For the first set of equations, we have:
$\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$
This gives us the vertices of the square: $(8, 0), (0, 8), (-8, 0), (0, -8)$

For the second set of equations, we have:
$\vert x - y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$
This gives us the vertices of the square: $(0, 8), (8, 0), (0, -8), (-8, 0)$

The vertices of the polygon are the same in both cases, so the polygon is a square. The side length of the square is 16 (since the distance from $(8, 0)$ to $(0, 8)$ is 16), so the area of the square is $16^2 = 256$.

Therefore, the area of the convex polygon is 256. The answer is: $256$

Interesting, let's analyze step by step:



The expression is equal to zero if either of the two factors is zero. This gives us two systems of equations to solve:

1. $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ and $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ and $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$.
2. $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ and $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ and $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$.

From the first system, we get $\vert x + y \vert = 10$, $\vert x \vert = 8$, and $\vert y \vert = 8$. This implies $-8 \leq x, y \leq 8$.

From the second system, we get $\vert x - y \vert = 10$, $\vert x \vert = 8$, and $\vert y \vert = 8$. This implies that the points must lie on the lines $x = y + 10$ or $x = -y + 10$.

The intersection of these conditions gives us a square with side length 8. The area of this square is $8^2 = 64$.

So the area of the convex polygon is 64. The answer is: $64$

Interesting, let's analyze step by step:



The equation given is a product of two terms equal to zero. This means that either the first term is zero or the second term is zero. So, we have two cases to consider:

1. $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ and $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$
2. $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ and $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$

For the first case, we have $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. This implies that $x + y = \pm 10$ and $x - y = \pm 10$. Solving these equations, we get the vertices of the polygon as $(0, 10), (0, -10), (10, 0), (-10, 0)$.

For the second case, we have $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$. This implies that $x = \pm 8$ and $y = \pm 8$. Solving these equations, we get the vertices of the polygon as $(8, 8), (8, -8), (-8, 8), (-8, -8)$.

Now, we can plot these points on a graph and observe that the polygon is a square with side length 10. The area of a square is given by the square of its side length, so the area of the polygon is $10^2 = 100$.

The answer is: $100$

Interesting, let's analyze step by step:



The equation is given as:
$$((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$$

This equation is satisfied if either of the two factors is zero. That is:

1. $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$
2. $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$

From these, we can deduce that the points that satisfy the equation are those where:

1. $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ or $\vert x - y \vert = 10$
2. $\vert x \vert = 8$ or $\vert y \vert = 8$

These points form a square with side length 16 (since $\vert x \vert = 8$ implies $-8 \leq x \leq 8$, and similarly for $y$). The area of this square is $16^2 = 256$.

So, the area of the convex polygon is 256.

The answer is: $256$
