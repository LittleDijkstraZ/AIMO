Below is a math problem you are to solve (positive numerical answer!):
"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"
Analyze this problem and think step by step to come to a solution with programs. After solving the problem, output the final numerical answer within \boxed{}.

Assistant:

 We first have to realize that the product of two numbers is zero if and only if at least one of the numbers is zero. So we can consider two cases: 
1) $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ or 
2) $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$.
The first equation implies that $|x+y| = |x-y| = 10$, and the only solution to this system of equations is $x=y=0$.
The second equation implies that $|x|=|y|=8$, and the solution are the points in a square with side length $16$.
Therefore, the points that satisfy the original equation are the vertices of a square with side length $16$. Its area is $16^2 = 256$. So the answer is: $256$.

    side_length = 16
    area = side_length ** 2
    return area

256
```
The area of the convex polygon is $256$ square units.
The answer is $\boxed{256}$.

Below is a math problem you are to solve (positive numerical answer!):
"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"

Assistant:

 The equation is given as:
\[((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0\]
This equation is true if and only if either of the following conditions hold:
\[\vert x + y \vert - 10 = 0, \vert x - y \vert - 10 = 0, \vert x \vert - 8 = 0, \text{or } \vert y \vert - 8 = 0.\]
The solutions to each of these conditions are:
\[x + y = \pm 10, x - y = \pm 10, x = \pm 8, \text{or } y = \pm 8.\]
These eight lines form a square with side length 16, so the area of the convex polygon is $16^2 = 256$. The answer is: $\boxed{256}$.

 First, we note that the product of two numbers is zero if and only if one of the numbers is zero. This means that we have two separate cases to consider in this problem:

1. $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$, which implies $\vert x + y \vert = 10$. This gives us two lines: $x + y = 10$ and $x + y = -10$.
2. $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$, which implies $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. This gives us two more lines: $x - y = 10$ and $x - y = -10$.
3. $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$, which implies $\vert x \vert = 8$. This gives us two vertical lines: $x = 8$ and $x = -8$.
4. $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$, which implies $\vert y \vert = 8$. This gives us two horizontal lines: $y = 8$ and $y = -8$.

These lines together form a rectangle with opposite corners at $(8, 8)$ and $(-8, -8)$, and sides parallel to the axes. The length and width of the rectangle are both 16, so the area of the rectangle is $16 \times 16 = 256$. The answer is: $256$
