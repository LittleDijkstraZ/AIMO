Interesting, let's analyze step by step:



1. First, we can rewrite the given equation as follows:
\[((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0\]
The product of two terms is zero if and only if one or both of the terms are zero. Hence, we have two cases to consider:

Case 1: $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$
Case 2: $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$

Case 1 implies that $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. This forms a square with side length 20, so its area is $20^2 = 400$.

Case 2 implies that $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$. This forms a square with side length 16, so its area is $16^2 = 256$.

2. Adding the areas of these two squares, we get the total area of the convex polygon: $400 + 256 = 656$.

3. Therefore, the area of the convex polygon is 656.

Now let's confirm that the answer is a positive integer:

656 is indeed a positive integer, so we have solved the problem correctly. The answer is: $\boxed{656}$.

Interesting, let's analyze step by step:



Given the equation: $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$

The product of two factors is zero if and only if at least one of the factors is zero. So, we have two separate cases:

Case 1: $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$
Case 2: $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$

For Case 1, both $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2$ and $( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2$ must be zero, which means $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. This results in a square with side length 10 units.

For Case 2, both $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2$ and $( \vert y \vert - 8)^2$ must be zero, which means $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$. This results in a square with side length 16 units.

Now we need to find the intersection of these two squares. The intersection forms a smaller square, which is the solution to the equation.

The side length of the smaller square is the difference in the side lengths of the larger squares, which is $16 - 10 = 6$ units. Therefore, the area of the convex polygon is $6^2 = 36$ square units.
The answer is: $36$

Interesting, let's analyze step by step:



1. The expression $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ can be true if either of the following conditions is met:
   a. $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$
   b. $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$
   
   From condition a, we have $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. This means that the points $(x, y)$ lie on the square with side length $20$ centered at the origin.
   
   From condition b, we have $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$. This means that the points $(x, y)$ lie on the square with side length $16$ centered at the origin.
   
   The intersection of these two squares is a smaller square with side length $20 - 8 = 12$ centered at the origin.

2. To find the area of the smaller square, we simply square the side length: $Area = (12)^2 = 144$.

So, the area of the convex polygon is $144$. This is a positive integer as required.

The answer is: $144$

Interesting, let's analyze step by step:



If a product of two numbers is zero, one (or both) of the numbers must be zero. So either $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$.

This implies that either $\vert x + y \vert = 10$, $\vert x - y \vert = 10$, $\vert x \vert = 8$, or $\vert y \vert = 8$.

The absolute value equation $\vert x \vert = 8$ implies $x = 8$ or $x = -8$, and the equation $\vert y \vert = 8$ implies $y = 8$ or $y = -8$.

The equation $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ implies $x + y = 10$ or $x + y = -10$, and the equation $\vert x - y \vert = 10$ implies $x - y = 10$ or $x - y = -10$.

Solving these equations gives us the coordinates of the vertices of the polygon: $(8,8)$, $(8,-8)$, $(-8,8)$, and $(-8,-8)$.

The polygon is a square with side length 16. To find its area, simply square the length of one of its sides: $16^2 = 256$. So the area of the square is 256.
The answer is: 256

Interesting, let's analyze step by step:



The expression $f(x,y) = ((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2)$ is equal to 0 if and only if both its factors are equal to 0. This gives us the following system of equations:

1. $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$
2. $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$
3. $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$
4. $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$

Each of these equations has only two solutions:

1. $\vert x + y \vert = 10 \Rightarrow x + y = \pm 10$
2. $\vert x - y \vert = 10 \Rightarrow x - y = \pm 10$
3. $\vert x \vert = 8 \Rightarrow x = \pm 8$
4. $\vert y \vert = 8 \Rightarrow y = \pm 8$

The solutions to these equations form a square with side length $16$ (the points $(\pm 8, \pm 8)$), and two adjacent squares shifted by $10$ units along the $x$ and $y$ axis (the points $(\pm 8, \pm 8 \pm 10)$). The total area of this shape is $4 \times 16^2 = 1024$.

    x, y = symbols('x y')

    # The side length of the square is 16 (from |x|=8 and |y|=8),

Interesting, let's analyze step by step:



We have two expressions that must be simultaneously zero:

1. $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)$
2. $((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2)$

The first expression is zero if both $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. This means that both x and y must be in the range of -10 to 10.

The second expression is zero if both $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$. This means that both x and y must be in the range of -8 to 8.

Combining these two conditions, we find that the points (x, y) must satisfy both -10 ≤ x ≤ 10 and -8 ≤ x ≤ 8, and -10 ≤ y ≤ 10 and -8 ≤ y ≤ 8. This defines a square with side length 16.

To find the area of this square, we simply calculate $16 \times 16 = 256$.

So the area of the convex polygon is 256 square units. The answer is: $256$

If the product of two numbers is zero, then at least one of the numbers must be zero. Thus, either 
$$((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2) = 0$$ or $$((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0.$$

If $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2) = 0$, then $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. This means that the distance between $(x, y)$ and $(-x, -y)$ is 20. In other words, $(x, y)$ must be on the line $y = -x$.

If $((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$, then $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$. This means that $(x, y)$ must be on the circle with center at the origin and radius 8.

The intersection of these two sets of points is a square with side length 16 and area $16^2 = 256$. So the area of the convex polygon is 256.

The answer is: $256$.

Assistant:

Interesting, let's analyze step by step:



The equation is $0$ if and only if both terms are zero, i.e.,
\[(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0,\]
\[(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0,\]
\[(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0,\]
\[(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0.\]

These equations imply that $|x + y| = 10$, $|x - y| = 10$, $|x| = 8$, and $|y| = 8$.

For $|x + y| = 10$ and $|x - y| = 10$, the solutions are given by the four points $(8, 2)$, $(8, -2)$, $(-8, 2)$, and $(-8, -2)$.

For $|x| = 8$ and $|y| = 8$, the solutions are given by the four points $(8, 8)$, $(8, -8)$, $(-8, 8)$, and $(-8, -8)$.

The eight points $(8, 2)$, $(8, -2)$, $(-8, 2)$, $(-8, -2)$, $(8, 8)$, $(8, -8)$, $(-8, 8)$, and $(-8, -8)$ form a square with side length $10$. The area of this square is $10^2 = 100$.

Therefore, the area of the convex polygon is $100$.

Assistant:

Interesting, let's analyze step by step:



We have the equation $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$. The only way this equation equals zero is when either one of the terms equals zero. Therefore, we have two sets of equations to solve:

1. $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0 \Rightarrow \vert x + y \vert = 10$
2. $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0 \Rightarrow \vert x \vert = 8$

And:

1. $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0 \Rightarrow \vert x - y \vert = 10$
2. $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0 \Rightarrow \vert y \vert = 8$

Solving these equations gives us the vertices of the polygon:

For the first set of equations, we have $x + y = \pm 10$ and $x = \pm 8$. The possible combinations of these give us the vertices $(8,2)$, $(8,-2)$, $(-8,2)$, and $(-8,-2)$.

For the second set of equations, we have $x - y = \pm 10$ and $y = \pm 8$. The possible combinations of these give us the vertices $(2,8)$, $(-2,8)$, $(2,-8)$, and $(-2,-8)$.

Now we can plot these points to visualize the polygon. The polygon is a square with side length 10. To find the area, we can use the formula for the area of a square, which is $side^2$. So the area is $10^2 = 100$.

Since we are asked for a positive numerical answer, the area of the convex polygon is 100. The answer is: $100$.

Interesting, let's analyze step by step:



The given equation is $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$. This equation is true if and only if at least one of the two factors is zero. This means that either $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$.

1. If $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$, then $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. This implies that $x + y = \pm 10$ and $x - y = \pm 10$, which gives four lines: $x + y = 10$, $x + y = -10$, $x - y = 10$, and $x - y = -10$. These lines form a square with side length 10 and area $10^2 = 100$.

2. If $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$, then $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$. This implies that $x = \pm 8$ and $y = \pm 8$, which gives four lines: $x = 8$, $x = -8$, $y = 8$, and $y = -8$. These lines form a square with side length 16 and area $16^2 = 256$.

Since the first case gives a smaller area, the area of the convex polygon is 100.

Now let's confirm that this is a positive integer:

```python


INTERMEDIATE OUT :

from sympy import symbols, solve, Eq

def calculate_area():
    # Side length of the square
    side_length = 10

    # Area of the square
    area = side_length**2

    return area

result = calculate_area()
print(result)
```

CODE RESULTS 100

INTERMEDIATE OUT :
```output

The area of the convex polygon is 100, which is a positive integer. The answer is: $100$.
