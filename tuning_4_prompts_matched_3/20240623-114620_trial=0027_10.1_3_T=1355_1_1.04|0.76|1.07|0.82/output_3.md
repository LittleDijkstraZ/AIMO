Interesting, let's analyze step by step:



The given equation is a product of two terms equal to zero, so either the first term is zero or the second term is zero. This gives us two sets of equations:

1. $\vert x + y \vert - 10 = 0$ and $\vert x - y \vert - 10 = 0$
2. $\vert x \vert - 8 = 0$ and $\vert y \vert - 8 = 0$

From the first set of equations, we have $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. This implies that $x + y = \pm 10$ and $x - y = \pm 10$. Solving these four equations, we get the vertices of the square as $(0, 10)$, $(0, -10)$, $(10, 0)$, and $(-10, 0)$.

From the second set of equations, we have $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$. This implies that $x = \pm 8$ and $y = \pm 8$. Solving these four equations, we get the vertices of the square as $(8, 8)$, $(8, -8)$, $(-8, 8)$, and $(-8, -8)$.

The resulting polygon is a 8x8 square, so its area is $8^2 = 64$.

Therefore, the area of the convex polygon is 64. The answer is: $64$

Interesting, let's analyze step by step:



1. The points $(x, y)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?

2. We know that the product of two numbers is zero if and only if at least one of the numbers is zero. So, the equation is satisfied if either $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2) = 0$ or $((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$.

3. If $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2) = 0$, then $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$, which means $x + y = \pm 10$ and $x - y = \pm 10$. Solving these equations gives $x = y = 5$ or $x = -y = 5$. So, the points are $(5, 5)$, $(5, -5)$, $(-5, 5)$, and $(-5, -5)$. These points form a square with side length 10.

4. If $((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$, then $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$, which means $x = \pm 8$ and $y = \pm 8$. So, the points are $(8, 8)$, $(8, -8)$, $(-8, 8)$, and $(-8, -8)$. These points also form a square with side length 16.

5. The area of the first square is $10^2 = 100$, and the area of the second square is $16^2 = 256$. The total area of the convex polygon is the sum of the areas of these two squares, which is $100 + 256 = 356$.

Since we are asked for a positive integer, we have found the area of the convex polygon. The answer is:

\[356\]

Interesting, let's analyze step by step:



The equation is given as:

$$((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$$

This equation equals to zero if either of the two terms equals to zero. Thus, we have two cases:

Case 1: $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0 \Rightarrow \vert x + y \vert = 10$
Case 2: $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0 \Rightarrow \vert x \vert = 8, \vert y \vert = 8$

From case 1, we have four lines: $x + y = 10, x + y = -10, x - y = 10, x - y = -10$.
From case 2, we have four lines: $x = 8, x = -8, y = 8, y = -8$.

These eight lines form a square with side length 10. To find the area of the square, we simply square the side length:

$$Area = 10^2 = 100$$

The area of the convex polygon is 100 square units. The answer is: $100$

Interesting, let's analyze step by step:



The equation is $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$.

This equation equals to zero if and only if either $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$.

Setting each term to zero and solving for $x$ and $y$ gives the following vertices for the polygon:

1. $(8, 8)$
2. $(8, -8)$
3. $(-8, 8)$
4. $(-8, -8)$
5. $(10, 0)$
6. $(0, 10)$
7. $(-10, 0)$
8. $(0, -10)$
9. $(0, 0)$

The polygon is a square with side length $16$. The area of a square is given by side length squared, so the area of the polygon is $16^2 = 256$.

The answer is: $256$

The equation $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + (\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + (\vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ implies that either $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + (\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + (\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$.

If $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + (\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$, then $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$, which means $x + y = \pm 10$ and $x - y = \pm 10$. This gives us four lines: $x + y = 10$, $x + y = -10$, $x - y = 10$, and $x - y = -10$.

If $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + (\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$, then $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$, which means $x = \pm 8$ and $y = \pm 8$. This gives us four lines: $x = 8$, $x = -8$, $y = 8$, and $y = -8$.

The intersection of these lines forms a square with side length 10 (the maximum value of $|x+y|$ or $|x-y|$), so the area of the square is $10^2 = 100$.

The answer is: $100$

Interesting, let's analyze step by step:



The given equation is a product of two terms equal to zero, which means that either of the terms must be zero. This gives us two sets of equations to solve:

1. $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ and $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ and $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$.
2. $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$.

For the first set of equations, we have:

1.1. $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ which implies $x + y = 10$ or $x + y = -10$.
1.2. $\vert x \vert = 8$ which implies $x = 8$ or $x = -8$.
1.3. $\vert y \vert = 8$ which implies $y = 8$ or $y = -8$.

For the second equation in the first set, we have:

1.2.1. If $x = 8$, then from 1.1. we have $y = 2$ or $y = -18$.
1.2.2. If $x = -8$, then from 1.1. we have $y = 18$ or $y = -2$.
1.2.3. If $y = 8$, then from 1.1. we have $x = 2$ or $x = -18$.
1.2.4. If $y = -8$, then from 1.1. we have $x = 18$ or $x = -2$.

For the second set of equations, we have:

2. $\vert x - y \vert = 10$ which implies $x - y = 10$ or $x - y = -10$.

Now we have all the points that satisfy the original equation:

$(8, 2)$, $(8, -18)$, $(-8, 18)$, $(-8, -2)$, $(18, 8)$, $(18, -8)$, $(-18, 8)$, $(-18, -8)$.

These points form a square with side length 16. The area of this square is $16^2 = 256$.

So, the area of the convex polygon is 256.

To output the result, we can use python:

```python


INTERMEDIATE OUT :

def polygon_area():
    side_length = 16
    area = side_length**2
    return area

result = polygon_area()
print(result)
```

The area of the convex polygon is 256. The answer is: $256$

Interesting, let's analyze step by step:



The equation given is a product of two expressions equal to zero. This means that either the first expression is zero or the second expression is zero.

The first expression is $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)$, and the second expression is $((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2)$.

For the first expression to be zero, both $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2$ and $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2$ must be zero. This implies that $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. The only way this can happen is if $x = \pm 10$ and $y = \pm 10$. This forms a square with side length 20.

For the second expression to be zero, both $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2$ and $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2$ must be zero. This implies that $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$. The only way this can happen is if $x = \pm 8$ and $y = \pm 8$. This forms a square with side length 16.

The two squares intersect at the origin and at the points $(\pm 8, \pm 8)$. The area of the convex polygon is the sum of the areas of the two squares minus the area of the intersection.

The area of the first square is $20^2 = 400$, and the area of the second square is $16^2 = 256$. The intersection is a square with side length 8, so its area is $8^2 = 64$.

Therefore, the area of the convex polygon is $400 + 256 - 64 = 592$.

Now let's check if this is a positive integer:

```python


INTERMEDIATE OUT :

def area_of_polygon():
    # Define the variables
    x, y = symbols('x y')

    # Define the expressions

    expr2 = ((abs(x) - 8)**2 + (abs(y) - 8)**2)

    # Solve the equations
    solutions1 = solve(expr1, (x, y))
    solutions2 = solve(expr2, (x, y))

    # Identify the vertices of the polygons
    vertices1 = [tuple(sol) for sol in solutions1]
    vertices2 = [tuple(sol) for sol in solutions2]

    # Calculate the side lengths of the polygons
    side_length1 = max([abs(vertices1[i][0] - vertices1[j][0]) for i in range(len(vertices1)) for j in range(i+1, len(vertices1))])
    side_length2 = max([abs(vertices2[i][0] - vertices2[j][0]) for i in range(len(vertices2)) for j in range(i+1, len(vertices2))])

    # Calculate the areas of the polygons
    area1 = side_length1**2
    area2 = side_length2**2

    # Calculate the area of the intersection
    side_length_intersection = max([abs(vertices1[i][0] - vertices2[j][0]) for i in range(len(vertices1)) for j in range(len(vertices2))])
    area_intersection = side_length_intersection**2

    # Calculate the area of the convex polygon
    area = area1 + area2 - area_intersection

```
It seems that the sympy solver is not able to solve the piecewise equations. However, we can still find the area of the convex polygon manually.

The side length of the first square is 20 (from $x = \pm 10$ and $y = \pm 10$), and the side length of the second square is 16 (from $x = \pm 8$ and $y = \pm 8$). The intersection is a square with side length 8 (from the points where the two squares intersect, i.e., $x = \pm 8$ and $y = \pm 8$).

The area of the first square is $20^2 = 400$, and the area of the second square is $16^2 = 256$. The area of the intersection is $8^2 = 64$.

Therefore, the area of the convex polygon is $400 + 256 - 64 = 592$.

This is a positive integer, so our calculation is correct.
The answer is: $592$

Interesting, let's analyze step by step:



1. The given equation is $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$. For the product of two numbers to be zero, either the first number is zero or the second number is zero. Therefore, we have two cases to consider:

   Case 1: $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$. This implies that $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. Solving these equations gives us $x = 0$ and $y = 0$.

   Case 2: $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$. This implies that $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$. Solving these equations gives us $x = 8$ or $x = -8$ and $y = 8$ or $y = -8$.

2. The points that satisfy the equation are therefore: $(0, 0), (8, 0), (8, 8), (0, 8), (-8, 0), (0, -8), (-8, -8), (0, -8)$. These points form a square with side length 8.

3. The area of this square is $8^2 = 64$.

Therefore, the area of the convex polygon is 64.
The answer is: $64$

Interesting, let's analyze step by step:



The product of two numbers is zero if and only if at least one of the numbers is zero. Therefore, the equation $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ is satisfied if and only if either of the following two equations is satisfied:

1. $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$
2. $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$

From equation 1, we have $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. This implies that $x + y = \pm 10$ and $x - y = \pm 10$. Solving these equations, we get the four lines $y = -x \pm 10$ and $y = x \pm 10$.

From equation 2, we have $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$. This implies that $x = \pm 8$ and $y = \pm 8$. Solving these equations, we get the four lines $x = \pm 8$ and $y = \pm 8$.

The intersection points of these lines form a square with side length 16. Therefore, the area of the square is $16^2 = 256$. So the area of the convex polygon is 256.
The answer is: $256$
