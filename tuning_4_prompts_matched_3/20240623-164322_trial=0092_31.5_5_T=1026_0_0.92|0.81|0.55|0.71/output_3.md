 The given equation is equal to zero if and only if both of the factors are equal to zero. Therefore, we have the following four conditions:
1. $\vert x + y \vert - 10 = 0$ and $\vert x - y \vert - 10 = 0$.
2. $\vert x \vert - 8 = 0$ and $\vert y \vert - 8 = 0$.
From the first condition, we have $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. This implies that $x + y = \pm 10$ and $x - y = \pm 10$. Solving these equations, we get the vertices of the square as $(8, 2)$, $(8, -2)$, $(-8, -2)$, and $(-8, 2)$.
From the second condition, we have $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$. This implies that $x = \pm 8$ and $y = \pm 8$. Solving these equations, we get the vertices of the square as $(8, 8)$, $(8, -8)$, $(-8, -8)$, and $(-8, 8)$.
The intersection of these two squares is a smaller square with side length 6 (subtracting 2 from each side length of the larger square). Therefore, the area of the convex polygon is the area of the smaller square, which is $6^2 = 36$.

The Python code to compute the area of the convex polygon is as follows:
```python


INTERMEDIATE OUT :

def area_of_polygon():
    """The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"""
    side_length = 6
    area = side_length ** 2
    return area

result = area_of_polygon()
print(result)
```

CODE RESULTS 36

INTERMEDIATE OUT :
```output
36
```
The area of the convex polygon is $36$ square units. The answer is: $36$

 The given equation is a product of two terms equal to zero. This means that either the first term is zero or the second term is zero.

The first term is zero when $|x+y| - 10 = 0$ or $|x-y| - 10 = 0$. This implies that $|x+y| = 10$ or $|x-y| = 10$. The solutions to these equations are the lines $x+y = 10$, $x+y = -10$, $x-y = 10$, and $x-y = -10$.

The second term is zero when $|x| - 8 = 0$ or $|y| - 8 = 0$. This implies that $|x| = 8$ or $|y| = 8$. The solutions to these equations are the lines $x = 8$, $x = -8$, $y = 8$, and $y = -8$.

These lines form a rectangle with vertices at $(8,8)$, $(8,-8)$, $(-8,8)$, and $(-8,-8)$. The side lengths of the rectangle are $16$ and $16$, so its area is $16 \times 16 = 256$.
The answer is: $256$

The given equation is a product of two expressions equal to zero. This means that either the first expression is zero or the second expression is zero.

The first expression is $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)$, and it equals to zero if and only if both $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. This gives us a square with side length 20, so the area is $20^2 = 400$.

The second expression is $((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2)$, and it equals to zero if and only if both $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$. This gives us a square with side length 16, so the area is $16^2 = 256$.

However, the intersection of these two squares is another square with side length 8, so its area is $8^2 = 64$.

Therefore, the area of the convex polygon is the sum of the areas of the two squares minus the area of their intersection, which is $400 + 256 - 64 = 592$.

So the area of the convex polygon is 592. The answer is: $592$

The given equation is a product of two terms equal to zero. Therefore, either the first term is zero or the second term is zero.

The first term is zero when $\vert x + y \vert - 10 = 0$ or $\vert x - y \vert - 10 = 0$. This means $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ or $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. The solutions to these equations are all points in a square with side length 20 centered at the origin.

The second term is zero when $\vert x \vert - 8 = 0$ or $\vert y \vert - 8 = 0$. This means $\vert x \vert = 8$ or $\vert y \vert = 8$. The solutions to these equations are all points in a square with side length 16 centered at the origin.

The intersection of the solutions to the two sets of equations is the convex polygon that encloses the points satisfying the original equation. This is a square with side length 8 (the smaller of the two side lengths).

The area of this square is $8^2 = 64$.
The answer is: $64$

 The given equation is a product of two terms equal to zero, so either the first term is zero or the second term is zero. 

If the first term is zero, then either $|x+y| - 10 = 0$ or $|x-y| - 10 = 0$. This means $|x+y| = 10$ or $|x-y| = 10$. These are the equations of two lines passing through the origin.

If the second term is zero, then either $|x| - 8 = 0$ or $|y| - 8 = 0$. This means $|x| = 8$ or $|y| = 8$. These are the equations of two lines passing through the origin.

The four lines divide the plane into 9 regions. The convex polygon is the intersection of these regions, which is a square with side length 16. The area of this square is $16^2 = 256$.

So the area of the convex polygon is 256. The answer is: $256$

"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"

The given equation is $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$.
For this equation to be true, either $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$.
If $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$, then $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$, which implies $x + y = \pm 10$ and $x - y = \pm 10$. Solving these equations gives us four lines: $x + y = 10$, $x + y = -10$, $x - y = 10$, and $x - y = -10$. These lines form a square with side length 10.
If $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$, then $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$, which implies $x = \pm 8$ and $y = \pm 8$. These lines form a square with side length 16.
The intersection of these two squares is the convex polygon whose area we want to find. This intersection is a square with side length 10.
The area of a square is given by the formula $s^2$, where $s$ is the side length. So the area of the convex polygon is $10^2 = 100$.
The answer is: $100$.

 The given equation is equal to zero if and only if both of the factors are equal to zero. The factors are:
$$((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)$$
and
$$((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2)$$
The first factor equals zero if and only if both $\vert x + y \vert - 10 = 0$ and $\vert x - y \vert - 10 = 0$, which implies that $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. The solutions to these equations are the lines $x + y = \pm 10$ and $x - y = \pm 10$.
The second factor equals zero if and only if both $\vert x \vert - 8 = 0$ and $\vert y \vert - 8 = 0$, which implies that $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$. The solutions to these equations are the lines $x = \pm 8$ and $y = \pm 8$.
The intersection of these lines form a square with side length 16. The area of this square is $16^2 = 256$. So, the area of the convex polygon is 256.
