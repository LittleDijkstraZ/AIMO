Approach:



1. First, let's notice that the expression $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ can be rewritten as $(x-2y)^2 + (y-2x)^2$. This will help us simplify the constraints given in the problem.
2. The constraint $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$ can be rewritten as $(x-2y)^2 + (y-2x)^2 = 40^2 = 1600$.
3. Now, we want to find the minimum value of $(x-2y)^2 + (y-2x)^2$, subject to the constraint $(x-2y)^2 + (y-2x)^2 = 1600$. This is a constraint optimization problem.
4. Since the expression $(x-2y)^2 + (y-2x)^2$ is always non-negative and equals 1600, the minimum value occurs when $(x-2y)^2 + (y-2x)^2 = 0$, which means $x = 2y$ and $y = 2x$.
5. Solving these equations simultaneously gives $x = \frac{4}{3}y$. Substituting this back into the constraint equation gives $(y - \frac{8}{3}y)^2 + (\frac{4}{3}y - 2y)^2 = 1600$. Simplifying gives $\frac{16}{9}y^2 + \frac{4}{9}y^2 = 1600$, which simplifies further to $\frac{20}{9}y^2 = 1600$. Solving for $y$ gives $y = \pm 6\sqrt{10}$.
6. Substituting $y = 6\sqrt{10}$ into the equation $x = \frac{4}{3}y$ gives $x = 8\sqrt{10}$.
7. Substituting $x = 8\sqrt{10}$ and $y = 6\sqrt{10}$ into the expression $(x-2y)^2 + (y-2x)^2$ gives $(8\sqrt{10} - 12\sqrt{10})^2 + (6\sqrt{10} - 16\sqrt{10})^2 = (-4\sqrt{10})^2 + (-10\sqrt{10})^2 = 1600 + 10000 = 11600$.
8. However, the problem asks for the minimum value of the expression, which is 0.
9. The mistake in our approach is that we assumed that the minimum value of $(x-2y)^2 + (y-2x)^2$ occurs when $x = 2y$ and $y = 2x$. In fact, the minimum value of $(x-2y)^2 + (y-2x)^2$ subject to the constraint $(x-2y)^2 + (y-2x)^2 = 1600$ occurs when $x = 2y$ and $y = 2x$, but this is not a general result.
10. Instead, we should use the method of Lagrange multipliers to solve this problem. The function to be minimized is $F(x, y) = (x-2y)^2 + (y-2x)^2$ and the constraint is $G(x, y) = (x-2y)^2 + (y-2x)^2 - 1600 = 0$. The method of Lagrange multipliers states that the gradient of $F$ must be a multiple of the gradient of $G$, so $\nabla F = \lambda \nabla G$ for some scalar $\lambda$.
11. Taking the gradient of $F$ and $G$ gives $\nabla F = \begin{bmatrix} -4x + 8y \\ -8x + 4y \end{bmatrix}$ and $\nabla G = \begin{bmatrix} 4x - 8y \\ 8x - 4y \end{bmatrix}$. Setting $\nabla F = \lambda \nabla G$ gives the system of equations $-4x + 8y = \lambda(4x - 8y)$, $-8x + 4y = \lambda(8x - 4y)$.
12. Solving this system of equations gives $x = 2y$ and $y = 2x$, which we already knew. Substituting $x = 2y$ into the constraint equation $(x-2y)^2 + (y-2x)^2 = 1600$ gives $(y - 0)^2 + (0 - y)^2 = 1600$, which simplifies to $2y^2 = 1600$, and solving for $y$ gives $y = \pm 4\sqrt{10}$.
13. Substituting $y = 4\sqrt{10}$ into the equation $x = 2y$ gives $x = 8\sqrt{10}$.
14. Substituting $x = 8\sqrt{10}$ and $y = 4\sqrt{10}$ into the expression $(x-2y)^2 + (y-2x)^2$ gives $(8\sqrt{10} - 8\sqrt{10})^2 + (4\sqrt{10} - 16\sqrt{10})^2 = 0 + 14400 = 0$.
15. Thus, the minimum value of the expression $(x-2y)^2 + (y-2x)^2$ is 0.

So the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ is 0. The answer is: $\boxed{0}$.

Approach:



We first need to notice that the given condition $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$ is always true because $|a| = |-a|$ for any real number $a$. Therefore, we can rewrite the condition as $2|x-2y| = 40$. Simplifying this gives $|x-2y| = 20$.

Next, we can rewrite the expression $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ as $\frac{1}{2}((5x-4y)^2+(3x-3y)^2)$.

Let $a = 5x-4y$ and $b = 3x-3y$, then we need to find the minimum value of $\frac{1}{2}(a^2+b^2)$.

Because $|x-2y| = 20$, we have $|5x-4y| = 20 \cdot 5 = 100$ and $|3x-3y| = 20 \cdot 3 = 60$.

Hence, the minimum value of $\frac{1}{2}(a^2+b^2)$ is $\frac{1}{2}(100^2+60^2) = \frac{1}{2}(10000+3600) = \frac{1}{2} \cdot 13600 = 6800$.

Therefore, the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ is $6800$.

The answer is: $6800$

Approach:


To solve this problem, we can use the AM-GM inequality. The AM-GM inequality states that the arithmetic mean of non-negative real numbers is greater than or equal to their geometric mean. That is, for non-negative real numbers $a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n$, we have
$$\frac{a_1 + a_2 + \ldots + a_n}{n} \geq \sqrt[n]{a_1 a_2 \ldots a_n}.$$
Equality holds if and only if $a_1 = a_2 = \ldots = a_n$.

We can apply the AM-GM inequality to the expression $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$. We can rewrite this expression as
$$5x^2+5y^2-8xy = \frac{1}{2}((2x-y)^2 + (2y-x)^2).$$
Now, we can apply the AM-GM inequality to each term:
$$\frac{1}{2}((2x-y)^2 + (2y-x)^2) \geq \frac{1}{2}(2\sqrt{(2x-y)(2y-x)})^2 = 0.$$
Equality occurs when $2x-y = 2y-x$, which implies $x = y$. Substituting $x = y$ into the constraint equation $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$, we get
$$|x-2x| + |x-2x| = 40,$$
which simplifies to
$$|x-2x| = 20,$$
or
$$|-x| = 20.$$
This implies $x = -20$ or $x = 20$. Since we are looking for the minimum value of the expression, we choose $x = -20$ (or equivalently $y = -20$), which gives us the minimum value of the expression:
$$5(-20)^2 + 5(-20)^2 - 8(-20)(-20) = 2000 + 2000 - 3200 = 800.$$
The minimum value of the expression $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ is 800. The answer is: 800

Approach:

 To solve this problem, we will use the fact that the expression $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ can be rewritten as $5(x-y)^2$. Therefore, its minimum value will occur when $x-y=0$, or $x=y$.

Substitute $x=y$ into the equation $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$, we get $|x-2x| + |x-2x| = 40$, which simplifies to $| -x | + | -x | = 40$, or $2|x| = 40$. Solving this equation gives $|x| = 20$, so $x = \pm 20$.

Since we want the minimum value of the expression, we choose $x=y=20$.

Substitute $x=y=20$ into the expression $5(x-y)^2$, we get $5(20-20)^2 = 0$.

So the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ when $x$ and $y$ range over all real numbers such that $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$ is $0$. The answer is: $0$

Approach:

 To find the minimum value of the expression $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ given the constraint $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$, we can use the fact that the expression is a quadratic form and complete the square to find its minimum value. 

First, let's rewrite the expression $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ as $5(x^2 - \frac{4}{5}xy) + 5(y^2 - \frac{4}{5}xy)$. Now we can complete the square:

$5(x^2 - \frac{4}{5}xy + (\frac{2}{5}y)^2 - (\frac{2}{5}y)^2) + 5(y^2 - \frac{4}{5}xy + (\frac{2}{5}x)^2 - (\frac{2}{5}x)^2)$

$5[(x - \frac{2}{5}y)^2 - (\frac{2}{5}y)^2] + 5[(y - \frac{2}{5}x)^2 - (\frac{2}{5}x)^2]$

$5(x - \frac{2}{5}y)^2 - 5(\frac{2}{5}y)^2 + 5(y - \frac{2}{5}x)^2 - 5(\frac{2}{5}x)^2$

$5(x - \frac{2}{5}y)^2 + 5(y - \frac{2}{5}x)^2 - \frac{4}{5}(x^2 + y^2)$.

Now, let's consider the constraint $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$. This can be rewritten as $|2x - y| + |2y - x| = 40$. By the triangle inequality, we know that $|a| + |b| \geq |a+b|$, so $|2x - y| + |2y - x| \geq |(2x - y) + (2y - x)| = |x| = 20$. Equality occurs when $2x - y = 2y - x$, or $x = y$. 

So, we know that $x = y$. Let $t = x = y$, then the constraint becomes $|2t - t| + |2t - t| = 40$, or $|t| + |t| = 40$, which implies $|t| = 20$. So, $-20 \leq t \leq 20$.

Now, substitute $x = y = t$ into the expression $5x^2+5y^2-8xy - \frac{4}{5}(x^2 + y^2)$, we get $5t^2 + 5t^2 - 8t^2 - \frac{4}{5}(2t^2) = 2t^2 - \frac{8}{5}t^2 = \frac{2}{5}t^2$. Since $-20 \leq t \leq 20$, the minimum value of $\frac{2}{5}t^2$ is 0 when $t = 0$.

So, the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ when $x$ and $y$ range over all real numbers such that $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$ is 0.

The answer is: $0$

Approach:


To find the minimum value of the expression $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ under the constraint $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$, we can use the method of Lagrange multipliers. We introduce a new variable $\lambda$ and form the function $F(x, y, \lambda) = 5x^2+5y^2-8xy + \lambda(|x-2y| + |y-2x| - 40)$.

Now we need to find the critical points of $F(x, y, \lambda)$ by taking partial derivatives with respect to $x$, $y$, and $\lambda$ and setting them equal to zero:

$\frac{\partial F}{\partial x} = 10x - 8y + \lambda(-1 + 2\text{sign}(x-2y)) = 0$

$\frac{\partial F}{\partial y} = 10y - 8x + \lambda(2 - 1\text{sign}(y-2x)) = 0$

$\frac{\partial F}{\partial \lambda} = |x-2y| + |y-2x| - 40 = 0$

Solving this system of equations is quite involved and typically requires numerical methods. However, we can simplify the problem by noticing that the expression $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ is a quadratic form and therefore its minimum value can be found by completing the square. 

The expression $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ can be rewritten as $5(x^2 - \frac{4}{5}xy) + 5(y^2 - \frac{4}{5}xy) = 5(x-\frac{2}{5}y)^2 + 5(y-\frac{2}{5}x)^2$. 

Since $(x-\frac{2}{5}y)^2$ and $(y-\frac{2}{5}x)^2$ are both non-negative, the minimum value of this expression is 0, which occurs when $x = \frac{2}{5}y$ and $y = \frac{2}{5}x$. 

Substituting $x = \frac{2}{5}y$ into the constraint equation $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$, we get $|(\frac{2}{5}y - 2y)| + |y - 2(\frac{2}{5}y)| = 40$. Solving this equation numerically, we find that $y = 10$ and $x = 4$. 

Substituting these values back into the expression $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$, we get $5(4)^2 + 5(10)^2 - 8(4)(10) = 80$.

Therefore, the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ under the given constraint is 80.
The answer is: $80$

Assistant:

Approach:



The function $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ can be rewritten as $(5x^2 - 8xy + 5y^2)$ which is the square of a binomial: $(√5x - √5y)^2$. Therefore, the minimum value of the function is 0, which occurs when $x = y$.

We are given the constraint $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$. By setting $x = y$, the left-hand side of the equation becomes 0, which satisfies the equation.

Therefore, the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ when $x$ and $y$ range over all real numbers such that $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$ is 0. The answer is: $0$
