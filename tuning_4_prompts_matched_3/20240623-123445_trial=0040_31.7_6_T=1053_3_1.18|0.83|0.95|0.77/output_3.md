Solve the following problem with a Python Script (positive numerical answer):
"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"

Approach:


The equation $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ is satisfied only when at least one of the factors is zero. This means either $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$.

For the first factor to be zero, it must be that $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. This implies that $x = \pm 10$ and $y = \pm 10$. This gives us a square with side length 20, so the area of the square is $20^2 = 400$.

For the second factor to be zero, it must be that $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$. This implies that $x = \pm 8$ and $y = \pm 8$. This gives us a square with side length 16, so the area of the square is $16^2 = 256$.

Therefore, the area of the convex polygon enclosed by the points that satisfy the given equation is the sum of the areas of the two squares, which is $400 + 256 = 656$. The answer is: $656$

Approach:


The equation $A \cdot B = 0$ implies that $A = 0$ or $B = 0$. Therefore, we can split the given equation into two cases and solve each case separately.

Case 1: $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$. This equation implies that $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. The only way this can happen is if $x = 0$ and $y = 0$. So, we have only one point $(0, 0)$.

Case 2: $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$. This equation implies that $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$. So, the points are in a square with side length 16. The vertices of this square are $(8, 8)$, $(8, -8)$, $(-8, 8)$, and $(-8, -8)$.

The convex polygon formed by the points satisfying the given equation is a square with side length 16. The area of this square is $16^2 = 256$. Therefore, the area of the convex polygon is 256.

The answer is: $\boxed{256}$

Solve the following problem with a Python Script (positive numerical answer):
"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"

Approach:

 The equation $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ is satisfied if either of the factors is zero. This gives us two sets of equations to solve:
1. $\vert x + y \vert - 10 = 0$ and $\vert x - y \vert - 10 = 0$
2. $\vert x \vert - 8 = 0$ and $\vert y \vert - 8 = 0$
Solving the first set of equations gives $x + y = 10$ and $x - y = 10$, which can be solved to give $x = 10$ and $y = 0$. Similarly, solving the second set of equations gives $x = 8$ and $y = 8$. Plotting these points on a graph, we can see that they form a square with side length 10 units. The area of this square is $10^2 = 100$ square units. Therefore, the area of the convex polygon is 100 square units.

The answer is: $100$

Approach:


The equation $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + (\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ holds if and only if $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. These two equations imply that $x + y = \pm 10$ and $x - y = \pm 10$. Solving these four systems of equations, we get the vertices of the polygon as $(0, 10), (0, -10), (10, 0), (-10, 0)$.

Similarly, the equation $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + (\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ implies that $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$, which gives us the vertices $(8, 0), (-8, 0), (0, 8), (0, -8)$.

Therefore, the convex polygon is a square with side length 10, and its area is $10^2 = 100$. The answer is: $100$

Solve the following problem with a Python Script (positive numerical answer):
"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"

Approach:


The equation $f(x, y) = 0$ where $f(x, y) = ((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2)$ implies that either $f_1(x, y) = (\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ or $f_2(x, y) = (\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$. The first equation $f_1(x, y) = 0$ implies that $|x + y| = 10$ and $|x - y| = 10$. These are the equations of two pairs of parallel lines, and the solution set is a rectangle with side lengths $20$ and $10\sqrt{2}$. The second equation $f_2(x, y) = 0$ implies that $|x| = 8$ and $|y| = 8$, which are the equations of two pairs of parallel lines, and the solution set is a square with side length $16$. So, the area of the polygon is the area of the rectangle plus the area of the square, which is $20 \cdot 10\sqrt{2} + 16 \cdot 16$.

Now, let's calculate the area:
The area of the rectangle is $20 \cdot 10\sqrt{2} = 200\sqrt{2}$.
The area of the square is $16 \cdot 16 = 256$.
Adding these two areas together, the area of the polygon is $200\sqrt{2} + 256$.

So, the area of the convex polygon is $200\sqrt{2} + 256$. However, this is not a positive numerical value. We must have made an error in our calculations.

Upon revisiting our approach, we realized that we made a mistake in the interpretation of the equation $f(x, y) = 0$. The equation does not imply that either $f_1(x, y) = 0$ or $f_2(x, y) = 0$, but rather that the product of these two functions is zero, i.e., $f(x, y) = f_1(x, y) \cdot f_2(x, y) = 0$. This means that the solution set is the union of the solution sets of $f_1(x, y) = 0$ and $f_2(x, y) = 0$. The solution set of $f_1(x, y) = 0$ is a rectangle with side lengths $20$ and $10\sqrt{2}$, and the solution set of $f_2(x, y) = 0$ is a square with side length $16$. The area of the polygon is the sum of the areas of the rectangle and the square, which is $200\sqrt{2} + 256$.

However, we made another mistake. The side lengths of the rectangle and the square are not correct. The side length of the rectangle should be $20$ and $10\sqrt{2}$, but the side length of the square should be $16$. The area of the rectangle is then $20 \cdot 10\sqrt{2} = 200\sqrt{2}$, and the area of the square is $16 \cdot 16 = 256$. Adding these two areas together, the area of the polygon is $200\sqrt{2} + 256$.

Therefore, the area of the convex polygon is $200\sqrt{2} + 256$.

Since the area of a rectangle is length times width and the area of a square is side length squared, we can calculate the numerical value of the area: $Area = 200\sqrt{2} + 256 \approx 282.84 + 256 = 538.84$.

Therefore, the area of the convex polygon is approximately 538.84 square units.
The answer is: $\boxed{538.84}$

Solve the following problem with a Python Script (positive numerical answer):
"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"

Approach:


The equation given is a product of two expressions equals to zero. Therefore, either the first expression equals to zero or the second expression equals to zero.

Let's first consider the case where $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$. This can only be true if $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. This implies that $x + y = \pm 10$ and $x - y = \pm 10$. Solving these four equations gives us the vertices of the rectangle as $(0, 10)$, $(0, -10)$, $(10, 0)$, and $(-10, 0)$.

Next, let's consider the case where $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$. This can only be true if $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$. This implies that $x = \pm 8$ and $y = \pm 8$. Solving these four equations gives us the vertices of the square as $(8, 0)$, $(-8, 0)$, $(0, 8)$, and $(0, -8)$.

Combining the vertices from both cases, we find that the polygon is a rectangle with length $20$ and width $16$.

The area of the rectangle is length times width, which is $20 \times 16 = 320$.

So, the area of the convex polygon is $320$. The answer is: $320$.

Solve the following problem with a Python Script (positive numerical answer):
"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"

Approach:


The equation given is a product of two expressions equal to zero. This means that either the first expression is zero or the second expression is zero. We can solve each expression separately.

For the first expression, we have:
$$((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2) = 0$$
This implies that both $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ and $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$. Therefore, $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$.
This gives us the system of equations:
$$x + y = \pm 10$$
$$x - y = \pm 10$$

Solving this system, we get the vertices of the polygon as:
$$(5, 5), (5, -5), (-5, 5), (-5, -5)$$

For the second expression, we have:
$$((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$$
This implies that both $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ and $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$. Therefore, $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$.
This gives us the system of equations:
$$x = \pm 8$$
$$y = \pm 8$$

Solving this system, we get the vertices of the polygon as:
$$(8, 0), (0, 8), (-8, 0), (0, -8)$$

Combining the vertices from both expressions, we get the vertices of the polygon as:
$$(5, 5), (5, -5), (-5, 5), (-5, -5), (8, 0), (0, 8), (-8, 0), (0, -8)$$

This polygon is a square with side length $10$ units. The area of a square is given by the square of the length of its side. So, the area of this square is $10^2 = 100$ square units. The answer is: $100$

Solve the following problem with a Python Script (positive numerical answer):
"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"

Approach:



The equation $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ implies that either $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$.

The first equation implies that $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$, which simplifies to $x + y = \pm 10$ and $x - y = \pm 10$. Solving these equations, we get the vertices of the polygon as $(5,5), (5,-5), (-5,5)$ and $(-5,-5)$.

The second equation implies that $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$, which simplifies to $x = \pm 8$ and $y = \pm 8$. Solving these equations, we get the vertices of the polygon as $(8,0), (0,8), (-8,0)$ and $(0,-8)$.

Now, we can see that the vertices of the polygon are the points $(5,5), (5,-5), (-5,5)$ and $(-5,-5)$ and $(8,0), (0,8), (-8,0)$ and $(0,-8)$. These points form a square with side length 10.

The area of the square is given by side length squared, so the area of the polygon is $10^2 = 100$.

So, the area of the convex polygon is 100.
The answer is: 100
