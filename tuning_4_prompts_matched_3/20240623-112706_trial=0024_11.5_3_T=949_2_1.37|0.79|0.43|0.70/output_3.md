Question (hint: positive numerical answer):
"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"
Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:



First, we need to understand the condition of the equation. The product of two numbers is zero if and only if at least one of the numbers is zero. So, we have two cases to consider:

1. $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$.
2. $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$.

For the first case, this means $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ or $\vert x - y \vert = 10$.
For the second case, this means $\vert x \vert = 8$ or $\vert y \vert = 8$.

The absolute value equations can be rewritten as:

1. $x + y = 10$ or $x + y = -10$ or $x - y = 10$ or $x - y = -10$.
2. $x = 8$ or $x = -8$ or $y = 8$ or $y = -8$.

The solutions to these equations give us the vertices of the polygon:

1. $(10, 0), (0, 10), (-10, 0), (0, -10), (10, -20), (20, 10), (-10, 20), (-20, -10)$.
2. $(8, 0), (0, 8), (-8, 0), (0, -8), (8, -16), (16, 8), (-8, 16), (-16, -8)$.

Now we need to find the area of the polygon. We can divide the polygon into 4 right triangles and 4 squares.

The 4 right triangles are all congruent and each has legs of length 10, so their area is $\frac{1}{2} \cdot 10 \cdot 10 = 50$. The total area of the 4 right triangles is $4 \cdot 50 = 200$.

The 4 squares are all congruent and each has side length 8, so their area is $8 \cdot 8 = 64$. The total area of the 4 squares is $4 \cdot 64 = 256$.

Adding these two areas together, the total area of the polygon is $200 + 256 = 456$.

So the area of the convex polygon is 456 square units. The answer is: $\boxed{456}$

Question (hint: positive numerical answer):
"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"
Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:


The product of two numbers is zero if and only if at least one of the numbers is zero. So, the equation
$$((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$$
implies that either
$$((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2) = 0$$
or
$$((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0.$$
For the first equation to be zero, we must have
$$\vert x + y \vert = 10 \quad \text{and} \quad \vert x - y \vert = 10.$$
These are the equations of two squares in the $x$-$y$ plane with side length 10. The centers of the squares are at $(0,0)$ and $(0,0)$, respectively, and the sides of the squares are parallel to the coordinate axes.

For the second equation to be zero, we must have
$$\vert x \vert = 8 \quad \text{and} \quad \vert y \vert = 8.$$
These are the equations of two squares in the $x$-$y$ plane with side length 8. The centers of the squares are at $(0,0)$ and $(0,0)$, respectively, and the sides of the squares are parallel to the coordinate axes.

The points satisfying the original equation are the intersections of these four squares. Therefore, the convex polygon is the intersection of the four squares, which is a square with side length 8.

The area of a square with side length $s$ is $s^2$, so the area of the convex polygon is $8^2 = 64$. The answer is: $\boxed{64}$

Question (hint: positive numerical answer):
"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"
Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:



The product of two numbers is zero if and only if at least one of the numbers is zero. So the equation is equal to zero if and only if either $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2) = 0$ or $((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$.

For the first case, either $\vert x + y \vert - 10 = 0$ or $\vert x - y \vert - 10 = 0$. This means $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ or $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. The absolute value equation splits into two cases: $x + y = 10$ or $x + y = -10$, and $x - y = 10$ or $x - y = -10$. These four lines form a square with side length 10. The area of this square is $10^2 = 100$.

For the second case, either $\vert x \vert - 8 = 0$ or $\vert y \vert - 8 = 0$. This means $\vert x \vert = 8$ or $\vert y \vert = 8$. The absolute value equation splits into two cases: $x = 8$ or $x = -8$, and $y = 8$ or $y = -8$. These four lines form a square with side length 16. The area of this square is $16^2 = 256$.

However, the area of the polygon is the intersection of the two squares, which is also a square. The side length of this square is the minimum of the side lengths of the two squares, which is 10. So the area of the polygon is $10^2 = 100$. The answer is: $100$

"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"
Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:


The product of two numbers is zero if and only if at least one of the numbers is zero. Therefore, the equation $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ is satisfied if and only if at least one of the following two equations is satisfied:
1. $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$
2. $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$
For the first equation to be satisfied, we must have $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. This means $x + y = \pm 10$ and $x - y = \pm 10$. Solving these equations gives us the points $(5,5)$, $(5,-5)$, $(-5,5)$, and $(-5,-5)$.
For the second equation to be satisfied, we must have $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$. This means $x = \pm 8$ and $y = \pm 8$. Solving these equations gives us the points $(8,8)$, $(8,-8)$, $(-8,8)$, and $(-8,-8)$.

Plotting these points on the coordinate plane, we can see that they form a square with side length 10. Therefore, the area of this square is $10^2 = 100$.

The answer is: $100$

Question (hint: positive numerical answer):
"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"
Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:



We first observe that the product of two real numbers is zero if and only if at least one of the numbers is zero. Thus, the equation given in the problem implies that either $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$.

If $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$, then both $\vert x + y \vert - 10 = 0$ and $\vert x - y \vert - 10 = 0$, which implies $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. This means that $x + y = \pm 10$ and $x - y = \pm 10$, which can be solved to give the four lines $x + y = 10$, $x + y = -10$, $x - y = 10$, and $x - y = -10$.

Similarly, if $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$, then both $\vert x \vert - 8 = 0$ and $\vert y \vert - 8 = 0$, which implies $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$. This means that $x = \pm 8$ and $y = \pm 8$, which can be solved to give the four lines $x = 8$, $x = -8$, $y = 8$, and $y = -8$.

The intersection of these lines form a square with side length 10, because the distance between the lines $x + y = 10$ and $x + y = -10$ (or $x - y = 10$ and $x - y = -10$) is 10 (using the distance formula for lines), and similarly for the other pairs of lines. The area of this square is $10^2 = 100$. The answer is: $100$

Question (hint: positive numerical answer):
"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"
Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:


To solve this problem, we need to understand the properties of absolute values and the zero product rule.

The expression is given as
$$((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0.$$

The zero product rule states that if the product of two numbers is zero, then at least one of the numbers must be zero. Therefore, either
$$(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$$
or
$$(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0.$$

For the first equation to be zero, we must have $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. This means that the sum and difference of $x$ and $y$ must be 10 or -10. This defines a square with side length 20.

For the second equation to be zero, we must have $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$. This means that $x$ and $y$ must be 8 or -8. This defines a square with side length 16.

The total area of the convex polygon is the sum of the areas of these two squares. The area of a square is given by the side length squared, so the area of the larger square is $20^2 = 400$, and the area of the smaller square is $16^2 = 256$. Therefore, the total area of the convex polygon is $400 + 256 = 656$.
The answer is: $656$.

"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"
Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:



The given equation is $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$. This equation is satisfied only when either $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$. 

For the first case, $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$, this can only happen when $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. These two equations represent a square with side length 10, and its vertices are $(5,5)$, $(5,-5)$, $(-5,-5)$, and $(-5,5)$.

For the second case, $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$, this can only happen when $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$. This means $x = \pm 8$ and $y = \pm 8$. So these four points are $(8,8)$, $(8,-8)$, $(-8,-8)$, and $(-8,8)$.

Therefore, the convex polygon is a square with side length 10. The area of this square is $10^2 = 100$. The answer is: $100$
