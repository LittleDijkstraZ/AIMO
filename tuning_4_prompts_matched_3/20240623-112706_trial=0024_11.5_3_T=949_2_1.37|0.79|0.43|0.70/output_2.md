Question (hint: positive numerical answer):
"For how many positive integers $m$ does the equation \[\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}\] have $4$ distinct solutions?"
Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:



The equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has 4 distinct solutions,
then the right side must be between 1 and 2.
This means $1 < \frac{m}{100} < 2$, so $100 < m < 200$.
The positive integers $m$ in this range are 101, 102, ..., 199,
so there are 99 such integers. The answer is: $99$

Question (hint: positive numerical answer):
"For how many positive integers $m$ does the equation \[\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}\] have $4$ distinct solutions?"
Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:


The number of solutions of the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ is determined by the value of $\frac{m}{100}$.

If $\frac{m}{100} = 2$, the equation has 4 solutions.

If $\frac{m}{100} > 2$, the equation has 2 solutions.

If $\frac{m}{100} < 2$, the equation has no solutions.

Therefore, the only value of $m$ that makes the equation have 4 solutions is $m = 200$.
The answer is: $1$

Question (hint: positive numerical answer):
"For how many positive integers $m$ does the equation \[\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}\] have $4$ distinct solutions?"
Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:


The equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has $4$ distinct solutions. This means that the expression inside the absolute value, $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert$, must be equal to $\frac{m}{100}$ or $-\frac{m}{100}$ at $4$ different $x$ values.
The expression $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert$ is equal to $\frac{m}{100}$ or $-\frac{m}{100}$ when $\vert x-1 \vert -2 = \pm \frac{m}{100}$.
This simplifies to $\vert x-1 \vert = 2 \pm \frac{m}{100}$.
For the equation $\vert x-1 \vert = 2 + \frac{m}{100}$ to have two solutions, $2 + \frac{m}{100}$ must be positive, so $\frac{m}{100} > -2$ or $m > -200$.
Similarly, for the equation $\vert x-1 \vert = 2 - \frac{m}{100}$ to have two solutions, $2 - \frac{m}{100}$ must be positive, so $\frac{m}{100} < 2$ or $m < 200$.
Combining these two inequalities, we have $-200 < m < 200$.
The number of positive integers $m$ in this range is $199$.
However, we need to check if any of these values actually give us $4$ distinct solutions.
If we consider the equation $\vert x-1 \vert = 2 + \frac{m}{100}$, the two solutions are $x = 1 + 2 + \frac{m}{100} = 3 + \frac{m}{100}$ and $x = 1 - 2 - \frac{m}{100} = -1 - \frac{m}{100}$.
Similarly, for the equation $\vert x-1 \vert = 2 - \frac{m}{100}$, the two solutions are $x = 1 + 2 - \frac{m}{100} = 3 - \frac{m}{100}$ and $x = 1 - 2 + \frac{m}{100} = -1 + \frac{m}{100}$.
For the four solutions to be distinct, we need $\frac{m}{100} \neq 1$. This is because if $\frac{m}{100} = 1$, then the two solutions for each equation would be the same.
So we need to exclude the values of $m$ for which $\frac{m}{100} = 1$, or $m = 100$.
Therefore, the number of positive integers $m$ for which the equation has $4$ distinct solutions is $199 - 1 = 198$.
The answer is: $198$

Question (hint: positive numerical answer):
"For how many positive integers $m$ does the equation \[\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}\] have $4$ distinct solutions?"
Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:



First, let's understand the problem. We want to find how many positive integers $m$ make the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ have $4$ distinct solutions. 

This equation is a combination of absolute value functions, and it's not immediately obvious how to solve it. However, we know from the graph of absolute value functions that the expression $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert$ is always between $0$ and $2$. This means $\frac{m}{100}$ must be between $0$ and $2$, so $0 \leq \frac{m}{100} \leq 2$. Multiplying all sides by $100$, we get $0 \leq m \leq 200$. 

We also know that the expression inside the absolute value, $\vert x-1 \vert -2$, can change its sign twice at $x=1 \pm 2$, which means $x=-1,3$. So the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has $4$ distinct solutions when $\frac{m}{100}=1$. Therefore, $m=100$. 

But does this value of $m$ satisfy the equation? We check: $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{100}{100}=1$. So we need to solve the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=1$. 

This equation has $4$ solutions: one in the interval $(-\infty, -1)$, one in the interval $(-1, 3)$, one in the interval $(3, \infty)$, and one is at $x=1$. 

Therefore, there is exactly one value of $m$ that makes the equation have $4$ distinct solutions, and that value is $m=100$. 
The answer is: $1$

Question (hint: positive numerical answer):
"For how many positive integers $m$ does the equation \[\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}\] have $4$ distinct solutions?"
Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:



The equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has 4 distinct solutions, it means that the value of the right side $\frac{m}{100}$ must be equal to the distance between the two horizontal lines in the graph of the function $f(x) = \vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert$.

The graph of the function $f(x) = \vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert$ has a value of 2 when $x< -1$, a value of 1 when $-1 \le x \le 3$, and a value of 0 when $x>3$. Therefore, the distance between the two horizontal lines in the graph must be a value in the interval $(0,2]$.

So, the possible values of $\frac{m}{100}$ are the numbers in the interval $(0,2]$. This means $0 < \frac{m}{100} \le 2$. Multiplying all sides of the inequality by 100 gives $0 < m \le 200$.

The positive integers $m$ that satisfy this inequality are 1, 2, ..., 200. There are 200 positive integers in this range.

However, the question asks for the number of positive integers $m$ such that the equation has exactly 4 distinct solutions. From the graph of the function $f(x) = \vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert$, we can see that the value of $\frac{m}{100}$ must be equal to 1 to have exactly 4 distinct solutions.

So, the only positive integer $m$ that makes the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ have 4 distinct solutions is $m=100$.

Therefore, the number of positive integers $m$ such that the equation has 4 distinct solutions is 1. The answer is: $1$

Question (hint: positive numerical answer):
"For how many positive integers $m$ does the equation \[\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}\] have $4$ distinct solutions?"
Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:


The equation $| |x - 1| - 2 | = \frac{m}{100}$ has four distinct solutions if and only if $\frac{m}{100} = 2$.
Therefore, $m = 200$.
Thus, there is only one positive integer $m$ that satisfies the condition, and that is $m = 200$. The answer is: $1$
