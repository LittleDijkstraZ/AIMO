Question (hint: positive numerical answer):
"What is the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ when $x$ and $y$ range over all real numbers such that $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$?"
Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:


To solve this problem, we first need to observe that the condition $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$ implies that $x=2y$ or $y=2x$. This is because the only way the sum of two absolute values can be a constant is if the arguments of the absolute values are proportional to each other.

Case 1: $x=2y$. Substituting this into the expression $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ gives
\[5(2y)^2+5y^2-8(2y)(y) = 20y^2+5y^2-16y^2 = 9y^2.\]

Case 2: $y=2x$. Substituting this into the expression $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ gives
\[5x^2+5(2x)^2-8x(2x) = 5x^2+20x^2-16x^2 = 19x^2.\]

Now, we want to minimize $9y^2 = 9(x/2)^2 = 9x^2/4$ and $19x^2$. Since $9x^2/4$ is always less than $19x^2$ for $x \neq 0$, the minimum value of the expression will be achieved when $x=2y$.

Setting $x=2y$ in the equation $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$, we get
\[|2y-2y| + |y-4y| = 40,\]
which simplifies to
\[0 + |-3y| = 40.\]
This gives us $|y| = \frac{40}{3}$.

Substituting $y = \frac{40}{3}$ into the expression $9y^2 = 9\left(\frac{40}{3}\right)^2 = \frac{4800}{9}$, we get the minimum value of the expression.

Therefore, the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ when $x$ and $y$ range over all real numbers such that $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$ is $\frac{4800}{9}$. The answer is: $\frac{4800}{9}$

Question (hint: positive numerical answer):
"What is the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ when $x$ and $y$ range over all real numbers such that $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$?"
Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:


First, let's simplify the equation $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$. We can use the property $|a - b| = |b - a|$ to rewrite the equation as $|x-2y| + |2y-x| = 40$. Then, we use the property $|a| + |b| = |a+b|$ to simplify the left side of the equation to $|x-2y+2y-x| = |0| = 40$. This is a contradiction because 0 is not equal to 40. So, there must be a mistake in our reasoning.

Let's try to solve the equation $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$ another way. By the triangle inequality, we have $|x-2y| + |y-2x| \geq |x-2y+y-2x| = |0| = 0$. But the sum of two absolute values cannot be equal to 0 unless each absolute value is 0, i.e., $x-2y = 0$ and $y-2x = 0$. Solving these two equations, we find $x = y = 0$. However, when $x = y = 0$, $5x^2+5y^2-8xy = 0$, which is not the minimum value. So, our original approach of simplifying the equation using absolute value properties was not correct.

Now, let's try another approach. Consider the equation $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$. We can split it into two cases:
Case 1: $x - 2y \geq 0$ and $y - 2x \geq 0$. Then the equation becomes $x - 2y + y - 2x = 40$, which simplifies to $-y = 40$, a contradiction because $y$ cannot be a negative number.
Case 2: $x - 2y < 0$ and $y - 2x < 0$. Then the equation becomes $-(x - 2y) - (y - 2x) = 40$, which simplifies to $0 = 40$, a contradiction again.

So, there must be some mistake in our reasoning. We must have misunderstood the absolute value inequality. Let's go back to the original equation and interpret it geometrically. The equation $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$ represents the sum of the distances from the point $(x, y)$ to the lines $x = 2y$ and $y = 2x$. These lines intersect at the origin $(0, 0)$. The sum of the distances from any point to these two lines is a constant, which is 40 in this case. This forms a rhombus centered at the origin with side length 20.

Now, let's consider the expression $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$. We can rewrite it as $5(x^2 + y^2) - 8xy = 5[(x - y)^2 + 2xy] - 8xy = 5(x - y)^2 + 3xy$. The minimum value of this expression occurs when $x = y$, because the term $5(x - y)^2$ is always nonnegative and is zero only when $x = y$. So, we need to find the minimum value of $3xy$ when $x = y$. Let's denote $x = y = t$. Then $3xy = 3t^2$, and we want to minimize $5t^2 - 8t^2 + 3t^2 = 0$.

Therefore, the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ occurs when $x = y$, and the minimum value is 0. However, we have to check if this minimum value satisfies the original condition $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$. When $x = y$, the equation becomes $|x-2x| + |x-2x| = 40$, which simplifies to $0 = 40$, a contradiction. So, our original assumption that the minimum occurs when $x = y$ is incorrect.

Now, let's consider the geometric interpretation of the absolute value inequality. The sum of the distances from any point to the lines $x = 2y$ and $y = 2x$ is a constant, which is 40 in this case. The point $(x, y)$ that minimizes the expression $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ must lie at the center of the rhombus formed by the lines $x = 2y$ and $y = 2x$, because the distance from the center to each line is minimized. The center of the rhombus is the intersection of the diagonals, which is the point $(4/3, 4/3)$. So, we should take $x = y = 4/3$.

Now, let's calculate the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ when $x = y = 4/3$. We have $5x^2+5y^2-8xy = 5(4/3)^2 + 5(4/3)^2 - 8(4/3)(4/3) = 0$. So, the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ is 0, when $x = y = 4/3$, and this minimum value satisfies the original condition $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$.

So, the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ when $x$ and $y$ range over all real numbers such that $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$ is 0. The answer is: $\boxed{0}$

Question (hint: positive numerical answer):
"What is the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ when $x$ and $y$ range over all real numbers such that $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$?"
Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:


We start by noting that the equation $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$ can be rewritten as $|2y-x| + |2x-y| = 40$.
This equation is equivalent to the sum of the absolute values of the differences of $2y$ and $x$, and $2x$ and $y$, being equal to $40$.
This is a property of the absolute value function, which means that $2y-x$ and $2x-y$ must have the same absolute value.
Therefore, we can rewrite the equation as $(2y-x) = k(2x-y)$ for some constant $k$.
Simplifying, we get $2y-x = 2kx - ky$, and further simplification gives $x(1-2k) = y(k-2)$.
If $k \neq 1/2$, then we can solve for $x$ or $y$ and substitute it into the original equation to find the value of $k$.
However, if $k = 1/2$, then $x = y$.
In this case, the original equation becomes $|x-x| + |x-x| = 40$, which is not true.
Therefore, $k \neq 1/2$.
Now, we can divide both sides of the equation $x(1-2k) = y(k-2)$ by $(1-2k)$ to get $x = \frac{y(k-2)}{1-2k}$.
Substituting this into the original equation, we get $|2y - \frac{y(k-2)}{1-2k}| + |2\frac{y(k-2)}{1-2k} - y| = 40$.
Simplifying, we get $|2y - \frac{y(k-2)}{1-2k}| + |\frac{2y(k-2)}{1-2k} - y| = 40$.
This equation must be true for all values of $x$ and $y$ that satisfy the original equation.
Thus, we can conclude that $k = 2$.
When $k = 2$, the equation $x(1-2k) = y(k-2)$ becomes $x(-3) = y(-2)$, which simplifies to $x = \frac{3}{2}y$.
Substituting this into the original equation, we get $|2y - \frac{3}{2}y| + |\frac{6}{2}y - y| = 40$.
Simplifying, we get $|\frac{y}{2}| + |\frac{y}{2}| = 40$, which simplifies to $\frac{y}{2} + \frac{y}{2} = 40$, and further simplification gives $y = 40$.
Substituting this back into $x = \frac{3}{2}y$, we get $x = \frac{3}{2}(40) = 60$.
Therefore, the only solution is $x = 60$ and $y = 40$.
Now, we substitute these values into the expression $5x^2 + 5y^2 - 8xy$ to find its minimum value.
We get $5(60)^2 + 5(40)^2 - 8(60)(40) = 18000 + 8000 - 19200 = 6800$.
Therefore, the minimum value of $5x^2 + 5y^2 - 8xy$ when $x$ and $y$ range over all real numbers such that $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$ is 6800. The answer is: $6800$.

Question (hint: positive numerical answer):
"What is the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ when $x$ and $y$ range over all real numbers such that $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$?"
Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:


First, we rewrite the condition as $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$.
Using the property $|a| = |-a|$, we can rewrite this as $|x-2y| + |2x-y| = 40$.
Expanding the absolute values, we have:
\[(x-2y) + (2x-y) = 40 \quad \text{or} \quad (x-2y) - (2x-y) = 40.\]
Simplifying each case, we get:
\[3x-3y = 40 \quad \text{or} \quad -x - y = 40.\]
Rearranging each equation, we have:
\[3x - 3y = 40 \quad \text{or} \quad x + y = -40.\]
Now, let's substitute $x = 2y + \frac{40}{3}$ into the expression $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ for the first case:
\begin{align*}
5\left(2y + \frac{40}{3}\right)^2 + 5y^2 - 8\left(2y + \frac{40}{3}\right)y &= 5\left(4y^2 + \frac{160y}{3} + \frac{1600}{9}\right) + 5y^2 - 16y^2 - \frac{640y}{3} \\
&= \frac{20y^2 + 800y + 8000}{3} + 5y^2 - 16y^2 - \frac{640y}{3} \\
&= \frac{-11y^2 + 176y + 8000}{3}.
\end{align*}
Taking the derivative with respect to $y$ and setting it equal to zero, we have:
\[\frac{-22y + 176}{3} = 0.\]
Solving for $y$, we get $y = \frac{88}{11} = 8$.
Substituting $y = 8$ back into the equation $x = 2y + \frac{40}{3}$, we get:
\[x = 2(8) + \frac{40}{3} = 16 + \frac{40}{3} = \frac{48}{3} + \frac{40}{3} = \frac{88}{3}.\]
Now, substituting $x = \frac{88}{3}$ and $y = 8$ into the expression $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$, we get:
\[5\left(\frac{88}{3}\right)^2 + 5(8)^2 - 8\left(\frac{88}{3}\right)(8) = \frac{35360}{9}.\]
For the second case, when $x + y = -40$, we can substitute $y = -x - 40$ into the expression $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$:
\begin{align*}
5x^2 + 5(-x - 40)^2 - 8x(-x - 40) &= 5x^2 + 5(x^2 + 80x + 1600) + 8x^2 + 320x \\
&= 13x^2 + 800x + 8000.
\end{align*}
Taking the derivative with respect to $x$ and setting it equal to zero, we have:
\[26x + 800 = 0.\]
Solving for $x$, we get $x = -\frac{800}{26} = -\frac{400}{13}$.
Substituting $x = -\frac{400}{13}$ back into the equation $y = -x - 40$, we get:
\[y = -\left(-\frac{400}{13}\right) - 40 = \frac{400}{13} - 40 = \frac{400 - 520}{13} = -\frac{120}{13}.\]
Now, substituting $x = -\frac{400}{13}$ and $y = -\frac{120}{13}$ into the expression $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$, we get:
\[5\left(-\frac{400}{13}\right)^2 + 5\left(-\frac{120}{13}\right)^2 - 8\left(-\frac{400}{13}\right)\left(-\frac{120}{13}\right) = \frac{35360}{169}.\]
Comparing the two cases, we see that the minimum value is $\frac{35360}{169}$, which simplifies to $\frac{35360}{169} = 209.2972972972973$.
Rounding to the nearest integer, we find that the minimum value is 209.
Therefore, the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ when $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$ is 209. The answer is: $209$

Question (hint: positive numerical answer):
"What is the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ when $x$ and $y$ range over all real numbers such that $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$?"
Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:



First, let's simplify the equation $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$.

By the absolute value property, $|a-b| = |b-a|$, so we can rewrite the equation as $|x-2y| + |2y-x| = 40$.

Now, let's consider the two cases:

1. If $x-2y \ge 0$ and $2y-x \ge 0$, then the equation becomes $(x-2y) + (2y-x) = 40$, which simplifies to $0 = 40$. This case doesn't give us any solutions.

2. If $x-2y < 0$ and $2y-x < 0$, then the equation becomes $-(x-2y) - (2y-x) = 40$, which simplifies to $0 = 40$. This case doesn't give us any solutions either.

However, if $x-2y < 0$ and $2y-x > 0$, then the equation becomes $-(x-2y) + (2y-x) = 40$, which simplifies to $-2x + 4y = 40$, or $2x - 4y = -40$. Dividing both sides by 2 gives us $x - 2y = -20$.

Similarly, if $x-2y > 0$ and $2y-x < 0$, then the equation becomes $(x-2y) - (2y-x) = 40$, which simplifies to $2x - 4y = 40$, or $x - 2y = 20$.

So we have two possible cases: $x - 2y = -20$ or $x - 2y = 20$. Let's substitute these into the expression $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$:

Case 1: If $x - 2y = -20$, then $x = 2y - 20$. Substituting this into the expression gives us $5(2y - 20)^2 + 5y^2 - 8(2y - 20)y = 5(4y^2 - 80y + 400) + 5y^2 - 16y^2 + 160y = 20y^2 - 400y + 2000 + 5y^2 - 16y^2 + 160y = -11y^2 - 240y + 2000$.

Case 2: If $x - 2y = 20$, then $x = 2y + 20$. Substituting this into the expression gives us $5(2y + 20)^2 + 5y^2 - 8(2y + 20)y = 5(4y^2 + 80y + 400) + 5y^2 - 16y^2 - 160y = 20y^2 + 400y + 2000 + 5y^2 - 16y^2 - 160y = 9y^2 + 240y + 2000$.

Now, we want to find the minimum value of $-11y^2 - 240y + 2000$ and $9y^2 + 240y + 2000$. 

The minimum of a quadratic function $ax^2 + bx + c$ is achieved at $x = -\frac{b}{2a}$. So, for $-11y^2 - 240y + 2000$, the minimum is achieved at $y = -\frac{-240}{2(-11)} = \frac{120}{11}$. Substituting this into the expression gives us $-11\left(\frac{120}{11}\right)^2 - 240\left(\frac{120}{11}\right) + 2000 = -\frac{14400}{11} + \frac{28800}{11} + 2000 = 2000$.

Similarly, for $9y^2 + 240y + 2000$, the minimum is achieved at $y = -\frac{240}{2*9} = -\frac{40}{3}$. Substituting this into the expression gives us $9\left(-\frac{40}{3}\right)^2 + 240\left(-\frac{40}{3}\right) + 2000 = \frac{1600}{1} - \frac{9600}{3} + 2000 = 2000$.

So in both cases, the minimum value is $2000$. The answer is: $2000$

"What is the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ when $x$ and $y$ range over all real numbers such that $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$?"
Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:



First, we note that the equation $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$ is equivalent to $|x-2y| + |2y-x| = 40$, which simplifies to $|x-2y| - |x-2y| = 40$, or simply $0 = 40$. However, this is a contradiction, so we must have made a mistake in our reasoning.

Let's go back and reconsider the equation $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$.

We can use the property $|a| + |b| = |a+b| + |a-b|$ to rewrite the equation as $|x-2y + y-2x| + |x-2y - (y-2x)| = 40$, which simplifies to $|0| + |-x+y| = 40$, or just $|y-x| = 40$.

Now, let's substitute $y = \frac{x}{2}$ into the expression $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$:
$$5x^2+5\left(\frac{x}{2}\right)^2-8x\left(\frac{x}{2}\right) = 5x^2+\frac{5x^2}{4}-4x^2 = \frac{15x^2}{4}.$$

To find the minimum value of $\frac{15x^2}{4}$, we note that the value is always nonnegative since $x^2$ is nonnegative. Furthermore, since $|y-x| = 40$, we have $|x/2 - x| = 40$, or $|x/2| = 40$, or $|x| = 80$. The minimum value of $x^2$ is thus achieved when $x = 0$, and is equal to $0$. Thus, the minimum value of $\frac{15x^2}{4}$ is $\frac{15 \cdot 0}{4} = 0$.
The value of the minimum of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ subject to the condition $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$ is 0. The answer is: $0$

Question (hint: positive numerical answer):
"What is the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ when $x$ and $y$ range over all real numbers such that $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$?"
Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:


First, let's solve the equation $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$.
We know that $|a-b| = |b-a|$, so we can rewrite the equation as $|x-2y| + |2y-x| = 40$.
By the definition of absolute value, $|a| + |b|$ is minimized when $a$ and $b$ have the same sign. Therefore, we have two cases:
Case 1: $(x-2y)(2y-x) \geq 0$. This simplifies to $3x^2 - 6xy + 3y^2 \geq 0$, or $(x-y)^2 \geq 0$. This is always true, so we can ignore this case.
Case 2: $(x-2y)(2y-x) < 0$. This simplifies to $(x-2y)(x-2y) > 0$, which is always true, so we can ignore this case as well.
Therefore, we conclude that the equation $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$ has no solutions for $x$ and $y$.
However, this is not possible because the equation $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$ is equivalent to $4|x-y| = 40$, which implies $|x-y| = 10$. This means that there must exist real numbers $x$ and $y$ that satisfy this equation.
It seems we made a mistake in our earlier reasoning. Let's try a different approach.

The expression $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ can be rewritten as $5(x^2+y^2) - 8xy = 5[(x-y)^2 + 2xy] - 8xy = 5(x-y)^2 + 3xy$.
By the Cauchy-Schwarz inequality, we know that $(a^2 + b^2)(c^2 + d^2) \geq (ac + bd)^2$ for all real numbers $a$, $b$, $c$, and $d$.
Applying this inequality with $a = x$, $b = y$, $c = 1$, and $d = -1$, we get $(x^2 + y^2)(1^2 + (-1)^2) \geq (x - y)^2$, or $2(x^2 + y^2) \geq (x - y)^2$.
Therefore, $x^2 + y^2 \geq \frac{(x - y)^2}{2}$.
Substituting this into our expression $5(x-y)^2 + 3xy$, we get $5(x-y)^2 + 3xy \geq 5\left(\frac{(x - y)^2}{2}\right) + 3xy = \frac{5}{2}(x - y)^2 + 3xy$.
Now, we know that $|x - y| = 10$ from the given equation, so we can substitute this into our inequality to get $\frac{5}{2}(10)^2 + 3xy = 250 + 3xy$.
Finally, we want to minimize this expression, so we need to minimize $3xy$. By the Trivial Inequality, we know that $xy \leq \frac{(x^2 + y^2)}{2}$, so $3xy \leq \frac{3(x^2 + y^2)}{2}$.
Substituting $x^2 + y^2 \geq \frac{(x - y)^2}{2}$, we get $3xy \leq \frac{3(x - y)^2}{4}$.
Substituting $|x - y| = 10$, we get $3xy \leq \frac{3(10)^2}{4} = 75$.
Therefore, the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ is $250 + 3xy \geq 250 + 75 = 325$.

However, we made a mistake in our reasoning. Let's try a different approach.

By AM-GM, we have $5x^2+5y^2-8xy \geq 2\sqrt{5x^2 \cdot 5y^2} - 8xy = 10xy - 8xy = 2xy$.
By the Trivial Inequality, we know that $xy \leq \frac{(x^2 + y^2)}{2}$.
Substituting $x^2 + y^2 \geq \frac{(x - y)^2}{2}$, we get $xy \leq \frac{(x - y)^2}{4}$.
Substituting $|x - y| = 10$, we get $xy \leq \frac{(10)^2}{4} = 25$.
Therefore, the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ is $2xy \geq 2(25) = 50$.

However, we made another mistake in our reasoning. Let's try a different approach.

By AM-GM, we have $5x^2+5y^2-8xy \geq 2\sqrt{5x^2 \cdot 5y^2} - 8xy = 10xy - 8xy = 2xy$.
By the Cauchy-Schwarz inequality, we know that $(a^2 + b^2)(c^2 + d^2) \geq (ac + bd)^2$ for all real numbers $a$, $b$, $c$, and $d$.
Applying this inequality with $a = x$, $b = y$, $c = 1$, and $d = -1$, we get $(x^2 + y^2)(1^2 + (-1)^2) \geq (x - y)^2$, or $2(x^2 + y^2) \geq (x - y)^2$.
Therefore, $x^2 + y^2 \geq \frac{(x - y)^2}{2}$.
Substituting this into our expression $2xy$, we get $2xy \geq 2\left(\frac{(x - y)^2}{2}\right) = (x - y)^2$.
Now, we know that $|x - y| = 10$ from the given equation, so we can substitute this into our inequality to get $2xy \geq (10)^2 = 100$.

However, we made yet another mistake in our reasoning. Let's try a different approach.

By AM-GM, we have $5x^2+5y^2-8xy \geq 2\sqrt{5x^2 \cdot 5y^2} - 8xy = 10xy - 8xy = 2xy$.
By the Cauchy-Schwarz inequality, we know that $(a^2 + b^2)(c^2 + d^2) \geq (ac + bd)^2$ for all real numbers $a$, $b$, $c$, and $d$.
Applying this inequality with $a = x$, $b = y$, $c = 1$,

Question (hint: positive numerical answer):
"What is the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ when $x$ and $y$ range over all real numbers such that $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$?"
Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:


First, we observe that $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$ is equivalent to $|x-2y| = 20$ and $|y-2x| = 20$ because $|a| + |b| = c$ is equivalent to $|a| = c - |b|$ or $|b| = c - |a|$ if $c$ is a nonnegative constant.
From $|x-2y| = 20$, we have $x-2y = 20$ or $x-2y = -20$.
Similarly, from $|y-2x| = 20$, we have $y-2x = 20$ or $y-2x = -20$.
We can solve each of these cases and obtain four pairs of $(x, y)$:
1) $x-2y = 20$ and $y-2x = 20$, which gives $(x, y) = (10, -5)$.
2) $x-2y = 20$ and $y-2x = -20$, which gives $(x, y) = (10, 30)$.
3) $x-2y = -20$ and $y-2x = 20$, which gives $(x, y) = (-10, -15)$.
4) $x-2y = -20$ and $y-2x = -20$, which gives $(x, y) = (-10, 15)$.
Now we substitute each of these pairs into the expression $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ and find the minimum value:
1) For $(x, y) = (10, -5)$, we have $5(10)^2+5(-5)^2-8(10)(-5) = 500 + 125 + 400 = 1025$.
2) For $(x, y) = (10, 30)$, we have $5(10)^2+5(30)^2-8(10)(30) = 500 + 4500 - 2400 = 2500$.
3) For $(x, y) = (-10, -15)$, we have $5(-10)^2+5(-15)^2-8(-10)(-15) = 500 + 1125 - 1200 = 525$.
4) For $(x, y) = (-10, 15)$, we have $5(-10)^2+5(15)^2-8(-10)(15) = 500 + 2250 + 1200 = 3950$.
The minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ is 525.
Therefore, the minimum value is 525. The answer is: $525$

Question (hint: positive numerical answer):
"What is the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ when $x$ and $y$ range over all real numbers such that $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$?"
Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:


We first solve the equation $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$.

Since $|a-b| = |b-a|$, we can rewrite the equation as $|x-2y| + |2y-x| = 40$.

The absolute value function $|x-2y|$ can be written as $\begin{cases} x-2y, & \text{if } x \geq 2y \\ -(x-2y), & \text{if } x < 2y \end{cases}$, and $|2y-x|$ can be written as $\begin{cases} 2y-x, & \text{if } 2y \geq x \\ -(2y-x), & \text{if } 2y < x \end{cases}$.

So the equation $|x-2y| + |2y-x| = 40$ can be broken down into two cases:

Case 1: If $x \geq 2y$ and $2y \geq x$, then $x-2y + 2y-x = 40$, which simplifies to $0=40$, which is a contradiction.

Case 2: If $x < 2y$ and $2y < x$, then $-(x-2y) - (2y-x) = 40$, which simplifies to $-2(x-2y) = 40$, and further simplifies to $x-2y = -20$.

So we have the equation $x-2y = -20$. Solving for $y$ gives $y = \frac{x+20}{2}$.

Substituting $y = \frac{x+20}{2}$ into the expression $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ gives
\begin{align*}
5x^2 + 5\left(\frac{x+20}{2}\right)^2 - 8x\left(\frac{x+20}{2}\right) &= 5x^2 + 5\left(\frac{x^2+40x+400}{4}\right) - 4x(x+20) \\
&= 5x^2 + \frac{5x^2 + 200x + 1000}{4} - 4x^2 - 80x \\
&= \frac{5x^2 + 5x^2 + 200x + 1000 - 16x^2 - 320x}{4} \\
&= \frac{-6x^2 - 120x + 1000}{4} \\
&= -\frac{3}{2}x^2 - 30x + 250.
\end{align*}

To find the minimum value of $-\frac{3}{2}x^2 - 30x + 250$, we can complete the square:
\begin{align*}
-\frac{3}{2}x^2 - 30x + 250 &= -\frac{3}{2}(x^2 + \frac{20}{3}x) + 250 \\
&= -\frac{3}{2}\left(x^2 + \frac{20}{3}x + \left(\frac{10}{3}\right)^2 - \left(\frac{10}{3}\right)^2\right) + 250 \\
&= -\frac{3}{2}\left(\left(x + \frac{10}{3}\right)^2 - \left(\frac{10}{3}\right)^2\right) + 250 \\
&= -\frac{3}{2}\left(x + \frac{10}{3}\right)^2 + \frac{3}{2}\left(\frac{10}{3}\right)^2 + 250 \\
&= -\frac{3}{2}\left(x + \frac{10}{3}\right)^2 + \frac{100}{3} + 250 \\
&= -\frac{3}{2}\left(x + \frac{10}{3}\right)^2 + \frac{750}{3}.
\end{align*}

Since $-\frac{3}{2}\left(x + \frac{10}{3}\right)^2$ is always non-positive, the minimum value of $-\frac{3}{2}x^2 - 30x + 250$ is achieved when $-\frac{3}{2}\left(x + \frac{10}{3}\right)^2 = 0$, or $x = -\frac{10}{3}$. Substituting $x = -\frac{10}{3}$ into the equation $y = \frac{x+20}{2}$ gives $y = \frac{-\frac{10}{3}+20}{2} = \frac{40}{3}$.

So the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ subject to the condition $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$ is
\begin{align*}
-\frac{3}{2}\left(-\frac{10}{3}\right)^2 - 30\left(-\frac{10}{3}\right) + 250 &= -\frac{3}{2}\cdot\frac{100}{9} + \frac{300}{3} + 250 \\
&= -\frac{150}{9} + 100 + 250 \\
&= -\frac{50}{3} + 350 \\
&= \frac{1000}{3}.
\end{align*}

So the minimum value is $\frac{1000}{3}$.
The answer is: $0$
