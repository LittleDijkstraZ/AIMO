Solve the following problem with a Python Script (positive numerical answer):
"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"
Write comments to indicate the steps you take. Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Approach:

 The product of two numbers is zero if and only if at least one of the numbers is zero. Therefore, we have two cases to consider: 
1) $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$, or
2) $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$.

Case 1: $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$. This happens if and only if $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. This describes a square with side length 20, so its area is $20^2 = 400$.

Case 2: $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$. This happens if and only if $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$, which describes a square with side length 16, so its area is $16^2 = 256$.

The convex polygon is the intersection of the squares from the two cases. Since the squares overlap, the area of the convex polygon is the sum of the areas of the two squares minus the area of their intersection. The intersection is a square with side length 8 (the smaller of the two squares), so its area is $8^2 = 64$.

Therefore, the area of the convex polygon is $400 + 256 - 64 = 592$. The answer is: $592$

Solve the following problem with a Python Script (positive numerical answer):
"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"

Approach:

 The product of two terms is zero if and only if at least one of the terms is zero. So the equation $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ is satisfied when either $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$.

1. For the first term to be zero, we need both $\vert x + y \vert - 10 = 0$ and $\vert x - y \vert - 10 = 0$, which implies $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. The solutions to these equations are the lines $x + y = 10$ and $x - y = 10$, as well as the lines $x + y = -10$ and $x - y = -10$. These lines form a square with side length 10. The area of this square is $10^2 = 100$.

2. For the second term to be zero, we need both $\vert x \vert - 8 = 0$ and $\vert y \vert - 8 = 0$, which implies $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$. The solutions to these equations are the lines $x = 8$ and $x = -8$, as well as the lines $y = 8$ and $y = -8$. These lines form a square with side length 16. The area of this square is $16^2 = 256$.

However, the first case corresponds to a square with side length 10, while the second case corresponds to a square with side length 16. The area of the convex polygon formed by the points satisfying the original equation is the area of the smaller square, which is 100. The answer is: $100$

Approach:



The equation given is a product of two terms being equal to zero, so either the first term or the second term has to be zero. This breaks down the problem into two separate cases:

1. $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ or $\vert x + y \vert = 10$. This is a square with side length 20 units, so its area is $20^2 = 400$ square units.
2. $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ or $\vert x \vert = 8$. This is a square with side length 16 units, so its area is $16^2 = 256$ square units.

However, the intersection of the two cases is a square with side length 8 units (the intersection of $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x \vert = 8$), so its area is $8^2 = 64$ square units.

To find the area of the convex polygon, we need to subtract the area of the intersection from the sum of the areas of the two squares.

Solution:

Area of the convex polygon = Area of square 1 + Area of square 2 - Area of intersection

Area of convex polygon = $400 + 256 - 64 = 592$ square units. The answer is: $592$

Solve the following problem with a Python Script (positive numerical answer):
"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"

Assistant:

Approach:

 The equation given in the problem, $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$, implies that either of the two factors in the product must be equal to zero. Therefore, either $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$.

The first factor equals zero when $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. This results in a square with side length 10 units, with vertices at $(5,5), (5,-5), (-5,-5), (-5,5)$.

The second factor equals zero when $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$. This results in a square with side length 16 units, with vertices at $(8,8), (8,-8), (-8,-8), (-8,8)$.

The area of the convex polygon formed by the intersection of these two squares is equal to the area of the smaller square, which can be calculated as $10 \times 10 = 100$ square units. Therefore, the area of the convex polygon is 100 square units.

The answer is: $100$

Solve the following problem with a Python Script (positive numerical answer):
"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"

Approach:

 The given equation is a product of two expressions equal to zero. So either $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$.

1. If $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$, then $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. This implies that $x + y = \pm 10$ and $x - y = \pm 10$. Solving these four equations, we get the vertices of the polygon as $(0, 10), (0, -10), (10, 0)$ and $(-10, 0)$.

2. If $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$, then $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$. This implies that $x = \pm 8$ and $y = \pm 8$. Solving these four equations, we get the vertices of the polygon as $(8, 0), (-8, 0), (0, 8)$ and $(0, -8)$.

So, the vertices of the polygon are $(0, 10), (0, -10), (10, 0), (-10, 0), (8, 0), (-8, 0), (0, 8)$ and $(0, -8)$.

The polygon is a square with side length 10. The area of a square with side length $a$ is $a^2$. So the area of the polygon is $10^2 = 100$. The answer is: $100$

Approach:



The equation $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + (\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + (\vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ is satisfied if and only if at least one of the factors is zero. Therefore, we have three cases to consider:

1. $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$, which implies $\vert x + y \vert = 10$, or $x + y = 10$ or $x + y = -10$.
2. $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$, which implies $\vert x - y \vert = 10$, or $x - y = 10$ or $x - y = -10$.
3. $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$, which implies $\vert x \vert = 8$, or $x = 8$ or $x = -8$.
4. $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$, which implies $\vert y \vert = 8$, or $y = 8$ or $y = -8$.

Plotting these lines on a graph, we find that the points that satisfy all of these conditions are the vertices of a square with side length 16. To find the area of this square, we simply square the length of one of its sides, so the area is $16^2 = 256$.

So the area of the convex polygon is $\boxed{256}$.
The answer is: $256$

 The equation given is a product of two terms equal to zero, which implies that either one of the terms is zero or both are zero. This gives us two cases to consider:

1. $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$. This implies that $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ or $\vert x - y \vert = 10$.
2. $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$. This implies that $\vert x \vert = 8$ or $\vert y \vert = 8$.

Solving these cases, we find that the points that satisfy the equation lie on the lines $x + y = \pm10$, $x - y = \pm10$, $x = \pm8$, and $y = \pm8$. These lines form a square with side length 16. The area of this square is $16^2 = 256$.
The answer is: 256

Approach:


The equation $AB = 0$ is equivalent to either $A = 0$ or $B = 0$. Therefore, the given equation is satisfied if either $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$.
The first equation implies $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$, which are equivalent to $x + y = \pm 10$ and $x - y = \pm 10$. These four lines form a square with side length 10$\sqrt{2}$. The area of this square is $(10\sqrt{2})^2 = 200$.
The second equation implies $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$, which are equivalent to $x = \pm 8$ and $y = \pm 8$. These four lines form a square with side length 16. The area of this square is $(16)^2 = 256$.
Therefore, the area of the convex polygon is the sum of the areas of the two squares, which is $200 + 256 = 456$.
The answer is: $456$

The equation $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + (\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ implies that $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. This is only possible if both $x+y = \pm 10$ and $x-y = \pm 10$ which implies that either $x = 10$ and $y = 0$ or $x = -10$ and $y = 0$. This gives us two lines $x = 10$ and $x = -10$ on the $x-y$ plane.

Similarly, the equation $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + (\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ implies that $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$ which means either $x = \pm 8$ or $y = \pm 8$. This gives us four lines $x = 8$, $x = -8$, $y = 8$, and $y = -8$ on the $x-y$ plane.

These eight lines enclose a rectangle with length $20$ and width $16$. The area of the rectangle is $20 \times 16 = 320$. Therefore, the area of the convex polygon is $320$.

The python code to calculate the area is as follows:
```python


INTERMEDIATE OUT :

def polygon_area():
    length = 20
    width = 16
    area = length * width
    return area

result = polygon_area()
print(result)
```

CODE RESULTS 320

INTERMEDIATE OUT :
```output
320
```
The area of the convex polygon is $320$. The answer is: $320$

Approach:


The expression $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ is equivalent to either of the two factors being zero. This gives us two sets of conditions:
1. $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ and $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$.
2. $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ and $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$.
In the first case, both $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2$ and $( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2$ must be zero. This implies that $|x + y| = 10$ and $|x - y| = 10$. The only way this can happen is if $x = 0$ and $y = 10$, or $x = 10$ and $y = 0$.
In the second case, both $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2$ and $( \vert y \vert - 8)^2$ must be zero. This implies that $|x| = 8$ and $|y| = 8$. The only way this can happen is if $x = 8$ and $y = 8$, or $x = -8$ and $y = -8$.
The points $\left(x, y\right)$ that satisfy either of these conditions form a square with side length 10.
To find the area of this square, we can use the formula $A = s^2$, where $s$ is the side length. So, $A = 10^2 = 100$.
The answer is: $100$.
