Solve the following problem with a Python Script (positive numerical answer):
"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"
Write comments to indicate the steps you take. Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Approach:


The equation is equal to zero if either of the factors is zero. So we have two cases to consider:
1. $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$
2. $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$

Case 1: $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$
This implies that $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. The solutions to these absolute value equations are lines, forming a square with side length 20.

Case 2: $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$
This implies that $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$. The solutions to these absolute value equations are circles with radius 8.

The intersection of the two cases is the square formed by the intersection of the lines $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$ with the circles $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$. The side length of the square is 20 and the radius of the circles is 8. The square is entirely contained within the circles, so the area of the convex polygon is the area of the square.

The area of a square with side length 20 is $20^2 = 400$.

So, the area of the convex polygon is 400.
The answer is: $400$.

Solve the following problem with a Python Script (positive numerical answer):
"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"

Approach:

 The given equation is a product of two terms equal to zero, which implies that each term must be zero independently. This gives us four equations:

1. $\vert x + y \vert - 10 = 0 \Rightarrow \vert x + y \vert = 10$.
2. $\vert x - y \vert - 10 = 0 \Rightarrow \vert x - y \vert = 10$.
3. $\vert x \vert - 8 = 0 \Rightarrow \vert x \vert = 8$.
4. $\vert y \vert - 8 = 0 \Rightarrow \vert y \vert = 8$.

From equations 3 and 4, we get $x = \pm 8$ and $y = \pm 8$.

Now, consider equation 1: $\vert x + y \vert = 10$. If $x = 8$ and $y = 8$, then $\vert x + y \vert = \vert 16 \vert = 16$, which is not equal to 10. Therefore, the solution $(x = 8, y = 8)$ does not satisfy the equation. Similarly, we can show that $(x = -8, y = -8)$ does not satisfy the equation.

Now, let's consider equation 1 with $x = 8$ and $y = -8$: $\vert x + y \vert = \vert 8 - 8 \vert = 0$, which is not equal to 10. So, $(x = 8, y = -8)$ does not satisfy the equation either.

However, if $x = -8$ and $y = 8$, then $\vert x + y \vert = \vert -8 + 8 \vert = 0$, which is equal to 10. This satisfies equation 1. Similarly, we can show that $(x = -8, y = -8)$ satisfies equation 2.

Therefore, the four vertices of the polygon are $(-8, 8)$, $(-8, -8)$, $(8, -8)$, and $(8, 8)$. This forms a square with side length 16 (since the distance between any two opposite corners of a square with side length $a$ is $\sqrt{a^2 + a^2} = a\sqrt{2}$, and in this case, $a = 8$). The area of a square is given by side length squared, so the area of the polygon is $16^2 = 256$.
The answer is: $256$

Approach:


This problem can be solved by analyzing the equations involved and understanding the properties of absolute value and square functions. The equation given is a product of two terms, and the product equals zero if at least one of the terms is zero. Therefore, we can break down the problem into two separate cases based on each term being zero.

Case 1: $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$
This implies that $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ or $\vert x - y \vert = 10$.
The solutions to these absolute value equations are the lines $x + y = 10$, $x + y = -10$, $x - y = 10$, and $x - y = -10$. These lines form a rectangle with vertices at (10, 0), (-10, 0), (0, 10), and (0, -10).

Case 2: $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$
This implies that $\vert x \vert = 8$ or $\vert y \vert = 8$.
The solutions to these absolute value equations are the lines $x = 8$, $x = -8$, $y = 8$, and $y = -8$. These lines also form a rectangle with vertices at (8, 0), (-8, 0), (0, 8), and (0, -8).

The intersection of the solutions to both cases is the rectangle with vertices at (8, 0), (-8, 0), (0, 8), and (0, -8). The area of this rectangle can be calculated as the product of its side lengths, which are both 16. So, the area of the convex polygon is $16 \times 16 = 256$.
The answer is $\boxed{256}$.

Solve the following problem with a Python Script (positive numerical answer):
"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"

Approach:

 The equation $AB = 0$ implies that either $A = 0$ or $B = 0$. Thus, the given equation is satisfied if either of the following two equations is satisfied:

1. $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + (\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$.
2. $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + (\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$.

For equation 1 to be satisfied, we need both $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. This implies that $x = 0$ and $y = \pm 10$ or $x = \pm 10$ and $y = 0$. Thus, the points are $(0,10)$, $(0,-10)$, $(10,0)$, and $(-10,0)$.

For equation 2 to be satisfied, we need both $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$. This implies that $x = \pm 8$ and $y = \pm 8$. Thus, the points are $(8,8)$, $(8,-8)$, $(-8,8)$, and $(-8,-8)$.

The points form a rectangle with side lengths $20$ and $16$. Therefore, the area of the rectangle is $20 \times 16 = 320$. So, the area of the convex polygon is $\boxed{320}$.
The answer is: $\boxed{320}$

Solve the following problem with a Python Script (positive numerical answer):
"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"

Approach:


The equation given in the problem is $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$.
This equation is equal to zero if either $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$.
If $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$, then $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. This means that $x + y = \pm 10$ and $x - y = \pm 10$. Solving these equations, we get four lines: $x + y = 10$, $x + y = -10$, $x - y = 10$, and $x - y = -10$.
If $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$, then $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$. This means that $x = \pm 8$ and $y = \pm 8$. This gives us four more lines: $x = 8$, $x = -8$, $y = 8$, and $y = -8$.
The intersection of these eight lines form a square with side length 16. The area of the square is $16^2 = 256$. So, the area of the convex polygon is 256.
The answer is: $256$

Solve the following problem with a Python Script (positive numerical answer):
"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"
Write comments to indicate the steps you take. Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Assistant:

Approach:



The equation given in the problem is $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$. This equation will be equal to zero if and only if either $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$.

For the first case, $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$, it is clear that $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. These two equations describe a square with side length 10. The vertices of the square are $(5, 5), (5, -5), (-5, 5),$ and $(-5, -5)$.

For the second case, $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$, it is clear that $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$. These two equations describe a square with side length 16. The vertices of the square are $(8, 8), (8, -8), (-8, 8),$ and $(-8, -8)$.

The intersection of these two squares is the convex polygon formed by the vertices $(5, 5), (5, -5), (-5, 5),$ and $(-5, -5)$.

The area of a square with side length $a$ is $a^2$. Therefore, the area of the convex polygon is the area of the smaller square, which has side length 10. Thus, the area of the convex polygon is $10^2 = 100$.
The answer is: $\boxed{100}$

Solve the following problem with a Python Script (positive numerical answer):
"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"
Write comments to indicate the steps you take. Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Approach:



The expression $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ is equal to zero if and only if either of the two expressions inside the product is equal to zero. 

This gives us two systems of equations to solve:

1. $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ and $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$
2. $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ and $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$

For the first system, $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ implies $\vert x + y \vert = 10$, and $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ implies $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$. Solving these equations, we find that the only possible solutions are $(x, y) = (8, 2)$ and $(x, y) = (-8, -2)$.

For the second system, $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ implies $\vert x - y \vert = 10$, and $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ implies $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$. Solving these equations, we find that the only possible solutions are $(x, y) = (8, -2)$ and $(x, y) = (-8, 2)$.

So the four vertices of the polygon are $(8, 2)$, $(-8, -2)$, $(8, -2)$, and $(-8, 2)$. These points form a square with side length $16$. The area of this square is $16^2 = 256$.

So the area of the convex polygon is $256$. The answer is: $256$
