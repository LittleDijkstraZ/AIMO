Approach:

 We need to find the number of values of $m$ for which the equation $| |x - 1| - 2| = \frac{m}{100}$ has 4 distinct solutions. We know that this equation will have 4 distinct solutions when the right side, $\frac{m}{100}$, is between 0 and 2. Therefore, we have $0 < \frac{m}{100} < 2$, which simplifies to $0 < m < 200$. The positive integers $m$ that satisfy this inequality are the integers from 1 to 199. However, we need to determine for how many of these values of $m$ the equation $| |x - 1| - 2| = \frac{m}{100}$ has exactly 4 distinct solutions. To do this, we need to analyze the behavior of the equation.

For $| |x - 1| - 2| = \frac{m}{100}$, the left side of the equation has a "V" shape if $|x - 1|$ is on the x-axis and a "$\cup$" shape if $y$ is on the y-axis. The equation will have 4 distinct solutions when the horizontal line $y = \frac{m}{100}$ intersects the "V" shape twice and the "$\cup$" shape twice. This occurs when $0 < \frac{m}{100} < 2$. Therefore, we need to count the number of positive integers $m$ such that $0 < m < 200$.

Solution: The number of positive integers $m$ such that $0 < m < 200$ is simply the number of integers from 1 to 199. To find this, we subtract the smallest integer from the largest and then add 1: $199 - 1 + 1 = 199$. Therefore, there are 199 positive integers $m$ for which the equation $| |x - 1| - 2| = \frac{m}{100}$ has 4 distinct solutions. However, we are asked to find the number of positive integers $m$ for which the equation has exactly 4 distinct solutions. Since we have shown that all positive integers $m$ in the range $0 < m < 200$ will produce 4 distinct solutions, there are 199 positive integers $m$ for which the equation has exactly 4 distinct solutions. The answer is: $199$

In this problem, we need to find the number of positive integers $m$ such that the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has exactly four distinct solutions.

First, we need to understand the graph of the function $y=\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert$. This function has a V-shape with a bottom part and a top part. The bottom part is the graph of $y=\vert x-1 \vert -2$, and the top part is the graph of $y=-\vert x-1 \vert +2$. The two parts meet at the points where $\vert x-1 \vert =2$, which are $x=3$ and $x=-1$. So the graph is defined on the intervals $x<-1$, $-1\leq x\leq 3$, and $x>3$.

For $m/100<2$, the equation has no solution because the right side of the equation is too small to intersect the graph.
For $m/100=2$, the equation has two solutions because the right side of the equation just touches the graph at the bottom.
For $2<m/100<4$, the equation has four solutions because the right side of the equation intersects the graph at the bottom and the top.
For $m/100=4$, the equation has two solutions because the right side of the equation just touches the graph at the top.
For $m/100>4$, the equation has no solution because the right side of the equation is too large to intersect the graph.

So the equation has four distinct solutions when $m/100=2$ or $2<m/100<4$. This means $m$ is an integer between $200$ and $400$, inclusive.

The number of such integers is $200$. So the number of positive integers $m$ for which the equation has four distinct solutions is 200.

So the solution is $\boxed{200}$.
The answer is: $200$

We will first understand the properties of the function $f(x) = ||x-1|-2|$. Then we will find for how many values of $m$ the equation $f(x) = \frac{m}{100}$ has exactly 4 distinct solutions.

The function $f(x) = ||x-1|-2|$ has a graph which looks like a "V" with the vertex at $x=1$. The function oscillates between the values of $0$ and $4$. The function is equal to $0$ when $|x-1|=2$, which gives us $x=3$ or $x=-1$. It is equal to $2$ when $|x-1|=0$, which gives us $x=1$. It is equal to $4$ when $|x-1|=6$, which has no solutions for $x$.

Thus, the graph of $f(x)$ is a "V" shape from $(âˆ’1, 0)$ to $(1, 2)$ and then from $(3, 0)$ to $(5, 4)$. The equation $f(x) = \frac{m}{100}$ will have 4 distinct solutions when $0 < \frac{m}{100} < 2$. This gives us $0 < m < 200$. The number of positive integer values of $m$ in this range is $199$.

Therefore, the number of positive integer values of $m$ for which the equation $||x-1|-2| = \frac{m}{100}$ has four distinct solutions is $199$. The answer is: $\boxed{199}$

Approach:


The equation \[\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}\] is a piecewise function that depends on the value of \[\vert x-1 \vert -2.\]
For each value of $m$, we can graph the equation and count the number of distinct solutions.
By doing this for various values of $m$, we can find the number of values of $m$ for which the equation has $4$ distinct solutions.

Solution:
After graphing the equation for various values of $m$, we find that the equation has $4$ distinct solutions when $m = 200$.

Therefore, the only positive integer $m$ for which the equation has $4$ distinct solutions is $m = 200$. The answer is: $1$

Approach:

 To find the number of positive integers $m$ such that the equation $||x-1|-2|=\frac{m}{100}$ has four distinct solutions, we can analyze the behavior of the function $||x-1|-2|$. This function is piecewise-linear, and it has four different linear segments depending on the value of $x$. We can find the $x$-coordinates of the transitions between these segments by setting the expressions inside the absolute value equal to zero.

Solution:

First, let's find the $x$-coordinates of the transitions between the segments of the function $||x-1|-2|$.

1. Set $x-1=0$, we get $x=1$.
2. Set $|x-1|-2=0$, we get $|x-1|=2$, which implies $x-1=2$ or $x-1=-2$. Solving these two equations, we get $x=3$ or $x=-1$.

Thus, the function $||x-1|-2|$ has three transitions at $x=-1$, $x=1$, and $x=3$. This function consists of four segments:

1. For $x<-1$, the function is $|-(x-1)-2|=|-x-1-2|=|-x-3| = x+3+2 = x+5$.
2. For $-1\leq x<1$, the function is $|x-1-2|=|x-3|=3-x$ if $x-3\geq0$ (i.e., $x\geq3$), and is $x-3$ if $x-3<0$ (i.e., $x<3$). Since $-1\leq x<1$ does not overlap with $x\geq3$, we only consider $x-3$ for this segment. So the function is $3-x$ for $-1\leq x<1$, and $x-3$ for $1\leq x<3$.
3. For $1\leq x<3$, the function is $|-(x-1)-2|=|-x+1-2|=|-x-1|=x+1-2=x-1$.
4. For $x\geq3$, the function is $|x-1-2|=|x-3|=x-3+2=x-1$.

Now, let's consider the equation $||x-1|-2|=\frac{m}{100}$. For this equation to have four distinct solutions, the value $\frac{m}{100}$ must be equal to the difference of the endpoints of the second segment (i.e., $3-1=2$) and the difference of the endpoints of the third segment (i.e., $1-(-1)=2$). This is because each of these differences corresponds to a segment of the piecewise function where there is a transition from a decreasing segment to an increasing segment or vice versa.

Therefore, we have $\frac{m}{100}=2$. Solving for $m$, we get $m=200$.

However, we need to check if this value of $m$ indeed gives four distinct solutions to the equation. Substituting $m=200$ into the equation, we get $||x-1|-2|=\frac{200}{100}=2$. This equation has four distinct solutions: $x=5$, $x=3$, $x=-1$, and $x=1$.

Thus, the number of positive integers $m$ such that the equation $||x-1|-2|=\frac{m}{100}$ has four distinct solutions is 1, and the answer is $m=200$. The answer is: $200$

Assistant:

Approach:


The absolute value equation \[\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}\] has four distinct solutions when the right-hand side is a number between $1$ and $2$ (inclusive). This is because the function $f(x) = \vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert$ has a maximum value of $2$ and a minimum value of $0$, and it reaches these values exactly once. So for the equation to have four distinct solutions, the right-hand side must be in the range $(1, 2]$. Therefore, we have $1 \leq \frac{m}{100} \leq 2$, which simplifies to $100 \leq m \leq 200$. The possible integer values of $m$ are then the integers from $100$ to $200$, inclusive.

To count the number of these integers, we subtract the smallest integer from the largest and then add $1$. So the number of integers $m$ is $200 - 100 + 1 = 101$.

Therefore, there are $101$ positive integers $m$ for which the equation has four distinct solutions. The answer is: $\boxed{101}$

Assistant:

Approach:



1. Firstly, let's rewrite the equation in a simpler form. Since $|a|=b$ is equivalent to $a=b$ or $a=-b$, we can expand the absolute value on the left side of the equation:

\[\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}\]
\[\Rightarrow \vert x-1 \vert -2 = \pm \frac{m}{100}\]
\[\Rightarrow \vert x-1 \vert = 2 \pm \frac{m}{100}\]

2. Now we have two separate absolute value equations to solve:

\[\vert x-1 \vert = 2 + \frac{m}{100} \tag{1}\]
\[\vert x-1 \vert = 2 - \frac{m}{100} \tag{2}\]

3. For equation (1), we have two possibilities:

\[x-1 = 2 + \frac{m}{100} \Rightarrow x = 3 + \frac{m}{100}\]
\[x-1 = -(2 + \frac{m}{100}) \Rightarrow x = -1 - \frac{m}{100}\]

4. For equation (2), we also have two possibilities:

\[x-1 = 2 - \frac{m}{100} \Rightarrow x = 3 - \frac{m}{100}\]
\[x-1 = -(2 - \frac{m}{100}) \Rightarrow x = -1 + \frac{m}{100}\]

5. We have a total of four possible solutions. The solutions are distinct if the four values of $x$ are different. This is only possible if $\frac{m}{100}$ is less than $2$, because otherwise some of the solutions would be the same. So we must have $m < 200$.

6. Now we need to check when the four solutions are distinct. For equation (1), the solutions are distinct if $-1 - \frac{m}{100} \neq 3 + \frac{m}{100}$ and $-1 - \frac{m}{100} \neq 3 - \frac{m}{100}$. This gives us $-4 \neq 2\frac{m}{100}$ and $-4 \neq -2\frac{m}{100}$, which both hold true. Similarly, for equation (2), the solutions are distinct if $-1 + \frac{m}{100} \neq 3 + \frac{m}{100}$ and $-1 + \frac{m}{100} \neq 3 - \frac{m}{100}$. This gives us $-4 \neq 4\frac{m}{100}$ and $-4 \neq -2\frac{m}{100}$, which both hold true.

7. Therefore, for all $m$ such that $0 < m < 200$, the four solutions are distinct.

8. To find the number of such $m$, we count the number of positive integers in the open interval $(0, 200)$. This is equal to $199$.

So the number of positive integers $m$ for which the equation has 4 distinct solutions is 199. The answer is: $199$.

The number of solutions to the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ is $4$ if and only if the value of $\frac{m}{100}$ is strictly between $1$ and $3$. This is because the function $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert$ has $4$ distinct solutions if and only if its absolute value is strictly between $1$ and $3$. 

We need to find the number of positive integers $m$ such that $1<\frac{m}{100}<3$. Multiplying all parts of the inequality by $100$, we get $100<m<300$. The number of integers in this range is $300-100-1=199$. But we need to exclude the endpoints $m=100$ and $m=300$ because these would make the absolute value equal to $1$ or $3$ respectively. So the number of integers $m$ that satisfy the condition is $199-2=197$.

Therefore, the number of positive integers $m$ such that the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has $4$ distinct solutions is $197$.
The answer is: $197$

We know that the equation $| |x - 1| - 2| = \frac{m}{100}$ has 4 distinct solutions. The expression $|x - 1| - 2 = y$ or $|x - 1| - 2 = -y$ for $y = \frac{m}{100}$, will give us the 4 distinct solutions. 

We solve for $x$ in the equation $|x - 1| - 2 = y$. This gives us the equation $|x - 1| = y + 2$.

For $x - 1 \geq 0$, this gives us the equation $x - 1 = y + 2$ or $x = y + 3$.

For $x - 1 < 0$, this gives us the equation $-(x - 1) = y + 2$ or $x = 1 - y - 2 = -y - 1$.

Thus, we have the solutions $x = y + 3$ and $x = -y - 1$.

Substituting $y = \frac{m}{100}$, we get the solutions $x = \frac{m}{100} + 3$ and $x = -\frac{m}{100} - 1$.

For the equation $| |x - 1| - 2| = -y = -\frac{m}{100}$, we get the solutions $x = \frac{m}{100} - 3$ and $x = -\frac{m}{100} + 1$.

Thus, the 4 distinct solutions are $\frac{m}{100} + 3$, $-\frac{m}{100} - 1$, $\frac{m}{100} - 3$, and $-\frac{m}{100} + 1$.

We want these solutions to be positive, so we require $\frac{m}{100} + 3 > 0$ and $-\frac{m}{100} - 1 > 0$.

This gives us the range of $m$ as $-300 < m < 300$.

However, $m$ must be positive, so we only consider $0 < m < 300$.

To count the number of positive integers $m$ such that the equation has 4 distinct solutions, we need to find how many positive integers $m$ satisfy the condition.

For $0 < m < 300$, we need to find the number of positive integers $m$ such that the sum of the absolute values of the differences between the roots is equal to 4.

The sum of the absolute values of the differences between the roots is given by $\left(\frac{m}{100} + 3 - \left(-\frac{m}{100} - 1\right)\right) + \left(\frac{m}{100} + 3 - \left(-\frac{m}{100} + 1\right)\right) + \left(-\frac{m}{100} - 1 - \left(-\frac{m}{100} + 1\right)\right) = 4$.

Solving this equation gives $\frac{2m}{100} + 4 = 4$, which simplifies to $\frac{m}{50} = 0$. This has no solution for $m$, so we must have made a mistake.

Let's go back and check our work. We found the solutions $x = \frac{m}{100} + 3$, $-\frac{m}{100} - 1$, $\frac{m}{100} - 3$, and $-\frac{m}{100} + 1$.

The sum of the absolute values of the differences between the roots is given by $\left|\frac{m}{100} + 3 - \left(-\frac{m}{100} - 1\right)\right| + \left|\frac{m}{100} + 3 - \left(-\frac{m}{100} + 1\right)\right| + \left|-\frac{m}{100} - 1 - \left(-\frac{m}{100} + 1\right)\right| = 4$.

Solving this equation gives $\left|\frac{2m}{100} + 4\right| + \left|\frac{2m}{100}\right| + |-2| = 4$. This simplifies to $\frac{2m}{50} + 4 + \frac{2m}{50} + 2 = 4$. This further simplifies to $\frac{4m}{50} + 6 = 4$. Solving this equation gives $\frac{4m}{50} = -2$, which simplifies to $m = -25$.

This is a contradiction since $m$ must be positive. So, we must have made a mistake somewhere.

Let's go back and check our work. We found the solutions $x = \frac{m}{100} + 3$, $-\frac{m}{100} - 1$, $\frac{m}{100} - 3$, and $-\frac{m}{100} + 1$.

The sum of the absolute values of the differences between the roots is given by $\left|\frac{m}{100} + 3 - \left(-\frac{m}{100} - 1\right)\right| + \left|\frac{m}{100} + 3 - \left(-\frac{m}{100} + 1\right)\right| + \left|-\frac{m}{100} - 1 - \left(-\frac{m}{100} + 1\right)\right| = 4$.

Solving this equation gives $\left|\frac{2m}{100} + 4\right| + \left|\frac{2m}{100}\right| + |-2| = 4$. This simplifies to $\frac{2m}{50} + 4 + \frac{2m}{50} + 2 = 4$. This further simplifies to $\frac{4m}{50} + 6 = 4$. Solving this equation gives $\frac{4m}{50} = -2$, which simplifies to $m = -25$.

This is a contradiction since $m$ must be positive. So, we must have made a mistake somewhere.

After checking our work again, we realize that we made a mistake in our calculation of the sum of the absolute values of the differences between the roots.

The correct calculation should be as follows:

The sum of the absolute values of the differences between the roots is given by $\left|\frac{m}{100} + 3 - \left(-\frac{m}{100} - 1\right)\right| + \left|\frac{m}{100} + 3 - \left(-\frac{m}{100} + 1\right)\

This problem is about finding the number of positive integers $m$ for which the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has exactly four distinct solutions.

The right-hand side $\frac{m}{100}$ must be positive, so $m$ must be a positive integer. The number of solutions to the equation depends on the value of $\frac{m}{100}$.

We consider the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$:

If $\frac{m}{100} < 2$, then the equation has two solutions.
If $\frac{m}{100} = 2$, then the equation has three solutions.
If $\frac{m}{100} > 2$, then the equation has four solutions.

So we want to find the number of positive integers $m$ such that $\frac{m}{100} = 2$, which means $m = 200$.

To find the number of values of $m$ for which the equation has four solutions, we must find the number of positive integers $m$ such that $\frac{m}{100} > 2$, which means $m > 200$.

Since $m$ is a positive integer, the only positive integer $m$ that satisfies $m > 200$ is $m = 201$.

So the only positive integer $m$ for which the equation has four solutions is $m = 201$. Therefore, the number of such positive integers $m$ is 1. The answer is: $1$

Approach:


We first simplify the equation \[\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}\]
\[\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}\]
We know that the number of distinct solutions of this equation is 4,
which means the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ will have 4 distinct solutions when $\frac{m}{100}$ is in the range $(0,2)$.
Therefore, we have $0 < \frac{m}{100} < 2$,
which gives us $0 < m < 200$.
So, the positive integer $m$ must be in the set $\{1,2,...,199\}$.
But we only want the values of $m$ that make the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ have exactly 4 distinct solutions.
We can start by testing the values of $m$ in the set $\{1,2,...,199\}$ and see how many of them make the equation have 4 distinct solutions.
After testing, we find that the values of $m$ that work are $1, 2, ..., 198$.
Therefore, the number of positive integers $m$ that satisfy the condition is the number of elements in the set $\{1,2,...,198\}$, which is $198$.
So the answer is $198$. The answer is: $198$.

Approach:

 The equation $| |x-1| - 2| = \frac{m}{100}$ has 4 distinct solutions if and only if $\frac{m}{100}$ is strictly between 0 and 2, inclusive. This is because $| |x-1| - 2|$ is at most 2, so $\frac{m}{100}$ must be less than or equal to 2, and it must be strictly greater than 0.

Therefore, we want to find the number of positive integers $m$ such that $0 < \frac{m}{100} \le 2$. Multiplying all sides of the inequalities by 100 gives $0 < m \le 200$. The positive integers $m$ satisfying this condition are 1 through 200, inclusive, of which there are 200. Therefore, there are 200 positive integers $m$ for which the equation has 4 distinct solutions. The answer is: $200$

Approach:


To solve this problem, we need to understand the graph of the function $f(x) = | |x-1| -2|$. The graph of this function is a V-shaped pattern that repeats every 1 unit on the x-axis. The "valleys" of this graph are the solutions to the equation $| |x-1| -2| = k$ for some constant $k$. For each "valley", the graph dips down to a depth of $k$ before climbing back up.

In this case, we want the equation $| |x-1| -2| = \frac{m}{100}$ to have 4 distinct solutions. This means we want the depth of the "valleys" in the graph of $f(x)$ to be $\frac{m}{100}$, and there to be exactly 2 "valleys" (since the graph repeats every 1 unit).

For each "valley", the depth is equal to the distance between the tops of the two "hills" that form the "valley". Each "hill" is a graph of $|x-1|$, which is a V-shaped pattern that repeats every 1 unit on the x-axis. The tops of these "hills" are at a height of 2. Therefore, the depth of each "valley" is 2 - $\frac{m}{100}$.

For the equation to have 4 distinct solutions, we need there to be exactly 2 "valleys" of depth $\frac{m}{100}$. This means that the equation $2 - \frac{m}{100} = \frac{m}{100}$ must have exactly 2 solutions. Simplifying this equation gives $2 = \frac{2m}{100}$, or $m = 50$.

Therefore, there is only one positive integer $m$ (50) for which the equation $| |x-1| -2| = \frac{m}{100}$ has 4 distinct solutions.
The answer is: 1

"For how many positive integers $m$ does the equation \[\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}\] have $4$ distinct solutions?"

Assistant:

Approach:

 The equation $| |x - 1| - 2| = \frac{m}{100}$ has four distinct solutions if and only if $\frac{m}{100}$ is less than $2$ but greater than $0$. This is because the expression on the left side, $| |x - 1| - 2|$, oscillates between $0$ and $4$ as $x$ varies over the real numbers. It equals $0$ when $|x - 1| = 2$, which means $x = 3$ or $x = -1$. It equals $4$ when $|x - 1| = 6$, which has no real solutions. For values of $| |x - 1| - 2|$ between $0$ and $4$, it increases linearly as $\frac{m}{100}$ increases from $0$ to $2$. Thus, the equation has four distinct solutions when $\frac{m}{100}$ is between $0$ and $2$. This implies $0 < \frac{m}{100} < 2$, which simplifies to $0 < m < 200$. Since $m$ is an integer, the number of positive integer values of $m$ in this range is $199$.

Therefore, the number of positive integers $m$ such that the equation $| |x - 1| - 2| = \frac{m}{100}$ has four distinct solutions is 199.
The answer is: $199$.
