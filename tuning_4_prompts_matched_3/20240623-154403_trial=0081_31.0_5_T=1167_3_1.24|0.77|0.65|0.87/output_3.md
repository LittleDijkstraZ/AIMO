Solve the following problem with a Python Script (positive numerical answer):
"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"
Write comments to indicate the steps you take. Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Approach:



The given equation is a product of two terms equal to zero, so either one of the terms must be zero. This means that the points that satisfy the equation are those that make either one of the terms zero.

1. For the term $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + (\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$, both terms must be zero, which implies $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. This results in a square with side length 10, centered at the origin (0,0).

2. For the term $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + (\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$, both terms must be zero, which implies $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$. This results in a square with side length 16, centered at the origin (0,0).

The intersection of these two squares is the convex polygon we are looking for. The area of the convex polygon is the area of the smaller square, which has side length 10.

So, the area of the convex polygon is $10^2 = 100$.

The answer is: $100$

Approach:

 The equation $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + (\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ implies that $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$, which gives $x + y = \pm 10$ and $x - y = \pm 10$. These are the equations of four lines in the coordinate plane. Similarly, the equation $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + (\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ implies that $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$, which gives $x = \pm 8$ and $y = \pm 8$. These are the equations of four lines in the coordinate plane. The intersection of these lines form a square with side length 10 (since the distance between $x + y = \pm 10$ and $x - y = \pm 10$ is 10 when $x = 0$ or $y = 0$). Therefore, the area of the square is $10^2 = 100$.

So the area of the convex polygon is $100$.
The answer is: $100$

Approach:


The given equation is equal to zero if and only if both factors are equal to zero.
The equation $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + (\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ is satisfied only when $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$.
This means that the points $(x, y)$ must lie on the lines $x + y = \pm 10$ and $x - y = \pm 10$.
The equation $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + (\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ is satisfied only when $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$.
This means that the points $(x, y)$ must lie on the lines $x = \pm 8$ and $y = \pm 8$.
The intersections of these lines form a square with side length $20$.
The area of this square is $20^2 = 400$.

The answer is: $400$

Assistant:

Approach:


The given equation is a product of two expressions equal to zero. This means that either the first expression is zero or the second expression is zero. Let's analyze each case separately.

1. If $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$, then both $\vert x + y \vert - 10 = 0$ and $\vert x - y \vert - 10 = 0$. This implies that $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. Solving these absolute value equations gives us the lines $x + y = 10$, $x + y = -10$, $x - y = 10$, and $x - y = -10$. These lines form a square with side length 10. The area of this square is $10^2 = 100$.

2. If $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$, then both $\vert x \vert - 8 = 0$ and $\vert y \vert - 8 = 0$. This implies that $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$. Solving these absolute value equations gives us the lines $x = 8$, $x = -8$, $y = 8$, and $y = -8$. These lines form a square with side length 16. The area of this square is $16^2 = 256$.

Since the points that satisfy the original equation are the intersection points of the points that satisfy each of the two cases, the area of the convex polygon is the sum of the areas of the two squares. Therefore, the area of the convex polygon is $100 + 256 = 356$.
The answer is: $356$

"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"
Write comments to indicate the steps you take. Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Assistant:

Approach:


The equation is in the form of product of two expressions equals zero, i.e., $A \cdot B = 0$. This implies that either $A = 0$ or $B = 0$. Therefore, we have two sets of conditions to satisfy:

1. $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$
2. $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$

For the first set of conditions, we have:

1. $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$

This implies that $x + y = \pm 10$ and $x - y = \pm 10$. Solving these equations, we get the vertices of the polygon as $(0, 10), (0, -10), (10, 0)$ and $(-10, 0)$.

For the second set of conditions, we have:

2. $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$

This implies that $x = \pm 8$ and $y = \pm 8$. Solving these equations, we get the vertices of the polygon as $(8, 8), (8, -8), (-8, 8)$ and $(-8, -8)$.

Now, we can draw a square with vertices $(8, 8), (8, -8), (-8, 8)$ and $(-8, -8)$. The side length of the square is 16 units. The area of a square is given by side length squared, so the area of this square is $16^2 = 256$ square units.

Therefore, the area of the convex polygon is 256 square units.
The answer is: $256$

Solve the following problem with a Python Script (positive numerical answer):
"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"

Approach:

 The expression is equal to zero if and only if both of its factors are equal to zero. So, we need to solve the following two sets of equations:
1. $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ and $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$
2. $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ and $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$

From the first set of equations, we get $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x \vert = 8$. The solutions to these equations are:
1. $x + y = 10$ and $x = 8$
2. $x + y = -10$ and $x = -8$

From the second set of equations, we get $\vert x - y \vert = 10$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$. The solutions to these equations are:
3. $x - y = 10$ and $y = 8$
4. $x - y = -10$ and $y = -8$

Now we have the vertices of the polygon:
1. $(8, 0)$
2. $(-8, 0)$
3. $(0, 8)$
4. $(0, -8)$
5. $(8, 2)$
6. $(-8, -2)$
7. $(2, 8)$
8. $(-2, -8)$

To find the area of the polygon, we can divide it into four triangles. The area of a triangle with vertices $(x_1, y_1)$, $(x_2, y_2)$, and $(x_3, y_3)$ is given by:
\[Area = \frac{1}{2} \vert x_1(y_2 - y_3) + x_2(y_3 - y_1) + x_3(y_1 - y_2) \vert\]

The four triangles are:
1. Triangle with vertices $(8, 0)$, $(0, 8)$, and $(0, 0)$:
\[Area_1 = \frac{1}{2} \vert 8(8 - 0) + 0(0 - 8) + 0(0 - 0) \vert = 32\]

2. Triangle with vertices $(-8, 0)$, $(0, -8)$, and $(0, 0)$:
\[Area_2 = \frac{1}{2} \vert -8(0 - (-8)) + 0(-8 - 0) + 0(0 - 0) \vert = 32\]

3. Triangle with vertices $(8, 0)$, $(0, 8)$, and $(8, 2)$:
\[Area_3 = \frac{1}{2} \vert 8(2 - 8) + 0(8 - 0) + 8(0 - 0) \vert = 24\]

4. Triangle with vertices $(-8, 0)$, $(0, -8)$, and $(-8, -2)$:
\[Area_4 = \frac{1}{2} \vert -8(-2 - (-8)) + 0(-8 - 0) + -8(0 - 0) \vert = 24\]

The total area of the polygon is the sum of the areas of these four triangles:
\[Area = Area_1 + Area_2 + Area_3 + Area_4 = 32 + 32 + 24 + 24 = 112\]

So, the area of the convex polygon is 112 square units. The answer is: $112$

Approach:


The expression $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + (\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ implies that $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. This means that $x + y = \pm 10$ and $x - y = \pm 10$. Solving these four equations, we get the vertices of the polygon as $(0, 10), (0, -10), (10, 0)$ and $(-10, 0)$.
Similarly, the expression $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + (\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ implies that $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$, which gives the vertices $(8, 0), (-8, 0), (0, 8)$ and $(0, -8)$.
The intersection of these two sets of vertices gives us the vertices of the convex polygon as $(0, 8), (0, -8), (8, 0)$ and $(-8, 0)$.
The polygon is a square with side length 8.
The area of the square is $8^2 = 64$.

So, the area of the convex polygon is 64 square units. The answer is: $64$

Approach:


The equation $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + (\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + (\vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ is satisfied only when both of the terms in the product are zero. This implies that either of the following two conditions hold:
1. $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + (\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$
2. $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + (\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$

For the first condition to be true, it implies that both $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. This is the set of points that lie on the lines $x + y = 10$ and $x - y = 10$ or their reflections in the coordinate axes. These lines form a square with side length 10.

For the second condition to be true, it implies that both $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$. This is the set of points that lie on the lines $x = 8$ and $y = 8$ or their reflections in the coordinate axes. These lines form a square with side length 8.

The area of the polygon formed by the intersection of these two squares is the area of the 8x8 square, which is $8^2 = 64$ square units. The answer is: $64$

The equation $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ implies that $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$.
From these equations, we can see that the polygon is a square with side length 16.

To find the area of the square, we simply square the length of one of its sides: $16^2 = 256$.

Approach:


The equation given is a product of two terms, which is equal to zero. Therefore, one of the terms must be zero for the whole expression to be zero. This gives us two separate cases to consider.

1. $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$
2. $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$

Case 1: $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$
This case implies that both $\vert x + y \vert - 10 = 0$ and $\vert x - y \vert - 10 = 0$, which means $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. The solutions to these absolute value equations are:

1. $x + y = 10$ and $x + y = -10$
2. $x - y = 10$ and $x - y = -10$

These four lines form a square with side length 10.

Case 2: $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$
This case implies that both $\vert x \vert - 8 = 0$ and $\vert y \vert - 8 = 0$, which means $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$. The solutions to these absolute value equations are:

1. $x = 8$ and $x = -8$
2. $y = 8$ and $y = -8$

These four lines form a square with side length 16.

The area of the convex polygon formed by the intersection of the two squares is the area of the smaller square (side length 10), which can be calculated as $10^2 = 100$.
The answer is: $100$

Approach:


The equation is given as $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$. For the product of two numbers to be zero, either one of the numbers has to be zero. Hence, either of the following two equations has to be true:

1. $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2) = 0$
2. $((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$

From equation 2, we can deduce that $x = \pm8$ and $y = \pm8$. This means the polygon is a square with side length 16. The area of the square is therefore $16^2 = 256$.

So, the area of the convex polygon is 256. The answer is: $256$.

Solve the following problem with a Python Script (positive numerical answer):
"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"

Approach:


The equation given in the problem is a product of two expressions equal to zero. This means that either the first expression is zero or the second expression is zero.
The first expression is $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)$, and the second expression is $((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2)$.
For the first expression to be zero, both $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2$ and $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2$ must be zero. This implies that $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. Solving these equations gives us $x = y$ or $x = -y$. This means that the points $(x, y)$ lie on the lines $y = x$ and $y = -x$.
For the second expression to be zero, both $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2$ and $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2$ must be zero. This implies that $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$. Solving these equations gives us $x = 8$ or $x = -8$, and $y = 8$ or $y = -8$. This means that the points $(x, y)$ lie on the lines $x = 8$, $x = -8$, $y = 8$, and $y = -8$.
The intersection of these lines forms a square with side length $10$, because the distance between the lines $y = x$ and $y = -x$ is $10$, and the distance between the lines $x = 8$ and $x = -8$ (or $y = 8$ and $y = -8$) is also $10$.
The area of a square is given by the square of the length of its side, so the area of this square is $10^2 = 100$. The answer is: $100$
