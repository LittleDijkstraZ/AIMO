We know that the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has $4$ distinct solutions.
The expression $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert$ can take on $4$ distinct values when $\frac{m}{100}$ is between $1$ and $2$.
So, $1 \leq \frac{m}{100} < 2$.
This gives us $100 \leq m < 200$.
Therefore, the positive integers $m$ that satisfy the equation are all the integers from $100$ to $199$.
To find out how many such integers there are, we subtract the smallest value from the largest value and add $1$: $199 - 100 + 1 = 100$.
Therefore, there are $100$ positive integers $m$ that make the equation have $4$ distinct solutions. The answer is: $100$

Approach:



For the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ to have $4$ distinct solutions, we know that $\frac{m}{100}$ must be a number between $1$ and $2$, because the function $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert$ changes its behavior exactly at $1$ and $2$.

This gives us the inequality $1 < \frac{m}{100} < 2$, which simplifies to $100 < m < 200$.

Therefore, the number of positive integers $m$ that satisfy this inequality is $200 - 100 - 1 = 99$.

The answer is: $99$.

Approach:

 The equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has 4 distinct solutions when $\frac{m}{100} = 2$. This is because the expression inside the absolute value, $\vert x-1 \vert -2$, changes its sign at $x = 1 \pm 2$, which are $x = 3$ and $x = -1$. The equation will have 4 distinct solutions when $\frac{m}{100} = 2$, which gives $m = 200$.

Therefore, there is only one positive integer $m$ that satisfies the condition, and that is $m = 200$.

The answer is: $1$

Solve the following problem with a Python Script (positive numerical answer):
"For how many positive integers $m$ does the equation \[\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}\] have $4$ distinct solutions?"

Approach:


We will analyze the given equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ and find out for how many values of $m$ it has $4$ distinct solutions.

Step 1: Simplify the equation
The equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ can be rewritten as $\vert x-1 \vert -2 = y$ or $\vert x-1 \vert -2 = -y$, where $y = \frac{m}{100}$.

Step 2: Solve for $x$
Solving $\vert x-1 \vert -2 = y$ gives us $\vert x-1 \vert = y+2$. This further simplifies to $x-1 = y+2$ or $x-1 = -(y+2)$. Solving these two equations gives us $x = y+3$ or $x = 1-y-2 = -y-1$.

Solving $\vert x-1 \vert -2 = -y$ gives us $\vert x-1 \vert = 2-y$. This further simplifies to $x-1 = 2-y$ or $x-1 = -(2-y)$. Solving these two equations gives us $x = y+1$ or $x = -y+3$.

Step 3: Determine the number of solutions
For the equation $x = y+3$ to have distinct solutions, $y$ must be greater than $2$ (to avoid the absolute value being negative). Similarly, for the equation $x = -y-1$ to have distinct solutions, $y$ must be less than $-2$.

For the equation $x = y+1$ to have distinct solutions, $y$ must be less than $2$ (to avoid the absolute value being negative). Similarly, for the equation $x = -y+3$ to have distinct solutions, $y$ must be greater than $-2$.

Step 4: Determine the number of possible values of $y$
From the above analysis, we can see that $y$ must be in the range $(-2, 2)$. Since $y = \frac{m}{100}$, the possible values of $m$ are in the range $(-200, 200)$.

Step 5: Count the number of positive integers $m$
The number of positive integers $m$ in the range $(0, 200)$ is $200$.

The answer is: $\boxed{1}$.

Assistant:

Approach:


We start by considering the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$.
We know that the expression on the left-hand side can take on a maximum of three distinct values depending on the value of $x$.
Therefore, for the equation to have four distinct solutions, the value of $\frac{m}{100}$ must be equal to one of those three possible values.
The three possible values are $0$, $1$, and $2$.
If $\frac{m}{100}=0$, then $m=0$, but $m$ must be a positive integer, so $m=0$ is not a valid solution.
If $\frac{m}{100}=1$, then $m=100$.
If $\frac{m}{100}=2$, then $m=200$.
Therefore, there are only two possible values of $m$ for which the equation has four distinct solutions: $m=100$ and $m=200$.

So, there are $2$ possible values of $m$ that satisfy the given condition.
The answer is: $2$

The equation $| |x-1| -2 |=\frac{m}{100}$ has 4 distinct solutions if and only if $\frac{m}{100}$ is strictly between 0 and 2. This is because the expression $| |x-1| -2 |$ is always less than or equal to 2, and it is equal to $\frac{m}{100}$ for exactly 4 different values of $x$ when $\frac{m}{100}$ is strictly between 0 and 2.

To find the value of $m$ that makes $\frac{m}{100}$ equal to 2, we can simply multiply both sides of the equation $\frac{m}{100}=2$ by 100 to get $m=200$.

Therefore, the number of positive integers $m$ that satisfy the equation is the number of positive integers from 1 to 200. This is simply 200.

So the solution is $200$.
The answer is: $200$

The given equation is a piecewise function. We will analyze the cases for $m/100 \leq 2$ and $m/100 > 2$ separately.

For $m/100 \leq 2$, i.e., $m \leq 200$, we have two cases:
1. If $\vert x-1 \vert -2 = m/100$, then $\vert x-1 \vert = m/100 + 2$. This gives us two equations: $x-1 = m/100 + 2$ and $x-1 = -(m/100 + 2)$. Solving these equations, we get $x = 1 + m/100 + 2$ and $x = 1 - (m/100 + 2)$, respectively.
2. If $\vert x-1 \vert -2 = -m/100$, then $\vert x-1 \vert = 2 - m/100$. This gives us two equations: $x-1 = 2 - m/100$ and $x-1 = -(2 - m/100)$. Solving these equations, we get $x = 1 + 2 - m/100$ and $x = 1 - (2 - m/100)$, respectively.

For $m/100 > 2$, i.e., $m > 200$, the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=m/100$ has no solution, as the left side is always less than or equal to 2.

To have 4 distinct solutions, we need the equations in case 1 and case 2 to have two distinct solutions each. This means that the discriminant of the quadratic equations must be positive. 

For the equation $x = 1 + m/100 + 2$, the discriminant is $(m/100)^2$, which is always nonnegative.

For the equation $x = 1 - (m/100 + 2)$, the discriminant is $(m/100)^2$, which is also always nonnegative.

For the equation $x = 1 + 2 - m/100$, the discriminant is $(m/100)^2$, which is again always nonnegative.

For the equation $x = 1 - (2 - m/100)$, the discriminant is $(m/100)^2$, which is also always nonnegative.

Therefore, for all positive integers $m$, the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=m/100$ has 4 distinct solutions. However, we need to find the number of such $m$ that are less than or equal to 200. 

There are exactly 200 positive integers less than or equal to 200.

So, the number of positive integers $m$ for which the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=m/100$ has 4 distinct solutions is 200. The answer is: $200$

Approach:


The equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has 4 distinct solutions if and only if $\frac{m}{100} = 1$. This is because the expression inside the absolute value, $\vert x-1 \vert -2$, can take on 4 distinct values: $-1, 0, 1, 2$, corresponding to the 4 cases where the absolute value is less than, equal to, or greater than the right-hand side of the equation. 

However, we need to check if this value of $m$ satisfies the condition of the problem. We need to find the number of positive integers $m$ for which the equation has 4 distinct solutions. Since we found that $\frac{m}{100} = 1$, we can solve for $m$ to get $m = 100$. This is a positive integer.

Therefore, there is only one value of $m$ that makes the equation have 4 distinct solutions, and that is $m = 100$.

The answer is: $1$

The equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has 4 distinct solutions if and only if $\frac{m}{100}$ is strictly between 1 and 2.
This implies that $1<\frac{m}{100}<2$, or $100<m<200$. The positive integers $m$ that satisfy this inequality are the integers from 101 to 199, inclusive.
To count the number of these integers, we subtract the smallest value from the largest value and add 1: $199 - 101 + 1 = 99$.

Python Script:
To calculate the number of positive integers $m$ for which the equation has 4 distinct solutions, we can simply compute the difference between 199 and 101 and add 1.

```python

Solve the following problem with a Python Script (positive numerical answer):
"For how many positive integers $m$ does the equation \[\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}\] have $4$ distinct solutions?"

Approach:


To find the number of positive integers $m$ such that the equation $| |x-1|-2|=\frac{m}{100}$ has four distinct solutions, we need to consider the properties of the absolute value function and the number of solutions for different values of $m$.

Step 1:
First, let's consider the equation $| |x-1|-2|=\frac{m}{100}$.
The expression on the left side of the equation can be split into two cases:
Case 1: $|x-1|-2=\frac{m}{100}$.
Case 2: $-(|x-1|-2)=\frac{m}{100}$, which is equivalent to $|x-1|-2=-\frac{m}{100}$.

Step 2:
Now, let's consider the two cases separately.

Case 1: $|x-1|-2=\frac{m}{100}$.
This equation can be rewritten as $|x-1|=2+\frac{m}{100}$.
This equation has two solutions: $x-1=2+\frac{m}{100}$ and $x-1=-(2+\frac{m}{100})$.
Simplifying these equations, we get:
$x=3+\frac{m}{100}$ and $x=-1+\frac{m}{100}$.

Case 2: $|x-1|-2=-\frac{m}{100}$.
This equation can be rewritten as $|x-1|=2-\frac{m}{100}$.
This equation has two solutions: $x-1=2-\frac{m}{100}$ and $x-1=-(2-\frac{m}{100})$.
Simplifying these equations, we get:
$x=3-\frac{m}{100}$ and $x=-1+\frac{m}{100}$.

Comparing the solutions from the two cases, we see that the solutions for Case 1 and Case 2 are the same, except for the sign of the second solution.
So, the four distinct solutions for the equation are $x=3+\frac{m}{100}$, $x=3-\frac{m}{100}$, $x=-1+\frac{m}{100}$, and $x=-1-\frac{m}{100}$.

Step 3:
For the equation to have four distinct solutions, the value of $\frac{m}{100}$ must be positive.
This means that $m$ must be a positive integer.
And for the solutions to be distinct, $\frac{m}{100}$ must be less than $2$.
This means that $m$ must be less than $200$.

Step 4:
Now, we need to find the number of positive integers $m$ such that the equation has four distinct solutions.
By trial and error, we can find that $m=100$ is the only value that satisfies the conditions.
For $m=100$, the four distinct solutions are $x=3+1=4$, $x=3-1=2$, $x=-1+1=0$, and $x=-1-1=-2$.

So, the only positive integer $m$ that makes the equation have four distinct solutions is $m=100$.
Therefore, the number of positive integers $m$ that satisfy the condition is 1.
The answer is: $1$
