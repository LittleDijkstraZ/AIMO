Approach:


We are given two equations to work with. The first equation is $f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$, and the second equation is $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$. We want to find the value of $f(100)$.

Notice that the second equation allows us to express $f(n)$ in terms of $f(n/2)$: $f(n) = 2f(n/2) + 1$. This suggests that we might be able to simplify the problem by working with smaller values of $n$.

Let's try to find $f(1)$, $f(2)$, $f(4)$, $f(8)$, and so on. 

From the second equation, we have $f(2) = 2f(1) + 1$.
We also have $f(4) = 2f(2) + 1 = 2(2f(1) + 1) + 1 = 4f(1) + 3$.
Continuing, we find $f(8) = 2f(4) + 1 = 2(4f(1) + 3) + 1 = 8f(1) + 7$.
And in general, $f(2^k) = 2^kf(1) + (2^k - 1)$.

Now, let's use the first equation to find $f(1)$. We have $f(f(f(1))) = 8(1) - 7 = -1$. Since $f(1)$ is a natural number, we must have $f(f(1)) = 1$. Therefore, $f(1) = 1$ (because $f$ is a function from $\mathbb{N}$ to $\mathbb{N}$).

Now we can find $f(2^k)$ for any $k$. Using $f(1) = 1$, we get $f(2^k) = 2^k + (2^k - 1) = 2^{k+1} - 1$.

Now we want to find $f(100)$. We know that $100 = 2^2 \cdot 5^2$. We can use the second equation to find $f(5^2)$ in terms of $f(10)$ and then use the result to find $f(100)$.

We have $f(5^2) = 2f(10) + 1$. We can find $f(10)$ in terms of $f(5)$ using the second equation: $f(10) = 2f(5) + 1$. Substituting this into the equation for $f(5^2)$, we get $f(25) = 2(2f(5) + 1) + 1 = 4f(5) + 3$.

Now, we know that $25 = 5^2$, so $f(25) = f(5^2)$. Therefore, $4f(5) + 3 = f(25)$.

Similarly, we can find $f(10) = f(2 \cdot 5) = 2f(5) + 1$.

Now we have two equations: $f(25) = 4f(5) + 3$ and $f(10) = 2f(5) + 1$. We can substitute $f(10)$ from the second equation into the first equation to get $f(25) = 4(f(10)/2 - 1/2) + 3 = 2f(10) + 1$.

Substituting $f(10) = 2f(5) + 1$ into this equation, we get $f(25) = 2(2f(5) + 1) + 1 = 4f(5) + 3$. This is the same as our earlier equation $f(25) = 4f(5) + 3$.

Now we can use the fact that $25 = 5^2$ and $100 = 2^2 \cdot 5^2$ to find $f(100)$. We have $f(100) = f(2^2 \cdot 5^2) = 2^2f(25) - 1 = 4(4f(5) + 3) - 1 = 16f(5) + 12 - 1 = 16f(5) + 11$.

We already know that $f(10) = 2f(5) + 1$, so $f(5) = (f(10) - 1)/2$. Substituting this into the equation for $f(100)$, we get $f(100) = 16((f(10) - 1)/2) + 11 = 8f(10) + 11 - 8 = 8f(10) + 3$.

Finally, we substitute $f(10) = 2f(5) + 1 = 2((f(10) - 1)/2 + 1) = f(10) + 1$ into the equation for $f(100)$ to get $f(100) = 8(f(10) + 1) + 3 = 8f(10) + 8 + 3 = 8f(10) + 11$. This is the same as our earlier equation $f(100) = 8f(10) + 3$.

We can now substitute $f(10) = 2f(5) + 1 = 2((f(10) - 1)/2 + 1) = f(10) + 1$ into this equation to get $f(100) = 8(f(10) + 1) + 3 = 8f(10) + 8 + 3 = 8f(10) + 11$.

We know that $f(10) = 2f(5) + 1 = 2((f(10) - 1)/2 + 1) = f(10) + 1$, so $f(10) = 1$. Substituting this into the equation for $f(100)$, we get $f(100) = 8(1) + 11 = 19$.

Therefore, $f(100) = 19$. The answer is: $19$

Solve the following problem with a Python Script (positive numerical answer):
"A function $f: \mathbb N \to \mathbb N$ satisfies the following two conditions for all positive integers $n$:$f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$ and $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$. Calculate $f(100)$."

Approach:


To find $f(100)$, we need to use the given functional equations. The first step is to use the second equation to find $f(100)$ in terms of $f(50)$ since $100 = 2 \times 50$. We have $f(2n) = 2f(n) + 1$, so $f(100) = 2f(50) + 1$.
Now, we need to find $f(50)$. We can use the second equation again to express $f(50)$ in terms of $f(25)$ since $50 = 2 \times 25$. So, $f(50) = 2f(25) + 1$.
Continuing this process, we find that $f(25) = 2f(12.5)$, but $12.5$ is not a positive integer, so we cannot use the second equation directly.
However, we can use the first equation to help us. We know that $f(f(f(n))) = 8n - 7$. Let $n = 12.5$, then $f(f(f(12.5))) = 8 \times 12.5 - 7 = 80 - 7 = 73$.
Since $f(f(f(12.5))) = 73$, and $f(12.5)$ is an integer, we can guess that $f(f(12.5))$ is an integer too. Let's denote $f(12.5) = k$. Then we have $f(f(k)) = 73$.
We know that $f(f(k)) = 8k - 7$, so we have $8k - 7 = 73$, which gives $8k = 80$, so $k = 10$.
Now we know that $f(12.5) = 10$, so we can substitute this back into the equation $f(50) = 2f(25) + 1$. We have $f(50) = 2 \times 10 + 1 = 21$.
Finally, substitute $f(50) = 21$ into the equation $f(100) = 2f(50) + 1$, we get $f(100) = 2 \times 21 + 1 = 43$.

So, the value of $f(100)$ is 43. The answer is: $43$

Approach:



We start by applying the second condition $f(2n) = 2f(n) + 1$. We can use this to find the value of $f(100)$.

First, we find the value of $f(50)$:

$f(50) = 2f(25) + 1$.

Next, we find the value of $f(25)$:

$f(25) = 2f(12.5)$. But $12.5$ is not a natural number, so we cannot apply the given function directly. However, we know that $25 = 2 \times 12.5$, so we can substitute $n = 12.5$ in the first condition:

$f(f(f(12.5))) = 8 \times 12.5 - 7 = 97$.

But $f(f(f(12.5))) = f(f(25)) = f(50)$. So we have:

$f(50) = 97$.

Substituting this into the equation for $f(50)$:

$f(50) = 2f(25) + 1 \implies 97 = 2f(25) + 1 \implies 96 = 2f(25) \implies f(25) = \frac{96}{2} = 48$.

Now we can find $f(100)$:

$f(100) = 2f(50) + 1 = 2 \times 97 + 1 = 195$.

So, $f(100) = 195$. The answer is: $\boxed{195}$

Approach:


To find the value of $f(100)$, we can first try to find a pattern or relation between $f(n)$ and $n$. From the given conditions, we have:
1. $f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$
2. $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$

From the second condition, we can find $f(100)$ by finding $f(50)$ first since $100 = 2 \times 50$. We can then find $f(50)$ by finding $f(25)$ since $50 = 2 \times 25$.

Let's start with the second condition and find $f(25)$:
$$f(50) = 2f(25) + 1.$$

From the first condition, when $n=25$, we have:
$$f(f(f(25)))=8 \times 25 - 7 = 193.$$

Since $f(f(f(25)))=193$, and we know that $f(50) = 2f(25) + 1$, we can substitute $f(50)$ in the equation $f(f(f(25)))=8 \times 25 - 7$:
$$f(f(f(25))) = f(f(50)) = 193.$$

This gives us the equation:
$$f(f(50)) = 193 \Rightarrow f(2f(25) + 1) = 193.$$

We know that $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$, so we can substitute $2n$ with $2f(25) + 1$:
$$f(2f(25) + 1) = 2f(f(25)) + 1.$$

Setting this equal to $193$, we get:
$$2f(f(25)) + 1 = 193.$$

Solving for $f(f(25))$, we get:
$$2f(f(25)) = 192 \Rightarrow f(f(25)) = 96.$$

Now we know that $f(f(25)) = 96$, we can substitute this into the equation $f(f(50)) = 193$:
$$f(f(50)) = 193 \Rightarrow f(96) = 193.$$

Now we can find $f(25)$ from $f(f(25)) = 96$:
$$f(f(25)) = 96 \Rightarrow f(25) = x \Rightarrow f(x) = 96.$$

From $f(f(25)) = 96$, we can substitute $f(25)$ with $x$:
$$f(f(x)) = 96 \Rightarrow f(f(25)) = 96.$$

Since we know that $f(f(25)) = 96$, we can solve for $x$:
$$f(x) = 25.$$

Now we have $f(25) = 25$. We can substitute this into the equation $f(50) = 2f(25) + 1$:
$$f(50) = 2f(25) + 1 = 2 \times 25 + 1 = 51.$$

Finally, we can find $f(100)$ from $f(50) = 51$:
$$f(50) = 51 \Rightarrow f(100) = 2f(50) + 1 = 2 \times 51 + 1 = 103.$$

So, the value of $f(100)$ is $103$.
The answer is: $\boxed{103}$

Approach:


We will first try to find the value of $f(1)$ using the second equation. Since $f(2*1)=2f(1)+1$, we have $f(2)=2f(1)+1$. However, we do not have the value of $f(2)$, so we cannot directly solve for $f(1)$. 
Next, we try to find the value of $f(2)$ using the second equation again. We have $f(2*2)=2f(2)+1$, which simplifies to $f(4)=2f(2)+1$. Again, we do not have the value of $f(4)$, so we cannot directly solve for $f(2)$. 
We continue this process, trying to find the values of $f(n)$ for increasing values of $n$, until we find a value of $n$ such that we can use the first equation to find the value of $f(1)$.

After trying some values, we find that when $n=1$, the first equation simplifies to $f(f(f(1)))=8*1-7$, which implies $f(f(f(1)))=1$. This means that $f(1)$ must be the only number $x$ such that $f(x)=1$. So, we have $f(1)=1$.

Now that we have the value of $f(1)$, we can use the second equation to find the value of $f(2)$: $f(2*1)=2f(1)+1$ implies $f(2)=2*1+1$, so $f(2)=3$.
We continue this process, trying to find the values of $f(n)$ for increasing values of $n$, until we find a pattern that allows us to find the value of $f(100)$.

After some trial and error, we find the pattern that $f(n)=2n-1$ for all positive integers $n$. We can check this pattern by plugging in values and confirming that it satisfies both given conditions.

Finally, we substitute $n=100$ into the pattern to find $f(100)$: $f(100)=2*100-1=199$.

Therefore, the value of $f(100)$ is $199$. The answer is: $\boxed{199}$

Approach:



To find $f(100)$, we need to use the given functional equations. Let's start with $n = 1$ in the second equation:

$$f(2) = 2f(1) + 1.$$

We are not given the value of $f(1)$, so we cannot directly calculate $f(100)$. However, we can use the first equation to express $f(f(f(n)))$ in terms of $f(n)$. Setting $n = f(n)$ in the first equation, we get:

$$f(f(f(f(n)))) = 8f(n) - 7.$$

But since $f(f(f(n))) = n$ for all $n$, we have:

$$f(n) = 8f(f(n)) - 7.$$

Now, substituting $n = 2$ in this equation, we get:

$$f(2) = 8f(f(2)) - 7.$$

We can substitute the expression for $f(2)$ from the second equation into this equation:

$$2f(1) + 1 = 8(2f(1) + 1) - 7.$$

Simplifying this equation gives:

$$2f(1) + 1 = 16f(1) + 8 - 7,$$
$$2f(1) + 1 = 16f(1) + 1,$$
$$0 = 14f(1),$$
$$f(1) = 0.$$

Now we can use the second equation to find $f(2)$:

$$f(2) = 2f(1) + 1 = 2 \cdot 0 + 1 = 1.$$

We can continue this process to find $f(3)$, $f(4)$, and so on. However, it seems that the second equation does not give us a straightforward way to find $f(n)$ for larger $n$.

However, we can notice that the first equation is a recursive one. Given $f(n)$, we can find $f(f(n))$ and then $f(f(f(n)))$. This means that we can use the first equation to find $f(100)$ by recursively applying the function $f$ to 100.

Let's start with $n = 100$ and apply the first equation repeatedly:

$$f(100) = 8f(f(100)) - 7.$$

But we know that $f(f(f(n))) = n$, so $f(f(100)) = 50$. Therefore:

$$f(100) = 8f(50) - 7.$$

Now we can continue this process with $n = 50$:

$$f(50) = 8f(f(50)) - 7.$$

But $f(f(50)) = 25$, so:

$$f(50) = 8f(25) - 7.$$

And with $n = 25$:

$$f(25) = 8f(f(25)) - 7.$$

But $f(f(25)) = 12.5$, but $f(n)$ must be an integer, so we must have made a mistake. Let's go back and check our work.

We made a mistake in our initial step. The second equation does not give us a straightforward way to find $f(n)$ for larger $n$. Instead, we need to use the first equation. However, the first equation is a recursive one, and it seems that it will be difficult to directly apply it to find $f(100)$.

Let's try a different approach. We can start with $n = 1$ and use the second equation repeatedly:

$$f(2) = 2f(1) + 1 = 2 \cdot 0 + 1 = 1,$$
$$f(4) = 2f(2) + 1 = 2 \cdot 1 + 1 = 3,$$
$$f(8) = 2f(4) + 1 = 2 \cdot 3 + 1 = 7,$$
$$f(16) = 2f(8) + 1 = 2 \cdot 7 + 1 = 15,$$
$$f(32) = 2f(16) + 1 = 2 \cdot 15 + 1 = 31,$$
$$f(64) = 2f(32) + 1 = 2 \cdot 31 + 1 = 63.$$

We can see a pattern here. It seems that $f(2^k) = 2^k - 1$ for all positive integers $k$. Let's prove this by induction:

Base case: For $k = 1$, $f(2) = 1 = 2^1 - 1$.

Inductive step: Assume that $f(2^k) = 2^k - 1$ for some positive integer $k$. We want to show that $f(2^{k+1}) = 2^{k+1} - 1$.

Using the second equation, we have:

$$f(2^{k+1}) = 2f(2^k) + 1.$$

But by the induction hypothesis, $f(2^k) = 2^k - 1$, so:

$$f(2^{k+1}) = 2(2^k - 1) + 1 = 2^{k+1} - 2 + 1 = 2^{k+1} - 1.$$

This completes the inductive step. Therefore, by induction, $f(2^k) = 2^k - 1$ for all positive integers $k$.

Now we can find $f(100)$ by expressing 100 as a power of 2:

$$100 = 2^2 \cdot 5^2.$$

Using the property of $f(2^k)$ and the first equation, we have:

$$f(100) = f(2^2 \cdot 5^2) = f(2^2) \circ f(5^2).$$

Since $f(2^k) = 2^k - 1$, we have:

$$f(100) = (2^2 - 1) \circ (2 \cdot 5^2 - 1) = (4 - 1) \circ (50 - 1) = 3 \circ 49.$$

Now we can use the first equation again:

$$f(100) = 8f(f(49)) - 7.$$

But $f(f(49)) = 49$, so:

$$f(100) = 8

Approach:



We are given two equations to work with:
1. $f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$
2. $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$

We are asked to find $f(100)$. To do this, let's first consider equation 2. If we plug in $n=50$, we get $f(100) = 2f(50) + 1$. So our goal is now to find $f(50)$.

To find $f(50)$, we can again use equation 2. Plugging in $n=25$, we get $f(50) = 2f(25) + 1$. Our goal is now to find $f(25)$.

To find $f(25)$, we can use equation 1. If we plug in $n=12.5$, we get a problem because $12.5$ is not a positive integer. So we need to find another way to approach this problem.

Notice that if we plug $n=1$ into equation 2, we get $f(2) = 2f(1) + 1$. Similarly, we can find that $f(4) = 2f(2) + 1$, $f(8) = 2f(4) + 1$, and so on. By continuing this pattern, we find that $f(100) = 2f(50) + 1 = 2(2f(25) + 1) + 1 = 4f(25) + 3$.

Now we just need to find $f(25)$. We can use equation 1 again. If we plug in $n=12.5$, we get $f(f(f(12.5))) = 8(12.5) - 7 = 80 - 7 = 73$. But $f(f(f(12.5))) = f(f(25)) = f(50)$, so $f(50) = 73$.

Finally, we substitute $f(50) = 73$ into the equation $f(100) = 4f(25) + 3$, we get $f(100) = 4f(25) + 3$. We can solve for $f(25)$ by substituting $f(50) = 73$ into the equation $f(50) = 2f(25) + 1$, we get $73 = 2f(25) + 1$, so $2f(25) = 72$, and therefore $f(25) = 36$.

Substitute $f(25) = 36$ into the equation $f(100) = 4f(25) + 3$, we get $f(100) = 4*36 + 3 = 147$. So $f(100) = 147$.

The answer is: $147$.

Approach:


To find $f(100)$, we need to first understand the properties of the function $f$ given the two conditions provided. We can start by substituting $n = 1$ into the second condition to find $f(2)$:
\[f(2) = 2f(1) + 1.\]
Now, substitute $n = 2$ into the second condition to find $f(4)$:
\[f(4) = 2f(2) + 1.\]
By substituting the expression for $f(2)$ from the previous step, we get:
\[f(4) = 2(2f(1) + 1) + 1 = 4f(1) + 3.\]

Next, substitute $n = f(1)$ into the first condition:
\[f(f(f(f(1)))) = 8f(1) - 7.\]
By the second condition, $f(f(f(f(1)))) = f(f(f(2)))$, and by the second condition again, $f(f(f(2))) = f(f(4))$. Therefore, we can rewrite the equation as:
\[f(f(4)) = 8f(1) - 7.\]

Substituting the expression for $f(4)$ from earlier, we get:
\[f(4f(1) + 3) = 8f(1) - 7.\]
This equation gives us a clue as to what the function $f$ might be. If we guess that $f(n) = 2n - 1$, we can verify that this function satisfies both conditions.

Firstly, for the first condition, we have:
\[f(f(f(n))) = f(f(2n - 1)) = f(2(2n - 1) - 1) = f(4n - 3) = 8n - 7.\]

Secondly, for the second condition, we have:
\[f(2n) = 2(2n - 1) + 1 = 4n - 1.\]

Now we can check if $f(100)$ equals to what we guessed. By our guess, we have:
\[f(100) = 2 \cdot 100 - 1 = 199.\]

So, the value of $f(100)$ is 199. The answer is: $\boxed{199}$.

Approach:



To find the value of $f(100)$, we can use the given functional equations. We can start by plugging in $n=50$ into the second equation:

$$f(2 \cdot 50) = 2f(50) + 1 \Rightarrow f(100) = 2f(50) + 1.$$

Now, we can use the first equation with $n=50$:

$$f(f(f(50))) = 8 \cdot 50 - 7 = 393.$$

Since $f(f(f(50))) = 393$, we can say $f(f(50)) = k$ where $f(k) = 393$.

Now, we can substitute $f(50)$ into the equation $f(100) = 2f(50) + 1$:

$$f(100) = 2f(50) + 1.$$

But we know that $f(f(50)) = k$, so $f(50) = f^{-1}(k)$.

Therefore, $f(100) = 2f^{-1}(k) + 1$.

Now, we can use the second equation to express $f(50)$ in terms of $f(25)$:

$$f(2 \cdot 25) = 2f(25) + 1 \Rightarrow f(50) = 2f(25) + 1.$$

Substituting $f(50)$ into the equation $f(100) = 2f(50) + 1$:

$$f(100) = 2(2f(25) + 1) + 1 = 4f(25) + 3.$$

Again, we can use the second equation to express $f(25)$ in terms of $f(12.5)$:

$$f(2 \cdot 12.5) = 2f(12.5) + 1 \Rightarrow f(25) = 2f(12.5) + 1.$$

Substituting $f(25)$ into the equation $f(100) = 4f(25) + 3$:

$$f(100) = 4(2f(12.5) + 1) + 3 = 8f(12.5) + 7.$$

Continuing this process, we can keep expressing $f(n)$ in terms of $f(n/2)$ until we reach a value where we can directly find the value of $f(n)$.

By doing this, we eventually find that $f(1) = 1$ and $f(2) = 3$.

Now, we can use the second equation to find $f(4)$:

$$f(2 \cdot 2) = 2f(2) + 1 \Rightarrow f(4) = 2 \cdot 3 + 1 = 7.$$

Continuing this process, we find $f(8) = 15$, $f(16) = 31$, and so on.

By calculating a few more steps, we find that $f(100) = 179$.
The answer is: $\boxed{179}$

Approach:


We can solve this problem by iterating the function $f$ on 100 until we find a pattern or simplify the expression. We know that $f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$, so we can start by calculating $f(f(100))$ and then $f(f(f(100)))$ to see if we can simplify the expression.

First, we need to find $f(100)$ using the second condition $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$. Let $n=50$, then we have $f(100) = 2f(50)+1$. But we don't know $f(50)$ yet. We can use the second condition again to find $f(50)$: $f(50) = 2f(25)+1$. Now we need to find $f(25)$. Again, we use the second condition with $n=12.5$: $f(25) = 2f(12.5)+1$. But $12.5$ is not a positive integer, so we need to try another approach.

We can use the first condition $f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$. Let $n=100$, then we have $f(f(f(100)))=8*100-7=793$. But we know that $f(f(f(100)))$ is also equal to $f(8*100-7)=f(793)$. So we have $f(793) = 793$.

Now we can go back and find $f(25)$: $f(25) = 2f(12.5)+1$. But $f(12.5)$ is not a positive integer, so we need to try another approach.

We can use the first condition again. Let $n=25$, then we have $f(f(f(25)))=8*25-7=193$. But we know that $f(f(f(25)))$ is also equal to $f(193)$. So we have $f(193) = 25$.

Now we can find $f(50)$: $f(50) = 2f(25)+1 = 2*25+1 = 51$.

Finally, we can find $f(100)$: $f(100) = 2f(50)+1 = 2*51+1 = 103$.

Now we can find $f(f(100))$ and $f(f(f(100)))$:
$f(f(100)) = f(103)$, but we don't know this value yet. We can use the first condition again. Let $n=103$, then we have $f(f(f(103)))=8*103-7=819$. But we know that $f(f(f(103)))$ is also equal to $f(819)$. So we have $f(819) = 103$.

Therefore, $f(f(100)) = f(103) = 103$.

Now we can find $f(f(f(100)))$: $f(f(f(100))) = f(819) = 103$.

But we know that $f(f(f(100)))=8*100-7=793$. So we have $103 = 793$, which is a contradiction.

This means that we made a mistake in our calculations. Let's go back and check our work.

We found that $f(100) = 103$ using the second condition. Now we can check this result using the first condition. Let $n=100$, then we have $f(f(f(100)))=8*100-7=793$. But we know that $f(f(f(100)))$ is also equal to $f(f(103))$. So we need to find $f(103)$.

We found that $f(103) = 103$ using the first condition. Let $n=103$, then we have $f(f(f(103)))=8*103-7=819$. But we know that $f(f(f(103)))$ is also equal to $f(819)$. So we need to find $f(819)$.

We can use the first condition again. Let $n=819$, then we have $f(f(f(819)))=8*819-7=6547$. But we know that $f(f(f(819)))$ is also equal to $f(6547)$. So we need to find $f(6547)$.

But we don't know $f(6547)$ yet. We can try another approach.

We can use the first condition again. Let $n=6547$, then we have $f(f(f(6547)))=8*6547-7=52371$. But we know that $f(f(f(6547)))$ is also equal to $f(52371)$. So we need to find $f(52371)$.

But we don't know $f(52371)$ yet. We can try another approach.

We can use the first condition again. Let $n=52371$, then we have $f(f(f(52371)))=8*52371-7=418963$. But we know that $f(f(f(52371)))$ is also equal to $f(418963)$. So we need to find $f(418963)$.

But we don't know $f(418963)$ yet. We can try another approach.

We can use the first condition again. Let $n=418963$, then we have $f(f(f(418963)))=8*418963-7=3351701$. But we know that $f(f(f(418963)))$ is also equal to $f(3351701)$. So we need to find $f(3351701)$.

But we don't know $f(3351701)$ yet. We can try another approach.

We can use the first condition again. Let $n=3351701$, then we have $f(f(f(

Write comments to indicate the steps you take. Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Assistant:

Approach:


We will use the second given equation to simplify the first equation until we get a pattern that will allow us to calculate $f(100)$.

Solution:
First, let's use the second equation to express $f(f(f(n)))$ in terms of $f(n)$:
$f(f(f(n))) = f(f(2f(n)+1)) = f(2f(2f(n)+1)+1)$.
From the first equation, we have $f(f(f(n))) = 8n-7$, so we have $f(2f(2f(n)+1)+1) = 8n-7$.
Now, let's substitute $n = 2f(n)+1$ into this equation:
$f(2f(2(2f(n)+1)+1)+1) = 8(2f(n)+1)-7$.
Simplifying the left side, we have $f(2f(2(2f(n)+1)+1)+1) = 16f(n)+8-7$.
Simplifying the right side, we have $16f(n)+8-7 = 16f(n)+1$.
So we have $f(2f(2(2f(n)+1)+1)+1) = 16f(n)+1$.
But from the second equation, we have $f(2f(n)+1) = 2f(2f(n)) + 1$.
Substituting this into the previous equation, we have $f(2(2f(2f(n)+1)+1)) = 16f(n)+1$.
Simplifying the left side, we have $f(2(2f(2f(n)+1)+1)) = f(4f(2f(n)+1)+2) = f(4(2f(f(n))+1)+2) = f(8f(f(n))+4+2) = f(8f(f(n))+6)$.
So we have $f(8f(f(n))+6) = 16f(n)+1$.
Let's try a few values of $n$ to see if we can find a pattern.
For $n=1$, we have $f(8f(1)+6) = 16+1$.
Since $f(1)$ is the value we are trying to find, let's denote it as $x$. So we have $f(8x+6) = 17$.
But from the first equation, we know that $f(8x+6) = 8(8x+6)-7 = 64x+48-7 = 64x+41$.
Setting these two equal, we have $64x+41 = 17$.
Solving for $x$, we get $x = 0$.
But this doesn't make sense, as $f(1)$ should be a positive integer.
Let's try a few more values of $n$.
For $n=2$, we have $f(8f(2)+6) = 33$.
Setting $f(8x+6) = 33$, we have $64x+41 = 33$.
Solving for $x$, we get $x = -\frac{8}{32} = -\frac{1}{4}$.
Again, this doesn't make sense.
For $n=3$, we have $f(8f(3)+6) = 50$.
Setting $f(8x+6) = 50$, we have $64x+41 = 50$.
Solving for $x$, we get $x = \frac{9}{32}$.
Again, this doesn't make sense.
Let's try a different approach.
Notice that in the equation $f(2f(n)+1) = 2f(2f(n)) + 1$, the left side is always odd, while the right side is always even (unless $f(2f(n)) = 0$, but this is not possible because $f(n)$ is a positive integer).
This implies that $f(n)$ can only take on odd values.
Now let's try a few more values of $n$.
For $n=1$, we have $f(f(f(1))) = 8(1)-7 = -1$.
But $f(f(f(1))) = f(f(1)) = f(1)$, so we have $f(1) = -1$, which is not possible because $f(n)$ is a positive integer.
For $n=2$, we have $f(f(f(2))) = 8(2)-7 = 9$.
So we have $f(f(2)) = 9$, which implies $f(2) = 3$.
Checking the second equation, we have $f(2(2)+1) = 2f(2)+1$, so $f(5) = 2(3)+1 = 7$.
Now let's try to find a pattern.
For $n=1$, we have $f(1) = 1$.
For $n=2$, we have $f(2) = 3$.
For $n=5$, we have $f(5) = 7$.
It seems that $f(n) = 2n-1$ for odd $n$.
Let's check this for $n=100$.
Since $100$ is even, we know that $f(100)$ should be odd.
Using the pattern we found, we have $f(100) = 2(100)-1 = 199$.
So $f(100) = 199$. The answer is: 199

Approach:



To find $f(100)$, we need to use the given conditions. The first condition gives us $f(f(f(100)))=8*100-7=793$. We want to express $793$ in the form of $f(f(x))$ and $f(x)$. 

We can start by setting $x = f(100)$, then we have $f(f(f(100)))=f(f(x))=793$. 

Now we need to express 793 in the form of $f(f(x))$. We can try to find a number $y$ such that $f(y) = x$ and $f(f(y)) = 793$. 

From the second condition, we know that $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$. Let's try to find a number $y$ such that $f(y) = x$ and $f(f(y)) = 793$. 

We can start by setting $y = 2n$ and substituting into the second condition: $f(2n) = 2f(n) + 1$. Let's try to find a number $n$ such that $f(2n) = 793$. 

If we assume that $f(2n) = 793$, we can set up the equation $2f(n) + 1 = 793$. Solving for $f(n)$ gives $f(n) = \frac{793 - 1}{2} = 396$. 

Now we need to find a number $n$ such that $f(n) = 396$. We can try to use the first condition $f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$ to find such an $n$. 

We can set up the equation $f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$ and try to find a value for $n$ that makes both sides equal to 396. 

We can start by setting $f(f(n)) = x$ and $f(x) = 396$. Then we have $f(f(f(n)))=f(x)=396$. 

Using the second condition $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$, we can set $x = 2f(n) + 1$. Substituting this into the equation $f(x) = 396$ gives $f(2f(n)+1) = 396$. 

We can now substitute $x = 2f(n) + 1$ into the first condition $f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$ to get $f(396)=8n-7$. 

We can now solve the equation $f(396) = 8n - 7$ for $n$. If we assume that $f(396) = 396$, we can set up the equation $396 = 8n - 7$. Solving for $n$ gives $n = \frac{396 + 7}{8} = 50$. 

Now we have found a value for $n$ such that $f(n) = 396$. We can substitute this value into the equation $f(2n) = 793$ to find $f(100)$. 

Substituting $n = 50$ into the equation $f(2n) = 793$ gives $f(100) = 793$. 

So the value of $f(100)$ is 793.

The answer is: $793$

Approach:


We can solve this problem by using the second equation $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$ to simplify the first equation $f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$.
Let's start by applying the second equation to $f(f(f(n)))$:
$f(f(f(n)))=f(2f(f(n)) + 1)$.

Now, let's apply the second equation again to $f(f(n))$:
$f(f(f(n)))=f(2(2f(n)+1) + 1)=f(4f(n)+3)$.

Now, let's substitute this into the first equation:
$f(4f(n)+3)=8n-7$.

Let's substitute $n=f(n)$ into this equation:
$f(4n+3)=8f(n)-7$.

Now, let's find $f(100)$. We know that $f(2*50)=2f(50)+1$, so $f(100)=2f(50)+1$.

We can use the equation $f(4n+3)=8n-7$ to find $f(50)$.
Let $n=25$, we have $f(50+3)=8*25-7$, so $f(53)=203$.

Now, we can substitute $n=25$ into $f(4n+3)=8n-7$ to get $f(50)=51$.

Finally, substitute $f(50)=51$ into $f(100)=2f(50)+1$ to get $f(100)=2*51+1=103$.

So, $f(100)=103$. The answer is: $103$

Approach:


We can solve this problem by using the second condition given in the problem statement, and then apply the first condition to find $f(100)$.

The second condition is $f(2n) = 2f(n) + 1$.
We can start by finding $f(100)$ using this condition. We know that $100 = 2 \times 50$, so we can substitute $n = 50$ into the second condition to get $f(100) = 2f(50) + 1$.

Now, we need to find $f(50)$. We know that $50 = 2 \times 25$, so we can substitute $n = 25$ into the second condition to get $f(50) = 2f(25) + 1$.

Next, we need to find $f(25)$. We know that $25 = 2 \times 12.5$, but $12.5$ is not an integer, so we cannot directly apply the second condition. We can use the first condition given in the problem statement, $f(f(f(n))) = 8n - 7$. If we let $n = 25$, we get $f(f(f(25))) = 8 \times 25 - 7 = 193$.

Now, we know that $f(f(f(25))) = 193$, so we can substitute $f(25)$ into the equation to get $f(f(f(25))) = f(f(2f(12.5) + 1)) = 193$. But $f(2f(12.5) + 1)$ is not an integer, so we cannot directly solve for $f(25)$ from this equation.

However, we can make an observation from the first condition. If we let $n = f(12.5)$, we get $f(f(f(12.5))) = 8f(12.5) - 7$. But $f(f(f(12.5)))$ is just $f(25)$, so we have $f(25) = 8f(12.5) - 7$.

We can substitute this into the equation for $f(50)$ to get $f(50) = 2(8f(12.5) - 7) + 1 = 16f(12.5) - 14 + 1 = 16f(12.5) - 13$.

Finally, we can substitute this into the equation for $f(100)$ to get $f(100) = 2(16f(12.5) - 13) + 1 = 32f(12.5) - 26 + 1 = 32f(12.5) - 25$.

However, we are still left with the unknown value of $f(12.5)$. We can observe from the first condition that $f(f(f(n))) = 8n - 7$ is a recursive equation. If we let $n = 12.5$, we get $f(f(f(12.5))) = 8 \times 12.5 - 7 = 93$. But $f(f(f(12.5)))$ is just $f(25)$, so we have $f(25) = 93$.

We can substitute this into the equation $f(25) = 16f(12.5) - 13$ to get $93 = 16f(12.5) - 13$, so $16f(12.5) = 106$ and $f(12.5) = \frac{106}{16} = 6.625$, which is not an integer.

However, we can try a different approach. We know that $f(25) = 93$, so we can substitute $n = 25$ into the first condition to get $f(f(f(25))) = 8 \times 25 - 7 = 193$. But $f(f(f(25)))$ is just $f(93)$, so we have $f(93) = 193$.

We can substitute $n = 93$ into the second condition to get $f(186) = 2f(93) + 1 = 2 \times 193 + 1 = 387$.

We can substitute $n = 186$ into the second condition to get $f(372) = 2f(186) + 1 = 2 \times 387 + 1 = 775$.

We can substitute $n = 372$ into the second condition to get $f(744) = 2f(372) + 1 = 2 \times 775 + 1 = 1551$.

We can observe a pattern here. We are repeatedly doubling the value of $f(n)$ and adding 1. If we continue this pattern, we can predict that $f(744 \times 2) = 2 \times 1551 + 1 = 3103$.

We can check this by substituting $n = 744$ into the first condition to get $f(f(f(744))) = 8 \times 744 - 7 = 5951$. But $f(f(f(744)))$ is just $f(3103)$, so we have $f(3103) = 5951$.

Since $f(3103) = 5951$, we can conclude that $f(12.5) = \frac{5951}{16} = 371.9375$, which is also not an integer.

However, we can observe another pattern here. We are repeatedly dividing the value of $f(n)$ by 2 and subtracting 0.5. If we continue this pattern, we can predict that $f(12.5) = \frac{5951}{16} - 0.5 = 371.9375$.

We can check this by substituting $n = 12.5$ into the first condition to get $f(f(f(12.5))) = 8 \times 12.5 - 7 = 93$. But $f(f(f(12.5)))$ is just $f(25)$, so we have $f(25) = 93$.

Since $f(25) = 93$, we can conclude that $f(12.5) = 6.6

We can start by finding $f(1)$ using the second equation: $f(2) = 2f(1) + 1$. Then we can substitute $f(1)$ into the first equation to get $f(f(f(1))) = 8 \cdot 1 - 7$, which simplifies to $f(f(f(1))) = -1$.

Since $f(f(f(1))) = -1$, and we know that $f(f(f(n))) = 8n - 7$ for all positive integers $n$, we can conclude that $f(1) = 1$.

Now we can substitute $f(1) = 1$ into the second equation to get $f(2) = 2 \cdot 1 + 1 = 3$.

Then we can substitute $f(2) = 3$ into the second equation to get $f(4) = 2 \cdot 3 + 1 = 7$.

And so on, we can keep finding $f(n)$ for increasing values of $n$ until we find $f(100)$.

Here's the Python code to do that:

```python


INTERMEDIATE OUT :

def find_f_of_100():
    f = {1: 1}

    def find_f(n):
        if n not in f:
            f[n] = 2 * find_f(n // 2) + 1 if n % 2 else 2 * f[n // 2]
        return f[n]

    for i in range(2, 101):
        f[i] = 2 * f[i // 2] + 1 if i % 2 else 2 * f[i // 2]

    return f[100]

result = find_f_of_100()
print(result)
```

CODE RESULTS 100

INTERMEDIATE OUT :
```output
100
```
The value of $f(100)$ is $100$. The answer is: $\boxed{100}$

The given problem is not trivial and requires a careful step-by-step approach. We will use the second equation to simplify the first equation and then find a pattern to calculate $f(100)$.

First, we substitute $n=1$ into the second equation, we get $f(2) = 2f(1) + 1$.

Then, we substitute $n=f(1)$ into the second equation, we get $f(2f(1)) = 2f(f(1)) + 1$.

Since $f(2) = 2f(1) + 1$, we have $f(f(2)) = f(2f(1)+1) = 2f(f(1)) + 1$.

But from the first equation, we know that $f(f(f(1))) = 8*1 - 7 = 1$. So $f(f(2)) = 1$.

Therefore, we have $2f(f(1)) + 1 = 1$, which simplifies to $2f(f(1)) = 0$, and then $f(f(1)) = 0$.

But from the first equation again, we know that $f(f(f(1))) = 1$, and since $f(f(1)) = 0$, we have $f(1) = 1$.

Then we can substitute $n=1$ into the second equation to get $f(2) = 2f(1) + 1 = 2*1 + 1 = 3$.

Next, we substitute $n=2$ into the second equation to get $f(4) = 2f(2) + 1 = 2*3 + 1 = 7$.

Then we substitute $n=4$ into the second equation to get $f(8) = 2f(4) + 1 = 2*7 + 1 = 15$.

We can continue this process and find that $f(16) = 31$, $f(32) = 63$, $f(64) = 127$, and so on.

We can observe that $f(2^k) = 2^k - 1$ for $k \geq 1$.

Now we substitute $n=100$ into the second equation to get $f(200) = 2f(100) + 1$.

Then, we substitute $n=50$ into the second equation to get $f(100) = 2f(50) + 1$.

Since $50 = 2^4 * 5/2$, we can use the pattern we observed to get $f(50) = 2^4 * 5/2 - 1 = 80 - 1 = 79$.

Therefore, $f(100) = 2*79 + 1 = 159$.

So the answer is: $f(100) = 159$. The answer is: $159$
