The equation $A \cdot B = 0$ implies that either $A = 0$ or $B = 0$. In this problem, we have two products of expressions equal to zero. Therefore, each product must be equal to zero separately.

This gives us two systems of equations:

1) $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ and $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ and $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ and $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$.

From the first and third equations, we have $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. From the second and fourth equations, we have $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$.

Solving these equations, we find that the points $(x, y)$ must lie on the square with vertices at $(8, 8)$, $(-8, 8)$, $(-8, -8)$, and $(8, -8)$.

Solution:

The side length of this square is $16$, so its area is $16^2 = 256$.
The answer is: $256$

"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"

The expression $AB = 0$ is true if and only if $A = 0$ or $B = 0$. So, the given equation is equivalent to either $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$.
The equations $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ and $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ imply that $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. This forms a square with side length 10. The equations $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ and $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ imply that $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$, which forms a square with side length 16.
The convex polygon enclosed by the points satisfying the given equation is the intersection of these two squares, which is a square with side length 10.
The area of this square is $10^2 = 100$. The answer is: $\boxed{100}$.

Solve the following problem with a Python Script (positive numerical answer):
"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"

Approach:

 The equation $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + (\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + (\vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ is true if either $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + (\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + (\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$. 

The first equation $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + (\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ implies that $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. This means that $x + y = \pm 10$ and $x - y = \pm 10$. Solving these equations gives the vertices of a square with side length 10 and diagonals of length $10\sqrt{2}$.

The second equation $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + (\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ implies that $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$. This means that $x = \pm 8$ and $y = \pm 8$. So, we get another square with side length 8 and diagonals of length $8\sqrt{2}$.

The area of a square is given by side length squared. Therefore, the area of the larger square is $10^2 = 100$ and the area of the smaller square is $8^2 = 64$.

The area of the convex polygon formed by the union of the two squares is the sum of the areas of the two squares, which is $100 + 64 = 164$. So, the area of the convex polygon is 164 square units. The answer is: $164$

Approach:


The given equation is a product of two expressions, set equal to zero. Therefore, for the product to be zero, either one of the expressions must be zero. This gives us two separate cases to consider:

Case 1: $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$
Case 2: $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$

Case 1 implies that $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. This gives us four equations based on the signs of $x$ and $y$:
1. $x + y = 10$
2. $x + y = -10$
3. $x - y = 10$
4. $x - y = -10$

These four equations represent the lines forming the sides of the square.

Case 2 implies that $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$, which gives us the lines $x = 8$, $x = -8$, $y = 8$, and $y = -8$.

The intersection of these lines forms a square with side length 10 (the distance between the lines $x + y = 10$ and $x - y = 10$, or $x + y = -10$ and $x - y = -10$).

The area of a square is given by the square of the length of its side, so the area of this square is $10^2 = 100$.

So, the area of the convex polygon is 100.

The answer is: $\boxed{100}$

Solve the following problem with a Python Script (positive numerical answer):
"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"

Assistant:

Approach:



The equation $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ equals to zero if and only if at least one of the factors equals to zero.
This means that either $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$.
The first factor equals to zero if and only if $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. These two equations represent two lines in the coordinate plane, and the points that satisfy both equations are the vertices of a square with side length 10 and center at the origin.
The second factor equals to zero if and only if $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$, which represents a square with side length 16 and center at the origin.
Combining these two cases, the points that satisfy the original equation are the vertices of a square with side length 10, since the square with side length 16 includes the square with side length 10.
The area of a square is calculated as side length squared, so the area of the square is $10^2 = 100$.
The answer is: $100$

Solve the following problem with a Python Script (positive numerical answer):
"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"

Approach:

 The equation $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ is satisfied if either one of the two factors is zero. This means that the points satisfying this equation lie on the intersection of the four curves $\vert x + y \vert - 10 = 0$, $\vert x - y \vert - 10 = 0$, $\vert x \vert - 8 = 0$, and $\vert y \vert - 8 = 0$.

The curves $\vert x \vert - 8 = 0$ and $\vert y \vert - 8 = 0$ represent four lines parallel to the x-axis and y-axis respectively, each at a distance of 8 units from the origin.

The curves $\vert x + y \vert - 10 = 0$ and $\vert x - y \vert - 10 = 0$ represent a square with side length of 20 units centered at the origin. This is because $\vert x + y \vert - 10 = 0$ represents all points $(x, y)$ for which $x + y = \pm 10$, and $\vert x - y \vert - 10 = 0$ represents all points $(x, y)$ for which $x - y = \pm 10$. The intersection of these two sets of points forms a square with side length of 20 units centered at the origin.

The intersection of the square and the lines forms a square with side length of 16 units (since the square is inside the lines at a distance of 8 units from each axis). Therefore, the area of the convex polygon is $16^2 = 256$. The answer is: $256$

Approach:


The given equation is a product of two expressions equal to zero, which means either the first expression is zero or the second expression is zero. We will consider these two cases separately.

Case 1: $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$
This implies that $\vert x + y \vert - 10 = 0$ and $\vert x - y \vert - 10 = 0$, which means $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. This implies that $x + y = \pm 10$ and $x - y = \pm 10$. Solving these equations, we get the vertices of the polygon as $(0, 10)$, $(0, -10)$, $(10, 0)$, and $(-10, 0)$.

Case 2: $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$
This implies that $\vert x \vert - 8 = 0$ and $\vert y \vert - 8 = 0$, which means $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$. This implies that $x = \pm 8$ and $y = \pm 8$. So, the vertices of the polygon also include $(8, 8)$, $(8, -8)$, $(-8, 8)$, and $(-8, -8)$.

Now, we can plot these points on the coordinate plane and observe that they form a square with side length 10 units. The area of a square is given by side length squared, so the area of the square is $10^2 = 100$ square units.

Therefore, the area of the convex polygon is 100 square units. The answer is: $100$
