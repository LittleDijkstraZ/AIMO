Question (hint: positive numerical answer):
"What is the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ when $x$ and $y$ range over all real numbers such that $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$?"
Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:



First, let's rewrite the given equation $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$.
Using the property $|a| = |-a|$, we can rewrite this as $|x-2y| + |2x-y| = 40$.
Now, let's consider two cases:
Case 1: If $x-2y \ge 0$ and $2x-y \ge 0$, then the equation becomes $x-2y + 2x-y = 40$, or $3x-3y = 40$, or $x-y = \frac{40}{3}$.
Case 2: If $x-2y < 0$ and $2x-y < 0$, then the equation becomes $-(x-2y) - (2x-y) = 40$, or $-x+2y -2x+y = 40$, or $-3x+3y = 40$, or $x-y = -\frac{40}{3}$.

Notice that the two cases lead to the same equation $x-y = \pm \frac{40}{3}$.
So, the equation $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$ always holds for $x-y = \pm \frac{40}{3}$.

Now, let's substitute $x-y = \frac{40}{3}$ into the expression we want to minimize, $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$.
Using the fact that $x-y = \frac{40}{3}$, we can solve for $y$ in terms of $x$: $y = x - \frac{40}{3}$.
Substituting this into the expression, we get
$$5x^2+5\left(x-\frac{40}{3}\right)^2-8x\left(x-\frac{40}{3}\right) = 5x^2+5\left(x^2-2\cdot\frac{40}{3}x+\left(\frac{40}{3}\right)^2\right)-8x^2+8\cdot\frac{40}{3}x = 5x^2+5x^2-133\frac{1}{3}x+\frac{1600}{3}-8x^2+266\frac{2}{3}x = -3x^2+\frac{333\frac{1}{3}x}{3}+\frac{1600}{3}.$$
This is a quadratic function of $x$, and its graph opens downward (since the coefficient of $x^2$ is negative). Thus, it has a maximum value.

To find the maximum value of this expression, we can find its derivative with respect to $x$ and set it equal to zero:
$$\frac{d}{dx}(-3x^2+\frac{333\frac{1}{3}x}{3}+\frac{1600}{3}) = -6x + \frac{333\frac{1}{3}}{3} = 0.$$
Solving this equation gives $x = \frac{333\frac{1}{3}}{18} = \frac{100}{3}$.
Substituting this value back into the equation $y = x - \frac{40}{3}$ gives $y = \frac{100}{3} - \frac{40}{3} = \frac{60}{3} = 20$.

Now, we substitute $x = \frac{100}{3}$ and $y = 20$ into the expression $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$:
$$5\left(\frac{100}{3}\right)^2 + 5(20)^2 - 8\left(\frac{100}{3}\right)(20) = \frac{50000}{9} + 2000 - \frac{160000}{3} = \frac{50000}{9} - \frac{480000}{9} + 2000 = \frac{-430000}{9} + 2000 = -\frac{430000}{9} + \frac{18000}{9} = -\frac{412000}{9}.$$
So, the minimum value of the expression is $-\frac{412000}{9}$. However, this doesn't seem to be a reasonable numerical answer.

Upon reexamination, we realize that we made a mistake in the setup of the equation in Case 2. The correct setup should be:
Case 2: If $x-2y < 0$ and $2x-y > 0$, then the equation becomes $-(x-2y) + (2x-y) = 40$, or $-x+2y +2x-y = 40$, or $x+y = 40$.

Solving the equation $x-y = \frac{40}{3}$ and $x+y = 40$ simultaneously, we get $x = \frac{40}{3} + \frac{80}{3} = \frac{120}{3} = 40$ and $y = 40 - 40 = 0$.

Substituting these values into the expression $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$, we get
$$5(40)^2 + 5(0)^2 - 8(40)(0) = 8000.$$
So, the minimum value of the expression is 8000.

Therefore, the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ when $x$ and $y$ range over all real numbers such that $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$ is 8000. The answer is: 8000

Question (hint: positive numerical answer):
"What is the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ when $x$ and $y$ range over all real numbers such that $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$?"
Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:


We can start by using the hint provided and rewrite the equation $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$ as $|x-2y| + |2y-x| = 40$. 
Then, by the triangle inequality, we know that $|a| + |b| \geq |a+b|$, so $|x-2y| + |2y-x| \geq |(x-2y) + (2y-x)| = 0$.
This means that $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 0$ if and only if $x=2y$ or $y=2x$. 
Let's assume $x=2y$. Substituting this into the equation we want to minimize gives $5x^2+5(\frac{x}{2})^2-8x(\frac{x}{2})=5x^2+\frac{5x^2}{4}-4x^2= \frac{15x^2}{4}$.
Now, we substitute $x=2y$ into the given equation $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$ to get $|2y-2y| + |y-4y| = 40$, which simplifies to $0 + |-3y| = 40$ and gives us $3|y| = 40$. Solving for $y$ we get $|y| = \frac{40}{3}$. Hence, $y = \pm \frac{40}{3}$. Since $x=2y$, we have $x = \pm \frac{80}{3}$.
So the minimum value occurs at $x = \frac{80}{3}$ and $y = -\frac{40}{3}$.
Now, we substitute these values into the expression $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ to find the minimum value: $5(\frac{80}{3})^2+5(-\frac{40}{3})^2-8(\frac{80}{3})(-\frac{40}{3})= \frac{32000}{9} + \frac{6400}{9} + \frac{32000}{9} = \frac{64000}{9}$.
The minimum value of the expression is $\frac{64000}{9}$.
The answer is: $64000/9$

Question (hint: positive numerical answer):
"What is the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ when $x$ and $y$ range over all real numbers such that $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$?"
Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:


The expression $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ can be rewritten as $(5x^2-8xy+5y^2) = (5x^2-8xy+4y^2+y^2) = ((√5x-√5y)^2 + (y-2x)^2)$. This is a sum of squares and is always nonnegative.

Now let's consider the constraint $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$. Without loss of generality, assume that $x \geq 2y$. Then $x-2y \geq 0$, and the constraint becomes $x-2y + y-2x = 40$. Simplifying gives $-x - y = 40$, or $x + y = -40$.

Squaring this equation, we get $x^2 + 2xy + y^2 = 1600$. Multiplying this by 5, we get $5x^2 + 10xy + 5y^2 = 8000$. Rearranging terms, we get $5x^2 + 5y^2 - 8xy = 8000 - 6xy$.

We want to minimize the expression $(5x^2-8xy+5y^2)$, so we want to minimize $-6xy$ given the constraint $x + y = -40$.

To minimize $-6xy$, we need to maximize $xy$. Using the constraint $x + y = -40$, we can rewrite $xy$ as $\frac{x^2 + y^2 - (x+y)^2}{4} = \frac{x^2 + y^2 - 1600}{4}$. To maximize this, we need to maximize $x^2 + y^2$. But we know from the constraint that $x^2 + 2xy + y^2 = 1600$, so $x^2 + y^2 = 1600 - 2xy$. Substituting this into the expression for $xy$, we get $xy = \frac{1600 - 2xy - 1600}{4} = \frac{-2xy}{4} = -\frac{xy}{2}$. So to maximize $xy$, we need $xy = 0$. This happens when either $x=0$ or $y=0$. Without loss of generality, let's take $x=0$, so $y=-40$.

Then, substituting these values into the expression $(5x^2-8xy+5y^2)$, we get $5(0)^2 - 8(0)(-40) + 5(-40)^2 = 0 + 0 + 8000 = 8000$.

Therefore, the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ is 8000. The answer is: $8000$.

Question (hint: positive numerical answer):
"What is the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ when $x$ and $y$ range over all real numbers such that $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$?"
Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:


We can rewrite the given equation as $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$.
By the triangle inequality, we have $|x-2y| + |y-2x| \geq |x-2y + y-2x| = |-(x-y)| = |y-x|$.
So, $|y-x| = 40$. This means $y-x = \pm 40$.
Without loss of generality, let's assume $y-x = 40$.
Then $y = x + 40$. Substituting this into the equation $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$,
we get $|x-2(x+40)| + |(x+40)-2x| = 40$, which simplifies to $|x-2x-80| + |x+40-2x| = 40$.
This further simplifies to $|-x-80| + |-x+40| = 40$.
Both absolute values are non-negative, so we have $-x-80 + -x+40 = 40$,
which simplifies to $-2x-40 = 40$.
Adding $2x$ to both sides gives $-40 = 40 - 2x$,
and adding $2x$ again gives $2x = 80$,
so $x = 40$. Substituting $x = 40$ into $y = x + 40$ gives $y = 80$.
Now we can substitute $x=40$ and $y=80$ into the expression $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ to get
$5(40)^2+5(80)^2-8(40)(80) = 8000+32000-25600 = 10400$.
So the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ is 10400.
The answer is: $\boxed{10400}$.

Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:


First, let's simplify the expression $|x-2y| + |y-2x|$.
$|x-2y| + |y-2x| = |x-2y| + |2y-x| = |x-2y| - |x-2y| = 0$.
However, this is a contradiction because $0$ cannot equal $40$.
So, there must be a mistake in our calculations.
Let's go back and check our work.
We have $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$.
By the absolute value property, we can split this into two cases:
Case 1: $x-2y + y-2x = 40$. Simplifying gives $-y = 40$, which is not possible.
Case 2: $x-2y - (y-2x) = 40$. Simplifying gives $x-2y - y + 2x = 40$, which simplifies further to $3x - 3y = 40$, or $x - y = \frac{40}{3}$.
Now, let's solve for $y$ in terms of $x$: $y = x - \frac{40}{3}$.
We can substitute this into the expression $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$:
\[5x^2 + 5\left(x - \frac{40}{3}\right)^2 - 8x\left(x - \frac{40}{3}\right).\]
Expanding and simplifying gives
\[5x^2 + 5\left(x^2 - \frac{80}{3}x + \frac{1600}{9}\right) - 8x^2 + \frac{320}{3}x.\]
Further simplifying gives
\[5x^2 + 5x^2 - \frac{400}{3}x + \frac{1600}{9} - 8x^2 + \frac{320}{3}x.\]
Combining like terms gives
\[2x^2 + \frac{160}{3}x + \frac{1600}{9}.\]
Now, let's complete the square to find the minimum value of this expression.
The expression $2x^2 + \frac{160}{3}x + \frac{1600}{9}$ can be written as $2\left(x^2 + \frac{80}{3}x\right) + \frac{1600}{9}$.
To complete the square, we need to add and subtract $\left(\frac{80}{6}\right)^2 = \frac{6400}{36}$ inside the parentheses:
\[2\left(x^2 + \frac{80}{3}x + \frac{6400}{36} - \frac{6400}{36}\right) + \frac{1600}{9}.\]
This simplifies to
\[2\left(\left(x + \frac{40}{6}\right)^2 - \frac{6400}{36}\right) + \frac{1600}{9}.\]
Expanding gives
\[2\left(x + \frac{40}{6}\right)^2 - 2\cdot \frac{6400}{36} + \frac{1600}{9}.\]
This further simplifies to
\[2\left(x + \frac{40}{6}\right)^2 - \frac{6400}{18} + \frac{1600}{9}.\]
Combining like terms gives
\[2\left(x + \frac{40}{6}\right)^2 - \frac{6400}{18} + \frac{3200}{18}.\]
This simplifies to
\[2\left(x + \frac{40}{6}\right)^2 - \frac{3200}{18}.\]
Since the square of a real number is always nonnegative, the minimum value of the expression $2\left(x + \frac{40}{6}\right)^2 - \frac{3200}{18}$ is $0$ when $x + \frac{40}{6} = 0$.
Solving for $x$ gives $x = -\frac{40}{6} = -\frac{20}{3}$.
Substituting this value into the expression $y = x - \frac{40}{3}$ gives
\[y = -\frac{20}{3} - \frac{40}{3} = -\frac{60}{3} = -20.\]
So the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ when $x$ and $y$ satisfy the given condition is
\[5\left(-\frac{20}{3}\right)^2 + 5(-20)^2 - 8\left(-\frac{20}{3}\right)(-20) = \frac{2000}{3} + 2000 + \frac{32000}{3} = \frac{64000}{3}.\]
However, this is not an integer, so there must be an error in our calculations.
Let's go back and reevaluate our work.
We have found that the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ when $x$ and $y$ satisfy the given condition occurs at $x = -\frac{20}{3}$ and $y = -20$.
Let's substitute these values into the expression $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$:
\[5\left(-\frac{20}{3}\right)^2 + 5(-20)^2 - 8\left(-\frac{20}{3}\right)(-20).\]
Simplifying gives
\[\frac{2000}{3} + 2000 + \frac{32000}{3} = \frac{64000}{3}.\]
This is not an integer, so there must be an error in our calculations.

Question (hint: positive numerical answer):
"What is the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ when $x$ and $y$ range over all real numbers such that $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$?"
Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:


First, we notice that the equation $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$ is equivalent to $|x-2y| = 20 - |y-2x|$.
This means that $x-2y$ and $y-2x$ have the same sign or one of them is zero.

Case 1: $x-2y = 0$ and $y-2x = 0$. This gives us $x=y=0$.

Case 2: $x-2y$ and $y-2x$ have the same sign. Without loss of generality, assume that they are both positive. Then we have $x-2y = 20 - (y-2x)$, which simplifies to $3x = 4y + 20$. Similarly, if they are both negative, we have $x-2y = -(20 - (y-2x))$, which simplifies to $3x = -4y - 20$.

In either case, we have $3x = 4y + 20$. We can substitute this into $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$ to get $|3x/3 - 2y| + |y - 2(3x/4)| = 40$, which simplifies to $|x - 2y| + |y - 3x/2| = 40$. This is true for any values of $x$ and $y$ that satisfy $3x = 4y + 20$.

Now, we substitute $3x = 4y + 20$ into the expression $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ to get
\[5x^2+5y^2-8xy = 5(3x/4)^2 + 5(x/3)^2 - 8(3x/4)(x/3) = 9x^2/8 + x^2/3 - 2x^2 = (35x^2)/24 - 2x^2 = (5x^2)/24.\]
To minimize this expression, we need to minimize $x^2$. From $3x = 4y + 20$, we can solve for $y$ to get $y = (3x-20)/4$. Substituting this into $|x - 2y| + |y - 3x/2| = 40$, we get
\[|x - 2((3x-20)/4)| + |((3x-20)/4) - 3x/2| = 40.\]
Simplifying this equation gives us $x = 10$. Substituting $x = 10$ into $3x = 4y + 20$, we get $y = 5$.

Finally, we substitute $x = 10$ and $y = 5$ into $(5x^2)/24$ to get $(5*10^2)/24 = 250/12 = 20.833...$. However, this does not satisfy the original equation $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$. So, we must have made a mistake somewhere.

After reviewing our work, we realize that we made a mistake in our assumption that $x-2y$ and $y-2x$ have the same sign. The correct assumption should be that $x-2y$ and $y-2x$ have opposite signs. This means that $x-2y = 20 - (y-2x)$, which simplifies to $3x = -4y + 20$. Similarly, if they have opposite signs, we have $x-2y = -(20 - (y-2x))$, which simplifies to $3x = 4y - 20$.

Without loss of generality, assume that $3x = 4y - 20$. We can substitute this into $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$ to get $|3x/3 - 2y| + |y - 2(3x/4)| = 40$, which simplifies to $|x - 2y| + |y - 3x/2| = 40$. This is true for any values of $x$ and $y$ that satisfy $3x = 4y - 20$.

Now, we substitute $3x = 4y - 20$ into the expression $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ to get
\[5x^2+5y^2-8xy = 5(3x/4)^2 + 5(x/3)^2 - 8(3x/4)(x/3) = 9x^2/8 + x^2/3 - 2x^2 = (35x^2)/24 - 2x^2 = (-5x^2)/24.\]
To minimize this expression, we need to minimize $x^2$. From $3x = 4y - 20$, we can solve for $y$ to get $y = (3x+20)/4$. Substituting this into $|x - 2y| + |y - 3x/2| = 40$, we get
\[|x - 2((3x+20)/4)| + |((3x+20)/4) - 3x/2| = 40.\]
Simplifying this equation gives us $x = -10$. Substituting $x = -10$ into $3x = 4y - 20$, we get $y = -5$.

Finally, we substitute $x = -10$ and $y = -5$ into $(-5x^2)/24$ to get $(-5*(-10)^2)/24 = -250/12 = -20.833...$. This does satisfy the original equation $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$.

So, the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ when $x$ and $y$ range over all real numbers such that $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$ is $-20.833...$. However, this is not possible because the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ must be a negative number. This suggests that we made another mistake in our work.

After reviewing our work again, we realize that we should not have switched the sign of $x^2$ in our calculations. The expression $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ should be minimized when $x$ and $y$ are equal to $10$ and $5$, respectively. Substituting $x = 10$ and $y = 5$ into $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$, we get $5*10^2 + 5*5^2 - 8*10*5 = 500

Question (hint: positive numerical answer):
"What is the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ when $x$ and $y$ range over all real numbers such that $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$?"
Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:



The given equation $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$ is equivalent to $|2y-x| + |2x-y| = 40$, which is the sum of the distances between the numbers $2y$ and $x$, and $2x$ and $y$. This sum of distances is equal to a fixed constant 40. This means that the numbers $2y$, $x$, and $2x$, and $y$ must be in the arithmetic progression.

So we have the following system of equations:
$2y - x = y - 2x$,
$2x - y = y - x$.

From the first equation, we get $x = y$. Substituting this into the second equation gives $x = 2y$, which also implies $y = \frac{x}{2}$. Substituting these into the given equation $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$ gives $|x - x| + |x/2 - x| = 40$, which simplifies to $|0| + |x/2 - x| = 40$. This gives $|x/2 - x| = 40$, or $|x/2 - 2x/2| = 40$, or $|-x/2| = 40$, or $|x| = 80$. Therefore, we have $x = \pm 80$. Since $y = \frac{x}{2}$, we have $y = \pm 40$.

Now we substitute $x = 80$ and $y = 40$ into the given expression $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ to get $5(80)^2+5(40)^2-8(80)(40) = 32000+8000-25600 = 9600$.

And if we substitute $x = -80$ and $y = -40$ into the given expression, we also get $9600$.

Therefore, the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ when $x$ and $y$ range over all real numbers such that $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$ is $9600$. The answer is: $9600$

Question (hint: positive numerical answer):
"What is the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ when $x$ and $y$ range over all real numbers such that $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$?"
Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:


First, we can rewrite the equation $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$ as $|2x-y| + |2y-x| = 40$.
By the triangle inequality, we have $|2x-y| + |2y-x| \ge |(2x-y) - (2y-x)| = |x-3y|$.
So, we have $|x-3y| = 40$.

Now, let's rewrite the expression $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ as $\frac{5}{2}[(x^2-2xy+y^2) + (x^2-6xy+9y^2)] = \frac{5}{2}[(x-y)^2 + (x-3y)^2]$.
By substituting $|x-3y| = 40$, we have $\frac{5}{2}[(x-y)^2 + 40^2] \ge \frac{5}{2} \cdot 40^2 = 4000$.
Therefore, the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ is $4000$. The answer is: $4000$

Question (hint: positive numerical answer):
"What is the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ when $x$ and $y$ range over all real numbers such that $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$?"
Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:



We first observe that $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$ can be rewritten as $|2y-x| + |2x-y| = 40$.
We can rewrite this as $|2y-x| + |x-2y| = 40$ since $|a| = |-a|$.
By the triangle inequality, we know that $|a| + |b| \ge |a+b|$ for all real numbers $a$ and $b$.
So, we have $|2y-x| + |x-2y| \ge |(2y-x) + (x-2y)| = 0$.
But $|2y-x| + |x-2y| = 40$ implies that this equality must hold.
So, $(2y-x)$ and $(x-2y)$ must have the same sign.
Without loss of generality, let's assume that $(2y-x)$ and $(x-2y)$ are both positive.
Then we have $2y-x > 0$ and $x-2y > 0$, which implies that $x > 2y$ and $x > y/2$.
The solution to these inequalities is $y/2 < x < 2y$.
Now, we want to minimize the expression $5x^2 + 5y^2 - 8xy$.
By completing the square, we can rewrite this as $5(x^2 - \frac{8}{5}xy + y^2) = 5[(x-4y/5)^2 - \frac{16}{25}y^2] = 5(x-4y/5)^2 - \frac{16}{5}y^2$.
To minimize this expression, we need to minimize $(x-4y/5)^2$ and maximize $- \frac{16}{5}y^2$.
Since $(x-4y/5)^2$ is always non-negative, we need to minimize $y^2$ while ensuring that $x > 2y$ and $x > y/2$.
From $y/2 < x < 2y$, we can deduce that the minimum value of $y^2$ is achieved when $y = \frac{20}{9}$ and $x = \frac{40}{9}$.
Substitute these values back into the expression $5x^2 + 5y^2 - 8xy$, we get
\[5\left(\frac{40}{9}\right)^2 + 5\left(\frac{20}{9}\right)^2 - 8\left(\frac{40}{9}\right)\left(\frac{20}{9}\right) = -\frac{800}{9}.\]
Therefore, the minimum value of $5x^2 + 5y^2 - 8xy$ when $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$ is $-\frac{800}{9}$.
The answer is: $-\frac{800}{9}$

Question (hint: positive numerical answer):
"What is the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ when $x$ and $y$ range over all real numbers such that $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$?"
Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:


First, we note that $|x - 2y| + |y - 2x| = 40$ is equivalent to $|2x - y| + |2y - x| = 40$.
Then by the triangle inequality, we know that $|2x - y| + |2y - x| \ge |(2x - y) - (2y - x)| = |x - 3y|$.
So, $|x - 3y| = 40$.
Squaring both sides, we get $(x - 3y)^2 = 1600$.
Expanding, we have $x^2 - 6xy + 9y^2 = 1600$.
Now, we consider the expression $5x^2 + 5y^2 - 8xy$. We can rewrite it as $5(x^2 + y^2) - 8xy$.
We know that $(x^2 + y^2) = (x^2 - 6xy + 9y^2) + 10xy = 1600 + 10xy$.
Substituting this into the expression, we have $5(1600 + 10xy) - 8xy = 8000 + 50xy - 8xy = 8000 + 42xy$.
Now, we need to find the minimum value of this expression.
By the Cauchy-Schwarz inequality, we know that $(1 + 49)^((x^2 + y^2)/2) \ge (x + 7y)^2$.
Simplifying, we get $(50)^{((x^2 + y^2)/2)} \ge (x + 7y)^2$.
Taking the square root of both sides, we have $50^{(x^2 + y^2)/2} \ge |x + 7y|$.
Since $|x - 3y| = 40$, we have $|x + 7y| = |x - 3y + 10y| \le |x - 3y| + |10y| = 40 + 10|y| = 40 + 10\cdot\frac{|x - 3y|}{3} = \frac{40(3 + 10)}{3} = \frac{40 \cdot 13}{3} = \frac{520}{3}$.
Therefore, $50^{(x^2 + y^2)/2} \ge \frac{520}{3}$, which implies $50^{(x^2 + y^2)/2} \ge \frac{520}{3}$.
Taking the natural logarithm of both sides, we have $(x^2 + y^2)/2 \ln 50 \ge \ln \frac{520}{3}$.
Dividing by $\ln 50$, we get $(x^2 + y^2)/2 \ge \frac{\ln \frac{520}{3}}{\ln 50}$.
Multiplying by 2, we have $x^2 + y^2 \ge 2 \cdot \frac{\ln \frac{520}{3}}{\ln 50}$.
Now, substituting this back into the expression $8000 + 42xy$, we have $8000 + 42xy \ge 8000 - 42 \cdot 2 \cdot \frac{\ln \frac{520}{3}}{\ln 50}$.
Simplifying, we get $8000 + 42xy \ge 8000 - 42 \cdot \frac{2 \ln \frac{520}{3}}{\ln 50}$.
Therefore, the minimum value of $5x^2 + 5y^2 - 8xy$ is $8000 - 42 \cdot \frac{2 \ln \frac{520}{3}}{\ln 50}$.
To find the numerical value, we can use a calculator.
The minimum value is approximately 4800.
The answer is: $4800$.

Question (hint: positive numerical answer):
"What is the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ when $x$ and $y$ range over all real numbers such that $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$?"
Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:



Firstly, we need to understand the given equation $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$. This equation simplifies to $|x-2y| + |2y-x| = 40$. Since $|a| = |b|$ is equivalent to $a = b$ or $a = -b$, we have:

1. If $x - 2y = 2y - x$, then $x = y$.
2. If $x - 2y = -(2y - x)$, then $x - 2y = -2y + x$, which simplifies to $0 = 0$, which is always true. This means that the conditions are not restrictive for this case.

So, $x = y$. Substituting this into the equation $|x - 2x| + |2x - x| = 40$, we get $| -x | + |x| = 40$, which simplifies to $2|x| = 40$, so $|x| = 20$. Hence, $x = 20$ or $x = -20$. Since $x = y$, $y = 20$ or $y = -20$.

Now, let's substitute $x = y$ into the expression $5x^2 + 5y^2 - 8xy$. We get $5x^2 + 5x^2 - 8x^2 = 2x^2$. Substituting $x = 20$ or $x = -20$, we get $2(20)^2 = 800$ or $2(-20)^2 = 800$ in both cases.

Hence, the minimum value of the expression $5x^2 + 5y^2 - 8xy$ when $x$ and $y$ range over all real numbers such that $|x - 2y| + |y - 2x| = 40$ is $800$. The answer is: $800$

Question (hint: positive numerical answer):
"What is the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ when $x$ and $y$ range over all real numbers such that $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$?"
Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:



We are given that $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$. Let's consider two cases:

Case 1: When $x - 2y \ge 0$ and $y - 2x \ge 0$. In this case, the given equation simplifies to $x - 2y + y - 2x = 40 \implies -x - y = 40 \implies x + y = -40$.

Case 2: When $x - 2y < 0$ and $y - 2x < 0$. In this case, the given equation simplifies to $-(x - 2y) - (y - 2x) = 40 \implies -x + 2y - y + 2x = 40 \implies x + y = -40$.

From both cases, we have the same condition: $x + y = -40$.

Now, we are asked to find the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$. We can rewrite this expression as $5(x^2 + y^2) - 8xy$. We can use the identity $x^2 + y^2 = (x + y)^2 - 2xy$ to rewrite the expression further as $5((x + y)^2 - 2xy) - 8xy = 5(-40)^2 - 18xy = 8000 - 18xy$.

We also have the condition $x + y = -40$, which implies $y = -40 - x$. Substituting this into the expression gives $8000 - 18x(-40 - x) = 8000 + 720x + 18x^2 = 18(x^2 + 40x) + 8000$.

Now, let's consider the quadratic $x^2 + 40x$. Completing the square gives $(x + 20)^2 - 400$. Since the square of a real number is always non-negative, the minimum value of $(x + 20)^2 - 400$ is $-400$, which occurs when $x = -20$.

Therefore, the minimum value of $18(x^2 + 40x) + 8000$ is $18(-400) + 8000 = -7200 + 8000 = 800$.
The answer is: 800

Question (hint: positive numerical answer):
"What is the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ when $x$ and $y$ range over all real numbers such that $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$?"
Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:


To solve this problem, we first need to rewrite the expression $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ in a form that makes it easier to find the minimum value. We can do this by completing the square for the $x$ and $y$ terms.

$5x^2+5y^2-8xy = 5(x^2 - \frac{8}{5}xy) + 5y^2 = 5[(x - \frac{4}{5}y)^2 - \frac{16}{25}y^2] + 5y^2 = 5(x - \frac{4}{5}y)^2 + \frac{5}{25}y^2$.

The first term $5(x - \frac{4}{5}y)^2$ is always non-negative, and the second term $\frac{5}{25}y^2$ is also non-negative. Therefore, the minimum value of the expression $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ is achieved when both terms are zero. This occurs when $x = \frac{4}{5}y$, or equivalently, $y = \frac{5}{4}x$.

Now we substitute $y = \frac{5}{4}x$ into the equation $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$, which gives $|x - 2\cdot \frac{5}{4}x| + |\frac{5}{4}x - 2x| = 40$, or $|x - \frac{5}{2}x| + |\frac{5}{4}x - \frac{8}{4}x| = 40$. Simplifying this gives:

$|-\frac{1}{2}x| + |-\frac{3}{4}x| = 40$.

Since both absolute values are non-negative, we can drop the absolute value signs, and the equation becomes:

$\frac{1}{2}x + \frac{3}{4}x = 40$.

Multiplying through by 4 to clear the fractions gives $2x + 3x = 160$, or $5x = 160$. So $x = 32$. Then $y = \frac{5}{4}x = 40$.

Substitute $x = 32$ and $y = 40$ back into the expression $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$, we get $5(32)^2 + 5(40)^2 - 8(32)(40) = 5 \cdot 1024 + 5 \cdot 1600 - 1280 \cdot 4 = 5120 + 8000 - 5120 = 8000$.

Therefore, the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ is $8000$. The answer is: $8000$.
