Question (hint: positive numerical answer):
"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"
Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:


The product of two numbers is zero if and only if at least one of the numbers is zero. Therefore, the equation $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ must be true for all points $(x, y)$ on the boundary of the polygon.
If $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$, then $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. This implies that $x + y = \pm 10$ and $x - y = \pm 10$, and solving these equations gives us the vertices of the square with side length $20$ centered at $(0,0)$.
If $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$, then $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$, which implies that $x = \pm 8$ and $y = \pm 8$. This gives us the vertices of the square with side length $16$ centered at $(0,0)$.
Combining these two cases, we see that the boundary of the polygon consists of the union of two squares, one with side length $20$ and the other with side length $16$.
The area of a square with side length $a$ is $a^2$, so the area of the polygon is $20^2 + 16^2 = 400 + 256 = 656$. The answer is: $656$

Question (hint: positive numerical answer):
"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"
Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:


The expression $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ is satisfied if and only if either of the following two conditions hold:
(1) $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ or (2) $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$.
For the first condition, $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$, this is only possible if $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. This is the equation of a square with side length 10 and diagonals of length $10\sqrt{2}$.
For the second condition, $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$, this is only possible if $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$. This is the equation of a square with side length 8 and diagonals of length $8\sqrt{2}$.
The union of these two squares forms a larger square with side length 10 and area $10^2 = 100$. Therefore, the area of the convex polygon is 100 square units.
The answer is: $100$

Question (hint: positive numerical answer):
"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"
Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:


The expression equals zero if and only if at least one of the factors equals zero. So, we have two cases to consider:
1) $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ and $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ and $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ and $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$.

2) One of the factors equals zero while the other does not. But this situation is impossible because the factors are products of non-negative numbers, so the product can be zero only if all factors are zero.

From $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$, we get $\vert x + y \vert = 10$, which means $x + y = 10$ or $x + y = -10$. Similarly, from $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$, we get $\vert x - y \vert = 10$, which means $x - y = 10$ or $x - y = -10$. From $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$, we get $\vert x \vert = 8$, which means $x = 8$ or $x = -8$. And from $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$, we get $\vert y \vert = 8$, which means $y = 8$ or $y = -8$.

Combining all these, we get the vertices of the polygon are $(8,8)$, $(8,-8)$, $(-8,8)$, $(-8,-8)$, $(10,0)$, $(-10,0)$, $(0,10)$, and $(0,-10)$. These points form a square with side length 16. The area of the square is $16^2 = 256$. The answer is: $256$.

Question (hint: positive numerical answer):
"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"
Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:



First, we need to understand that the expression $AB=0$ if and only if either $A=0$ or $B=0$. Thus, the given equation $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ is satisfied when either of the following two conditions holds:

1) $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$
2) $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$

From condition 1, we have $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. This implies that $x + y = \pm 10$ and $x - y = \pm 10$. Solving these four equations, we get the vertices of the polygon as $(0, 10)$, $(0, -10)$, $(10, 0)$, and $(-10, 0)$.

From condition 2, we have $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$. This implies that $x = \pm 8$ and $y = \pm 8$. Solving these four equations, we get the vertices of the polygon as $(8, 8)$, $(8, -8)$, $(-8, 8)$, and $(-8, -8)$.

Thus, the polygon is a square with side length 10. The area of the square is $10 \times 10 = 100$.

The answer is: $100$

Question (hint: positive numerical answer):
"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"
Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:


The equation $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ implies that either $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$. 

The first equation can only hold when both $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. These two equations imply that $x = \pm y$.

The second equation can only hold when both $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$, or equivalently $x = \pm 8$ and $y = \pm 8$.

Therefore, the graph consists of the four lines $y = x$, $y = -x$, $x = 8$, and $y = 8$. These lines form a rectangle with side lengths $16$ and $20$, hence its area is $16 \times 20 = 320$.
The answer is: $320$

Question (hint: positive numerical answer):
"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"
Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:


First, we notice that the product of two numbers is zero if and only if one or both of the numbers are zero. So we have two separate cases to consider.

Case 1: $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$.
This is only possible if both $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ and $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$, which means $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. The absolute value equation can be broken down into two separate equations:
1) $x + y = 10$ or $x + y = -10$
2) $x - y = 10$ or $x - y = -10$

Solving these four equations gives us the vertices of the rectangle: $(10, 0)$, $(0, 10)$, $(-10, 0)$, and $(0, -10)$.

Case 2: $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$.
This is only possible if both $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ and $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$, which means $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$. The absolute value equations can be broken down into two separate equations:
1) $x = 8$ or $x = -8$
2) $y = 8$ or $y = -8$

Solving these four equations gives us the vertices of the square: $(8, 8)$, $(8, -8)$, $(-8, 8)$, and $(-8, -8)$.

The vertices of the polygon are the intersections of the vertices from Case 1 and Case 2, which are: $(8, 8)$, $(8, -8)$, $(-8, 8)$, and $(-8, -8)$. These form a square with side length 10.

To find the area of this square, we simply square the side length: $10^2 = 100$. The area of the square is 100 square units. The answer is: $100$

"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"
Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:


The equation $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + (\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ forces both $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10.$ The only way both of these equations can be true is if $(x, y)$ is one of the points of the square with vertices at $(\pm 10, 0)$ and $(0, \pm 10).$ Similarly, the equation $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + (\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ forces both $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8.$ The only way both of these equations can be true is if $(x, y)$ is one of the points of the square with vertices at $(\pm 8, 0)$ and $(0, \pm 8).$ The intersection of these two squares is a square with side length $10 - 8 = 2$ and thus an area of $2^2 = 4.$

Therefore the area of the convex polygon is 4 square units.
The answer is: $4$

Question (hint: positive numerical answer):
"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"
Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:



The equation $f(x, y) g(x, y) = 0$ is satisfied if and only if $f(x, y) = 0$ or $g(x, y) = 0$. Thus, the given equation is equivalent to the union of the following two sets of points:

1) The points $\left(x, y\right)$ that satisfy $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + (\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$, and
2) The points $\left(x, y\right)$ that satisfy $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + (\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$.

From the first equation, we get $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. The set of points that satisfy either of these equations is a square with side length 20, centered at the origin $(0,0)$, and with sides parallel to the axes.

From the second equation, we get $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$. The set of points that satisfy either of these equations is a square with side length 16, also centered at the origin, with sides parallel to the axes.

The intersection of these two squares is the square with side length 8 and centered at the origin, and this square is the convex polygon in question. The area of a square is given by the square of the length of its side, so the area of this convex polygon is $8^2 = 64$. The answer is: $64$.

First, we notice that the product of two expressions is zero if and only if at least one of the expressions is zero. Therefore, we have two cases to consider:

Case 1: $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$. This means that both $\vert x + y \vert - 10 = 0$ and $\vert x - y \vert - 10 = 0$, so $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. This implies that $x + y = \pm 10$ and $x - y = \pm 10$. Solving these equations gives us the points $(5,5)$, $(5,-5)$, $(-5,5)$, and $(-5,-5)$.

Case 2: $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$. This means that both $\vert x \vert - 8 = 0$ and $\vert y \vert - 8 = 0$, so $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$. This implies that $x = \pm 8$ and $y = \pm 8$. So we have the points $(8,8)$, $(8,-8)$, $(-8,8)$, and $(-8,-8)$.

Combining these points, we find that the vertices of the polygon are $(5,5)$, $(5,-5)$, $(-5,5)$, $(-5,-5)$, $(8,8)$, $(8,-8)$, $(-8,8)$, and $(-8,-8)$. These points form a square with side length 10. The area of a square is given by the square of the length of its side, so the area of the square is $10^2 = 100$. Therefore, the area of the convex polygon is 100 square units. The answer is: $100$
