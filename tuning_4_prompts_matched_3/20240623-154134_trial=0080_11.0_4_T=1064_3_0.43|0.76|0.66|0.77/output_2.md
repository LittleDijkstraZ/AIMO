The equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has 4 distinct solutions if and only if $\frac{m}{100}$ is strictly between 1 and 2. This is because the function $f(x) = \vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert$ has a graph that is a "V" shape with vertices at $x=1$ and $x=3$, and the distance between the vertices is 2. So, for $f(x)$ to have 4 distinct solutions, the right hand side of the equation, $\frac{m}{100}$, must be strictly between 1 and 2.

This gives us the inequality $1 < \frac{m}{100} < 2$. Multiplying all sides of the inequality by 100 gives $100 < m < 200$. The positive integers $m$ that satisfy this inequality are the integers from 101 to 199, inclusive. To find the number of these integers, we subtract the smallest integer from the largest and add 1. So, the number of positive integers $m$ is $199 - 101 + 1 = 99$.

So, the number of positive integers $m$ for which the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has 4 distinct solutions is 99. The answer is: $99$

We know that the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has 4 distinct solutions. 

The equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ is equivalent to the system of equations:

1. $\vert x-1 \vert -2 = \frac{m}{100}$
2. $\vert x-1 \vert -2 = -\frac{m}{100}$
3. $-\vert x-1 \vert +2 = \frac{m}{100}$
4. $-\vert x-1 \vert +2 = -\frac{m}{100}$

Each of these equations has 2 sub-cases:

1.1. $x-1 -2 = \frac{m}{100}$
1.2. $-(x-1) -2 = \frac{m}{100}$
2.1. $x-1 -2 = -\frac{m}{100}$
2.2. $-(x-1) -2 = -\frac{m}{100}$
3.1. $-(x-1) +2 = \frac{m}{100}$
3.2. $x-1 +2 = \frac{m}{100}$
4.1. $-(x-1) +2 = -\frac{m}{100}$
4.2. $x-1 +2 = -\frac{m}{100}$

Solving each of these sub-cases gives us the values of $x$ in terms of $m$. 

Then we substitute these values into the original equation and solve for $m$.

Finally, we count the number of positive integer solutions for $m$.

The number of positive integer solutions for $m$ is 1.
The answer is: $1$

The equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has $4$ distinct solutions, we need to find the number of positive integers $m$ such that the equation has $4$ distinct solutions.

We know that $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ is equivalent to the system of equations:

1. $\vert x-1 \vert -2 = \frac{m}{100}$
2. $\vert x-1 \vert -2 = -\frac{m}{100}$
3. $-\vert x-1 \vert +2 = \frac{m}{100}$
4. $-\vert x-1 \vert +2 = -\frac{m}{100}$

Each of these equations has $2$ cases to consider:

1. $\vert x-1 \vert = 2 + \frac{m}{100}$ and $\vert x-1 \vert = 2 - \frac{m}{100}$
2. $\vert x-1 \vert = -2 + \frac{m}{100}$ and $\vert x-1 \vert = -2 - \frac{m}{100}$

For each of these cases, we need to find the number of positive integers $m$ such that the equation has $4$ distinct solutions.

For each case, we need to find the range of $m$ such that the equation has $4$ distinct solutions.

After finding the range of $m$ for each case, we can find the intersection of these ranges to get the final range of $m$.

The number of positive integers in the final range of $m$ is the number of positive integers $m$ such that the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has $4$ distinct solutions.

Python Script:

```python

def count_positive_integers():
    # Define the ranges of m for each case
    range1 = [m for m in range(1, 201) if 2 + m/100 > 0 and 2 - m/100 > 0 and 2 + m/100 > 2 - m/100]
    range2 = [m for m in range(1, 201) if -2 + m/100 > 0 and -2 - m/100 < 0 and -2 + m/100 > -2 - m/100]

    # Find the intersection of the ranges
    intersection = list(set(range1) & set(range2))

    # Return the number of positive integers in the intersection
    return len(intersection)

The Python script seems to have an error. The ranges of $m$ for each case should be calculated correctly, but the intersection of the ranges is empty. Let's re-examine the problem and the ranges of $m$ for each case.

For the first case, $\vert x-1 \vert = 2 + \frac{m}{100}$ and $\vert x-1 \vert = 2 - \frac{m}{100}$, the range of $m$ is $0 < m < 200$.

For the second case, $\vert x-1 \vert = -2 + \frac{m}{100}$ and $\vert x-1 \vert = -2 - \frac{m}{100}$, the range of $m$ is $0 < m < 400$.

The intersection of these ranges is $0 < m < 200$, which means the number of positive integers $m$ such that the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has $4$ distinct solutions is the number of positive integers in the range $0 < m < 200$, which is $199$.

So, the number of positive integers $m$ such that the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has $4$ distinct solutions is $199$.

The answer is: $199$

Approach:



The equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has 4 distinct solutions if and only if $\frac{m}{100}$ is strictly between 1 and 2. This is because the function $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert$ has a graph that is a series of V-shapes, with the $i$-th V-shape corresponding to $i$ solutions for the equation when $\frac{m}{100}=i$. Therefore, we need to find the value of $m$ such that $\frac{m}{100}$ is strictly between 1 and 2.

This can be achieved by multiplying both sides of the inequality $1 < \frac{m}{100} < 2$ by 100 to get $100 < m < 200$. The positive integers $m$ that satisfy this inequality are the integers from 101 to 199, inclusive. To find the number of such integers, we subtract the smallest integer from the largest and add 1.

So, the number of positive integers $m$ that satisfy the condition is $199 - 101 + 1 = 99$.

Therefore, the number of positive integers $m$ for which the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has 4 distinct solutions is 99. The answer is: $99$

Approach:



The equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has $4$ distinct solutions if and only if $\frac{m}{100}$ is strictly between $1$ and $2$. This is because the function $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert$ has a graph that is a series of "V"s, with the $x$-intercepts occurring at integer values. The number of distinct solutions is equal to the number of "V"s that the value $\frac{m}{100}$ falls within.

So we want to find the number of positive integers $m$ such that $1<\frac{m}{100}<2$. Multiplying all sides of the inequalities by $100$ gives $100<m<200$. The number of positive integers in this range is $200-100-1=99$.

So the number of positive integers $m$ for which the equation has $4$ distinct solutions is $99$.

The answer is: $99$

Approach:


We first note that the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has 4 distinct solutions if and only if $\frac{m}{100}$ is strictly between 1 and 2. This is because the function $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert$ oscillates between 1 and 2. Therefore, we have $1 < \frac{m}{100} < 2$, which implies $100 < m < 200$. The positive integers $m$ that satisfy this inequality are the integers from 101 to 199, inclusive. To find the number of these integers, we subtract the smallest integer from the largest and add 1. So the number of positive integers $m$ is $199 - 101 + 1 = 99$.

The answer is: $99$
