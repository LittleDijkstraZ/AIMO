 The equation $| |x - 1| - 2 | = \frac{m}{100}$ has 4 distinct solutions if and only if $\frac{m}{100}$ is equal to the positive difference between 2 and 1, which is 1. Therefore, $m = 100$.

So, the only positive integer $m$ for which the equation has 4 distinct solutions is 100.

```python

Analyze this problem and think step by step to come to a solution with programs. After solving the problem, output the final numerical answer within \boxed{}.

Assistant:

 To solve this problem, we need to analyze the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ and find for how many positive integers $m$ it has $4$ distinct solutions.

The equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ is a piecewise function with four cases to consider based on the absolute value inside the absolute value. We can break it down into four cases:

1. If $\vert x-1 \vert -2 > 0$, then the equation becomes $\vert x-1 \vert -2 = \frac{m}{100}$.
2. If $\vert x-1 \vert -2 < 0$, then the equation becomes $-( \vert x-1 \vert -2 ) = \frac{m}{100}$, which simplifies to $\vert x-1 \vert -2 = -\frac{m}{100}$.
3. If $\vert x-1 \vert -2 = 0$, then the equation becomes $\vert x-1 \vert = 2$, which gives us two solutions: $x = 3$ and $x = -1$.

Now, we need to solve the first two cases for $x$:

1. $\vert x-1 \vert -2 = \frac{m}{100}$ gives us $\vert x-1 \vert = 2 + \frac{m}{100}$, which leads to two equations: $x-1 = 2 + \frac{m}{100}$ and $x-1 = -(2 + \frac{m}{100})$. Solving these equations gives us $x = 3 + \frac{m}{100}$ and $x = -1 - \frac{m}{100}$.

2. $\vert x-1 \vert -2 = -\frac{m}{100}$ gives us $\vert x-1 \vert = 2 - \frac{m}{100}$. This equation has solutions only if $2 - \frac{m}{100} > 0$, i.e., $m < 200$. The two equations are $x-1 = 2 - \frac{m}{100}$ and $x-1 = -(2 - \frac{m}{100})$, which lead to $x = 3 - \frac{m}{100}$ and $x = -1 + \frac{m}{100}$.

For the equation to have four distinct solutions, the two solutions from the third case ($x = 3$ and $x = -1$) must be different from the four solutions from the first and second cases. This means that none of the four solutions from the first and second cases can be equal to $3$ or $-1$. 

Setting $x = 3 + \frac{m}{100}$ equal to $3$ gives $\frac{m}{100} = 0$, which is not possible. Setting $x = -1 - \frac{m}{100}$ equal to $-1$ gives $-\frac{m}{100} = 0$, which is also not possible. Setting $x = 3 - \frac{m}{100}$ equal to $3$ gives $\frac{m}{100} = 0$, which is not possible. Setting $x = -1 + \frac{m}{100}$ equal to $-1$ gives $\frac{m}{100} = 0$, which is not possible.

Therefore, the four solutions from the first and second cases must be distinct from each other. This means that the distances between consecutive solutions must be greater than $0$. The distances between the consecutive solutions from the first case are $\frac{1}{100}$, and the distances between the consecutive solutions from the second case are also $\frac{1}{100}$. Therefore, for the equation to have four distinct solutions, the value of $\frac{m}{100}$ must be less than $2$. This gives us $0 < \frac{m}{100} < 2$, which implies $0 < m < 200$.

Since $m$ is a positive integer, the possible values of $m$ are the integers from $1$ to $199$. Therefore, there are $199$ positive integers $m$ for which the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has $4$ distinct solutions. The answer is: $199$

Assistant:

 The equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has 4 distinct solutions if and only if $\frac{m}{100}$ is strictly between 1 and 2. This is because the expression on the left side of the equation, $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert$, can take on any value from 0 to 3, and it takes on the value of 1 or 2 exactly 4 times. Therefore, we have $1 < \frac{m}{100} < 2$, which implies $100 < m < 200$. The positive integers $m$ that satisfy this inequality are the integers from 101 to 199, inclusive. To find the number of these integers, we subtract the smallest integer from the largest and add 1. So the number of positive integers $m$ is $199 - 101 + 1 = 99$. The answer is: $99$

Assistant:

 The number of distinct solutions to the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ is equal to 4 if and only if $\frac{m}{100} = 2$. This is because the expression on the left side of the equation, $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert$, can take on the value of 2 exactly 4 times.

So, we need to solve the equation $\frac{m}{100} = 2$ for $m$. Multiplying both sides of the equation by 100 gives $m = 200$.

Therefore, the only positive integer $m$ for which the equation has 4 distinct solutions is 200. The answer is: $200$

Assistant:

 The number of distinct solutions of the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ is equal to 4 if and only if $\frac{m}{100} = 2$.
This is because the expression on the left side of the equation, $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert$, can take on the values 0, 1, 2, or 3, but only for $\frac{m}{100} = 2$ does it take on 4 distinct values.

To solve for $m$, we can multiply both sides of the equation $\frac{m}{100} = 2$ by 100 to get $m = 200$.

Therefore, the value of $m$ that makes the equation have 4 distinct solutions is 200. The answer is: $200$

Assistant:

 The number of distinct solutions of the equation $| |x - 1| - 2| = \frac{m}{100}$ is equal to 4 if and only if $\frac{m}{100} = 1$.
This is because the expression $| |x - 1| - 2|$ can take on the values 0, 1, 2, or 3, and it is equal to 1 only once.
So we have $\frac{m}{100} = 1$, which implies $m = 100$.
Therefore, there is only one positive integer $m$ that satisfies the given condition, and that is $m = 100$. The answer is: $1$

Assistant:

 To solve this problem, we need to analyze the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ and find the values of $m$ for which it has 4 distinct solutions.

The equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ can be rewritten as a piecewise function:

\[
\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\begin{cases}
(\vert x-1 \vert -2) - \frac{m}{100}, & \text{if } \vert x-1 \vert -2 \geq 0 \\
-(\vert x-1 \vert -2) - \frac{m}{100}, & \text{if } \vert x-1 \vert -2 < 0
\end{cases}
\]

Simplifying the above equations, we get:

\[
\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\begin{cases}
\vert x-1 \vert -2 - \frac{m}{100}, & \text{if } x \geq 3 \\
2 - \vert x-1 \vert - \frac{m}{100}, & \text{if } 1 < x < 3 \\
-(\vert x-1 \vert -2) - \frac{m}{100}, & \text{if } x \leq 1
\end{cases}
\]

The equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has 4 distinct solutions if and only if the equation $\vert x-1 \vert -2 = \frac{m}{100}$ has 2 distinct solutions in the interval $(1,3)$, and the equation $2 - \vert x-1 \vert = \frac{m}{100}$ has 2 distinct solutions in the interval $(3, \infty)$.

The equation $\vert x-1 \vert -2 = \frac{m}{100}$ has 2 distinct solutions in the interval $(1,3)$ if and only if $2 - \frac{m}{100} > 0$, which implies $m < 200$.

The equation $2 - \vert x-1 \vert = \frac{m}{100}$ has 2 distinct solutions in the interval $(3, \infty)$ if and only if $2 - \frac{m}{100} < 0$, which implies $m > 200$.

Therefore, the only value of $m$ that satisfies both conditions is $m = 200$.

So, there is only one positive integer $m$ for which the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has 4 distinct solutions, and that is $m = 200$. The answer is: $1$

Assistant:

 The number of distinct solutions of the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ is equal to 4 if and only if $\frac{m}{100}$ is equal to 2. This is because the function $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert$ takes the value 2 exactly four times. Therefore, we have $\frac{m}{100}=2$, which gives $m=200$. So the number of positive integers $m$ for which the equation has 4 distinct solutions is 1, and the answer is $\boxed{1}$.

Here is a Python program that calculates the number of positive integers $m$:

```python


INTERMEDIATE OUT :

def count_m():
    # Since m/100 = 2, then m = 200
    m = 200
    return m

result = count_m()

```

Assistant:

 The equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has 4 distinct solutions if and only if $\frac{m}{100}$ is strictly between 1 and 2. This is because the function $f(x) = \vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert$ has a "V" shape with the "valleys" at $x=1$, $x=3$, and $x=-1$, and the distance between the valleys is 2. If $\frac{m}{100}$ is less than 1, there are no solutions. If it is equal to 1 or greater than 2, there are only 2 or 3 solutions. If it is strictly between 1 and 2, there are 4 solutions. Therefore, we want to find the number of positive integers $m$ such that $1 < \frac{m}{100} < 2$. This is equivalent to $100 < m < 200$. The number of positive integers in this range is $100$. The answer is: $100$
