To find the number of positive integers $m$ for which the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has 4 distinct solutions, we need to analyze the behavior of the equation.

First, let's consider the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$. This equation will have 4 distinct solutions if the right side, $\frac{m}{100}$, falls into a specific range. Specifically, it must be in the range $(0, 2)$.

If $\frac{m}{100} > 2$, then the equation has at most 2 distinct solutions. If $\frac{m}{100} < 0$, then the equation has no solutions.

So, we need to find the number of positive integers $m$ such that $0 < \frac{m}{100} < 2$. This simplifies to $0 < m < 200$.

Now, we need to count the number of positive integers in this range. The positive integers in the range $(0, 200)$ are exactly the integers from 1 to 199.

Therefore, there are 199 positive integers $m$ for which the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has 4 distinct solutions.

So, the answer is $199$. The answer is: $199$

To solve the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ having $4$ distinct solutions, we need to find the number of values of $m$ such that the right side of the equation is in the range of the number of solutions of the inner absolute value equation.

The inner absolute value equation is $\vert x-1 \vert -2=\pm \frac{m}{100}$.

Let's first solve the case $\vert x-1 \vert -2= \frac{m}{100}$.

$\vert x-1 \vert = 2 + \frac{m}{100}$

This equation has two solutions: $x-1 = 2 + \frac{m}{100}$ and $x-1 = -(2 + \frac{m}{100})$.

Solving the first equation gives $x = 3 + \frac{m}{100}$.

Solving the second equation gives $x = -1 - \frac{m}{100}$.

Now, we need to find the range of $m$ such that these two solutions are distinct and $x$ is in the valid range for the absolute value function (i.e., $x \geq -1$).

For $x = 3 + \frac{m}{100}$ to be greater than or equal to $-1$, we have $3 + \frac{m}{100} \geq -1$, which gives $m \geq -400$.

For $x = -1 - \frac{m}{100}$ to be less than $3 + \frac{m}{100}$, we have $-1 - \frac{m}{100} < 3 + \frac{m}{100}$, which gives $m > -200$.

So, the range of $m$ for the first case is $-400 \leq m < -200$.

Now let's solve the case $\vert x-1 \vert -2= -\frac{m}{100}$.

$\vert x-1 \vert = 2 - \frac{m}{100}$

This equation has two solutions: $x-1 = 2 - \frac{m}{100}$ and $x-1 = -(2 - \frac{m}{100})$.

Solving the first equation gives $x = 3 - \frac{m}{100}$.

Solving the second equation gives $x = -1 + \frac{m}{100}$.

Now, we need to find the range of $m$ such that these two solutions are distinct and $x$ is in the valid range for the absolute value function (i.e., $x \leq 3$).

For $x = 3 - \frac{m}{100}$ to be less than or equal to $3$, we have $3 - \frac{m}{100} \leq 3$, which gives $m \geq 0$.

For $x = -1 + \frac{m}{100}$ to be less than $3 - \frac{m}{100}$, we have $-1 + \frac{m}{100} < 3 - \frac{m}{100}$, which gives $m < 200$.

So, the range of $m$ for the second case is $0 \leq m < 200$.

The union of these two ranges gives $-400 \leq m < -200$ or $0 \leq m < 200$.

This means that the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has $4$ distinct solutions when $m$ is in the range $-400 \leq m < -200$ or $0 \leq m < 200$.

Now we need to count the number of positive integers $m$ in this range.

For the range $-400 \leq m < -200$, there are $200$ positive integers.

For the range $0 \leq m < 200$, there are $200$ positive integers.

So, the total number of positive integers $m$ is $200 + 200 = 400$.

Therefore, the number of positive integers $m$ such that the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has $4$ distinct solutions is $400$. The answer is: $400$

We need to find the number of positive integers $m$ such that the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has $4$ distinct solutions.
The equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ can be rewritten as $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=0.01m$.
The equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=0$ has three cases:
Case 1: $\vert x-1 \vert -2=0$, which gives $\vert x-1 \vert =2$.
Case 2: $\vert x-1 \vert -2<0$, which gives $\vert x-1 \vert <2$.
Case 3: $\vert x-1 \vert -2>0$, which gives $\vert x-1 \vert >2$.
For Case 1, we have two subcases:
Subcase 1.1: $x-1=2$, which gives $x=3$.
Subcase 1.2: $x-1=-2$, which gives $x=-1$.
For Case 2, we have $x-1<2$ and $x-1>-2$, which gives $-2<x-1<2$. Adding $1$ to all sides gives $-1<x<3$.
For Case 3, we have $x-1>2$ and $x-1<-2$, which has no solutions since $x-1$ cannot be both greater than $2$ and less than $-2$.
So the solutions to the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=0$ are $x=-1$, $x=3$, and $-1<x<3$.
The equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=0.01m$ will have four distinct solutions if the interval $(-1,3)$ is shifted to the left or right by $0.01m$.
This will happen when $0.01m=\frac{1}{2}$, or $m=50$.
Therefore, there is only one positive integer $m$ such that the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has $4$ distinct solutions, and that is $m=50$. The answer is: $1$

We want the equation $| |x-1| - 2 | = \frac{m}{100}$ to have 4 distinct solutions. This equation can be thought of as a piecewise function, with three "pieces" based on the value of $|x-1|$. 

1. If $|x-1| < 2$, then $| |x-1| - 2 | = 2 - |x-1|$. So the equation becomes $2 - |x-1| = \frac{m}{100}$, or $|x-1| = 2 - \frac{m}{100}$. This has two solutions if $0 < 2 - \frac{m}{100} < 2$, or equivalently, if $0 < m < 200$.

2. If $|x-1| \geq 2$, then $| |x-1| - 2 | = |x-1| - 2$. So the equation becomes $|x-1| - 2 = \frac{m}{100}$, or $|x-1| = 2 + \frac{m}{100}$. This has two solutions if $|x-1| > 2$, or equivalently, if $x > 3$ or $x < -1$. This will give us two more solutions if $2 < 2 + \frac{m}{100} < 4$, or equivalently, if $0 < m < 200$.

So for $0 < m < 200$, the equation has 4 distinct solutions. Therefore, the number of positive integers $m$ that satisfy this condition is the number of positive integers from 1 to 199, inclusive.

Counting the number of these integers gives us the answer: $199$.
The answer is: $199$

To find the number of positive integers $m$ for which the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has $4$ distinct solutions, we need to analyze the equation and consider the possible values of $m$.

First, let's consider the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$. This equation has four distinct solutions if and only if $\frac{m}{100} = 2$.

Solving for $m$, we get $m = 200$.

So, the only positive integer value of $m$ for which the equation has $4$ distinct solutions is $200$.

Therefore, the number of positive integers $m$ is $1$. The answer is: $1$

The equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has 4 distinct solutions if and only if $\frac{m}{100}$ is less than 2 but greater than 0. This is because the expression inside the absolute value, $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert$, can take on any value between 0 and 4 (inclusive) for the equation to have 4 distinct solutions. Since $\frac{m}{100}$ is equal to the value inside the absolute value, we have $0 < \frac{m}{100} < 2$. Multiplying all sides of the inequalities by 100 gives $0 < m < 200$. Therefore, the number of positive integer values of $m$ that satisfy this condition is the number of integers from 1 to 199, which is 199.

However, we must remember that $m$ cannot be 0, because the expression inside the absolute value cannot be equal to 0 (otherwise the equation would only have 3 distinct solutions). So we must subtract 1 from the total number of positive integers from 1 to 199.

So the number of positive integers $m$ for which the equation has 4 distinct solutions is $199 - 1 = 198$.

Therefore, the number of positive integers $m$ for which the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has 4 distinct solutions is 198.
The answer is: $198$

We know that the absolute value function $|\cdot|$ has a V-shape, and $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert$ is the sum of two absolute value functions. The equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ will have 4 distinct solutions if and only if $\frac{m}{100}$ is the height of the V-shape such that the two V-shapes intersect in exactly 4 points.

By observation, we can see that the maximum value of $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert$ is 2, and the minimum value is 0. So, the only possible value of $\frac{m}{100}$ that would give 4 distinct solutions is $1$, because $0 < \frac{m}{100} < 2$.

So, we have $\frac{m}{100} = 1$, which gives $m = 100$.

So, there is only one positive integer $m$ that makes the equation have 4 distinct solutions, and that is $100$. The answer is: $1$

We want to find the number of positive integers $m$ such that the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has 4 distinct solutions.
This equation represents a piecewise function with 4 different cases depending on the value of $x$.
For each case, we can find the number of solutions and sum them up.
However, we are only interested in the cases that give us 4 distinct solutions.

After analyzing the cases and solving the equations, we find that only the case where $2 < m < 4$ gives us 4 distinct solutions.
The only positive integer $m$ in this range is $3$.
Therefore, there is only 1 positive integer $m$ that gives us 4 distinct solutions.

So, the number of positive integers $m$ is 1.
The answer is: $1$
