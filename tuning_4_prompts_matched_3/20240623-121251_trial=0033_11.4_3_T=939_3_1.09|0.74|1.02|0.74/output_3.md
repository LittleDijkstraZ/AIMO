Solve the following problem with a Python Script (positive numerical answer):
"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"

Approach:

 The given equation is $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$. For the product of two numbers to be zero, either one of the numbers must be zero. Therefore, either $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$.

If $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$, then $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. This implies that $x + y = \pm 10$ and $x - y = \pm 10$. Solving these equations gives us the vertices of the square: $(8, 2)$, $(8, -2)$, $(-8, -2)$, and $(-8, 2)$.

If $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$, then $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$. This implies that $x = \pm 8$ and $y = \pm 8$. But this case gives us the same vertices as the previous case.

Therefore, the points that satisfy the given equation are the vertices of a square with side length 16. The area of this square is $16^2 = 256$. The answer is: $256$

Approach:


The equation $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + (\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + (\vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ is satisfied only when either $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + (\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + (\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$.

If $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + (\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$, then both $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$, which implies that $x = \pm 10$ and $y = \pm 10$. This forms a square with side length 20, so the area is $20^2 = 400$.

If $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + (\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$, then both $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$, which implies that $x = \pm 8$ and $y = \pm 8$. This forms a square with side length 16, so the area is $16^2 = 256$.

The sum of these two areas gives the total area of the convex polygon, which is $400 + 256 = 656$.
The answer is: $656$

"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"

Approach:



The equation $AB = 0$ is true if and only if either $A = 0$ or $B = 0$. Therefore, the given equation is equivalent to the union of the following two equations:

1. $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$.
2. $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$.

From equation 1, we have $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. This implies that $x + y = \pm 10$ and $x - y = \pm 10$. Solving these four equations, we get the vertices of the square as $(0, 10), (0, -10), (10, 0), (-10, 0)$.

From equation 2, we have $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$. This implies that $x = \pm 8$ and $y = \pm 8$. Solving these four equations, we get the vertices of the square as $(8, 0), (-8, 0), (0, 8), (0, -8)$.

The points satisfying the given equation are the union of these two squares. The resulting figure is a square with side length $10$. The area of this square is $10^2 = 100$. Therefore, the area of the convex polygon is $100$.

The answer is: $100$

Solve the following problem with a Python Script (positive numerical answer):
"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"
Write comments to indicate the steps you take. Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Assistant:

Approach:


The equation given in the problem, $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$, is satisfied only when either of the two factors is zero. This means that either $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$.
For the first factor to be zero, both $\vert x + y \vert - 10 = 0$ and $\vert x - y \vert - 10 = 0$, which implies $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. These are the equations of two squares with side length 10 centered at the origin. The vertices of these squares are the points where the lines $x + y = \pm 10$ and $x - y = \pm 10$ intersect. These are the vertices of the polygon.
For the second factor to be zero, both $\vert x \vert - 8 = 0$ and $\vert y \vert - 8 = 0$, which implies $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$. These are the equations of two squares with side length 16 centered at the origin. However, these squares are entirely contained within the squares defined by the first factor, so they don't contribute any additional area to the polygon.
To find the area of the polygon, we can find the area of the square formed by the intersection of the two squares defined by the first factor and subtract the area of the two squares defined by the second factor (which is zero in this case).
The side length of the square formed by the intersection of the two squares defined by the first factor is the diagonal of a square with side length 10 (by the Pythagorean theorem), which is $\sqrt{10^2 + 10^2} = \sqrt{200} = 10\sqrt{2}$.
The area of this square is therefore $(10\sqrt{2})^2 = 200$.
Since the area of the two squares defined by the second factor is zero, the area of the convex polygon is 200.
The answer is: $200$

Assistant:

Approach:


The equation $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + (\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ implies that $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. This means that $x + y = \pm 10$ and $x - y = \pm 10$. Solving these equations gives us the vertices of the square as $(0, 10), (0, -10), (10, 0), (-10, 0)$.

Similarly, the equation $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + (\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ implies that $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$. This means that $x = \pm 8$ and $y = \pm 8$. So the vertices of the square are $(8, 0), (-8, 0), (0, 8), (0, -8)$.

The intersection of these two squares is a smaller square with side length 6 (since the distance between the points $(0, 10)$ and $(0, -8)$ is 18 units and we subtract the lengths of the sides of the smaller squares from both the x and y directions).

The area of a square is given by the square of the length of its side, so the area of the convex polygon is $6^2 = 36$.

So the area of the convex polygon is 36 square units.
The answer is: $36$

Assistant:

Approach:

 The given equation is a product of two expressions equal to zero, so either the first expression is zero or the second expression is zero. We can analyze these two cases separately.

Case 1: $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$. This equation is satisfied only when $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. This implies that $x + y = \pm 10$ and $x - y = \pm 10$. Solving these four equations, we get the vertices of the polygon as $(0, 10), (0, -10), (10, 0), (-10, 0)$.

Case 2: $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$. This equation is satisfied only when $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$. This implies that $x = \pm 8$ and $y = \pm 8$. Solving these four equations, we get the vertices of the polygon as $(8, 8), (8, -8), (-8, 8), (-8, -8)$.

The vertices obtained from both cases form a square with side length $10$. The area of the square is side length squared, which is $10^2 = 100$. So the area of the convex polygon is $100$. The answer is: $100$

Solve the following problem with a Python Script (positive numerical answer):
"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"
Write comments to indicate the steps you take. Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Assistant:

Approach:


The equation given is a product of two expressions equal to zero, so either one of the expressions must be zero for the equation to hold. This gives us two systems of equations to solve:
1. $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ and $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$
2. $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ and $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$
For the first system, we have $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x \vert = 8$. The solutions to these equations are:
- For $\vert x + y \vert = 10$, we have $x + y = 10$ or $x + y = -10$.
- For $\vert x \vert = 8$, we have $x = 8$ or $x = -8$.
Similarly, for the second system, we have $\vert x - y \vert = 10$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$. The solutions to these equations are:
- For $\vert x - y \vert = 10$, we have $x - y = 10$ or $x - y = -10$.
- For $\vert y \vert = 8$, we have $y = 8$ or $y = -8$.
Now we have all the possible combinations of $x$ and $y$ that satisfy the equations. By plotting these points in a coordinate plane and connecting them, we can visualize the polygon formed. The polygon is a square with side length 16. The area of a square is given by the square of the length of its side, so the area of this square is $16^2 = 256$.

The answer is: 256

Approach:


The equation $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + (\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + (\vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ is satisfied only when either $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + (\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + (\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$.

If $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + (\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$, then both $\vert x + y \vert - 10 = 0$ and $\vert x - y \vert - 10 = 0$, which implies $x + y = 10$ and $x - y = 10$ or $x + y = 10$ and $x - y = -10$. Solving these systems of equations, we get the vertices of the polygon as $(0, 10)$, $(10, 0)$, $(0, -10)$, and $(-10, 0)$.

Similarly, if $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + (\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$, then both $\vert x \vert - 8 = 0$ and $\vert y \vert - 8 = 0$, which implies $x = \pm 8$ and $y = \pm 8$. This gives us the vertices $(8, 8)$, $(8, -8)$, $(-8, 8)$, and $(-8, -8)$.

Therefore, the vertices of the polygon are $(0, 10)$, $(10, 0)$, $(0, -10)$, $(-10, 0)$, $(8, 8)$, $(8, -8)$, $(-8, 8)$, and $(-8, -8)$.

To find the area of the polygon, we can divide it into four right triangles with vertices at $(0, 0)$, $(0, 10)$, and $(10, 0)$, $(0, 0)$, $(0, -10)$, and $(-10, 0)$, $(0, 0)$, $(8, 0)$, and $(0, 8)$, and $(0, 0)$, $(0, -8)$, and $(0, -8)$.

The area of each triangle is $\frac{1}{2} \times 10 \times 10 = 50$, so the total area of the polygon is $4 \times 50 = 200$.

The answer is: 200

The polygon is a square with side length 10 (the distance between $(0, 10)$ and $(0, -10)$, or between $(0, 10)$ and $(10, 0)$). The area of a square is the square of the length of its side, so the area of this square is $10^2 = 100$. The answer is: $100$

Approach:


The given equation is of the form $f(x, y) \cdot g(x, y) = 0$. This implies that either $f(x, y) = 0$ or $g(x, y) = 0$. 

So, we need to find the points that satisfy either $f(x, y) = 0$ or $g(x, y) = 0$.

For $f(x, y) = ((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2) = 0$, we have $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$.

This gives us four equations: $x + y = 10$, $x + y = -10$, $x - y = 10$, and $x - y = -10$.

Solving these equations, we get the vertices of the polygon as $(0, 10)$, $(0, -10)$, $(10, 0)$, and $(-10, 0)$.

For $g(x, y) = ((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$, we have $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$.

This gives us four more vertices: $(8, 0)$, $(-8, 0)$, $(0, 8)$, and $(0, -8)$.

Now, we can plot these points on a coordinate plane and connect them to form a square with side length 16 units.

The area of this square is $16^2 = 256$ square units.
The answer is: $256$

Approach:


The equation $AB = 0$ implies that $A = 0$ or $B = 0$. Therefore, the given equation is satisfied if either of the following two conditions holds:

1. $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$
2. $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$

From condition 1, we have $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. This implies that $x + y = \pm 10$ and $x - y = \pm 10$. Solving these equations gives us the vertices of the polygon as $(0, 10)$, $(0, -10)$, $(10, 0)$, and $(-10, 0)$.

From condition 2, we have $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$. This implies that $x = \pm 8$ and $y = \pm 8$. Solving these equations gives us the vertices of the polygon as $(8, 8)$, $(8, -8)$, $(-8, 8)$, and $(-8, -8)$.

Plotting these points on a graph, we find that they form a square with side length 10. The area of this square is $10^2 = 100$. Therefore, the area of the convex polygon is 100.
The answer is: $100$
