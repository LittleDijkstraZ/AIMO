Assistant:

 The given equation is $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ and we want to find for how many positive integers $m$ it has 4 distinct solutions.

The equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ can be rewritten as $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=0.01m$. The expression $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert$ can take on three different values: 

1. When $\vert x-1 \vert -2 \geq 0$, we have $\vert x-1 \vert -2=0.01m$, which simplifies to $\vert x-1 \vert = 2+0.01m$. This gives two equations: $x-1=2+0.01m$ and $x-1=-(2+0.01m)$.

2. When $-1 \leq \vert x-1 \vert < 2$, we have $-( \vert x-1 \vert -2) = 0.01m$, which simplifies to $2 - \vert x-1 \vert = 0.01m$. This gives two equations: $2 - (x-1) = 0.01m$ and $2 - (-(x-1)) = 0.01m$.

3. When $\vert x-1 \vert -2 < 0$, we have $-\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert = 0.01m$, which simplifies to $-\vert x-1 \vert +2 = 0.01m$. This gives two equations: $-(x-1) + 2 = 0.01m$ and $-(-(x-1)) + 2 = 0.01m$.

Each of these six equations gives two solutions for $x$. So, the original equation has 4 distinct solutions if and only if exactly one of the six equations gives 2 distinct solutions. 

This is equivalent to finding the values of $m$ for which the right-hand side of each equation (i.e., $2+0.01m$, $2-0.01m$, and $-(2+0.01m)$) lies in the interval $[-1, 1]$. 

After solving these inequalities, we find that $19.00 \leq m \leq 21.00$. Since $m$ is a positive integer, the only possible value of $m$ is $20$. 

Therefore, the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has 4 distinct solutions for exactly one positive integer $m$, which is $20$. The answer is: $20$

 To solve this problem, we need to analyze the equation \[\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}\] and find the number of values of $m$ for which it has four distinct solutions.

The equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ is a piecewise function with four cases to consider based on the absolute value signs. The function will be:

- $\vert x-1 \vert -2 = \frac{m}{100}$ when $(x-1) \geq 0$ and $\vert x-1 \vert -2 \geq 0$. This simplifies to $x-1 -2 = \frac{m}{100}$ or $x-3 = \frac{m}{100}$.
- $-\vert x-1 \vert +2 = \frac{m}{100}$ when $(x-1) \geq 0$ and $\vert x-1 \vert -2 < 0$. This simplifies to $-x+1 +2 = \frac{m}{100}$ or $-x+3 = \frac{m}{100}$.
- $-\vert x-1 \vert -2 = \frac{m}{100}$ when $(x-1) < 0$ and $\vert x-1 \vert +2 \geq 0$. This simplifies to -x+1 -2 = \frac{m}{100} or -x-1 = \frac{m}{100}.
- $\vert x-1 \vert +2 = \frac{m}{100}$ when $(x-1) < 0$ and $\vert x-1 \vert +2 < 0$. This simplifies to x-1 +2 = \frac{m}{100} or x+1 = \frac{m}{100}.

For the equation to have four distinct solutions, the two positive equations ($x-3 = \frac{m}{100}$ and $x+1 = \frac{m}{100}$) and the two negative equations ($-x+3 = \frac{m}{100}$ and $-x-1 = \frac{m}{100}$) must intersect in four distinct points. This happens when the slopes of the lines are different, which means that $3 \neq -1$, $1 \neq -3$, and $3 \neq 1$.

After analyzing the equations, we find that the only values of $m$ that make the equation have four distinct solutions are those for which $\frac{m}{100} = 2$ or $\frac{m}{100} = 4$. This means $m = 200$ or $m = 400$.

So, there are only two values of $m$ that make the equation have four distinct solutions. Therefore, the number of positive integers $m$ for which the equation has four distinct solutions is 2. The answer is: 2

Assistant:


To solve this problem, we need to find the number of values of $m$ for which the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has exactly four distinct solutions.

Let's analyze the equation. The expression $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert$ represents the distance between $x$ and $1$ in the number line, minus $2$. This means that the distance between $x$ and $1$ minus $2$ is equal to $\frac{m}{100}$.

The equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ will have four distinct solutions when $\frac{m}{100}$ is equal to the height of a "bump" in the graph of $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert$. The height of the bump is $2$, so we need $\frac{m}{100}=2$.

Therefore, $m=200$. So, there is only one value of $m$ for which the equation has four distinct solutions, which is $m=200$. The answer is: $1$

Assistant:

 The given equation has four distinct solutions if and only if the right side of the equation, $m/100$, is equal to $1$. This is because the absolute value function $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert$ takes on the value of $1$ exactly four times.

Therefore, we have $m/100 = 1$, which implies $m = 100$. So the only positive integer $m$ that makes the equation have four distinct solutions is $100$.

The answer is: $100$.

Assistant:

 To solve this problem, we need to find the value of $m$ such that the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has $4$ distinct solutions. 

First, let's analyze the equation. The expression $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert$ is a piecewise function that takes on three different forms depending on the value of $x$:

1. If $x < 1$, then $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert = \vert -x+1 -2 \vert = \vert -x-1 \vert = x+1+2 = x+3$.
2. If $1 \leq x \leq 3$, then $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert = \vert x-1 -2 \vert = \vert x-3 \vert = 3-x$.
3. If $x > 3$, then $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert = \vert x-1 -2 \vert = \vert x-3 \vert = x-3$.

Now, we want to find the value of $m$ such that the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has $4$ distinct solutions. This means that the right side of the equation, $\frac{m}{100}$, should be equal to one of the three forms of the left side of the equation at certain values of $x$. 

The equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ will have four distinct solutions when $\frac{m}{100}$ equals $3$, $1$, and $3$ (in increasing order of $x$) in the three cases above. 

So, we have:

1. For $3 = \frac{m}{100}$, we get $m = 300$.
2. For $1 = \frac{m}{100}$, we get $m = 100$.
3. For $3 = \frac{m}{100}$, we get $m = 300$ again.

Therefore, the value of $m$ such that the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has $4$ distinct solutions is $m = 100$ or $m = 300$. However, we are asked for a positive integer $m$, so the only valid value is $m = 100$. The answer is: $100$

Assistant:

 The given equation is $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$. The number of distinct solutions for this equation is equal to 4 if and only if $\frac{m}{100}=1$. This is because the expression inside the absolute value, $\vert x-1 \vert -2$, can only be 1 or -1.

To confirm this, let's solve the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=1$.

The equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=1$ gives us two sub-equations:
1. $\vert x-1 \vert -2 = 1$
2. $\vert x-1 \vert -2 = -1$

For the first sub-equation, $\vert x-1 \vert -2 = 1$ simplifies to $\vert x-1 \vert = 3$. This gives us two more sub-equations:
1. $x-1 = 3$
2. $x-1 = -3$

Solving $x-1 = 3$ gives $x = 4$. Solving $x-1 = -3$ gives $x = -2$. So the solutions to the first sub-equation are $x = 4$ and $x = -2$.

For the second sub-equation, $\vert x-1 \vert -2 = -1$ simplifies to $\vert x-1 \vert = 1$. This gives us two more sub-equations:
1. $x-1 = 1$
2. $x-1 = -1$

Solving $x-1 = 1$ gives $x = 2$. Solving $x-1 = -1$ gives $x = 0$. So the solutions to the second sub-equation are $x = 2$ and $x = 0$.

So the solutions to the original equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=1$ are $x = 4$, $x = -2$, $x = 2$, and $x = 0$. These are 4 distinct solutions.

Therefore, if $\frac{m}{100}=1$, the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has 4 distinct solutions. Solving for $m$ gives $m = 100$. So the only positive integer value of $m$ for which the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has 4 distinct solutions is $m = 100$.
The value of $m$ for which the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has 4 distinct solutions is 100. The answer is: $1$

Assistant:

 The problem asks for the number of positive integers $m$ such that the equation $| |x - 1| - 2| = \frac{m}{100}$ has 4 distinct solutions.

To find the number of such $m$, we can analyze the equation step by step.

First, we can rewrite the equation as $|x - 1| - 2 = \pm \frac{m}{100}$.

This gives us two equations: $|x - 1| - 2 = \frac{m}{100}$ and $|x - 1| - 2 = -\frac{m}{100}$.

For each of these equations, we can rewrite them as $|x - 1| = 2 + \frac{m}{100}$ and $|x - 1| = 2 - \frac{m}{100}$ respectively.

For the first equation $|x - 1| = 2 + \frac{m}{100}$, the right side must be greater than 2 for the equation to have solutions. This gives us $2 + \frac{m}{100} > 2$, or $\frac{m}{100} > 0$, which implies $m > 0$.

For the second equation $|x - 1| = 2 - \frac{m}{100}$, the right side must be greater than 0 for the equation to have solutions. This gives us $2 - \frac{m}{100} > 0$, or $\frac{m}{100} < 2$, which implies $m < 200$.

Combining these two conditions, we have $0 < m < 200$.

Now, we need to find how many integers $m$ in this range make the original equation have 4 distinct solutions. By analyzing the equations $|x - 1| = 2 + \frac{m}{100}$ and $|x - 1| = 2 - \frac{m}{100}$, we find that the number of distinct solutions equals to the number of times the graphs of $y = 2 + \frac{m}{100}$ and $y = 2 - \frac{m}{100}$ intersect the graph of $y = |x - 1|$.

By drawing the graphs of $y = 2 + \frac{m}{100}$, $y = 2 - \frac{m}{100}$ and $y = |x - 1|$, we find that the number of distinct solutions equals to 4 when $100 < m < 200$.

The positive integers $m$ in this range are exactly the integers from 101 to 199, and the number of such integers is $199 - 101 + 1 = 99$.

Therefore, the number of positive integers $m$ such that the equation $| |x - 1| - 2| = \frac{m}{100}$ has 4 distinct solutions is 99.
The answer is: $99$

Assistant:

 The equation $| |x-1| - 2 | = \frac{m}{100}$ has four distinct solutions if and only if $\frac{m}{100} = 2$. 

To see this, consider the equation $| |x-1| - 2 | = k$ for some positive constant $k$. The expression $| |x-1| - 2 |$ is equal to $k$ at four different values of $x$: one value of $x$ for which $|x-1| - 2 = k$, one for which $|x-1| - 2 = -k$, one for which $|x-1| + 2 = k$, and one for which $|x-1| + 2 = -k$. These are the four solutions to the equation. 

Now, if $\frac{m}{100} = 2$, then $m = 200$, and we can substitute this into the equation to get $| |x-1| - 2 | = 2$. This equation has four distinct solutions. 

So, the only positive integer $m$ that satisfies the given condition is $m = 200$. 

Therefore, the answer is $1$. However, since the problem asks for the number of positive integers $m$, we should consider all positive integers $m$. 

For any positive integer $m$, the equation $| |x-1| - 2 | = \frac{m}{100}$ will have four distinct solutions if and only if $\frac{m}{100} = 2$, or $m = 200$. However, this is only one value of $m$, and since $m$ is a positive integer, we must consider all positive integers $m$. 

For all other values of $m$, the equation will not have four distinct solutions. For example, if $m = 100$, then $| |x-1| - 2 | = 1$, which does not have four distinct solutions. Similarly, if $m = 300$, then $| |x-1| - 2 | = 3$, which also does not have four distinct solutions. 

So, the number of positive integers $m$ for which the equation has four distinct solutions is $1$. However, since the problem asks for the number of positive integers $m$, we must consider all positive integers $m$.
The answer is $\boxed{1}$.

 The given equation is a variation of the equation $\vert \vert x \vert -a \vert=b$. The number of solutions of this equation depends on the values of $a$ and $b$. For the given equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$, it is equivalent to the equation $\vert \vert x \vert - (1+2) \vert=\frac{m}{100}$, which simplifies to $\vert \vert x \vert -3 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$.

This equation has 4 distinct solutions when $0< \frac{m}{100} <3$. This translates to $0 < m < 300$. The positive integers $m$ that satisfy this inequality are $1, 2, ..., 299$.

However, the problem asks for how many positive integers $m$ the equation has 4 distinct solutions. The number of such $m$ is the number of positive integers from 1 to 299, which is 299.

 The given equation is $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$. The number of distinct solutions to this equation depends on the value of $m$. 

For the equation to have four distinct solutions, the value of $\frac{m}{100}$ must be such that the expression inside the absolute value, $\vert x-1 \vert -2$, changes its sign twice. This happens when $\frac{m}{100}=2$. So, $m=200$. 

Therefore, there is only one positive integer $m$ for which the equation has four distinct solutions. The value of $m$ is $200$.
The answer is: $1$
