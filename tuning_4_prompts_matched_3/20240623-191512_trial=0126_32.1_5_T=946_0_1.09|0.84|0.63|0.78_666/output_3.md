Below is a math problem you are to solve (positive numerical answer!):
"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"
Analyze this problem and think step by step to come to a solution with programs. After solving the problem, output the final numerical answer within \boxed{}.

Assistant:


The expression $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2)$ is equal to zero if and only if at least one of the factors is equal to zero. This means that either $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$.
For the first factor to be zero, we must have $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. These equations describe a square with side length 10 and diagonals of length $10\sqrt{2}$.
For the second factor to be zero, we must have $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$. This describes a square with side length 8 and diagonals of length $8\sqrt{2}$.
The combined solution is the union of these two squares. The area of the larger square is $(10)^2 = 100$, and the area of the smaller square is $(8)^2 = 64$. Therefore, the area of the convex polygon is $100 - 64 = 36$. The answer is: $36$

 The given equation is a product of two terms equal to zero. Therefore, either the first term is zero or the second term is zero.
The first term is $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)$ which equals zero if and only if $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. This gives us four lines: $x + y = \pm10$ and $x - y = \pm10$.
The second term is $((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2)$ which equals zero if and only if $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$. This gives us four lines: $x = \pm8$ and $y = \pm8$.
The intersection points of these lines are the vertices of the polygon.
The polygon is a square with side length 16. To find its area, we simply square the side length: $16^2 = 256$.
So the area of the convex polygon is 256 square units.

The given equation is a product of two terms equal to zero. This means that either the first term is zero or the second term is zero. 

The first term is $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)$, and this is zero if and only if both $\vert x + y \vert - 10 = 0$ and $\vert x - y \vert - 10 = 0$, which implies $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. These equations represent two lines in the coordinate plane: $x + y = 10$ and $x - y = 10$.

The second term is $((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2)$, and this is zero if and only if both $\vert x \vert - 8 = 0$ and $\vert y \vert - 8 = 0$, which implies $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$. These equations represent two lines in the coordinate plane: $x = 8$ and $y = 8$.

The intersection of these lines forms a square with side length 10. The area of this square is $10^2 = 100$.

Therefore, the area of the convex polygon is $100$. The answer is: $100$

Below is a math problem you are to solve (positive numerical answer!):
"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"

Assistant:

 The given equation is $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$.
For the product of two numbers to be zero, one of the numbers must be zero. Therefore, either $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$.

If $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$, then $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. This implies that $x + y = \pm 10$ and $x - y = \pm 10$. Solving these equations, we get the vertices of the square as $(0, 10), (0, -10), (10, 0)$ and $(-10, 0)$.

If $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$, then $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$. This implies that $x = \pm 8$ and $y = \pm 8$. So we get the vertices of the square as $(8, 0), (-8, 0), (0, 8)$ and $(0, -8)$.

The points that satisfy the given equation are the vertices of two squares. The larger square has side length $20$ and the smaller square has side length $16$.

The area of a square is given by the square of its side length. Therefore, the area of the larger square is $20^2 = 400$ and the area of the smaller square is $16^2 = 256$.

The area of the convex polygon formed by the union of the two squares is the sum of the areas of the two squares, which is $400 + 256 = 656$. The answer is: $656$

Below is a math problem you are to solve (positive numerical answer!):
"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"
Analyze this problem and think step by step to come to a solution with programs. After solving the problem, output the final numerical answer within \boxed{}.

Assistant:

 The given equation is equal to zero if and only if both factors are equal to zero. This gives us the following four conditions:
1. $\vert x + y \vert - 10 = 0$ and $\vert x - y \vert - 10 = 0$.
2. $\vert x \vert - 8 = 0$ and $\vert y \vert - 8 = 0$.
Solving these conditions, we find that the polygon is a square with side length 16. The area of this square is $16^2 = 256$.

Therefore, the area of the convex polygon is 256.

Here is a Python code to calculate the area of the polygon:

```python

def polygon_area():
    """The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"""
    side_length = 16
    area = side_length ** 2

The area of the convex polygon is $256$. The answer is: $256$
