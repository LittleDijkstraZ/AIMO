"For how many positive integers $m$ does the equation \[\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}\] have $4$ distinct solutions?"
Write comments to indicate the steps you take. Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Assistant:

Approach:



1. For the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ to have 4 distinct solutions, the value of $\frac{m}{100}$ must be between 1 and 2 (inclusive) because the function $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert$ has its maximum value of 2 and minimum value of 0, and it takes all values in between these limits.
2. Therefore, $\frac{m}{100}$ must be in the range of 1 to 2.
3. To find the values of $m$ that satisfy this condition, we can multiply the bounds of the range by 100: $1 \leq \frac{m}{100} \leq 2$.
4. Multiplying all parts of the inequality by 100 gives: $100 \leq m \leq 200$.
5. The positive integers that satisfy this inequality are the integers from 100 to 200 inclusive.
6. To count the number of these integers, we subtract the smallest value from the largest value and then add 1 (because both bounds are inclusive): $200 - 100 + 1 = 101$.
7. Therefore, there are 101 positive integers $m$ such that the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has 4 distinct solutions.

Therefore, the number of positive integers $m$ for which the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has 4 distinct solutions is 101. The answer is: $101$

Approach:



We start by analyzing the equation \[\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}.\]
The function $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert$ is a piecewise function that has four pieces. Each piece gives us a range of $x$ that satisfies the equation. The number of distinct solutions of the equation is equal to the number of ranges of $x$ that the right-hand side $\frac{m}{100}$ can cover.

If $\frac{m}{100}$ is less than $1$, there is no solution because $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert$ is always greater than or equal to $1$.
If $\frac{m}{100}$ is equal to $1$, there is one solution because $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert$ equals $1$ at two points.
If $\frac{m}{100}$ is between $1$ and $2$, there are two solutions because $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert$ equals $\frac{m}{100}$ at four points.
If $\frac{m}{100}$ is equal to $2$, there are three solutions because $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert$ equals $2$ at three points.
If $\frac{m}{100}$ is greater than $2$, there are four solutions because $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert$ equals $\frac{m}{100}$ at six points.

Therefore, the equation \[\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}\] has four distinct solutions when $\frac{m}{100}$ is between $1$ and $2$. This means $1 \leq \frac{m}{100} < 2$. Solving this inequality gives $100 \leq m < 200$. The positive integers $m$ that satisfy this inequality are $100, 101, ..., 199$, which makes $100$ values.

So the number of positive integers $m$ for which the equation \[\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}\] has $4$ distinct solutions is $100$.

So the answer is $\boxed{100}$.

Approach:


The number of distinct solutions of the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ is equal to $4$ when $\frac{m}{100} = 2$. This is because the expression on the left side of the equation, $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert$, can take on the value of $2$ exactly $4$ times.

Solving for $m$:
We have $\frac{m}{100} = 2$. To find $m$, we multiply both sides of the equation by $100$:
\[m = 2 \times 100 = 200.\]
Therefore, $m = 200$. The value of $m$ for which the equation has $4$ distinct solutions is $200$.
The answer is: 1

This problem involves the number of solutions to an absolute value equation. The equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has four distinct solutions when the value of $\frac{m}{100}$ lies in the range $[2-1, 2+1]$, or $[1, 3]$. So, we need to find the values of $m$ such that $\frac{m}{100}$ lies in this interval. To find the integer values of $m$, we need to multiply each value in the interval $[1, 3]$ by $100$.

```python


INTERMEDIATE OUT :

def find_m():
    m_values = []
    for m in range(100, 301, 100):
        m_values.append(m)
    return m_values

m_values = find_m()
print(m_values)
```

INTERMEDIATE OUT :
```output

So, the positive integers $m$ that make the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ have $4$ distinct solutions are $100$, $200$, and $300$. There are $3$ such values. The answer is: $3$

Approach:


We first note that the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has $4$ distinct solutions if and only if $\frac{m}{100} \leq 2$. This is because the function $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert$ oscillates between $0$ and $4$ and the right side $\frac{m}{100}$ must be less than or equal to $2$ in order for the equation to have $4$ distinct solutions. Thus, we have $0 \leq \frac{m}{100} \leq 2$. Multiplying all sides of the inequalities by $100$ gives $0 \leq m \leq 200$. The positive integers $m$ that satisfy this inequality are the positive integers from $1$ to $200$. However, we need to count the number of these positive integers for which the equation has $4$ distinct solutions.

Since we know that $\frac{m}{100} \leq 2$, we can multiply both sides by $100$ to get $m \leq 200$. And as $m$ must be a positive integer, the maximum value for $m$ is $200$. So we need to count the number of positive integers from $1$ to $200$. This is simply $200$.

However, we want to find the number of positive integers $m$ for which the equation has $4$ distinct solutions. This is not simply all the positive integers from $1$ to $200$. We need to find the values of $m$ for which the equation has $4$ distinct solutions.

For $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ to have $4$ distinct solutions, the right side $\frac{m}{100}$ must be less than or equal to $2$. This gives us $0 \leq \frac{m}{100} \leq 2$. Multiplying all sides of the inequalities by $100$ gives $0 \leq m \leq 200$. So the positive integers $m$ that satisfy this inequality are the positive integers from $1$ to $200$.

But we need to find the number of these positive integers for which the equation has $4$ distinct solutions. This is a more complicated problem and requires a more detailed analysis of the function $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert$.

However, we can use the fact that the function $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert$ oscillates between $0$ and $4$ and the right side $\frac{m}{100}$ must be less than or equal to $2$. This means that the equation has $4$ distinct solutions when $\frac{m}{100}$ is equal to $1$ or $2$. This gives us the inequalities $1 \leq \frac{m}{100} \leq 2$. Multiplying all sides of the inequalities by $100$ gives $100 \leq m \leq 200$. So the positive integers $m$ that satisfy this inequality are the positive integers from $100$ to $200$.

Counting the number of these positive integers gives $200 - 100 + 1 = 101$. So there are $101$ positive integers $m$ for which the equation has $4$ distinct solutions.

So the number of positive integers $m$ for which the equation has $4$ distinct solutions is $101$. The answer is: 101

Approach:



For the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ to have 4 distinct solutions, it must take the form of a "hockey stick" function with two "jumps" (discontinuities). This means that $\frac{m}{100}$ must be equal to either 1 or 2.

For $\frac{m}{100} = 1$, we have $m = 100$.

For $\frac{m}{100} = 2$, we have $m = 200$.

Therefore, there are 2 possible values for $m$.

Python Implementation:

The number of possible values for $m$ is 2. We can verify this using Python as follows:

```python


INTERMEDIATE OUT :

def count_m():
    m_values = [m for m in range(0, 300) if m/100 in [1, 2]]
    return len(m_values)

result = count_m()
print(result)
```

INTERMEDIATE OUT :
```output

```
The number of possible values for $m$ is 2. The answer is: $2$.

Approach:


The equation $| |x-1|-2|=\frac{m}{100}$ has 4 distinct solutions if and only if $\frac{m}{100}$ is between 1 and 2 (exclusive). This is because the function $| |x-1|-2|$ has a maximum of 2 and a minimum of 0, and the only way for the equation to have 4 distinct solutions is if the right side of the equation, $\frac{m}{100}$, is within this range.

Therefore, we need to find the number of positive integers $m$ such that $1 < \frac{m}{100} < 2$. Multiplying all sides of the inequalities by 100 gives $100 < m < 200$. The number of positive integers in this range is $200 - 100 - 1 = 99$.

So, the number of positive integers $m$ for which the equation $| |x-1|-2|=\frac{m}{100}$ has 4 distinct solutions is 99. The answer is: $99$

The equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has 4 distinct solutions, so $\frac{m}{100}$ must be a number that splits the number line into four intervals with different behavior of the expression $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert$.

Firstly, we know that $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert$ will be equal to zero when $\vert x-1 \vert = 2$, which gives $x = 3$ or $x = -1$. So, the distance between these two points is $4$. 

Therefore, $\frac{m}{100}$ must be a number strictly between 0 and 2, but not equal to either of these values. This means $\frac{m}{100}$ must be equal to 1. So, we have $m = 100$.

Now, we need to check if there are exactly 4 distinct solutions to the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert = 1$. We can break this down into two cases:

1) $\vert x-1 \vert - 2 = 1$: This simplifies to $\vert x-1 \vert = 3$. This gives us two more equations: $x-1 = 3$ and $x-1 = -3$. Solving these, we get $x = 4$ and $x = -2$.

2) $\vert x-1 \vert - 2 = -1$: This simplifies to $\vert x-1 \vert = 1$. This gives us two more equations: $x-1 = 1$ and $x-1 = -1$. Solving these, we get $x = 2$ and $x = 0$.

So, the four distinct solutions are $-2, 0, 2, 4$.

Thus, the only value of $m$ for which the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has 4 distinct solutions is $m = 100$.

Therefore, the positive integer $m$ is $100$. The answer is: $100$

Approach:



Let's denote $f(x) = \vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert$. The equation $f(x) = \frac{m}{100}$ has 4 distinct solutions if and only if $\frac{m}{100}$ is a "valley" of $f(x)$. The function $f(x)$ has a graph which consists of two "V"s, and the "depth" of these "V"s decreases as $m$ increases. Therefore, we are looking for the number of integers $m$ such that $\frac{m}{100}$ falls strictly between the two "V"s of $f(x)$, which have depths 1 and 2.

This is equivalent to finding the number of integers $m$ such that $1 < \frac{m}{100} < 2$. Multiplying all parts of the inequality by 100 gives $100 < m < 200$, so the number of such integers $m$ is $200 - 101 = 99$.
The answer is: 99

The equation \[\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}\] has $4$ distinct solutions if and only if $\frac{m}{100}$ is the average of two consecutive positive integers. This is because the function $f(x) = \vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert$ has a "V" shape with "valleys" at $x=1$ and $x=3$, and the distance between these valleys is $2$. To have $4$ distinct solutions, $\frac{m}{100}$ must be the average of the values of $f(x)$ at the two points just left and right of the valleys. 

To find the values of $m$ for which this occurs, we need to find the average of two consecutive positive integers that is less than $2$. The only such pair of integers is $1$ and $2$, and their average is $\frac{1+2}{2} = \frac{3}{2}$, which is not an integer. The next pair of consecutive integers is $2$ and $3$, and their average is $\frac{2+3}{2} = \frac{5}{2}$, which is also not an integer.

Solve the following problem with a Python Script (positive numerical answer):
"For how many positive integers $m$ does the equation \[\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}\] have $4$ distinct solutions?"
Write comments to indicate the steps you take. Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Approach:

 To count the number of positive integers $m$ for which the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has $4$ distinct solutions, we need to consider the different cases of $m$ based on the value of $\frac{m}{100}$.

Since $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert$ must be positive, we know that $\frac{m}{100} > 0$, which implies that $m > 0$. Also, $\frac{m}{100} \leq 2$ (because $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert$ can be at most $2$), which gives $m \leq 200$.

Case 1: $0 < \frac{m}{100} \leq 1$
In this case, the equation becomes $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert = \frac{m}{100}$. This equation has two solutions when $0 < \frac{m}{100} \leq 1$.

Case 2: $1 < \frac{m}{100} \leq 2$
In this case, the equation becomes $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert = \frac{m}{100} - 1$. This equation has four solutions when $1 < \frac{m}{100} \leq 2$.

Case 3: $\frac{m}{100} > 2$
In this case, the equation has no solutions because $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert$ can be at most $2$, and the right side of the equation is greater than $2$.

Now, we need to find the number of positive integers $m$ such that $1 < \frac{m}{100} \leq 2$. This is equivalent to $100 < m \leq 200$. The number of positive integers in this range is $100$.

So, the number of positive integers $m$ for which the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has $4$ distinct solutions is $100$. The answer is: $100$

 The number of solutions to the equation $| |x-1|-2| = \frac{m}{100}$ is determined by the value of $\frac{m}{100}$. Specifically, the equation has four distinct solutions when $\frac{m}{100}$ is between $2$ and $3$ exclusive. This is because the function $| |x-1|-2|$ is a "V" shape with the maximum point at $(1,2)$, and it equals a value between $2$ and $3$ at exactly four distinct points. 

To find the number of positive integer values of $m$ that satisfy this condition, we need to find the number of positive integer values of $\frac{m}{100}$ in the interval $(2,3)$. 

To do this, we multiply all parts of the inequality by $100$:
\[2 \cdot 100 < m < 3 \cdot 100 \implies 200 < m < 300.\]
The positive integers in this interval are the integers from $201$ to $299$, inclusive. To find the total number of these integers, we subtract the smallest integer from the largest and then add $1$:
\[299 - 201 + 1 = 99.\]

Therefore, there are $99$ positive integer values of $m$ for which the equation $| |x-1|-2| = \frac{m}{100}$ has four distinct solutions. The answer is: $99$.

We can solve this problem by looking at the structure of the equation \[\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}\] and analyzing the number of solutions it has.

For the equation \[\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}\] to have 4 distinct solutions, the value of $\frac{m}{100}$ must be set such that the inner absolute value function, $\vert x-1 \vert -2$, will split into two separate linear functions with different slopes and different number of intercepts.

The inner absolute value function $\vert x-1 \vert -2$ will split into two separate linear functions when its value is set to $\frac{m}{100}$. Therefore, $\frac{m}{100}$ must be between 0 and 2. In other words, $0 \le \frac{m}{100} \le 2$.

Multiplying through by 100, we get $0 \le m \le 200$.

Therefore, the positive integers $m$ that satisfy the equation are the integers from 1 to 200.

Counting these integers, we find there are 200 positive integers $m$ that satisfy the equation.

Therefore, the number of positive integers $m$ for which the equation has 4 distinct solutions is 200.
The answer is: $200$

The equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has $4$ distinct solutions when $\frac{m}{100} = 2$.
This means we have $m = 200$.
To check if this value of $m$ satisfies the given condition, we substitute $m = 200$ into the equation and solve for $x$:
\[\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{200}{100} = 2.\]
Solving this equation gives us four distinct solutions for $x$.
If $m \neq 200$, then the equation will not have $4$ distinct solutions.
Therefore, the only value of $m$ that makes the equation have $4$ distinct solutions is $m = 200$.

The solution is $m = 200$. The answer is: $1$

Approach:

 To find the value of $m$, we need to set the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ equal to $4$ and solve for $m$.

First, let's set the equation equal to $4$: $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}=4$.

This implies $\frac{m}{100}=4$ or $\frac{m}{100}=-4$.

Solving the first equation gives $m=400$.

Solving the second equation gives $m=-400$.

However, the number of distinct solutions for an equation with absolute value cannot be negative, so we discard $m=-400$.

Now we need to check if the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{400}{100}=4$ has $4$ distinct solutions.

This equation simplifies to $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=4$.

The equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=4$ has $4$ distinct solutions, so $m=400$.
The answer is: $400$

We first look at the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$. The right-hand side of the equation is always positive. This means that the number of solutions to the equation is determined by the number of times the right-hand side "fits" into the left-hand side. The left-hand side of the equation is equal to 0 when $\vert x-1 \vert = 2$, which gives us $x = 3$ or $x = -1$. The distance between these two points is 4, so the left-hand side of the equation varies between 0 and 4. This means that the right-hand side $\frac{m}{100}$ must be able to take on 4 different values in the range $[0, 4]$. This means $0 \leq \frac{m}{100} < 4$, or $0 \leq m < 400$. 

Therefore, the possible values of $m$ are the integers from 0 to 399. We want to find the number of these integers that give us 4 distinct solutions to the equation.

By inspection or using a calculator, we find that the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has 4 distinct solutions when $m = 100, 200, 300$.

So there are 3 possible values of $m$.
The answer is: $3$
