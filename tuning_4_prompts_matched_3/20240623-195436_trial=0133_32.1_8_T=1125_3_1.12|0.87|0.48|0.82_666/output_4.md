Approach:


We can solve this problem by using the given functional equations step by step.

First, we know that $f(f(f(100))) = 8*100 - 7 = 793$.
Let's denote $x = f(100)$. Then we have $f(f(x)) = 793$.

Now, we know that $f(f(x)) = 793$, using the second equation we have $f(2x) = 2f(x) + 1$.
So, we can substitute $x$ with $100$ to get $f(2*100) = 2f(100) + 1$.
This simplifies to $f(200) = 2f(100) + 1$.

We know that $f(200) = 793$, so we have $793 = 2f(100) + 1$.
Subtracting $1$ from both sides gives $792 = 2f(100)$, and dividing by $2$ gives $f(100) = 396$.

So, the value of $f(100)$ is $396$.
The answer is: $396$

"A function $f: \mathbb N \to \mathbb N$ satisfies the following two conditions for all positive integers $n$:$f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$ and $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$. Calculate $f(100)$."

Approach:


To find the value of $f(100)$, we can use the second given condition $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$ repeatedly to reduce $100$ to a smaller number for which we can use the first given condition $f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$.

Let's start with $n=100$:
$f(100)$:
Using the second condition with $n=50$, we get $f(100) = 2f(50)+1$.
Now we need to find $f(50)$:
Using the second condition with $n=25$, we get $f(50) = 2f(25)+1$.
Next, we need to find $f(25)$:
Using the second condition with $n=12.5$ (not a positive integer, so we cannot use this directly), we can observe that $25 = 2*12.5$. So we can write $f(25) = 2f(12.5)+1$.
But we can't go further with the second condition because we have a non-integer value $12.5$.

However, we can use the first condition now: $f(f(f(12.5)))=8*12.5-7=100-7=93$.
Since $f(f(f(12.5)))=93$, we have $f(12.5)= \frac{93}{f(f(1))}$.
But we know from the first condition that $f(f(f(1)))=8*1-7=1$, so $f(12.5)= \frac{93}{1}=93$.

Now we can find $f(25)$: $f(25) = 2f(12.5)+1 = 2*93+1=186+1=187$.

Finally, we can find $f(50)$: $f(50) = 2f(25)+1 = 2*187+1=374+1=375$.

Now we can find $f(100)$: $f(100) = 2f(50)+1 = 2*375+1=750+1=751$.

So, $f(100) = 751$.
The answer is: $751$

Approach:


We can start by applying the second condition to the first equation. We get $f(f(f(2n)))=8(2n)-7=16n-7$. Since $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$, we can substitute this into the equation to get $f(f(2f(n)+1))=16n-7$. Now, we can apply the second condition again to get $f(2(f(n)+1))=16n-7$, which simplifies to $2f(f(n)+1)+1=16n-7$. We can then subtract 1 from both sides to get $2f(f(n)+1)=16n-8$. Dividing both sides by 2 gives us $f(f(n)+1)=8n-4$.
Now, we want to find $f(100)$. We know that $f(f(f(100)))=8(100)-7=793$. Let's set $n=50$ in the equation $f(f(n)+1)=8n-4$ to get $f(51)=8(50)-4=396$. Now, we can set $n=25$ in the same equation to get $f(26)=8(25)-4=196$. Finally, setting $n=13$ gives us $f(14)=8(13)-4=92$.
Now, we can use these values to find $f(100)$. Since $f(f(f(100)))=793$, we know that $f(100)$ is the value that makes $f(f(x))=793$. From our previous calculations, we know that $f(14)=92$, so we can set $x=14$ in the equation $f(f(x))=793$ to get $f(92)=793$.
Now, we need to find the value of $f(92)$. We can start by setting $n=46$ in the equation $f(f(n)+1)=8n-4$ to get $f(47)=8(46)-4=364$. Setting $n=23$ gives us $f(24)=8(23)-4=180$. Setting $n=12$ gives us $f(13)=8(12)-4=92$. Finally, setting $n=6$ gives us $f(7)=8(6)-4=44$.
Setting $n=3$ in the equation $f(f(n)+1)=8n-4$ gives us $f(4)=8(3)-4=20$. Setting $n=2$ gives us $f(3)=8(2)-4=12$. Setting $n=1$ gives us $f(2)=8(1)-4=4$. Finally, setting $n=1$ gives us $f(1)=8(1)-4=4$.
Now, we can use these values to find $f(92)$. Since $f(7)=44$, we can set $x=7$ in the equation $f(f(x))=793$ to get $f(44)=793$. From our previous calculations, we know that $f(4)=20$, so we can set $x=4$ in the equation $f(f(x))=793$ to get $f(20)=793$. Setting $n=10$ in the equation $f(f(n)+1)=8n-4$ gives us $f(11)=8(10)-4=76$. Setting $n=5$ gives us $f(6)=8(5)-4=36$. Setting $n=3$ gives us $f(4)=8(3)-4=20$. Setting $n=2$ gives us $f(3)=8(2)-4=12$. Setting $n=1$ gives us $f(2)=8(1)-4=4$. Finally, setting $n=1$ gives us $f(1)=8(1)-4=4$.
Therefore, we have found that $f(92)=793$.
Since $f(f(f(100)))=793$, we know that $f(100)$ is the value that makes $f(x)=793$. From our previous calculations, we know that $f(14)=92$, so we can set $x=14$ in the equation $f(x)=793$ to get $f(14)=793$. Therefore, $f(100)=14$. The answer is: $14$

Assistant:

Approach:


To calculate $f(100)$, we can first calculate $f(2 \cdot 50)$ using the second condition of the function, and then use the first condition to calculate $f(f(50))$. By repeating this process, we can eventually reach $f(100)$.

First, we calculate $f(2 \cdot 50) = 2f(50) + 1$.
Next, we substitute $f(50)$ with $f(f(25))$ using the first condition.
We continue this process until we reach $f(100)$.

Note: We will need to use the first condition repeatedly to express $f(50)$ and $f(25)$ in terms of $f(n)$ until we reach $f(100)$.

Also note: This problem may seem complex at first glance, but once you start calculating, you'll see a pattern emerge that simplifies the problem significantly.

Python code:
```python


INTERMEDIATE OUT :

def f(n):
    if n == 1:
        return 1
    elif n == 2:
        return 3
    elif n % 2 == 0:
        return 2 * f(n // 2) + 1
    else:
        return 8 * (n - 1) // 4 - 1

result = f(100)
print(result)
```

CODE RESULTS 191

INTERMEDIATE OUT :
```output
191
```
The answer is: $191$.
The python function $f(n)$ is defined recursively based on the two conditions of the function. The function $f(n)$ is equal to $1$ when $n$ is $1$, and it's equal to $3$ when $n$ is $2$. For even $n$, $f(n)$ is equal to $2f(n/2) + 1$. For odd $n$, $f(n)$ is equal to $8(n-1)/4 - 1$.
The value of $f(100)$ is calculated using this function and is found to be $191$.
The answer is: $\boxed{191}$

Approach:


We are given the function $f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$ and $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$. We need to find the value of $f(100)$. 

One way to approach this problem is to try to find a pattern in the function. 

By substituting $n=1$ into the equation $f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$, we get $f(f(f(1)))=8*1-7=1$, which implies that $f(f(1))=1$. 

Then by substituting $n=1$ into the equation $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$, we get $f(2*1)=2f(1)+1$, which implies that $f(2)=2f(1)+1$. Since $f(f(1))=1$, we have $f(2)=2*1+1=3$. 

By substituting $n=2$ into the equation $f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$, we get $f(f(f(2)))=8*2-7=9$, which implies that $f(f(3))=9$. 

Then by substituting $n=3$ into the equation $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$, we get $f(2*3)=2f(3)+1$, which implies that $f(6)=2f(3)+1$. Since $f(f(3))=9$, we have $f(6)=2*9+1=19$.

We can continue this process to find more values of $f(n)$, but it will be quite tedious. 

Another approach is to notice that $f(100)$ is a specific value of the function $f(n)$. If we can find a pattern in the function, we can use this pattern to find $f(100)$.

From the equation $f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$, we know that for any $n$, $f(f(f(n)))$ is always $1$ more than a multiple of $8$. 

From the equation $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$, we can see that $f(n)$ is always one more than an even number. This implies that $f(n)$ is always an odd number.

By trying some values of $n$, we can observe that $f(n)$ is always three times the value of $n$ minus one. That is, $f(n)=3n-1$. 

To verify this, we can substitute $n=100$ into the function $f(n)=3n-1$, we get $f(100)=3*100-1=299$.

Now, we need to check if this function satisfies the given conditions. 

For the first condition, $f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$, we substitute $f(n)=3n-1$ into it, we get $f(f(f(n)))=f(f(3n-1))=f(3(3n-1)-1)=f(9n-4)=8n-7$. This is true.

For the second condition, $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$, we substitute $f(n)=3n-1$ into it, we get $f(2n)=2(3n-1)+1=6n-2+1=6n-1$. But we know that $f(2n)=2f(n)+1=2(3n-1)+1=6n-2+1=6n-1$. This is also true.

Therefore, our assumption that $f(n)=3n-1$ is correct. So, $f(100)=3*100-1=299$.
The answer is: $299$

We start by evaluating the second equation with $n=50$, we get $f(100) = 2f(50) + 1$. 

Next, we use the first equation with $n=50$, we get $f(f(f(50))) = 8*50 - 7 = 393$. 

Since $f(f(f(50))) = f(f(x)) = 393$, we can set $x = f(50)$, so $f(x) = f(f(50))$. 

Now, using the second equation again with $n=x$, we get $f(f(x)) = 2f(x) + 1$. 

Substitute $f(x) = f(f(50))$ into this equation, we get $393 = 2f(f(50)) + 1$. 

Solving for $f(f(50))$, we get $f(f(50)) = \frac{393 - 1}{2} = 196$. 

Now, substitute $f(f(50)) = 196$ into the equation $f(f(x)) = 2f(x) + 1$, we get $196 = 2f(x) + 1$. 

Solving for $f(x)$, we get $f(x) = \frac{196 - 1}{2} = 97.5$, but this is not possible because the function $f$ is defined on the set of natural numbers. 

We must have made a mistake somewhere. Let's retrace our steps.

Upon reexamination, we realize that we made a mistake in the substitution. Instead of substituting $f(x) = f(f(50))$ into the equation $f(f(x)) = 2f(x) + 1$, we should substitute $x = f(50)$ into the equation $f(f(x)) = 2f(x) + 1$.

Doing this, we get $f(f(f(50))) = 2f(f(50)) + 1$. 

Substitute $f(f(f(50))) = 393$, we get $393 = 2f(f(50)) + 1$. 

Solving for $f(f(50))$, we get $f(f(50)) = \frac{393 - 1}{2} = 196$. 

Now, substitute $f(f(50)) = 196$ into the equation $f(f(x)) = 2f(x) + 1$, we get $196 = 2f(f(50)) + 1$. 

Solving for $f(f(50))$, we get $f(f(50)) = \frac{196 - 1}{2} = 97.5$, but this is not possible because the function $f$ is defined on the set of natural numbers. 

We must have made another mistake. Let's retrace our steps again.

Doing this, we get $f(f(f(50))) = 2f(f(50)) + 1$. 

Substitute $f(f(f(50))) = 393$, we get $393 = 2f(f(50)) + 1$. 

Solving for $f(f(50))$, we get $f(f(50)) = \frac{393 - 1}{2} = 196$. 

Now, substitute $f(f(50)) = 196$ into the equation $f(f(x)) = 2f(x) + 1$, we get $196 = 2f(x) + 1$. 

Solving for $f(x)$, we get $f(x) = \frac{196 - 1}{2} = 97.5$, but this is not possible because the function $f$ is defined on the set of natural numbers. 

We must have made a third mistake. Let's retrace our steps one last time.

Upon reexamination, we realize that we made a mistake in the step where we substituted $f(f(50)) = 196$ into the equation $f(f(x)) = 2f(x) + 1$. We should not substitute the value of $f(f(50))$ into the equation, but rather solve for $f(50)$ using the equation $f(f(50)) = 196$.

Doing this, we get $f(50) = \frac{196 + 1}{2} = 98.5$, but this is not possible because the function $f$ is defined on the set of natural numbers. 

We must have made another mistake. Let's retrace our steps one last time.

Doing this, we get $f(f(50)) = 196$. 

Now, substitute $f(f(50)) = 196$ into the equation $f(f(x)) = 2f(x) + 1$, we get $196 = 2f(x) + 1$.

Approach:


To find $f(100)$, we can start by plugging in $n=50$ into the second equation, which gives us $f(100) = 2f(50) + 1$. We still need to find $f(50)$, so let's plug $n=25$ into the second equation to get $f(50) = 2f(25) + 1$. Now we need to find $f(25)$.

We can continue this process until we reach the base case, which is when we can directly apply the first equation. The base case is when $n=1$, for which we have $f(f(f(1))) = 8(1) - 7 = -1$. Since the function $f$ maps from $\mathbb{N}$ to $\mathbb{N}$, it cannot output a negative number, so we must have $f(1) = 1$.

Now we can work our way back up to find $f(100)$. Using the second equation, we get $f(50) = 2f(25) + 1$, and then $f(100) = 2f(50) + 1$. To find $f(25)$, we use the second equation again: $f(25) = 2f(12.5)$. Since $12.5$ is not an integer, we cannot continue this process. But we can use the first equation to get around this issue. Since $f(f(f(1))) = -1$, and we know $f(1) = 1$, we can substitute $n=1$ into the first equation to get $f(f(1)) = 8(1) - 7 = 1$. Then, using the second equation again, we get $f(2) = 2f(1) + 1 = 3$. Now we can continue using the second equation to find $f(4) = 2f(2) + 1 = 7$, $f(8) = 2f(4) + 1 = 15$, $f(16) = 2f(8) + 1 = 31$, and so on. We can keep doing this until we find that $f(25) = 127$.

Then we can work our way back up to find $f(50) = 2f(25) + 1 = 2(127) + 1 = 255$, and finally $f(100) = 2f(50) + 1 = 2(255) + 1 = 511$.

So, $f(100) = 511$. The answer is: $511$

Solve the following problem with a Python Script (positive numerical answer):

Approach:



We are given two functional equations, and we need to find $f(100)$. One way to do this is to start with $n=100$ and repeatedly apply the given functional equations.

First, we substitute $n=100$ into the second equation to get $f(200) = 2f(100) + 1$. 

Then, we substitute $f(100)$ into the first equation with $n = f(100)$, which gives $f(f(f(100))) = 8f(100) - 7$.

Since $f(f(f(100))) = f(f(2f(100) + 1))$, and we know from the second equation that $f(2f(100) + 1) = 2f(f(100)) + 1$, we can substitute this into the equation above to get $f(2f(2f(100) + 1)) = 8f(100) - 7$.

But from the second equation, we know that $f(2f(2f(100) + 1)) = 2f(f(2f(100) + 1)) + 1 = 2(2f(f(100)) + 1) + 1 = 4f(f(100)) + 3$.

Setting this equal to $8f(100) - 7$, we get $4f(f(100)) + 3 = 8f(100) - 7$.

Rearranging terms, we get $4f(f(100)) - 8f(100) = -10$, or $4(f(f(100)) - 2f(100)) = -10$.

Dividing both sides by 4, we get $f(f(100)) - 2f(100) = -2.5$.

But this is a contradiction because the left-hand side is an integer while the right-hand side is not. This means that our initial assumption that the function $f$ is well-defined for all positive integers must be incorrect.

However, if we look at the first equation more closely, we can see that if we set $n = 1$, we get $f(f(f(1))) = 8*1 - 7 = -1$, which is impossible since $f(1)$ must be a positive integer. 

This suggests that the function $f$ might not be well-defined for all positive integers, or it might not satisfy the given functional equations exactly.

But if we look at the second equation again, we can see that it implies that $f(n)$ is an odd function of $n$. That is, $f(n)$ will be odd if $n$ is odd, and even if $n$ is even.

This suggests that we might need to reconsider the problem and look for a different approach.

After some experimentation, we find that the function $f(n) = 2n - 1$ satisfies both given functional equations.

For the first equation, $f(f(f(n))) = f(f(2n - 1)) = f(2(2n - 1) - 1) = f(4n - 3) = 2(4n - 3) - 1 = 8n - 7$.

For the second equation, $f(2n) = 2(2n) - 1 = 4n - 1 = 2f(n) + 1$.

So, we can conclude that $f(n) = 2n - 1$.

Now, we can calculate $f(100)$ as $f(100) = 2*100 - 1 = 199$.

So, the answer is $f(100) = 199$.
The answer is: $199$

Approach:


We can start by substituting $n = 100$ into the second condition to find $f(200) = 2f(100) + 1$. Then we can substitute $n = f(100)$ into the first condition to find $f(f(f(100))) = f(f(2f(100) + 1)) = 8*100 - 7 = 793$. Therefore, we have $f(f(2f(100) + 1)) = 793$.

Next, we substitute $n = 2f(100) + 1$ into the second condition to find $f(2(2f(100) + 1)) = 2f(2f(100) + 1) + 1$. That is, $f(4f(100) + 2) = 2f(2f(100) + 1) + 1$.

Since $f(200) = 2f(100) + 1$, we can replace $2f(100) + 1$ with $f(200)$ in the above equation to get $f(4f(100) + 2) = 2f(f(200)) + 1$.

By substituting $n = f(200)$ into the first condition, we have $f(f(f(200))) = 8*200 - 7 = 1593$. Therefore, we have $f(4f(100) + 2) = 1593$.

Now we have two equations: $f(f(2f(100) + 1)) = 793$ and $f(4f(100) + 2) = 1593$.

We can see that $4f(100) + 2 = f(2f(100) + 1)$. Therefore, we can equate the two equations to get $793 = 1593 - 2f(f(100))$. Solving this equation gives $f(f(100)) = 400$.

Substituting $n = f(100)$ into the first condition again, we have $f(f(f(100))) = 8*100 - 7 = 793$. Therefore, we have $f(f(100)) = 400$.

Finally, substituting $n = 400$ into the first condition again, we have $f(f(f(400))) = 8*400 - 7 = 3193$. Therefore, we have $f(100) = 625$ since $f(400) = 100$.

Therefore, the value of $f(100)$ is 625. The answer is: $\boxed{625}$

Approach:

 We will try to find the value of $f(100)$ by using the given functional equations.

Firstly, we know that $f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$. This implies that $f(f(n))$ is the inverse function of $g(n)=8n-7$. Let's denote the inverse function of $g(n)$ as $g^{-1}(n)$, then we have $f(f(n))=g^{-1}(n)$. 

Secondly, we know that $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$. This implies that the function $f(n)$ is not linear. 

We can start by finding $f(1)$ using the second equation. Setting $n=1$, we get $f(2)=2f(1)+1$. But we also know that $f(f(f(1)))=8*1-7=1$, so $f(f(1))=1$. Then $f(1)=g^{-1}(1)$, and we need to find the inverse of $g(n)$ to get $f(1)$. 

The function $g(n)$ is given by $g(n)=8n-7$. To find its inverse, we can rearrange the equation to solve for $n$: $n=\frac{g(n)+7}{8}$. So the inverse function $g^{-1}(n)$ is $g^{-1}(n)=\frac{n+7}{8}$. Therefore, $f(1)=g^{-1}(1)=\frac{1+7}{8}=1$.

Now that we know $f(1)=1$, we can substitute this into the second equation to find $f(2)$: $f(2)=2f(1)+1=2*1+1=3$.

Next, we can use the second equation to find $f(4)$: $f(4)=2f(2)+1=2*3+1=7$.

And finally, we can use the second equation to find $f(100)$: $f(100)=2f(50)+1$. 

We can continue this process to find $f(50)$ using the second equation. Setting $n=25$ in the second equation, we get $f(50)=2f(25)+1$. Again, we can use the second equation to find $f(25)$: $f(25)=2f(12.5)+1$. But $f(12.5)$ is not a valid input for the function $f(n)$ since it's not an integer. 

So let's try a different approach. We know that $f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$, and we know that $f(1)=1$. Therefore, we can set $n=1$ in this equation to get $f(f(f(1)))=8*1-7=1$, which implies $f(f(1))=1$. Since we already know that $f(1)=1$, we can conclude that $f(f(1))=1$. 

Now, we can use the second equation again to find $f(2)$: $f(2)=2f(1)+1=2*1+1=3$.

And we already found that $f(2)=3$. Therefore, $f(f(2))=f(3)$. Setting $n=2$ in the second equation, we get $f(6)=2f(3)+1$. But we already know that $f(2)=3$, so we can substitute this in to get $f(6)=2*3+1=7$.

Now, we can use the second equation again to find $f(100)$: $f(100)=2f(50)+1$. Setting $n=50$ in the second equation, we get $f(100)=2f(50)+1$. And we can use the second equation to find $f(50)$: $f(50)=2f(25)+1$. Setting $n=25$ in the second equation, we get $f(50)=2f(25)+1$. 

Continuing this process, we can find that $f(100)=2*2*2*f(1)+1=8*1+1=9$. But this doesn't match with our previous calculations. 

We must have made a mistake somewhere. Let's go back and check our calculations. 

We found that $f(1)=1$, $f(2)=3$, $f(4)=7$, and $f(100)=9$. But we know from the first equation that $f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$. Let's check if this equation holds for $n=100$. 

We have $f(f(f(100)))=f(f(9))=f(7)=15$, but $8*100-7=793$, which is not equal to $15$. So our calculations must be wrong somewhere. 

Let's go back and check our calculations again.

Approach:



First, we need to find a value for $f(1)$ using the second given equation: $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$. Setting $n=1$, we get $f(2)=2f(1)+1$. But we also know from the first equation that $f(f(f(1)))=8(1)-7=1$, so $f(f(f(1)))=1$. Since $f(f(f(1)))=f(f(1))$ because $f$ maps natural numbers to natural numbers, and $f(f(1))=f(1)$ because $f$ maps natural numbers to natural numbers, we have $f(1)=1$.

Now, we can use the second given equation to find $f(2)$: $f(2)=2f(1)+1=2(1)+1=3$.

Next, we can use the first given equation to find $f(3)$: $f(f(f(3)))=8(3)-7=19$. Since $f(f(f(3)))=f(f(3))$ because $f$ maps natural numbers to natural numbers, and $f(f(3))=f(3)$ because $f$ maps natural numbers to natural numbers, we have $f(3)=19$.

Continuing in this way, we can find $f(4)=7$, $f(5)=31$, $f(6)=15$, $f(7)=63$, $f(8)=31$, $f(9)=127$, $f(10)=63$, $f(11)=255$, $f(12)=127$, and so on.

We can see a pattern that $f(2^n-1)=2^{n+2}-3$ for all positive integers $n$. Therefore, $f(100)=f(2^{6+1}-1)=2^{6+2}-3=256-3=253$.
The answer is: $\boxed{253}$

We can start by finding the value of $f(1)$ using the equation $f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$ with $n=1$. We have $f(f(f(1)))=8(1)-7=1$.

Then we can use the equation $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$ to find the value of $f(1)$. We set $n=1$ and we have $f(2)=2f(1)+1$. Since $f(f(f(1)))=1$, we have $f(2)=2f(1)+1=1$. This implies that $f(1)=0$.

Now we can use the equation $f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$ with $n=2$. We have $f(f(f(2)))=8(2)-7=9$. But since $f(2)=1$, we have $f(f(1))=9$. Since $f(1)=0$, we have $f(0)=9$.

Now we can use the equation $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$ again. We set $n=50$ and we have $f(100)=2f(50)+1$. We can use the equation $f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$ with $n=50$ to find the value of $f(50)$. We have $f(f(f(50)))=8(50)-7=393$. But since $f(f(f(50)))=f(50)$, we have $f(50)=393$.

Finally, we substitute $f(50)=393$ into the equation $f(100)=2f(50)+1$ to find the value of $f(100)$. We have $f(100)=2(393)+1=787$.

So the value of $f(100)$ is 787.
The answer is: $787$

To find the value of $f(100)$, we can use the second equation from the problem statement to express $f(100)$ in terms of $f(50)$ and then use the second equation again to express $f(50)$ in terms of $f(25)$. This process can be repeated until we reach a value that we can easily compute. Then we can work our way back up to find $f(100)$.

First, we use the second equation with $n=50$ to get $f(100)=2f(50)+1$. Then we express $f(50)$ in terms of $f(25)$ using the second equation with $n=25$: $f(50)=2f(25)+1$. Substituting this into the equation for $f(100)$, we get $f(100)=2(2f(25)+1)+1=4f(25)+3$.

Now we express $f(25)$ in terms of $f(12.5)$, but since $12.5$ is not a positive integer, we can't use the second equation directly. However, we can use the first equation from the problem statement with $n=12.5$: $f(f(f(12.5)))=8(12.5)-7=93$. Since $f(f(f(12.5)))=f(f(100))$, we have $f(f(100))=93$.

We now have a system of equations:
\[f(f(100))=93,\]
\[f(100)=2f(50)+1,\]
\[f(50)=2f(25)+1.\]

From the first equation, we can express $f(100)$ in terms of $f(50)$: $f(100)=f(f^{-1}(93))$. Since $f(f(x))=8x-7$, we have $f^{-1}(x)=\frac{x+7}{8}$. So $f(100)=f\left(\frac{93+7}{8}\right)=f(13)$.

Using the second equation with $n=25$, we get $f(50)=2f(25)+1$. We can express $f(25)$ in terms of $f(13)$ using the second equation with $n=13$: $f(25)=2f(13)+1$. Substituting this into the equation for $f(50)$, we get $f(50)=2(2f(13)+1)+1=4f(13)+3$.

Substituting this into the equation for $f(100)$, we get $f(100)=2(4f(13)+3)+1=8f(13)+7$. But we know from the first equation that $f(100)=93$, so we have $93=8f(13)+7$. Solving for $f(13)$, we get $f(13)=\frac{93-7}{8}=10$.

Finally, we substitute $f(13)=10$ into the equation for $f(25)$ to get $f(25)=2(10)+1=21$. Then we substitute $f(25)=21$ into the equation for $f(50)$ to get $f(50)=4(21)+3=87$. And finally, we substitute $f(50)=87$ into the equation for $f(100)$ to get $f(100)=2(87)+1=175$.

However, this value doesn't match the value we got from the first equation $f(f(100))=93$. This indicates that there must have been a mistake in our calculations. Let's go back and check our work.

Upon re-examining our calculations, we realize that when we expressed $f(25)$ in terms of $f(13)$, we assumed that $f(25)=2f(13)$, which is not necessarily true based on the given equations. In fact, from the first equation with $n=13$, we have $f(f(f(13)))=8(13)-7=99$, so $f(f(13))=99$. But $f(f(13))=f(99)$, so $f(99)=99$.

Now we have a new system of equations:
\[f(f(100))=93,\]
\[f(100)=2f(50)+1,\]
\[f(50)=2f(25)+1,\]
\[f(25)=2f(13)+1.\]

From the first equation, we can express $f(100)$ in terms of $f(50)$: $f(100)=f(f^{-1}(93))$. Since $f(f(x))=99$, we have $f^{-1}(x)=\frac{x}{99}$. So $f(100)=f\left(\frac{93}{99}\right)$. But this doesn't make sense, because $f(100)$ is a positive integer, and $\frac{93}{99}$ is not an integer.

We must have made a mistake in our calculations. Let's go back and re-examine our work.

Approach:



We are given two equations for the function $f$. The first equation is $f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$ and the second equation is $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$. We want to find $f(100)$.

To find $f(100)$, we can start by finding $f(50)$ using the second equation. Then we can find $f(25)$ and finally $f(100)$ using the first equation.

First, substitute $n=50$ into the second equation to get $f(100)=2f(50)+1$.

Now we need to find $f(50)$. We can do this by substituting $n=25$ into the second equation to get $f(50)=2f(25)+1$.

Next, we need to find $f(25)$. We can do this by substituting $n=12.5$ into the first equation. But $n$ must be a positive integer, so this equation is not applicable here.

However, we can use the second equation to find $f(25)$ and $f(50)$.

Substituting $n=25$ into the second equation gives $f(50)=2f(25)+1$.

Substituting $n=50$ into the second equation gives $f(100)=2f(50)+1$.

We now have a system of three equations:

1. $f(100)=2f(50)+1$.
2. $f(50)=2f(25)+1$.
3. $f(25)$ is found from the first equation, but $f(25)$ is not an integer.

We can substitute equation (2) into equation (1) to eliminate $f(50)$:

$f(100)=2(2f(25)+1)+1=4f(25)+3$.

Now we have a new equation: $f(100)=4f(25)+3$.

We can use the first equation to find $f(25)$. We know that $f(f(f(25)))=8(25)-7=173$.

Since $f(f(f(25)))=173$, we can substitute $n=25$ into the first equation to get $f(173)=8(25)-7=193$.

Then we can substitute $f(25)=173$ into the new equation to get $f(100)=4(173)+3=695$.

So, $f(100)=695$.
The answer is: $695$

To find $f(100)$, we can use the second condition $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$. We can start by calculating $f(50)$, then $f(25)$, and so on, until we reach $f(1)$. Then, we can use the first condition $f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$ to find $f(1)$, and finally, use the second condition to find $f(100)$.

Let's start:

1. $f(50) = 2f(25)+1$.
2. $f(25) = 2f(12.5)+1$. But $12.5$ is not a positive integer, so we can't use the second condition directly.
3. But we can notice that $f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$. If we set $n=1$, we get $f(f(f(1)))=8*1-7=1$. So $f(1)=1$.
4. Then we can use the second condition to find $f(25)$, $f(50)$, and so on.
5. $f(25) = 2f(12.5)+1 = 2*f(f(f(12.5)))+1 = 2*(8*12.5-7)+1 = 2*(100-7)+1 = 2*93+1 = 186+1 = 187$.
6. $f(50) = 2f(25)+1 = 2*187+1 = 374+1 = 375$.
7. $f(100) = 2f(50)+1 = 2*375+1 = 750+1 = 751$.

So the value of $f(100)$ is 751.

1. $f(50) = 2f(25)+1 = 2*187+1 = 374+1 = 375$.
2. $f(100) = 2f(50)+1 = 2*375+1 = 750+1 = 751$.

So the value of $f(100)$ is 751.

## QUESTION 4 - 15 
- TIME_SPENT : 820 secs

15_User:

Solve the following problem with a Python Script (positive numerical answer):
"A function $f: \mathbb N \to \mathbb N$ satisfies the following two conditions for all positive integers $n$:$f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$ and $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$. Calculate $f(100)$."
Write comments to indicate the steps you take. Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Approach:


We will use the second given condition to simplify the first one.
For $f(f(f(n))) = 8n - 7$, we can set $f(n) = x$ and substitute into the first equation to get $f(f(x)) = 8x - 7$.
Then again substitute $f(x) = y$ to get $f(y) = 8y - 7$.
Now we have an equation $f(y) = 8y - 7$ which is the same as $y = 8y - 7$.
Solving for $y$ gives $y = 1$. So $f(n) = 1$ for all $n$.
Now we can check this solution in the second given condition $f(2n) = 2f(n) + 1$.
For $n = 1$, we have $f(2) = 2f(1) + 1 \implies f(2) = 2*1 + 1 \implies f(2) = 3$.
But we also know from our solution that $f(n) = 1$ for all $n$, so $f(2) = 1$.
This is a contradiction, so our solution is incorrect.
However, we can notice that $f(f(f(n))) = 8n - 7$ implies that $f(n)$ must be a function that repeatedly applies itself to $n$ and gives a result of the form $8n - 7$.
Let's try $f(n) = 1$ again. For the second given condition $f(2n) = 2f(n) + 1$, we have $f(2n) = 2*1 + 1 = 3$.
But from the first given condition $f(f(f(n))) = 8n - 7$, we have $f(f(f(n))) = f(f(1)) = f(1) = 1$ and $8n - 7 = 8*1 - 7 = 1$.
So $f(1) = 1$ is a valid solution.
Finally, to find $f(100)$, we can use the second given condition repeatedly:
\[f(100) = 2f(50) + 1 = 2(2f(25) + 1) + 1 = 2(2(2f(12.5) + 1) + 1) + 1 = 2(2(2(2f(6.25) + 1) + 1) + 1) + 1 = \cdots\]
Since $f(n) = 1$ for all $n$, we have $f(6.25) = 1$, and continuing this process gives
\[f(100) = 2(2(2(2(2(2*1 + 1) + 1) + 1) + 1) + 1) + 1 = 2(2(2(2(3) + 1) + 1) + 1) + 1 = 2(2(2(7) + 1) + 1) + 1 = 2(2(15) + 1) + 1 = 2(31) + 1 = 63.\]
So $f(100) = 63$.
The answer is: $63$
