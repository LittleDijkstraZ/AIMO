Solve the following problem with a Python Script (positive numerical answer):
"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"

The equation $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ is satisfied if either one of the two factors is zero.

The first factor is zero when $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ or $\vert x - y \vert = 10$, which represent two lines parallel to the x-axis and y-axis respectively, and a distance of 10 units from the origin. These lines form a square with side length of 20 units.

The second factor is zero when $\vert x \vert = 8$ or $\vert y \vert = 8$, which represent two lines parallel to the y-axis and x-axis respectively, and a distance of 8 units from the origin. These lines form a square with side length of 16 units.

So the points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying the equation enclose a convex polygon, which is the union of two squares: one with side length of 20 units and the other with side length of 16 units.

To find the area of this convex polygon, we simply add the areas of the two squares:

Area = (20^2) + (16^2) = 400 + 256 = 656 square units.

So the area of the convex polygon is 656 square units. The answer is: $656$

Approach:


The given equation is a product of two expressions equal to zero, which means that either of the expressions must be zero for the equation to hold true. Therefore, we have two cases to consider:

Case 1: $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$
This means that both $\vert x + y \vert - 10 = 0$ and $\vert x - y \vert - 10 = 0$, so $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. The only way this can happen is if $x = y = 5$ or $x = -y = -5$.

Case 2: $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$
This means that both $\vert x \vert - 8 = 0$ and $\vert y \vert - 8 = 0$, so $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$. The only way this can happen is if $x = 8$ or $x = -8$ and $y = 8$ or $y = -8$.

Considering both cases together, we see that the points $(x, y)$ satisfying the equation must be either $(5, 5)$, $(-5, -5)$, $(8, 8)$, $(-8, -8)$, $(8, -8)$, $(-8, 8)$, $(5, -5)$, or $(-5, 5)$. These points form a square with side length 10. The area of this square is side length squared, which is $10^2 = 100$.

The answer is: $100$

Solve the following problem with a Python Script (positive numerical answer):

Approach:



The equation $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + (\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ implies that $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$.
The equation $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + (\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ implies that $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$.
From $\vert x + y \vert = 10$, we have $x + y = 10$ or $x + y = -10$.
From $\vert x \vert = 8$, we have $x = 8$ or $x = -8$.
From $\vert y \vert = 8$, we have $y = 8$ or $y = -8$.
We can consider the following cases:
Case 1: $x = 8$ and $y = 8$. In this case, $x + y = 16$, which satisfies $x + y = 10$.
Case 2: $x = 8$ and $y = -8$. In this case, $x + y = 0$, which does not satisfy $x + y = 10$.
Case 3: $x = -8$ and $y = 8$. In this case, $x + y = 0$, which does not satisfy $x + y = 10$.
Case 4: $x = -8$ and $y = -8$. In this case, $x + y = -16$, which satisfies $x + y = -10$.
From the above analysis, we find that the points satisfying the equations are $(8, 8)$, $(8, -8)$, $(-8, 8)$, and $(-8, -8)$. These points form a square with side length $16$.
The area of the square is $16^2 = 256$. The answer is: $256$

Approach:


The equation $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ implies that $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. This gives us four equations: $x + y = 10$, $x + y = -10$, $x - y = 10$, and $x - y = -10$. These four lines form a square with side length 10.

The equation $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ implies that $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$, which gives us four more lines: $x = 8$, $x = -8$, $y = 8$, and $y = -8$. These four lines form a square with side length 16.

The intersection of the two squares is a smaller square with side length 8.

The area of a square is given by side length squared. So the area of the smaller square is $8^2 = 64$.
The answer is: $64$.

Solve the following problem with a Python Script (positive numerical answer):
"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"

Approach:



The equation $f(x,y) = 0$ represents the points $(x, y)$ that satisfy the condition. The equation is given by
\[f(x,y) = ((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2).\]
This equation is equal to zero if either of the two factors are zero.

For the first factor, either $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ or $( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$. These equations are satisfied when $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ or $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. These are the equations of two lines in the coordinate plane, and together they form a square with side length 10 units.

For the second factor, either $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ or $( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$. These equations are satisfied when $\vert x \vert = 8$ or $\vert y \vert = 8$. These are the equations of two lines in the coordinate plane, and together they form a square with side length 8 units.

The area of the first square is $10^2 = 100$ square units, and the area of the second square is $8^2 = 64$ square units. The convex polygon enclosed by the points that satisfy the original equation is the intersection of these two squares, so it is also a square.

The side length of this square is the smaller of the side lengths of the two squares, which is 8 units. Therefore, the area of the convex polygon is $8^2 = 64$ square units. The answer is: $\boxed{64}$

Approach:

 The given equation is a product of two expressions equal to zero. Therefore, either the first expression is zero or the second expression is zero. 

1) For the first expression to be zero, we have:
\[(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0 \text{ and } (\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0.\]
This implies $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. The solutions to these equations are the lines $x + y = 10$ and $x - y = 10$.

2) For the second expression to be zero, we have:
\[(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0 \text{ and } (\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0.\]
This implies $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$. The solutions to these equations are the lines $x = 8$ and $y = 8$.

The intersection points of these lines are the vertices of the polygon. The vertices are $(8, 2)$, $(8, -2)$, $(-2, 8)$, and $(-8, 2)$. These points form a square with side length 10. 

The area of a square is given by the square of the length of its side, so the area of this square is $10^2 = 100$. 

The answer is: $100$

Solve the following problem with a Python Script (positive numerical answer):
"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"

Approach:



The equation $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ is satisfied when either $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$.

For $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$, we have $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. This implies that $x + y = \pm 10$ and $x - y = \pm 10$. Solving these equations, we get the vertices of the polygon as $(0, 10), (0, -10), (10, 0), (-10, 0)$.

For $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$, we have $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$. This implies that $x = \pm 8$ and $y = \pm 8$. So we get four more vertices of the polygon as $(8, 8), (8, -8), (-8, 8), (-8, -8)$.

Now we can draw the convex polygon and calculate its area. The polygon is a square with side length 10. The area of the square is $10^2 = 100$.
The answer is: $100$

Solve the following problem with a Python Script (positive numerical answer):
"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"

Approach:


The equation given in the problem is a product of two expressions equal to zero. This means that either the first expression is zero or the second expression is zero. 

The first expression is $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)$. This expression is zero only when both $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. This implies that $x + y = \pm 10$ and $x - y = \pm 10$. Solving these equations gives four points: $(5,5), (5,-5), (-5,5)$ and $(-5,-5)$.

The second expression is $((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2)$. This expression is zero only when both $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$. This implies that $x = \pm 8$ and $y = \pm 8$. Solving these equations gives four more points: $(8,8), (8,-8), (-8,8)$ and $(-8,-8)$.

So, the points that satisfy the equation are the eight points: $(5,5), (5,-5), (-5,5), (-5,-5), (8,8), (8,-8), (-8,8)$ and $(-8,-8)$.

These points form a square with side length $10$ units. The area of a square is side length squared, so the area of this square is $10^2 = 100$ square units.

Therefore, the area of the convex polygon is 100 square units. The answer is: $100$
