 To analyze the problem, we need to understand the structure of the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ and how many solutions it has.

The equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ is a piecewise function, and its solution will depend on the value of $\frac{m}{100}$. The piecewise function can be broken down into three cases:

1. If $\frac{m}{100} < 2 - 1 = 1$, then the equation has no solutions.
2. If $\frac{m}{100} = 1$, then the equation has two solutions.
3. If $\frac{m}{100} > 1$, then the equation has four solutions.

We are asked to find the number of positive integers $m$ such that the equation has four distinct solutions. From the analysis above, this happens when $\frac{m}{100} > 1$, which implies $m > 100$. The smallest such $m$ is $101$. The largest $m$ is also limited by the fact that $\frac{m}{100} \leq 2 - 1 = 1$, which implies $m \leq 100$. Therefore, the only possible values of $m$ are the integers from $101$ to $100$, inclusive. There are $100 - 101 + 1 = 100$.

So, the number of positive integers $m$ for which the equation has four distinct solutions is $100$.
The answer is: $100$.

Below is a math problem you are to solve (positive numerical answer!):
"For how many positive integers $m$ does the equation \[\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}\] have $4$ distinct solutions?"
Analyze this problem and think step by step to come to a solution with programs. After solving the problem, output the final numerical answer within \boxed{}.

Assistant:

 To analyze the given problem, we first need to understand the function $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert$. This function has a "V" shape with two "knees" at $x=1\pm2$, or $x=-1$ and $x=3$. The value of the function is 0 when $x$ is in the interval $(-1, 3)$, and $|x-1|-2$ is equal to $2-(x-1)=3-x$ for $x \le 1$, and $x-1-2=x-3$ for $x \ge 3$.

Therefore, the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has four distinct solutions when $\frac{m}{100}$ is in the range $(0, 2)$, or $0 < \frac{m}{100} < 2$. This means $0 < m < 200$.

The number of positive integers $m$ in this range is $200 - 1 = 199$. Therefore, the number of positive integers $m$ for which the equation has 4 distinct solutions is 199.

So, the answer is $\boxed{199}$.

Here's a Python program to calculate the number of positive integers $m$ in the range $(0, 200)$:

```python


INTERMEDIATE OUT :

def count_positive_integers():
    return 200 - 1

result = count_positive_integers()
print(result)
```

CODE RESULTS 199

INTERMEDIATE OUT :
```output
199
```
So, the number of positive integers $m$ for which the equation has 4 distinct solutions is 199. The answer is: $199$

The number of distinct solutions of the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ is equal to $4$ if and only if $\frac{m}{100} = 2$. Therefore, we solve the equation $2 = \frac{m}{100}$ for $m$ to get $m = 200$.

So, the only positive integer $m$ for which the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has $4$ distinct solutions is $200$. Therefore, the answer is $200$. The code to compute this is:

```python

    """For how many positive integers $m$ does the equation \[\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}\] have $4$ distinct solutions?"""
    m = 200
    return m

result = find_m()
print(result)
```

Assistant:

 The equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has 4 distinct solutions if and only if $\frac{m}{100}$ is strictly between 1 and 2. This is because the function $f(x) = \vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert$ has a graph that consists of three line segments with slopes -1, 1, and -1. The segment with slope -1 spans from $y=1$ to $y=2$, so the value of $m$ must be such that $\frac{m}{100}$ is strictly between 1 and 2.

This means that $1<\frac{m}{100}<2$, which implies $100<m<200$. The positive integers $m$ that satisfy this inequality are the integers from 101 to 199, inclusive. To find the number of such integers, we subtract the smallest integer in the range from the largest integer in the range and then add 1.

```python


INTERMEDIATE OUT :

def count_m():
    """Count the number of positive integers m for which the equation | |x-1| - 2 | = m/100 has 4 distinct solutions."""
    m_min = 101
    m_max = 199
    count = m_max - m_min + 1
    return count

result = count_m()

"For how many positive integers $m$ does the equation \[\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}\] have $4$ distinct solutions?"

Assistant:

 This problem is quite complex and beyond the scope of a simple Python script. It requires a deep understanding of absolute value functions and the properties of their graphs. The question is asking for how many values of $m$ does the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ have $4$ distinct solutions.

This equation is a piecewise function with four pieces, and each piece is a line segment. The graph of the function is a "V" shape, with the "tips" of the "V" at $(1-2, 0) = (-1, 0)$ and $(1+2, 0) = (3, 0)$. The distance between the tips of the "V" is $4$, and each "V" has a height of $\frac{m}{100}$.

For the equation to have $4$ distinct solutions, the height of the "V" must be such that the "V" intersects the x-axis in two places. This happens when the height is less than $1$ (the distance between the tips divided by $2$). Therefore, we have $\frac{m}{100} < 1$, or $m < 100$.

The only positive integer values of $m$ that satisfy this inequality are the integers from $1$ to $99$. Therefore, there are $99$ values of $m$ for which the equation has $4$ distinct solutions. The answer is: $99$

Assistant:


For a given $m$, the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has four distinct solutions if and only if $\frac{m}{100}$ is strictly between $1$ and $2$. This is because the function $f(x) = \vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert$ has a graph that consists of four line segments with slopes $\pm1$ and $\pm(-1)$, and the equation $f(x) = k$ has two solutions for $0 < k < 1$, four solutions for $1 < k < 2$, and two solutions for $k > 2$. So we want to find the number of positive integers $m$ for which $1 < \frac{m}{100} < 2$, or equivalently, $100 < m < 200$. The number of such integers is $200 - 100 - 1 = 99$. Therefore, there are 99 positive integers $m$ for which the equation has four distinct solutions. The answer is: $99$.
