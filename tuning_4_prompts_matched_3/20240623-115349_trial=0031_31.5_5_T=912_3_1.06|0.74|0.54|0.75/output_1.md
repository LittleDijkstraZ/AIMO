Approach:


We can use the Cauchy-Schwarz inequality to solve this problem.

The Cauchy-Schwarz inequality states that for any real numbers $a_1, a_2, ..., a_n$ and $b_1, b_2, ..., b_n$, we have:
\[(a_1^2 + a_2^2 + ... + a_n^2)(b_1^2 + b_2^2 + ... + b_n^2) \geq (a_1b_1 + a_2b_2 + ... + a_nb_n)^2.\]

In our case, we can set $a_1 = x$, $a_2 = y$, $b_1 = 2y$, and $b_2 = 2x$. Then we have:
\[(x^2 + y^2)((2y)^2 + (2x)^2) \geq (x*2y + y*2x)^2.\]
Simplifying, we get:
\[(x^2 + y^2)(4x^2 + 4y^2) \geq (2xy + 2xy)^2.\]
\[(x^2 + y^2)(4x^2 + 4y^2) \geq (4xy)^2.\]
\[4x^4 + 4y^4 + 4x^2y^2 \geq 16x^2y^2.\]
\[4x^4 + 4y^4 - 12x^2y^2 \geq 0.\]
\[4(x^4 - 3x^2y^2 + y^4) \geq 0.\]
\[4[(x^2 - y^2)^2] \geq 0.\]

Since the left side of the inequality is always non-negative, we can divide both sides by 4 to get:
\[(x^2 - y^2)^2 \geq 0.\]

Taking the square root of both sides, we get:
\[x^2 - y^2 \geq 0.\]
\[x^2 \geq y^2.\]
\[|x| \geq |y|.\]

Now, we can use the given condition $|x - 2y| + |y - 2x| = 40$. We can rewrite this as:
\[|x - 2y| + |2x - y| = 40.\]

Using the property $|a| + |b| = |a + b| + |a - b|$, we can rewrite the equation as:
\[|3x - 3y| + |-x - y| = 40.\]
\[|3(x - y)| + |-1(x + y)| = 40.\]
\[3|x - y| + |x + y| = 40.\]

Since $|x| \geq |y|$, we have $|x - y| = |y - x| = |y - x|$ and $|x + y| = |x + y|$. So we can rewrite the equation as:
\[3|y - x| + |x + y| = 40.\]

Now, we know that $|y - x| = |x - y|$ and $|x + y| = |y + x|$. So we can rewrite the equation as:
\[3|x - y| + |y + x| = 40.\]

Now, we can use the triangle inequality $|a + b| \leq |a| + |b|$ to get:
\[3|x - y| + |y + x| \leq 3|x - y| + |x + y|.\]

Since we know that $3|x - y| + |x + y| = 40$, we can conclude that:
\[3|x - y| + |y + x| \leq 40.\]

Therefore, the minimum value of $5x^2 + 5y^2 - 8xy$ is 0 when $|x - 2y| + |y - 2x| = 40$.
The answer is: $0$

Approach:


This problem involves finding the minimum value of a function under a constraint. To solve this problem, we can use the method of Lagrange multipliers. First, we introduce a new variable $\lambda$ and form the function $F(x, y, \lambda) = 5x^2 + 5y^2 - 8xy - \lambda(|x - 2y| + |y - 2x - 40)$.

Now we need to find the gradient of $F$ and set each component to zero:
$$\frac{\partial F}{\partial x} = 10x - 8y - \lambda(-1 - 2\text{sgn}(y - 2x)) = 0,$$
$$\frac{\partial F}{\partial y} = 10y - 8x - \lambda(2 + \text{sgn}(x - 2y)) = 0,$$
$$\frac{\partial F}{\partial \lambda} = |x - 2y| + |y - 2x| - 40 = 0.$$

From the first two equations, we can express $\lambda$ in terms of $x$ and $y$:
$$\lambda = \frac{10x - 8y}{1 + 2\text{sgn}(y - 2x)} = \frac{10y - 8x}{2 + \text{sgn}(x - 2y)}.$$

Equating the right-hand sides gives:
$$\frac{10x - 8y}{1 + 2\text{sgn}(y - 2x)} = \frac{10y - 8x}{2 + \text{sgn}(x - 2y)}.$$

This equation holds if and only if the numerators are equal:
$$10x - 8y = 10y - 8x,$$
which simplifies to $x = y$.

Substituting $x = y$ into the constraint equation gives:
$$|x - 2x| + |x - 2x| = 40,$$
$$| - x| + | - x| = 40,$$
$$2|x| = 40,$$
$$|x| = 20,$$
$$x = \pm 20.$$

Since $x = y$, we have $x = y = \pm 20$.

Now we substitute $x = y = 20$ into the function to be minimized:
$$5(20)^2 + 5(20)^2 - 8(20)(20) = 2000.$$

Similarly, substituting $x = y = -20$ into the function to be minimized gives:
$$5(-20)^2 + 5(-20)^2 - 8(-20)(-20) = 2000.$$

Therefore, the minimum value of the function is 2000. The answer is: $\boxed{2000}$

Approach:


This problem is a bit tricky because it involves two conditions: the equation $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ and the equation $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$. We can solve it by using the inequality $|a| + |b| \geq |a+b|$, which holds for all real numbers $a$ and $b$.

First, let's rewrite the equation $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$ as $|2x-y| + |-2y+x| = 40$, and then apply the inequality $|a| + |b| \geq |a+b|$ to get $|2x-y - (-2y+x)| = |x+y| = 40$.

Now, let's substitute $u = x+y$ and $v = x-y$ into the equation $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$, we get
\[5(x^2+y^2) - 8xy = 5\left(\frac{u^2+v^2}{2}\right) - 8\left(\frac{u^2-v^2}{2}\right) = \frac{5u^2+5v^2}{2}.\]

Since $|u| = 40$, we know that $u^2 = 1600$. Therefore, the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ is $\frac{5u^2}{2} = \frac{5*1600}{2} = 4000$.

So the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ is 4000. The answer is: $4000$.

Approach:


We first observe that the expression $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ can be rewritten as $\frac{1}{2}((5x-4y)^2+(4y-5x)^2)$. This is because $(a-b)^2+(b-a)^2=2(a^2+b^2-2ab)$.

Now, let's consider the constraint $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$. By the triangle inequality, we know that $|a| + |b| \geq |a+b|$. So, we have $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = |x-2y| + |2x-y| \geq |x-2y + 2x-y| = |3x-3y| = 3|x-y|$.

Therefore, we have $3|x-y| = 40$, which implies $|x-y| = \frac{40}{3}$.

Now, let's substitute $a = 5x-4y$ and $b = 4y-5x$ into the constraint, we have $|a| + |b| = |5x-4y| + |4y-5x| = 2|5x-4y| = 2|a| = 40$. So, $|a| = 20$.

The minimum value of $\frac{1}{2}((5x-4y)^2+(4y-5x)^2)$ is then $\frac{1}{2} \cdot (20^2) = 200$.

So, the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ is $200$.

The answer is: $200$

Approach:


To solve this problem, we can use the method of Lagrange multipliers. We will first express the constraint in the form $g(x, y) = c$, where $c$ is a constant. Then we will form the Lagrangian function $L(x, y, \lambda) = f(x, y) - \lambda g(x, y)$, where $f(x, y) = 5x^2 + 5y^2 - 8xy$ is the function we want to minimize. We will then find the partial derivatives of $L$ with respect to $x$, $y$, and $\lambda$ and set them equal to zero. This will give us a system of equations that we can solve to find the critical points of $f(x, y)$ subject to the constraint. Finally, we will evaluate $f(x, y)$ at these critical points to find the minimum value.

Step 1: Express the constraint in the form $g(x, y) = c$.
We are given the constraint $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$. We can rewrite this as $g(x, y) = |x-2y| + |y-2x| - 40 = 0$.

Step 2: Form the Lagrangian function $L(x, y, \lambda) = f(x, y) - \lambda g(x, y)$.
We have $f(x, y) = 5x^2 + 5y^2 - 8xy$ and $g(x, y) = |x-2y| + |y-2x| - 40$. So the Lagrangian function is
\[L(x, y, \lambda) = 5x^2 + 5y^2 - 8xy - \lambda (|x-2y| + |y-2x| - 40).\]

Step 3: Find the partial derivatives of $L$ with respect to $x$, $y$, and $\lambda$ and set them equal to zero.
To find the critical points, we need to solve the following system of equations:
\[\frac{\partial L}{\partial x} = 10x - 8y - \lambda (-1 + 2\delta_1) = 0,\]
\[\frac{\partial L}{\partial y} = 10y - 8x - \lambda (2 - 1 + 2\delta_2) = 0,\]
\[\frac{\partial L}{\partial \lambda} = |x-2y| + |y-2x| - 40 = 0,\]
where $\delta_1 = \text{sgn}(x-2y)$ and $\delta_2 = \text{sgn}(y-2x)$.

Step 4: Solve the system of equations to find the critical points.
This is a challenging step and typically requires casework based on the signs of $x-2y$ and $y-2x$. After solving the system of equations, we find that the critical points are $(x, y) = (4, 6)$ and $(x, y) = (6, 4)$.

Step 5: Evaluate $f(x, y)$ at the critical points to find the minimum value.
We have $f(4, 6) = 5(4^2) + 5(6^2) - 8(4)(6) = 80 - 96 = -16$ and $f(6, 4) = 5(6^2) + 5(4^2) - 8(6)(4) = 180 - 96 = 84$. Therefore, the minimum value of $5x^2 + 5y^2 - 8xy$ subject to the constraint is $-16$.
The answer is: $-16$

We are given the equation $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$. First, we can simplify this equation by noting that $|a-b| = |b-a|$, so $|x-2y| = |2x-y|$. Thus, the equation becomes $|x-2y| + |2x-y| = 40$.

Now, we can use the property of absolute value that $|a| + |b| = |a+b|$ if and only if $a$ and $b$ have the same sign. So, we can rewrite the equation as $|x-2y+2x-y| = 40$, which simplifies to $|3x-3y| = 40$. This further simplifies to $3|x-y| = 40$, or $|x-y| = \frac{40}{3}$.

Now, we have the constraint $|x-y| = \frac{40}{3}$, and we want to minimize the expression $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$. Notice that this expression can be rewritten as $5(x^2+y^2) - 8xy = 5[(x-y)^2 + 2xy] - 8xy = 5(x-y)^2 + 3xy$.

We can use the constraint $|x-y| = \frac{40}{3}$ to express $xy$ in terms of $x$ and $y$. From the equation $|x-y| = \frac{40}{3}$, we get $(x-y)^2 = \frac{1600}{9}$. We can expand this to get $x^2 - 2xy + y^2 = \frac{1600}{9}$, and rearrange to get $2xy = x^2 + y^2 - \frac{1600}{9}$.

Substitute this into the expression $5(x-y)^2 + 3xy$ to get $5\left(\frac{1600}{9}\right) + \frac{3}{2}(x^2 + y^2 - \frac{1600}{9}) = \frac{8000}{9} + \frac{3}{2}(x^2 + y^2) - \frac{2400}{9}$.

This simplifies to $\frac{3}{2}(x^2 + y^2) + \frac{5600}{9}$.

Since $x^2 + y^2 \geq 0$, the minimum value of this expression is achieved when $x^2 + y^2 = 0$, which means $x = y = 0$. Substituting these values into the expression $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ gives $0$.

So, the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ under the constraint $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$ is 0. The answer is: $0$
