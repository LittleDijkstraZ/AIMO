The equation given is a product of two expressions equal to zero, which means that either of the expressions must be zero.

The expressions are $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + (\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2$ and $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + (\vert y \vert - 8)^2$.

If either of these expressions is zero, then the corresponding absolute value expressions must also be zero.

For the first expression, $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + (\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$, we have:

$\vert x + y \vert - 10 = 0$ and $\vert x - y \vert - 10 = 0$.

This implies that $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$.

The absolute value equations can be rewritten as:

$x + y = \pm 10$ and $x - y = \pm 10$.

These equations represent the lines $y = -x \pm 10$ and $y = x \pm 10$.

For the second expression, $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + (\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$, we have:

$\vert x \vert - 8 = 0$ and $\vert y \vert - 8 = 0$.

This implies that $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$.

The absolute value equations can be rewritten as:

$x = \pm 8$ and $y = \pm 8$.

These equations represent the lines $x = \pm 8$ and $y = \pm 8$.

The eight lines intersect at the vertices of a square with side length 16.

The area of the square is $16^2 = 256$.
The answer is: $256$

The equation $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ implies that either $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$.

For the first case, $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$, it implies that $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. These are the equations of two lines parallel to the x-axis and y-axis respectively, with a distance of 10 units from the origin.

For the second case, $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$, it implies that $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$. These are the equations of two circles centered at the origin with a radius of 8 units.

The intersection of these lines and circles forms a square with side length 16 units. Therefore, the area of the convex polygon is $16^2 = 256$ square units.

The answer is: $256$

Solve the following problem with a Python Script (positive numerical answer):
"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"

The given equation is a product of two expressions equal to zero. This means that either the first expression is zero or the second expression is zero. 

We can solve each expression separately:

1. $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + (\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$

2. $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + (\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$

From equation 1, we have:

$\vert x + y \vert - 10 = 0$ and $\vert x - y \vert - 10 = 0$

This implies $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$

From equation 2, we have:

$\vert x \vert - 8 = 0$ and $\vert y \vert - 8 = 0$

This implies $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$

The solutions to these equations are:

For equation 1:
$x + y = 10$ and $x - y = 10$ or $x + y = -10$ and $x - y = -10$

For equation 2:
$x = 8$ and $y = 8$ or $x = -8$ and $y = -8$

The solutions to these systems of equations are:

$(x, y) = (0, 10), (10, 0), (-10, 0), (0, -10)$ for equation 1
$(x, y) = (8, 8), (-8, -8)$ for equation 2

The intersection of these solutions gives us the vertices of the polygon:

$(x, y) = (8, 8), (8, -8), (-8, 8), (-8, -8)$

This is a square with side length 16. The area of a square is side length squared, so the area of the polygon is $16^2 = 256$.
The answer is: $256$

Solve the following problem with a Python Script (positive numerical answer):
"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"

The given equation is of the form $AB = 0$, which implies that either $A = 0$ or $B = 0$. 

So, we have two cases:

1. $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$. This implies that $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. These are the equations of two lines in the plane, forming a rectangle.

2. $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$. This implies that $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$, which are the equations of two circles with radius 8.

The intersection of these two regions is a square with side length 16. Therefore, the area of the convex polygon is $16^2 = 256$.

So, the area of the convex polygon is 256.
The answer is: $256$
