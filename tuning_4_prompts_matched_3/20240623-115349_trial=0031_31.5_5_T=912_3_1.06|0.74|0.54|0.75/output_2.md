We need to find the number of positive integers $m$ for which the equation $| |x - 1| - 2| = \frac{m}{100}$ has exactly four distinct solutions.

Firstly, let's consider the right side of the equation $\frac{m}{100}$. Since $m$ is a positive integer, $\frac{m}{100}$ is a positive number. The number of distinct solutions of the equation depends on the value of $\frac{m}{100}$.

When $\frac{m}{100} = 2$, the equation becomes $| |x - 1| - 2| = 2$. Solving this equation, we get four distinct solutions: $x = -1, 1, 3, 5$.

When $\frac{m}{100} < 2$, the equation becomes $| |x - 1| - 2| = \frac{m}{100}$. Solving this equation, we get two distinct solutions.

When $\frac{m}{100} > 2$, the equation becomes $| |x - 1| - 2| = \frac{m}{100}$. Solving this equation, we get more than two distinct solutions.

So, the only value of $m$ that gives us four distinct solutions is $m = 200$. Therefore, the number of positive integers $m$ for which the equation has exactly four distinct solutions is $1$. The answer is: $1$

We want to find the number of positive integers $m$ such that the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has 4 distinct solutions.
The right-hand side of the equation is a constant, and the left-hand side is a piecewise function with four linear pieces.
The number of distinct solutions is equal to the number of times the right-hand side intersects the four linear pieces of the left-hand side.
By analyzing the graph of the left-hand side, we can see that it intersects the horizontal line $y=\frac{m}{100}$ exactly 4 times if $0<\frac{m}{100}<1$. This implies that $0<m<100$.
Therefore, we need to find the number of positive integers $m$ in the range $0<m<100$.
The number of such integers is $99$.

```python


INTERMEDIATE OUT :

def count_positive_integers():
    return 99

result = count_positive_integers()
print(result)
```

CODE RESULTS 99

INTERMEDIATE OUT :
```output
99
```
The number of positive integers $m$ for which the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has 4 distinct solutions is 99. The answer is: $99$

First, we need to understand the structure of the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$. This equation has four distinct solutions, which means that the absolute value equation $\vert x-1 \vert -2=\pm\frac{m}{100}$ has two solutions each.

Let's denote $k = \frac{m}{100}$, then we have $\vert x-1 \vert -2=k$ and $\vert x-1 \vert -2=-k$.

For the equation $\vert x-1 \vert -2=k$, we have $\vert x-1 \vert = k+2$. This equation has two solutions if $k+2 > 0$, i.e., $k > -2$.

For the equation $\vert x-1 \vert -2=-k$, we have $\vert x-1 \vert = 2-k$. This equation has two solutions if $2-k > 0$, i.e., $k < 2$.

Combining these two conditions, we have $-2 < k < 2$. Since $k = \frac{m}{100}$, we have $-200 < m < 200$.

The question asks for the number of positive integers $m$ that satisfy this condition. The number of positive integers in the interval $( -200, 200 )$ is $200 - 1 = 199$.

Therefore, the number of positive integers $m$ for which the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has four distinct solutions is $199$. The answer is: $199$

Approach:


The given equation has 4 distinct solutions, which means that the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has 4 distinct solutions. This implies that $\frac{m}{100}$ must be equal to either 1 or 2. This is because the expression on the left hand side of the equation, $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert$, can only take on values from 0 to 2. If $\frac{m}{100}$ is greater than 2, the equation will have no solution.

Now we need to find the number of positive integers $m$ such that $\frac{m}{100}$ equals either 1 or 2. This means we need to find the number of positive integers $m$ such that $m$ equals either 100 or 200.

The number of positive integers from 1 to 100 is 100, and the number of positive integers from 1 to 200 is 200. Therefore, there are 2 such values of $m$.

So the number of positive integers $m$ for which the equation has 4 distinct solutions is 2.

The answer is: $2$

We first simplify the equation by considering the possible values of $m$.
The right-hand side of the equation $\frac{m}{100}$ can take integer values from $0$ to $1$ for $m$ from $0$ to $100$.
We then analyze the number of solutions for each possible value of $m$.
For $m=0$, the equation simplifies to $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=0$, which has only one solution $x=3$.
For $m=1$, the equation simplifies to $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{1}{100}$, which has four distinct solutions.
For $m>1$, the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has at most two solutions.
Therefore, the only value of $m$ for which the equation has four distinct solutions is $m=1$.
So, there is only one positive integer $m$ for which the equation has four distinct solutions.
The answer is: $1$

To solve this problem, we need to find out how many positive integer values of $m$ make the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ have $4$ distinct solutions.

The equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ is a piecewise function with $4$ cases based on the value of $x$. The piecewise function can be written as:

1. If $x \leq 1$, then $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert = -(x-1-2) = -x+3$.
2. If $1 < x \leq 3$, then $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert = x-1-2 = x-3$.
3. If $3 < x \leq 5$, then $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert = -(x-1-2) = -x+3$.
4. If $x > 5$, then $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert = x-1-2 = x-3$.

So, the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ is equivalent to $-x+3 = \frac{m}{100}$, $x-3 = \frac{m}{100}$, $-x+3 = \frac{m}{100}$, and $x-3 = \frac{m}{100}$ respectively for the four cases.

Solving these equations for $x$, we get $x = 3 + \frac{m}{100}$, $x = 3 - \frac{m}{100}$, $x = 3 + \frac{m}{100}$, and $x = 3 - \frac{m}{100}$ respectively.

For the equation to have $4$ distinct solutions, the values of $x$ from the first and third equations must be different from the values of $x$ from the second and fourth equations. This implies that the absolute value of the difference between the values of $x$ from the first and second (or third and fourth) equations must be greater than $2$.

So, we have $\vert (3 + \frac{m}{100}) - (3 - \frac{m}{100}) \vert > 2$, which simplifies to $\frac{2m}{100} > 2$.

Solving for $m$, we get $m > 100$. The smallest integer value of $m$ that satisfies this inequality is $101$.

Therefore, there is only one positive integer value of $m$ that makes the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ have $4$ distinct solutions, and that is $m = 101$. The answer is: $1$

We want to find the number of positive integers $m$ for which the equation $| |x - 1| - 2| = \frac{m}{100}$ has 4 distinct solutions. 

First, let's consider the right side of the equation $\frac{m}{100}$. Since $m$ is a positive integer, $\frac{m}{100}$ is a positive number. The left side of the equation $| |x - 1| - 2|$ is the absolute value of a quantity, so it is always non-negative. 

For the equation to have 4 distinct solutions, the right side $\frac{m}{100}$ must be equal to the value of $| |x - 1| - 2|$ twice. This means that the value of $| |x - 1| - 2|$ must be $\frac{m}{200}$ and $2\cdot\frac{m}{200} = \frac{m}{100}$.

Now, let's consider the possible values of $| |x - 1| - 2|$. This expression can take on values between 0 and 2, inclusive. So, the possible values of $| |x - 1| - 2|$ are 0, $\frac{1}{100}$, $\frac{2}{100}$, ..., $\frac{198}{100}$, $\frac{199}{100}$, and 2. 

However, since $| |x - 1| - 2|$ is equal to $\frac{m}{200}$ and $2\cdot\frac{m}{200} = \frac{m}{100}$, we can see that $\frac{m}{200}$ must be between 0 and 1, because if it were equal to or greater than 2, then $2\cdot\frac{m}{200}$ would be greater than 2, which is not possible because the right side of the equation is $\frac{m}{100}$, which is always less than or equal to 2.

So, the possible values of $| |x - 1| - 2|$ that can make the equation have 4 distinct solutions are $\frac{1}{100}$, $\frac{2}{100}$, ..., $\frac{198}{100}$, and $\frac{199}{100}$. There are 199 such values.

Therefore, there are 199 positive integers $m$ for which the equation has 4 distinct solutions. The answer is: $199$

Approach:


The equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has $4$ distinct solutions, which means that the right-hand side $\frac{m}{100}$ must be equal to $2$. This is because the absolute value function $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert$ reaches its maximum value of $2$ exactly once.

If $\frac{m}{100}=2$, then $m=200$. So, there is only one value of $m$ that makes the equation have $4$ distinct solutions. Therefore, the number of positive integers $m$ is $1$.
The answer is: $1$
