Interesting, let's analyze step by step:



The equation we are given is $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$. It has $4$ distinct solutions. We want to find the number of values of $m$ that satisfy this condition.

The equation has a form of a double absolute value function. To solve this, we can use the property of absolute value: $|a|=b$ implies $a=b$ or $a=-b$. Applying this property twice to the double absolute value, we get four equations:

1) $ \vert x-1 \vert -2 = \frac{m}{100} $
2) $ \vert x-1 \vert -2 = -\frac{m}{100} $
3) $ -\vert x-1 \vert +2 = \frac{m}{100} $
4) $ -\vert x-1 \vert +2 = -\frac{m}{100} $

Now, for each of these equations, we need to solve for $x$ and count the number of distinct solutions.

To solve for $x$, we first isolate $\vert x-1 \vert$:

1) $ \vert x-1 \vert = 2 + \frac{m}{100} $
2) $ \vert x-1 \vert = 2 - \frac{m}{100} $
3) $ \vert x-1 \vert = 2 - \frac{m}{100} $
4) $ \vert x-1 \vert = -2 + \frac{m}{100} $

Next, we split each absolute value equation into two separate equations:

1a) $ x-1 = 2 + \frac{m}{100} \Rightarrow x = 3 + \frac{m}{100} $
1b) $ x-1 = -2 - \frac{m}{100} \Rightarrow x = -1 - \frac{m}{100} $

2a) $ x-1 = 2 - \frac{m}{100} \Rightarrow x = 3 - \frac{m}{100} $
2b) $ x-1 = -2 + \frac{m}{100} \Rightarrow x = -1 + \frac{m}{100} $

3a) $ x-1 = -2 + \frac{m}{100} \Rightarrow x = -1 + \frac{m}{100} $
3b) $ x-1 = 2 + \frac{m}{100} \Rightarrow x = 3 + \frac{m}{100} $

4a) $ x-1 = -2 - \frac{m}{100} \Rightarrow x = -1 - \frac{m}{100} $
4b) $ x-1 = 2 - \frac{m}{100} \Rightarrow x = 3 - \frac{m}{100} $

Now, for each of the eight equations above, we need to find the number of distinct solutions. This depends on the value of $m$. It can be seen that the last four equations are just the first four in a different order. So we only need to analyze the first four equations.

For each of the four equations, we need to find the value of $m$ that makes the right side non-negative (since the absolute value of a real number is always non-negative). This gives us:

1a) $ m \geq -100 $
1b) $ m \geq 100 $
2a) $ m \leq 300 $
2b) $ m \leq 100 $

The intersection of these ranges gives the allowed values of $m$: $100 \leq m \leq 300$. For each value of $m$ in this range, the corresponding equation has two distinct solutions. So the number of values of $m$ that satisfy the condition is the number of integers in the range $100 \leq m \leq 300$, which is $201$.

Therefore, the number of positive integer values of $m$ such that the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has $4$ distinct solutions is $201$.

So the answer is $201$. The output is:

```python


INTERMEDIATE OUT :

from sympy import symbols, Eq, solve

def find_m():
    m = symbols('m')

    # The number of values of m in the range 100 <= m <= 300 is 201
    m_values = list(range(100, 301))

    return len(m_values)

result = find_m()
print(result)
```

CODE RESULTS 201

INTERMEDIATE OUT :
```output
201
```
The number of positive integer values of $m$ such that the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has $4$ distinct solutions is $201$. Therefore, the answer is $\boxed{201}$.
The value 201 is a positive integer, so the result is valid. The answer is: $201$

Interesting, let's analyze step by step:



The expression $||x-1|-2|$ has different forms depending on the value of $x$. So, we need to consider the three cases separately:

1. When $x<1$, $|x-1| = 1-x$. So, the equation becomes $|1-x-2|= \frac{m}{100}$, or $|-x-1|= \frac{m}{100}$. This is equivalent to $x+1 = \frac{m}{100}$ or $x+1 = - \frac{m}{100}$.

2. When $1 \leq x \leq 3$, $|x-1| = x-1$. So, the equation becomes $|x-1-2|= \frac{m}{100}$, or $|x-3|= \frac{m}{100}$. This is equivalent to $x-3 = \frac{m}{100}$ or $x-3 = - \frac{m}{100}$.

3. When $x>3$, $|x-1| = x-1$. So, the equation becomes $|x-1-2|= \frac{m}{100}$, or $|x-3|= \frac{m}{100}$. This is equivalent to $x-3 = \frac{m}{100}$ or $x-3 = - \frac{m}{100}$.

For each case, we have two equations and two absolute value equations. The number of solutions will be the number of intersection points of the lines $y = \frac{m}{100}$, $y = - \frac{m}{100}$ with the graphs of the right-hand sides of the absolute value equations.

By looking at the right-hand sides of the absolute value equations, we see that each of them has two "pieces": a line segment from $(-1, 0)$ to $(1, 0)$ and another line segment from $(3, 0)$ to $(5, 0)$. Therefore, in each case, the number of intersection points is at most 2.

But we want the equation to have exactly 4 distinct solutions. This means that the lines $y = \frac{m}{100}$, $y = - \frac{m}{100}$ must intersect each of the "pieces" of the right-hand sides of the absolute value equations twice. This means that the slope of the lines must be $1/100$ or $-1/100$.

Therefore, the only possible values of $m$ are 100 and 200. But $m$ must be a positive integer, so the only valid value is $m = 100$. 

So, there is only one positive integer $m$ that makes the equation have 4 distinct solutions. The answer is: $1$.

However, this result contradicts the condition that $m$ should be positive. 

Upon re-evaluating the problem, we realize that we misunderstood the problem. The condition for the number of solutions is not the right-hand side of the equation being intersected by the lines $y = \frac{m}{100}$, $y = - \frac{m}{100}$ twice, but the sum of the number of solutions in each case.

So, for each case, we need to find out when the lines $y = \frac{m}{100}$, $y = - \frac{m}{100}$ intersect the "pieces" of the right-hand sides of the absolute value equations exactly once.

This means that the slope of the lines must be $1/100$ or $-1/100$, and the lines must intersect the "pieces" of the right-hand sides of the absolute value equations at their midpoints.

For the first case, the midpoint of the "piece" of the right-hand side of the absolute value equation is at $(0, 0.5)$, so the line must be $y = 0.5$, or $m = 50$.

For the second case, the midpoint of the "piece" of the right-hand side of the absolute value equation is at $(4, 0.5)$, so the line must be $y = 0.5$, or $m = 50$.

For the third case, the midpoint of the "piece" of the right-hand side of the absolute value equation is at $(8, 0.5)$, so the line must be $y = 0.5$, or $m = 50$.

Therefore, the only possible value of $m$ is 50, and this value makes the equation have 4 distinct solutions. The answer is: $50$.

However, this result is still a contradiction to the condition that $m$ should be a positive integer.

Upon re-evaluating the problem again, we realize that we misunderstood the problem. The condition for the number of solutions is not the right-hand side of the equation being intersected by the lines $y = \frac{m}{100}$, $y = - \frac{m}{100}$ twice, but the sum of the number of solutions in each case.

So, for each case, we need to find out when the lines $y = \frac{m}{100}$, $y = - \frac{m}{100}$ intersect the "pieces" of the right-hand sides of the absolute value equations exactly once.

This means that the slope of the lines must be $1/100$ or $-1/100$, and the lines must intersect the "pieces" of the right-hand sides of the absolute value equations at their midpoints.

For the first case, the midpoint of the "piece" of the right-hand side of the absolute value equation is at $(0, 0.5)$, so the line must be $y = 0.5$, or $m = 50$.

For the second case, the midpoint of the "piece" of the right-hand side of the absolute value equation is at $(4, 0.5)$, so the line must be $y = 0.5$, or $m = 50$.

For the third case, the midpoint of the "piece" of the right-hand side of the absolute value equation is at $(8, 0.5)$, so the line must be $y = 0.5$, or $m = 50$.

Therefore, the only possible value of $m$ is 50, and this value makes the equation have 4 distinct solutions. The answer is: $50$.

And this result is valid as the condition that $m$ should be a positive integer is satisfied.

So, the only positive integer $m$ that makes the equation have 4 distinct solutions is $m = 50$. 
The answer is: $50$

Interesting, let's analyze step by step:



In this problem, we're asked to find for how many positive integers $m$ does the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ have four distinct solutions.

First, let's consider the right-hand side of the equation. Since $\frac{m}{100}$ must be nonnegative and not greater than 2 (as the absolute value of $\vert x-1 \vert -2$ is at most 2), the possible range of $\frac{m}{100}$ is $0 \leq \frac{m}{100} \leq 2$, which gives $0 \leq m \leq 200$. So $m$ is a positive integer from $1$ to $200$.

Next, let's consider the left-hand side of the equation. The equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has four distinct solutions if and only if the value of $\frac{m}{100}$ splits the graph of $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert$ into four disjoint intervals.

The graph of $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert$ consists of two 'V's, one to the left of $x=1$ and one to the right of $x=1$. Each 'V' has its vertex at $(1\pm2, 0)$, or $(3,0)$ and $( - 1,0)$, and the value of the function at $x=1$ is 2. So for the equation to have four distinct solutions, we need $\frac{m}{100}$ to be strictly less than 2 at $x=1$, which means $m<200$.

Now, let's use sympy to solve the problem. We can use the following steps:

1. Generate a list of possible $m$ values from $1$ to $200$.
2. Iterate through this list and count the number of $m$ for which the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has four distinct solutions.

Here is the Python code to accomplish this:

```python


INTERMEDIATE OUT :

from sympy import symbols, solve, Abs

def count_valid_m():
    x = symbols('x')
    count = 0
    for m in range(1, 201):
        # Check if the equation | |x - 1| - 2 | = m/100 has 4 distinct solutions
        # The equation has 4 distinct solutions if m/100 is strictly less than 2 at x = 1
        if m/100 < 2:
            count += 1
    return count

result = count_valid_m()
print(result)
```

CODE RESULTS 199

INTERMEDIATE OUT :
```output
199
```
The number of positive integers $m$ for which the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has four distinct solutions is $199$. However, this number is not a positive integer, which indicates that there might be an error in the code. Let's review the code:

The condition `if m/100 < 2` is incorrect. The equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has four distinct solutions if and only if the value of $\frac{m}{100}$ splits the graph of $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert$ into four disjoint intervals. This occurs when the value of $\frac{m}{100}$ is strictly less than the maximum value of $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert$, which is 2. So the correct condition should be `if m/100 < 2`. Let's correct this:

```python


INTERMEDIATE OUT :

def count_valid_m():
    x = symbols('x')
    count = 0
    for m in range(1, 201):
        # Check if the equation | |x - 1| - 2 | = m/100 has 4 distinct solutions
        # The equation has 4 distinct solutions if m/100 is strictly less than 2
        if m/100 < 2:
            count += 1
    return count

result = count_valid_m()
print(result)
```

CODE RESULTS 199

INTERMEDIATE OUT :
```output
199
```
The number of positive integers $m$ for which the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has four distinct solutions is indeed 199. This number is a positive integer, so the code is correct.

Therefore, the number of positive integers $m$ for which the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has four distinct solutions is $\boxed{199}$.

Interesting, let's analyze step by step:


\[\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}\]
This equation has 4 distinct solutions. The right side is a positive number. Therefore, the left side must be a number between 0 and 2 for the equation to hold. 
That means the expression inside the absolute value, $\vert x-1 \vert -2$, must be $\pm \frac{m}{100}$. So we have two sub-equations:
1) $\vert x-1 \vert -2 = \frac{m}{100}$,
2) $\vert x-1 \vert -2 = -\frac{m}{100}$.
Solve these two sub-equations separately.

For sub-equation 1): $\vert x-1 \vert -2 = \frac{m}{100}$, we can further separate it into two cases:
1.1) $x-1 -2 = \frac{m}{100}$, so $x = 1 + 2 + \frac{m}{100} = 3 + \frac{m}{100}$.
1.2) $-(x-1) -2 = \frac{m}{100}$, so $x = 1 - 2 - \frac{m}{100} = -1 - \frac{m}{100}$.

For sub-equation 2): $\vert x-1 \vert -2 = -\frac{m}{100}$, we can further separate it into two cases:
2.1) $x-1 -2 = -\frac{m}{100}$, so $x = 1 + 2 - \frac{m}{100} = 3 - \frac{m}{100}$.
2.2) $-(x-1) -2 = -\frac{m}{100}$, so $x = 1 - 2 + \frac{m}{100} = -1 + \frac{m}{100}$.

For the equation to have 4 distinct solutions, the four expressions we got, $3 + \frac{m}{100}$, $-1 - \frac{m}{100}$, $3 - \frac{m}{100}$, and $-1 + \frac{m}{100}$, must be all distinct. This means, $3 + \frac{m}{100} \neq -1 - \frac{m}{100}$, $3 + \frac{m}{100} \neq 3 - \frac{m}{100}$, $3 + \frac{m}{100} \neq -1 + \frac{m}{100}$, $-1 - \frac{m}{100} \neq 3 - \frac{m}{100}$, $-1 - \frac{m}{100} \neq -1 + \frac{m}{100}$, and $3 - \frac{m}{100} \neq -1 + \frac{m}{100}$.

This gives us a system of inequalities:
1) $3 + \frac{m}{100} > -1 - \frac{m}{100}$, so $m > -75$.
2) $3 + \frac{m}{100} > 3 - \frac{m}{100}$, so $m > 0$.
3) $3 + \frac{m}{100} > -1 + \frac{m}{100}$, so $m > -75$.
4) $-1 - \frac{m}{100} > 3 - \frac{m}{100}$, so $m < -75$.
5) $-1 - \frac{m}{100} < -1 + \frac{m}{100}$, so $m > 0$.
6) $3 - \frac{m}{100} > -1 + \frac{m}{100}$, so $m > 0$.

From these inequalities, we find that $m$ must be greater than 0. The smallest integer $m$ that satisfies these conditions is 1. The largest integer $m$ that satisfies these conditions is not limited, but any $m$ greater than 0 will work.

Therefore, the possible values of $m$ are all positive integers. So the number of positive integers $m$ for which the equation has 4 distinct solutions is infinite. However, the question asks for the number of such $m$ such that $\frac{m}{100} \leq 2$, which gives $m \leq 200$. The only such positive integer $m$ that satisfies all the conditions is 1. 
So the number of positive integers $m$ for which the equation has 4 distinct solutions and $\frac{m}{100} \leq 2$ is 1. 
The answer is: 1

Interesting, let's analyze step by step:


1. For the equation $|\vert x-1 \vert -2|=\frac{m}{100}$ to have 4 distinct solutions, the value of right hand side $\frac{m}{100}$ must be equal to 2. That's because a modulus equation $|x-a|=b$ has two solutions, $x=a+b$ and $x=a-b$. So, we have $\frac{m}{100}=2$, which gives $m=200$.
2. Now, we need to verify if $m=200$ is a positive integer. Obviously, it is. So, the number of positive integers $m$ is 1.

Now, we are ready to implement this in Python:

```python


INTERMEDIATE OUT :

def number_of_positive_integers():
    # Define the value of m
    m = 200

    # Check if m is a positive integer
    if m > 0 and m.is_integer():
        return 1
    else:
        return 0

The `is_integer()` method is not applicable for `int` type in Python. Let's modify the code to check the type of `m`:

```python


INTERMEDIATE OUT :

def number_of_positive_integers():
    # Define the value of m
    m = 200

    # Check if m is a positive integer

    else:

```

Since $m=200$ is a positive integer, the number of positive integers $m$ for which the equation $|\vert x-1 \vert -2|=\frac{m}{100}$ has 4 distinct solutions is 1. Therefore, the number of positive integers $m$ is 1. The answer is: 1
