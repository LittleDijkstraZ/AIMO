Below is a math problem you are to solve (positive numerical answer!):
"For how many positive integers $m$ does the equation \[\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}\] have $4$ distinct solutions?"
Analyze this problem and think step by step to come to a solution with programs. After solving the problem, output the final numerical answer within \boxed{}.

Assistant:

 The equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has 4 distinct solutions if and only if $\frac{m}{100}$ is strictly between 1 and 2. This is because the expression on the left hand side of the equation, $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert$, can take on any value from 0 to 3, and it equals to $\frac{m}{100}$ exactly when it is strictly between 1 and 2.

Therefore, we need to find the number of positive integers $m$ such that $1 < \frac{m}{100} < 2$. Multiplying all parts of the inequality by 100, we get $100 < m < 200$. The number of positive integers in this range is $200 - 100 - 1 = 99$.

So, there are 99 positive integers $m$ for which the equation has 4 distinct solutions.
The answer is: $99$.

This problem involves the number of solutions to an absolute value equation. The equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has 4 distinct solutions if and only if $\frac{m}{100}$ is strictly between 1 and 2. This is because the expression on the left side of the equation, $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert$, can take on any value from 0 to 3, and we want it to be equal to a value strictly between 1 and 2.

So we need to find the value of $m$ such that $\frac{m}{100}$ is strictly between 1 and 2. This means $1 < \frac{m}{100} < 2$. Multiplying all sides by 100 gives $100 < m < 200$. The positive integers $m$ that satisfy this inequality are the integers from 101 to 199, inclusive. To find the number of such integers, we subtract the smallest integer from the largest and add 1 (because both endpoints are included). So the number of such integers is $199 - 101 + 1 = 99$.

Therefore, there are 99 positive integers $m$ such that the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has 4 distinct solutions. The answer is: $99$

Assistant:

 The number of distinct solutions of the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ is equal to $4$ if and only if $\frac{m}{100} = 2$. This is because the function $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert$ takes the value $2$ exactly $4$ times. Therefore, we can solve for $m$ by setting $\frac{m}{100} = 2$.

Multiplying both sides of the equation by $100$ gives $m = 200$. So the number of positive integers $m$ for which the equation has $4$ distinct solutions is $1$. The answer is: $1$

Below is a math problem you are to solve (positive numerical answer!):
"For how many positive integers $m$ does the equation \[\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}\] have $4$ distinct solutions?"
Analyze this problem and think step by step to come to a solution with programs. After solving the problem, output the final numerical answer within \boxed{}.

Assistant:

 The problem asks for how many positive integers $m$ does the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ have $4$ distinct solutions.

The equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ is equivalent to a piecewise function with four cases:

1. If $\vert x-1 \vert -2 > 0$, then $\vert x-1 \vert > 2$, so $x-1 > 2$ or $x-1 < -2$, which gives us $x > 3$ or $x < -1$. In this case, the equation becomes $\vert x-1 \vert -2 = \frac{m}{100}$, or $\vert x-1 \vert = 2 + \frac{m}{100}$. This gives us two equations: $x-1 = 2 + \frac{m}{100}$ and $x-1 = -2 - \frac{m}{100}$. Solving these gives us $x = 3 + \frac{m}{100}$ and $x = -1 - \frac{m}{100}$.
2. If $\vert x-1 \vert -2 < 0$, then $\vert x-1 \vert < 2$, so $-2 < x-1 < 2$, which gives us $-1 < x < 3$. In this case, the equation becomes $-\vert x-1 \vert +2 = \frac{m}{100}$, or $\vert x-1 \vert = 2 - \frac{m}{100}$. This gives us two equations: $x-1 = 2 - \frac{m}{100}$ and $x-1 = -2 + \frac{m}{100}$. Solving these gives us $x = 3 - \frac{m}{100}$ and $x = -1 + \frac{m}{100}$.

For the equation to have 4 distinct solutions, the ranges of $x$ from the two cases must not overlap. This means that $3 + \frac{m}{100} > 3 - \frac{m}{100}$, or $\frac{m}{100} > -\frac{m}{100}$, which implies $m > 0$. Similarly, $-1 - \frac{m}{100} < -1 + \frac{m}{100}$, or $-\frac{m}{100} < \frac{m}{100}$, which implies $m > 0$. Therefore, $m$ must be a positive integer.

Also, for the equation to have 4 distinct solutions, the ranges of $x$ from the two cases must cover the entire real line. This means that $3 - \frac{m}{100} < 3$ and $-1 + \frac{m}{100} > -1$, or $\frac{m}{100} < 1$ and $\frac{m}{100} > -1$, which implies $0 < m < 100$. Therefore, $m$ must be a positive integer less than 100.

Combining these conditions, we find that $m$ must be a positive integer in the range $0 < m < 100$. The number of such positive integers is 99.

Therefore, the number of positive integers $m$ for which the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has 4 distinct solutions is 99.
