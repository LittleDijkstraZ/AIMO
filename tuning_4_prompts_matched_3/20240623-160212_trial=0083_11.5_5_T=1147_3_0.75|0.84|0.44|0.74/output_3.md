Approach:


The equation given is a product of two expressions equal to zero. This means that either the first expression is zero or the second expression is zero. Let's analyze each case:

1. $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$: This implies that $\vert x + y \vert = 10$, which means $x + y = \pm 10$.
2. $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$: This implies that $\vert x - y \vert = 10$, which means $x - y = \pm 10$.
3. $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$: This implies that $\vert x \vert = 8$, which means $x = \pm 8$.
4. $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$: This implies that $\vert y \vert = 8$, which means $y = \pm 8$.

From these conditions, we can see that the points that satisfy the equation lie on the lines $x + y = \pm 10$, $x - y = \pm 10$, $x = \pm 8$, and $y = \pm 8$. These lines form a square with side length 10. The area of this square is $10^2 = 100$.
The answer is: $100$

Approach:


The equation $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + (\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ implies that $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. This means that $x + y = \pm 10$ and $x - y = \pm 10$. Solving these equations gives us the vertices of the square: $(8, 2)$, $(8, -2)$, $(-8, -2)$, and $(-8, 2)$.

Similarly, the equation $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + (\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ implies that $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$. This means that $x = \pm 8$ and $y = \pm 8$. Solving these equations gives us the vertices of the square: $(8, 8)$, $(8, -8)$, $(-8, -8)$, and $(-8, 8)$.

The intersection of these two squares forms a larger square with side length $10\sqrt{2}$. The area of this square is $(10\sqrt{2})^2 = 200$.

So the area of the convex polygon is $200$.

```python

from sympy import sqrt

def area_of_polygon():
    side_length = 10 * sqrt(2)
    area = side_length**2

```

The area of the convex polygon is $200$. The answer is: $200$

Approach:


The given equation is a product of two expressions, and it equals to zero. This means that either the first expression equals to zero or the second expression equals to zero. We will analyze each case separately.

1. For the first expression $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$, it is a sum of squares, and it equals to zero if and only if each square equals to zero. That means $\vert x + y \vert - 10 = 0$ and $\vert x - y \vert - 10 = 0$, which simplifies to $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. This implies that the points $(x, y)$ must lie on the lines $x + y = 10$ and $x - y = 10$.

2. For the second expression $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$, it is also a sum of squares, and it equals to zero if and only if each square equals to zero. That means $\vert x \vert - 8 = 0$ and $\vert y \vert - 8 = 0$, which simplifies to $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$. This implies that the points $(x, y)$ must lie on the lines $x = 8$ and $y = 8$.

Combining these two cases, we find that the points $(x, y)$ that satisfy the given equation are the intersections of the lines $x + y = 10$, $x - y = 10$, $x = 8$, and $y = 8$. These lines form a rectangle with vertices at $(8, 2)$, $(8, 8)$, $(2, 8)$, and $(14, 8)$.

The area of this rectangle is the product of its length and width. The length is the distance between the points $(8, 2)$ and $(8, 8)$, which is $8 - 2 = 6$. The width is the distance between the points $(8, 8)$ and $(2, 8)$, which is $8 - 2 = 6$. Therefore, the area of the rectangle is $6 \times 6 = 36$.

So the area of the convex polygon enclosed by the points $(x, y)$ that satisfy the given equation is 36 square units. The answer is: $36$

Approach:

 The given equation is a product of two terms equal to zero, so either the first term is zero or the second term is zero. This means that the points that satisfy the equation are the union of the points that satisfy each term being zero separately.

1. For the first term, $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$, this implies that $\vert x + y \vert = 10$, which means $x + y = \pm 10$. These are two lines in the plane.

2. For the second term, $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$, this implies that $\vert x - y \vert = 10$, which means $x - y = \pm 10$. These are also two lines in the plane.

3. For the third term, $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$, this implies that $\vert x \vert = 8$, which means $x = \pm 8$. These are two vertical lines in the plane.

4. For the fourth term, $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$, this implies that $\vert y \vert = 8$, which means $y = \pm 8$. These are two horizontal lines in the plane.

The intersection of these lines forms a square with side length 10 (the distance from -10 to 10 on the x or y axis). The area of this square is $10^2 = 100$.
The answer is: $100$

The given equation is a product of two expressions equal to zero. This means that either the first expression is zero or the second expression is zero. Let's consider each case separately.

1. $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0 \Rightarrow \vert x + y \vert = 10 \Rightarrow x + y = \pm 10$.
2. $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0 \Rightarrow \vert x - y \vert = 10 \Rightarrow x - y = \pm 10$.
3. $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0 \Rightarrow \vert x \vert = 8 \Rightarrow x = \pm 8$.
4. $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0 \Rightarrow \vert y \vert = 8 \Rightarrow y = \pm 8$.

From cases 1 and 2, we get the lines $x + y = 10$, $x + y = -10$, $x - y = 10$, and $x - y = -10$. These lines form a square with side length 10. From cases 3 and 4, we get the lines $x = 8$, $x = -8$, $y = 8$, and $y = -8$. These lines form a square with side length 16. The intersection of these two squares is the convex polygon we are looking for.

The side length of the smaller square is the diagonal of the larger square, which can be found using the Pythagorean theorem: $\sqrt{(10)^2 + (10)^2} = \sqrt{200} = 10\sqrt{2}$. The side length of the smaller square is half of this value, or $5\sqrt{2}$.

The area of a square is the side length squared, so the area of the smaller square is $(5\sqrt{2})^2 = 50$.

So the area of the convex polygon is 50.
The answer is: $50$

"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"

Approach:


The given equation is a product of two terms, and the product equals to zero if and only if at least one of the terms equals to zero. So we have two cases:

1. $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$.
2. $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$.

For the first case, we have $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ or $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. This gives us the lines $x + y = 10$, $x + y = -10$, $x - y = 10$, and $x - y = -10$.

For the second case, we have $\vert x \vert = 8$ or $\vert y \vert = 8$. This gives us the lines $x = 8$, $x = -8$, $y = 8$, and $y = -8$.

The intersection points of these lines are the vertices of the polygon. By calculating these intersection points, we find that the polygon is a square with side length 16. The area of this square is $16^2 = 256$. So the area of the convex polygon is 256.

The answer is: $256$

Approach:



The equation given is a product of two expressions equal to zero. This means that either the first expression is zero or the second expression is zero.

Let's consider the two cases:

1. $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$
2. $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$

For the first case, we have two equations:

$\vert x + y \vert - 10 = 0$ and $\vert x - y \vert - 10 = 0$

which simplifies to:

$\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$

These equations represent two pairs of parallel lines, each pair being 20 units apart. The lines form a square with side length 10 units.

For the second case, we have:

$\vert x \vert - 8 = 0$ and $\vert y \vert - 8 = 0$

which simplifies to:

$\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$

These equations represent two pairs of parallel lines, each pair being 16 units apart. The lines form a square with side length 16 units.

The total area of the convex polygon is the sum of the areas of the two squares. The area of a square is given by side length squared, so the area of the first square is $10^2 = 100$ square units and the area of the second square is $16^2 = 256$ square units.

Therefore, the total area of the convex polygon is $100 + 256 = 356$ square units.

So, the area of the convex polygon is 356 square units. The answer is: $356$

Approach:

 The equation given is a product of two expressions equal to zero, so either one of the expressions must be zero. This gives us two systems of equations to solve. The absolute value expressions can be split into cases based on the value of the expressions inside the absolute value being positive or negative.

Solution:

First, let's solve $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$. This gives us $\vert x + y \vert = 10$. This absolute value equation splits into two cases:
1. $x + y = 10$
2. $x + y = -10$

Next, let's solve $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$. This gives us $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. This absolute value equation also splits into two cases:
1. $x - y = 10$
2. $x - y = -10$

Similarly, for $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$, we have $\vert x \vert = 8$, which splits into two cases:
1. $x = 8$
2. $x = -8$

And for $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$, we have $\vert y \vert = 8$, which also splits into two cases:
1. $y = 8$
2. $y = -8$

Now we have a total of 8 cases to consider. Solving each case, we find that the points that satisfy the equation are:

1. $(8, 2)$
2. $(-8, 2)$
3. $(8, -2)$
4. $(-8, -2)$
5. $(2, 8)$
6. $(-2, 8)$
7. $(2, -8)$
8. $(-2, -8)$

These points form a square with side length 8, so the area of the square is $8^2 = 64$. The answer is: $64$

Approach:


The given equation is a product of two expressions, which makes it equal to zero if either of the expressions is zero. Therefore, we can set each of the expressions to zero and solve for the possible values of x and y.

1. $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0 \Rightarrow \vert x + y \vert = 10 \Rightarrow x + y = \pm 10$
2. $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0 \Rightarrow \vert x - y \vert = 10 \Rightarrow x - y = \pm 10$
3. $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0 \Rightarrow \vert x \vert = 8 \Rightarrow x = \pm 8$
4. $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0 \Rightarrow \vert y \vert = 8 \Rightarrow y = \pm 8$

From these equations, we can find the vertices of the polygon by solving the systems of equations formed by the combinations of the above equations. The vertices are:
(8, 2), (8, -2), (-8, 2), (-8, -2), (2, 8), (-2, 8), (2, -8), and (-2, -8).

Now, we can plot these points on a graph to visualize the polygon. The polygon is a square with side length 16 units. To find the area of the square, we use the formula: area = side length^2. So, the area of the polygon is $16^2 = 256$ square units.
The answer is: $256$

Approach:


The given equation is a product of two terms equal to zero, so either of the terms must be zero. This gives us two sets of equations to solve:

1. $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ and $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ and $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$.
2. $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$.

For the first set of equations, we have:

1. $\vert x + y \vert = 10$, which implies $x + y = 10$ or $x + y = -10$.
2. $\vert x \vert = 8$, which implies $x = 8$ or $x = -8$.
3. $\vert y \vert = 8$, which implies $y = 8$ or $y = -8$.

For the second set of equations, we have:

1. $\vert x - y \vert = 10$, which implies $x - y = 10$ or $x - y = -10$.

Solving these equations, we find the vertices of the polygon:

1. $(8, 2)$, $(8, -18)$, $(-8, 2)$, $(-8, -18)$.
2. $(18, 8)$, $(18, -8)$, $(-2, 8)$, $(-2, -8)$.

The polygon is a square with side length 16. The area of a square is side length squared, so the area of the polygon is $16^2 = 256$. The answer is: $256$

The equation given in the problem is a product of two terms equal to zero, so either one of the terms must be zero. This gives us two separate cases to consider:

1. $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + (\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$
2. $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + (\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$

For the first case, we have:

$(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + (\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$

This implies that both $\vert x + y \vert - 10 = 0$ and $\vert x - y \vert - 10 = 0$, which means $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. The only way this can happen is if $x = y = 5$ or $x = -y = -5$. This gives us two points: $(5,5)$ and $(-5,-5)$.

For the second case, we have:

$(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + (\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$

This implies that both $\vert x \vert - 8 = 0$ and $\vert y \vert - 8 = 0$, which means $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$. The only way this can happen is if $x = 8$ or $x = -8$, and $y = 8$ or $y = -8$. This gives us four points: $(8,8)$, $(8,-8)$, $(-8,8)$, and $(-8,-8)$.

The points form a square with side length 10, so the area of the square is $10^2 = 100$. The answer is: $100$

The equation given is a product of two expressions equal to zero. This means that either the first expression is zero or the second expression is zero. We can analyze each case separately.

Case 1: $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$
This equation implies that both $\vert x + y \vert - 10 = 0$ and $\vert x - y \vert - 10 = 0$.
So, $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$.
This means that $x + y = \pm 10$ and $x - y = \pm 10$.
Solving these equations, we get the lines $x + y = 10$, $x + y = -10$, $x - y = 10$, and $x - y = -10$.

Case 2: $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$
This equation implies that both $\vert x \vert - 8 = 0$ and $\vert y \vert - 8 = 0$.
So, $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$.
This means that $x = \pm 8$ and $y = \pm 8$.

The intersection of these lines forms a square with side length 10 (from the lines $x + y = \pm 10$) and vertices at $(\pm 8, \pm 8)$.

The area of this square is side length squared, which is $10^2 = 100$.

So, the area of the convex polygon is 100.
The answer is: $100$
