"For how many positive integers $m$ does the equation \[\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}\] have $4$ distinct solutions?"

Approach:



The equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has 4 distinct solutions if and only if $\frac{m}{100}$ is strictly between 1 and 2. This is because the function $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert$ has a graph that oscillates between 1 and 2. So, we have $1 < \frac{m}{100} < 2$, which gives $100 < m < 200$. The number of positive integers $m$ in this range is $200 - 100 - 1 = 99$.

So the number of positive integers $m$ for which the equation has 4 distinct solutions is 99. The answer is: $99$

Approach:


We first analyze the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$.
The absolute value function makes the expression inside it non-negative, so we have two cases to consider:

Case 1: $\vert x-1 \vert -2 = \frac{m}{100}$.
This simplifies to $\vert x-1 \vert = 2 + \frac{m}{100}$.
Again, we have two sub-cases to consider:

Sub-case 1.1: $x-1 = 2 + \frac{m}{100}$, which simplifies to $x = 3 + \frac{m}{100}$.

Sub-case 1.2: $-(x-1) = 2 + \frac{m}{100}$, which simplifies to $x = -1 + \frac{m}{100}$.

Case 2: $-\vert x-1 \vert +2 = \frac{m}{100}$.
This simplifies to $\vert x-1 \vert = 2 - \frac{m}{100}$.
Again, we have two sub-cases to consider:

Sub-case 2.1: $x-1 = 2 - \frac{m}{100}$, which simplifies to $x = 3 - \frac{m}{100}$.

Sub-case 2.2: $-(x-1) = 2 - \frac{m}{100}$, which simplifies to $x = -1 - \frac{m}{100}$.

So, the four distinct solutions are $3 + \frac{m}{100}$, $-1 + \frac{m}{100}$, $3 - \frac{m}{100}$, and $-1 - \frac{m}{100}$.

For these four solutions to be distinct, we must have $\frac{m}{100} \neq 0$, which implies $m \neq 0$.
Also, we must have $\frac{m}{100} \neq 2$, which implies $m \neq 200$.
And we must have $\frac{m}{100} \neq 4$, which implies $m \neq 400$.

So, the possible values of $m$ are those positive integers that are less than 400 and not equal to 0, 200, or 400.
There are 398 such positive integers.

Therefore, the number of positive integers $m$ for which the equation has 4 distinct solutions is 398. The answer is: $398$

Approach:



The equation $| |x-1| - 2| = \frac{m}{100}$ has four distinct solutions, it means that the expression $|x-1| - 2$ must be equal to $\frac{m}{100}$ or $-\frac{m}{100}$.

So we have two equations:
1. $|x-1| - 2 = \frac{m}{100}$, which gives $|x-1| = 2 + \frac{m}{100}$.
2. $|x-1| - 2 = -\frac{m}{100}$, which gives $|x-1| = 2 - \frac{m}{100}$.

For the first equation, $|x-1| = 2 + \frac{m}{100}$, the right side must be greater than 2 for the equation to have solutions. So we have $2 + \frac{m}{100} > 2$, which simplifies to $\frac{m}{100} > 0$, and therefore $m > 0$.

For the second equation, $|x-1| = 2 - \frac{m}{100}$, the right side must be greater than 0 for the equation to have solutions. So we have $2 - \frac{m}{100} > 0$, which simplifies to $\frac{m}{100} < 2$, and therefore $m < 200$.

Combining the above two inequalities, we get $0 < m < 200$.

The number of positive integers $m$ that satisfy this inequality is 199.

So the number of positive integers $m$ for which the equation $| |x-1| - 2| = \frac{m}{100}$ has four distinct solutions is 199.

The answer is: $199$

Approach:



The equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has 4 distinct solutions if and only if $\frac{m}{100}$ is strictly between 1 and 2. This is because the function $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert$ has a graph that is a "V" shape with the "valleys" (the points where the function equals zero) occurring at $x=1 \pm 2$, or $x=-1$ and $x=3$. The distance between these valleys is 4, so for $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert$ to have 4 distinct solutions, the right hand side of the equation, $\frac{m}{100}$, must be strictly between 1 and 2. This gives $1 < \frac{m}{100} < 2$, or $100 < m < 200$. The positive integers $m$ in this range are exactly the integers from 101 to 199, inclusive. To find the number of these integers, we subtract the smallest integer in the range from the largest, and then add 1. This gives $199 - 101 + 1 = 99$.

So the number of positive integers $m$ for which the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has 4 distinct solutions is 99. The answer is: $99$

Assistant:

Approach:


We know that the equation $| |x-1|-2|=\frac{m}{100}$ has 4 distinct solutions if and only if $\frac{m}{100}$ is strictly between 0 and 2. This is because the expression $| |x-1|-2|$ can take on any value from 0 to 2, and $\frac{m}{100}$ must be within this range for the equation to have 4 distinct solutions.

So, we have $0 < \frac{m}{100} < 2$. Multiplying all sides by 100 gives $0 < m < 200$. The positive integers $m$ that satisfy this inequality are the integers from 1 to 199.

To count the number of these integers, we subtract the smallest integer from the largest and add 1. So the number of positive integers $m$ is $199 - 1 + 1 = 199$.

Therefore, the number of positive integers $m$ for which the equation $| |x-1|-2|=\frac{m}{100}$ has 4 distinct solutions is 199.
The answer is: $199$

Approach:


The equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has $4$ distinct solutions if and only if $\frac{m}{100}$ is strictly between $1$ and $2$, i.e., $1<\frac{m}{100}<2$.
This is equivalent to $100<m<200$.
The positive integers $m$ that satisfy this inequality are the integers from $101$ to $199$, inclusive.
To find the number of these integers, we subtract the smallest integer from the largest and add $1$.

Solution:
The number of positive integers $m$ that satisfy $100<m<200$ is $199-101+1=99$.

Therefore, the number of positive integers $m$ for which the equation has $4$ distinct solutions is $99$. The answer is: $99$

Approach:



The equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has 4 distinct solutions if and only if $\frac{m}{100} = 2$.

This is because the function $f(x) = \vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert$ has a graph that is a "V" shape with its "valley" at a height of 2. The equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ will have 4 distinct solutions when $\frac{m}{100} = 2$, or $m = 200$.

So, the only positive integer $m$ for which the equation has 4 distinct solutions is $m = 200$.

Therefore, the answer is $1$. The answer is: $1$

Assistant:

Approach:



The equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has $4$ distinct solutions means that the right side of the equation, $\frac{m}{100}$, must be equal to $2$. This is because the left side of the equation, $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert$, can take on the values of $2$ and $0$ only.

So we have $\frac{m}{100}=2$, which gives $m=200$.

So the number of positive integers $m$ that satisfy the equation is $1$, namely $200$.
The answer is: $1$

We can solve this problem by examining the properties of the absolute value function and the number of solutions of the equation.

The equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has four distinct solutions if and only if the right-hand side $\frac{m}{100}$ is strictly between $1$ and $2$. This is because the left-hand side of the equation, $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert$, takes on the values from $1$ to $3$ exactly once as $x$ varies over the real numbers. Therefore, we have $1 < \frac{m}{100} < 2$.

Multiplying all parts of the inequality by $100$, we get $100 < m < 200$. The positive integers $m$ that satisfy this inequality are exactly the integers from $101$ to $199$, inclusive. Therefore, the number of such integers is $199 - 101 + 1 = 99$.

So, the number of positive integers $m$ for which the equation has four distinct solutions is $99$. The answer is: $99$
