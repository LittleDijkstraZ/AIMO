Below is a math problem you are to solve (positive numerical answer!):
"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"
Analyze this problem and think step by step to come to a solution with programs. After solving the problem, output the final numerical answer within \boxed{}.

Assistant:

 The expression $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2)$ is equal to $0$ if and only if at least one of the factors is $0$. This means that either $\vert x + y \vert - 10 = 0$, $\vert x - y \vert - 10 = 0$, $\vert x \vert - 8 = 0$, or $\vert y \vert - 8 = 0$. These equations simplify to $\vert x + y \vert = 10$, $\vert x - y \vert = 10$, $\vert x \vert = 8$, and $\vert y \vert = 8$, respectively. The solutions to these equations are the vertices of a square with side length $16$. The area of this square is $16^2 = 256$. Therefore, the area of the convex polygon is $256$. The answer is: $256$

 The problem statement is a bit confusing because it contains vertical bars around the expressions. It is likely that the intended meaning is $|x+y|$ and $|x-y|$ instead of $|(|x+y|-10)$ and $|(|x-y|-10)$. If this is the case, then the equation simplifies to:

$$((|x+y| - 10)^2 + (|x-y| - 10)^2)((|x| - 8)^2 + (|y| - 8)^2) = 0.$$

This equation is satisfied if either of the following two conditions is met:

1. $(|x+y| - 10)^2 + (|x-y| - 10)^2 = 0$. This is only possible if $|x+y| = 10$ and $|x-y| = 10$, which implies $x = 0$ and $y = 0$.
2. $(|x| - 8)^2 + (|y| - 8)^2 = 0$. This is only possible if $|x| = 8$ and $|y| = 8$, which implies a square with side length 16.

The first condition gives us one point $(0, 0)$, and the second condition gives us a square with side length 16. So the points are enclosed in a square with side length 16. The area of this square is $16^2 = 256$. Therefore, the area of the convex polygon is $256$.

 The given equation is a product of two expressions equal to zero, which means that each of the expressions must be zero for the product to be zero. Therefore, we have two cases to consider:
1. $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ and $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ and $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$.
2. $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ and $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ and $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$.
For the first case, we have $\vert x + y \vert = 10$, $\vert x \vert = 8$, and $\vert y \vert = 8$. This implies that $-8 \leq x, y \leq 8$ and $x + y = \pm 10$. The points satisfying these conditions form a square with side length 16. The area of this square is $16^2 = 256$.
For the second case, we have $\vert x - y \vert = 10$, $\vert x \vert = 8$, and $\vert y \vert = 8$. This implies that $-8 \leq x, y \leq 8$ and $x - y = \pm 10$. The points satisfying these conditions also form a square with side length 16. The area of this square is also $16^2 = 256$.
Since the two squares overlap, the area of the convex polygon is the sum of the areas of the two squares minus the area of the overlapping region. The overlapping region is also a square with side length 8 (the diagonal of the smaller squares), so its area is $8^2 = 64$. Therefore, the area of the convex polygon is $2 \times 256 - 64 = 448$. The answer is: $448$

Assistant:



The expression $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2)$ is equal to zero if and only if both factors are equal to zero.

The first factor is equal to zero if and only if either $\vert x + y \vert - 10 = 0$ or $\vert x - y \vert - 10 = 0$. This implies that $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ or $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. These are the equations of two diagonals of a square.

The second factor is equal to zero if and only if either $\vert x \vert - 8 = 0$ or $\vert y \vert - 8 = 0$, which implies that $\vert x \vert = 8$ or $\vert y \vert = 8$. These are the equations of two vertical and two horizontal lines passing through the points of intersection of the diagonals.

So, the points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying the equation are the vertices of a square with side length 16.

The area of a square with side length $s$ is $s^2$. Therefore, the area of the convex polygon is $16^2 = 256$.
