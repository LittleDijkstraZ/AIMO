To find the number of positive integers $m$ for which the equation \[\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}\] has $4$ distinct solutions, we need to consider the possible values of $\frac{m}{100}$ and the resulting number of solutions for each value.

For $\frac{m}{100} = 0$, the equation simplifies to $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert = 0$, which gives us two solutions: $x = 3$ and $x = -1$. So this case does not yield 4 distinct solutions.

For $\frac{m}{100} = 1$, the equation simplifies to $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert = 1$, which gives us four solutions: $x = 0, 2, 4, -2$. This is the only case that yields 4 distinct solutions.

For $\frac{m}{100} = 2$, the equation simplifies to $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert = 2$, which gives us six solutions: $x = -1, 1, 3, 5, -3, -5$. This case also yields 4 distinct solutions.

For $\frac{m}{100} > 2$, the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has only two solutions.

Therefore, the only positive integer $m$ for which the equation has 4 distinct solutions is $m = 100$. So the answer is $\boxed{1}$.
The answer is $\boxed{1}$.

The equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has $4$ distinct solutions. The number of solutions of an absolute value equation depends on the value of the right side. The expression on the left side, $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert$, takes the value $0$ at $2$ points, the value $1$ at $4$ points, and takes values greater than $1$ at $0$ points. Thus, for the equation to have $4$ solutions, the right side must be $1$, which gives $\frac{m}{100}=1$.

Solving the equation $\frac{m}{100}=1$ for $m$ gives $m=100$. Thus, there is only one value of $m$ for which the equation has $4$ distinct solutions, and that value is $100$.

The answer is: $1$

To find the number of positive integers $m$ for which the equation $| |x-1| -2| = \frac{m}{100}$ has four distinct solutions, we first need to understand the properties of the absolute value function.

The function $|x-1|-2$ will be zero at $x=3$ and $x=-1$. This is because when $x=3$, $|3-1|-2 = 0$, and when $x=-1$, $|-1-1|-2 = 0$.

The function $| |x-1| -2|$ will be positive when $x < -1$ and $x > 3$. It will be negative when $-1 < x < 3$.

Now, let's consider the equation $| |x-1| -2| = \frac{m}{100}$. For this equation to have four distinct solutions, we need the right-hand side, $\frac{m}{100}$, to be positive. This means $m$ must be positive.

The equation will have four distinct solutions when $\frac{m}{100}$ lies strictly between $0$ and $2$, i.e., $0 < \frac{m}{100} < 2$.

To satisfy this condition, $0 < m < 200$. The positive integers $m$ in this range are $1, 2, 3, ..., 199$. However, $m=0$ and $m=200$ are not valid because they would result in only two or no solutions, respectively.

So, the number of positive integers $m$ for which the equation has four distinct solutions is $199-1 = 198$.

The answer is: $198$

 The problem asks for the number of positive integers $m$ for which the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has four distinct solutions. We can analyze this equation to find the possible values of $m$.

1. First, let's get rid of the fraction by multiplying both sides by $100$ to obtain the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=m$.
2. The absolute value equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=m$ will have four distinct solutions if and only if $0 < m < 2$. This is because the expression inside the absolute value, $\vert x-1 \vert -2$, changes its sign at $x=1$, so we need to ensure that the right-hand side $m$ is less than $2$ for the equation to have four distinct solutions.
3. Now, we need to find the positive integers $m$ that satisfy $0 < m < 2$. The only such positive integer is $m=1$.

Therefore, the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has four distinct solutions for only one positive integer $m$, which is $1$. The answer is: $1$

Approach:


To find the number of positive integers $m$ such that the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has four distinct solutions, we need to find the values of $m$ for which the right side of the equation, $\frac{m}{100}$, can take four different values.

The absolute value function $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert$ takes on a value between $0$ and $3$ inclusive. Thus, the right side of the equation, $\frac{m}{100}$, should also take on a value between $0$ and $3$ inclusive.

This means $0 \leq \frac{m}{100} \leq 3$. Multiplying all sides by $100$ gives $0 \leq m \leq 300$. The positive integers $m$ that satisfy this inequality are $1, 2, 3, \dots, 300$.

However, we want the number of positive integers $m$ for which the equation has exactly four distinct solutions. To determine this, we need to look at the behavior of the function $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert$. For each value of $m$, this function takes on four distinct values.

The function $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert$ takes on the value $0$ at exactly two points, and the value $2$ at exactly two points. This means that the right side of the equation, $\frac{m}{100}$, should also take on these values exactly twice each.

This implies that $m$ should be a multiple of $100$ that is between $0$ and $300$ inclusive. The multiples of $100$ in this range are $100, 200,$ and $300$.

For each of these values of $m$, the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has exactly four distinct solutions. Therefore, there are three positive integers $m$ that satisfy the condition of having four distinct solutions. The answer is: 3

The number of solutions to the equation $|\vert x-1 \vert -2|=\frac{m}{100}$ is equal to 4 if and only if the value $\frac{m}{100}$ is equal to the difference between the rightmost endpoint and the leftmost endpoint of the piece-wise linear function $f(x) = |\vert x-1 \vert -2|$.

Let's draw the graph of $f(x) = |\vert x-1 \vert -2|$ first:

- The graph of $f(x) = |\vert x-1 \vert -2|$ consists of three line segments.
- The left segment has slope $-1$ and starts at $(1-2, 1-2) = (-1, -1)$.
- The middle segment is horizontal and spans the interval $[-1, 1]$.
- The right segment has slope $1$ and starts at $(1+2, 1-2) = (3, -1)$.

Therefore, the difference between the rightmost endpoint and the leftmost endpoint of the piece-wise linear function $f(x) = |\vert x-1 \vert -2|$ is $3 - (-1) = 4$.

This implies that the equation $|\vert x-1 \vert -2|=\frac{m}{100}$ has 4 distinct solutions if and only if $\frac{m}{100} = 4$, or $m = 400$.

So, the only positive integer $m$ for which the equation $|\vert x-1 \vert -2|=\frac{m}{100}$ has 4 distinct solutions is 400. The answer is: $1$
