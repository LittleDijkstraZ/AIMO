Approach:


The given equation is a product of two terms equals to zero, which implies that either the first term equals to zero or the second term equals to zero.
The equation $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ implies that $\vert x + y \vert = 10$. This is the equation of a square with side length 20. The vertices of this square are $(10,0), (0,10), (-10,0),$ and $(0,-10)$.
The equation $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ implies that $\vert x \vert = 8$. This is the equation of a square with side length 16. The vertices of this square are $(8,0), (-8,0), (0,8),$ and $(0,-8)$.
The intersection of these two squares is a smaller square with side length 8. The vertices of this square are $(8,4), (8,-4), (-8,4),$ and $(-8,-4)$.
Therefore, the area of the convex polygon is the area of the smaller square, which is $8^2 = 64$.

```python

Solve the following problem with a Python Script (positive numerical answer):
"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"

The equation is satisfied if either $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$.

The first two equations imply that $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$.

The third and fourth equations imply that $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$.

Solving these equations we find the points satisfying these conditions are $\left(8,0\right)$, $\left(-8,0\right)$, $\left(0,8\right)$, and $\left(0,-8\right)$, which are the vertices of a square with side length 16.

Therefore, the area of the square is $16^2 = 256$.

So, the area of the convex polygon is 256. The answer is: $256$

Solve the following problem with a Python Script (positive numerical answer):
"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"

Approach:


The equation $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ is satisfied if either $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$.
The first equation is satisfied if and only if both $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. This means $x + y = \pm 10$ and $x - y = \pm 10$, which gives us the four lines $x + y = 10$, $x + y = -10$, $x - y = 10$, and $x - y = -10$. The points where these lines intersect form a square with side length 20. The area of this square is $20^2 = 400$.
The second equation is satisfied if and only if both $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$, which means $x = \pm 8$ and $y = \pm 8$. This gives us the four lines $x = 8$, $x = -8$, $y = 8$, and $y = -8$. The points where these lines intersect form a square with side length 16. The area of this square is $16^2 = 256$.
The convex polygon formed by the intersection of the two squares is the smaller square with side length 16. So, the area of this convex polygon is $16^2 = 256$.
The answer is: $256$

Solve the following problem with a Python Script (positive numerical answer):
"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"

Assistant:

Approach:


The expression $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ will be zero if either of the two factors is zero. This gives us two conditions to consider:

1. $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$
2. $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$

From condition 1, we have $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. This implies that the points $(x, y)$ lie on a square with side length $10\sqrt{2}$.

From condition 2, we have $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$. This implies that the points $(x, y)$ lie on a square with side length $16$.

The area of the convex polygon is the sum of the areas of these two squares. The area of a square is given by the square of the length of its side. Therefore, the area of the first square is $(10\sqrt{2})^2 = 200$, and the area of the second square is $16^2 = 256$. Adding these two areas gives the total area of the convex polygon: $200 + 256 = 456$.
The answer is: 456

Solve the following problem with a Python Script (positive numerical answer):
"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"

Approach:



This problem is equivalent to finding the set of points $\left(x, y\right)$ that satisfy at least one of the following two conditions:

1. $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + (\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$
2. $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + (\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$

From the first condition, we have $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. This gives us four equations:

1. $x + y = 10$
2. $x + y = -10$
3. $x - y = 10$
4. $x - y = -10$

The second condition gives us $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$, which gives us four more equations:

5. $x = 8$
6. $x = -8$
7. $y = 8$
8. $y = -8$

The intersection points of these lines are the vertices of the polygon:

1. $(0, 10)$ from 1 and 7
2. $(0, -10)$ from 2 and 7
3. $(10, 0)$ from 1 and 5
4. $(-10, 0)$ from 2 and 5
5. $(8, 2)$ from 5 and 1
6. $(-8, 2)$ from 6 and 1
7. $(8, -2)$ from 5 and 2
8. $(-8, -2)$ from 6 and 2
9. $(2, 8)$ from 1 and 7
10. $(-2, 8)$ from 2 and 7
11. $(2, -8)$ from 1 and 8
12. $(-2, -8)$ from 2 and 8

Now, we can calculate the area of the polygon by dividing it into triangles and rectangles:

- There are four rectangles: $10 \times 10$, $8 \times 2$, $8 \times 2$, and $2 \times 8$.
- There are twelve triangles: three with base and height of 8, three with base and height of 2, and six with base and height of 6.

The area of the polygon is the sum of the areas of these shapes:

- The area of each $10 \times 10$ rectangle is $100$. There are four of them, so the total area is $400$.
- The area of each $8 \times 2$ rectangle is $16$. There are two of them, so the total area is $32$.
- The area of each $8 \times 2$ rectangle is also $16$. There are two of them, so the total area is again $32$.
- The area of each triangle with base and height of 8 is $0.5 \times 8 \times 8 = 32$. There are three of them, so the total area is $96$.
- The area of each triangle with base and height of 2 is $0.5 \times 2 \times 2 = 2$. There are three of them, so the total area is $6$.
- The area of each triangle with base and height of 6 is $0.5 \times 6 \times 6 = 18$. There are six of them, so the total area is $108$.

Adding all these up, the area of the polygon is $400 + 32 + 32 + 96 + 6 + 108 = 682$.

So, the area of the convex polygon is 682 square units. The answer is: $682$

Solve the following problem with a Python Script (positive numerical answer):
"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"

Approach:



The equation is given as
$$((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0.$$
This equation is true if and only if either of the two factors is equal to zero. Thus, we have two sets of equations:

1. $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0 \Rightarrow \vert x + y \vert = 10$.
2. $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0 \Rightarrow \vert x - y \vert = 10$.
3. $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0 \Rightarrow \vert x \vert = 8$.
4. $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0 \Rightarrow \vert y \vert = 8$.

From 3. and 4., we have $x = \pm 8$ and $y = \pm 8$.

From 1. and 2., we have four cases:

1.1. $x + y = 10$ and $x - y = 10$. Solving this system of equations gives $x = 10$ and $y = 0$.
1.2. $x + y = 10$ and $x - y = -10$. Solving this system of equations gives $x = 0$ and $y = 10$.
1.3. $x + y = -10$ and $x - y = 10$. Solving this system of equations gives $x = 0$ and $y = -10$.
1.4. $x + y = -10$ and $x - y = -10$. Solving this system of equations gives $x = -10$ and $y = 0$.

So the vertices of the polygon are: $(8,8)$, $(8,-8)$, $(-8,8)$, and $(-8,-8)$.

These points form a square with side length $16$. The area of this square is $16^2 = 256$.

So, the area of the convex polygon is $256$.

The answer is: $256$

Approach:


The equation $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ is satisfied if either of the two factors is zero.

1. The first factor is zero when $\vert x + y \vert - 10 = 0$ and $\vert x - y \vert - 10 = 0$, which simplifies to $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. These are the equations of two lines in the coordinate plane. The area enclosed by these lines is a square with side length 20. The area of the square is $20^2 = 400$.

2. The second factor is zero when $\vert x \vert - 8 = 0$ and $\vert y \vert - 8 = 0$, which simplifies to $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$. These are the equations of two lines in the coordinate plane. The area enclosed by these lines is a square with side length 16. The area of the square is $16^2 = 256$.

Since the area of the polygon is the sum of the areas of the two squares, the area of the polygon is $400 + 256 = 656$.

Therefore, the area of the convex polygon is 656.

The answer is: $656$

The equation is given as: $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$

In order for the product of two numbers to be zero, one of them must be zero. Therefore, we have two separate cases to consider:

Case 1: $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$
This implies that both $\vert x + y \vert - 10 = 0$ and $\vert x - y \vert - 10 = 0$, which gives $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$.

Case 2: $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$
This implies that both $\vert x \vert - 8 = 0$ and $\vert y \vert - 8 = 0$, which gives $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$.

From case 1, we have $x + y = \pm 10$ and $x - y = \pm 10$. This gives us four lines: $x + y = 10$, $x + y = -10$, $x - y = 10$, and $x - y = -10$.
From case 2, we have $x = \pm 8$ and $y = \pm 8$. This gives us four lines: $x = 8$, $x = -8$, $y = 8$, and $y = -8$.

The eight lines intersect at the vertices of a square with side length 10. The area of this square is $10^2 = 100$.
The answer is: $100$

The equation $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ is satisfied if either of the two factors is zero. This gives us two sets of conditions:
1. $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ and $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ and $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ and $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$
2. $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ and $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ and $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$

Solving the conditions from set 1, we get $x = \pm 8$ and $y = \pm 8$, which gives us a square with side length 16. So the area of this square is $16^2 = 256$.

Solving the conditions from set 2, we get two pairs of lines $x + y = \pm 10$ and $x - y = \pm 10$, which intersect at the points $(\pm 5, 0)$ and $(0, \pm 5)$. This forms a square with side length 10. So the area of this square is $10^2 = 100$.

Since the area of the convex polygon is the union of the two squares, we have $256 + 100 = 356$.

Therefore, the area of the convex polygon is 356 square units. The answer is: $356$

Approach:


The equation given is $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + (\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + (\vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$. The product of two numbers is zero if and only if at least one of the numbers is zero. Therefore, either $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + (\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + (\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$. 

If $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + (\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$, then $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. This implies that $x + y = \pm 10$ and $x - y = \pm 10$. Solving these equations, we get the vertices of the polygon as $(0, 10), (0, -10), (10, 0), (-10, 0)$.

If $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + (\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$, then $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$. This implies that $x = \pm 8$ and $y = \pm 8$. Adding the vertices from both cases, we get the vertices of the polygon as $(0, 10), (0, -10), (10, 0), (-10, 0), (8, 8), (8, -8), (-8, 8), (-8, -8)$.

To find the area of the polygon, we can divide it into four right triangles by drawing the lines from the origin to the points $(8, 8)$, $(8, -8)$, and $(-8, 8)$, and $(-8, -8)$. The base and height of each triangle are 8 units, so the area of each triangle is $1/2 * 8 * 8 = 32$. Since there are four triangles, the total area of the polygon is $4 * 32 = 128$.

Approach:


The expression $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2)$ is equal to zero if and only if at least one of the factors is zero.
For the first factor to be zero, we must have $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ or $\vert x - y \vert = 10$.
These are the equations of two squares with side length 10 centered at the origin.
For the second factor to be zero, we must have $\vert x \vert = 8$ or $\vert y \vert = 8$.
These are the equations of two squares with side length 8 centered at the origin.

The intersection of these squares form a regular octagon centered at the origin.

The area of a regular octagon with side length $a$ is given by $\frac{2a^2(1 + \sqrt{2})}{1}$.

For this problem, $a = 10$, so the area of the octagon is $\frac{2(10)^2(1 + \sqrt{2})}{1} = 200(1 + \sqrt{2})$.

Therefore, the area of the convex polygon enclosed by the points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying the given equation is $200(1 + \sqrt{2})$.
The answer is: $200(1 + \sqrt{2})$

Approach:


The given equation is a product of two expressions equals to zero. So, one or both of the expressions must be zero for the entire equation to hold true.
We can set each expression equal to zero and solve for the possible values of x and y.
Then, plot these points on a coordinate plane to visualize the shape enclosed by the points.
The shape formed by the points is a square, where the side length is 16 units (since the distance from the origin (0,0) to any of the vertices of the square is 8 units in both the x and y directions).
To find the area of the square, we simply square the side length: $16^2 = 256$.

So, the area of the convex polygon is 256 square units. The answer is: $256$
