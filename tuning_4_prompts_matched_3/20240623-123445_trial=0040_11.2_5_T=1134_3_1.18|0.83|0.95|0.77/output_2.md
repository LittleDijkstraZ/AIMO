Approach:



We first note that the left-hand side of the equation, $| |x-1| - 2 |$, is a piecewise function that takes the value $2 - |x-1|$ when $x < 1$ and $|x-1| - 2$ when $x \geq 1$. This function is equal to $\frac{m}{100}$ and it has 4 distinct solutions if and only if the equation $|x-1| - 2 = \frac{m}{100}$ has 2 distinct solutions for $x \geq 1$ and the equation $2 - |x-1| = \frac{m}{100}$ has 2 distinct solutions for $x < 1$.

For $x < 1$, the equation $2 - |x-1| = \frac{m}{100}$ simplifies to $|x-1| = 2 - \frac{m}{100}$. This has 2 distinct solutions for $x < 1$ if and only if $0 < 2 - \frac{m}{100} < 1$, which simplifies to $100/2 < m < 100$.

For $x \geq 1$, the equation $|x-1| - 2 = \frac{m}{100}$ simplifies to $|x-1| = 2 + \frac{m}{100}$. This has 2 distinct solutions for $x \geq 1$ if and only if $0 < 2 + \frac{m}{100}$.

Combining these two inequalities, we see that the value of $m$ must be such that $100/2 < m < 100$. The only positive integer in this range is $m = 50$. So there is only 1 value of $m$ for which the equation has 4 distinct solutions, and that is $m = 50$. The answer is: $1$

Approach:


The number of solutions to the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ is equal to the number of times the graph of $y=\frac{m}{100}$ intersects the graph of $y=\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert$.
The graph of $y=\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert$ is a "V" shape with vertices at $(1-2, 0) = (-1, 0)$, $(1, 0)$, and $(1+2, 0) = (3, 0)$, and the graph of $y=\frac{m}{100}$ is a horizontal line.
So, we want to find the number of values of $\frac{m}{100}$ for which the line intersects the "V" shape at exactly $4$ points.
This occurs when $0 < \frac{m}{100} < 2$.
Thus, $0 < m < 200$.
The positive integers $m$ in this range are $1, 2, 3, ..., 199$, making $199$ total values.
The answer is: $199$

 To solve this problem, we need to find the number of positive integers $m$ for which the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has $4$ distinct solutions.

We know that the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has $4$ distinct solutions when $\frac{m}{100}$ is strictly between $1$ and $2$. This is because the function $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert$ has $4$ "humps" in the interval $(1, 3)$, and the equation will have as many solutions as the number of these humps intersected by the line $y = \frac{m}{100}$.

So, we need to find the number of positive integers $m$ for which $1 < \frac{m}{100} < 2$. Multiplying all sides of the inequalities by $100$, we get $100 < m < 200$.

Now, we need to find the number of positive integers in this interval. The smallest integer in the interval is $101$, and the largest integer is $199$. The number of integers in this interval is $199 - 101 + 1 = 99$.

So, the number of positive integers $m$ for which the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has $4$ distinct solutions is $99$. The answer is: $99$

The equation \[\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}\] has 4 distinct solutions if $\frac{m}{100}$ is less than 2 and greater than 0. This is because the expression on the left side of the equation, $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert$, can take on values from 0 to 2, and the equation will have 4 distinct solutions when $\frac{m}{100}$ falls into this range.

So, we need to find the number of positive integers $m$ such that $0 < \frac{m}{100} < 2$.

Multiplying all sides of the inequality by 100, we get $0 < m < 200$. The positive integers $m$ that satisfy this inequality are 1, 2, ..., 199, giving us a total of 199 positive integers.

Therefore, the number of positive integers $m$ for which the equation \[\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}\] has 4 distinct solutions is 199.
The answer is: 199

Approach:


The equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has 4 distinct solutions, which means the right side should be a number between 0 and 3. Therefore, $0 < \frac{m}{100} \leq 3$, which gives $0 < m \leq 300$.

Then we need to find the number of positive integers $m$ in this range. The integers from 1 to 300 inclusive are the positive integers $m$ that satisfy the equation. 

Therefore, the number of such $m$ is $300$.

The answer is: $300$.

We are given the equation $| |x - 1| - 2| = \frac{m}{100}$, and we want to find how many values of $m$ result in the equation having 4 distinct solutions. 

First, let's consider the equation $| |x - 1| - 2| = k$ where $k = \frac{m}{100}$. The number of solutions to this equation depends on the value of $k$. Specifically, the equation has 4 distinct solutions when $0 < k < 1$. This is because the expression $|x - 1| - 2$ "jumps" from $-2$ to $2$ as $x$ passes through $1$, and the absolute value $| |x - 1| - 2|$ "jumps" from $2$ to $0$ and back to $2$ as $x$ passes through $1 \pm 2$, or $3$ and $-1$. The equation $| |x - 1| - 2| = k$ has 4 distinct solutions when $0 < k < 1$.

If $k = \frac{m}{100}$ and $0 < k < 1$, then $0 < \frac{m}{100} < 1$, and multiplying all sides of the inequality by $100$ gives $0 < m < 100$. So the positive integer values of $m$ that we are looking for are the integers from $1$ to $99$.

To find the number of these integers, we subtract the smallest integer from the largest and add $1$: $99 - 1 + 1 = 99$. So there are 99 positive integer values of $m$ for which the equation has 4 distinct solutions. The answer is: 99

We need to find the number of positive integer values of $m$ such that the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has exactly 4 distinct solutions.

The equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ is a piecewise function with four cases based on the absolute value. We need to analyze each case separately and determine the number of distinct solutions in each case.

Case 1: When $\vert x-1 \vert -2 > 0$, we have $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\vert x-1 \vert -2=\frac{m}{100}$.
Solving this equation gives us $\vert x-1 \vert = 2+\frac{m}{100}$, and further solving gives us two solutions: $x = 1+2+\frac{m}{100}$ and $x = 1-2-\frac{m}{100}$, or $x = 3+\frac{m}{100}$ and $x = -1-\frac{m}{100}$.

Case 2: When $\vert x-1 \vert -2 < 0$, we have $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=-\vert x-1 \vert +2=\frac{m}{100}$.
Solving this equation gives us $\vert x-1 \vert = 2-\frac{m}{100}$. Since the right side must be non-negative, we have $2-\frac{m}{100} \geq 0$, or $\frac{m}{100} \leq 2$. So, $m \leq 200$.
Solving $\vert x-1 \vert = 2-\frac{m}{100}$ gives us two solutions: $x = 1+2-\frac{m}{100}$ and $x = 1-2+\frac{m}{100}$, or $x = 3-\frac{m}{100}$ and $x = -1+\frac{m}{100}$.

We can see that for Case 2, the two solutions are distinct if and only if $3-\frac{m}{100} \neq -1+\frac{m}{100}$, or $4 = \frac{2m}{100}$, or $m = 100$.

Therefore, for $m = 100$, the equation has exactly 4 distinct solutions. Since $m$ must be a positive integer, the only positive integer value of $m$ that works is $m = 100$. The answer is: $1$

We are given the equation $| |x - 1| - 2 | = \frac{m}{100}$ and we want to find the number of positive integers $m$ for which this equation has $4$ distinct solutions.

We first note that the left-hand side of the equation is non-negative, and the right-hand side is positive. Therefore, for the equation to have solutions, we must have $\frac{m}{100} > 0$, which implies $m > 0$.

Also, we know that the absolute value function $|x - 1|$ can take on any value from $0$ to $1$ when $x$ is in the interval $[0, 2]$, and can take on any value from $1$ to $2$ when $x$ is in the interval $[2, 4]$. Therefore, the expression $| |x - 1| - 2 |$ can take on any value from $0$ to $1$ when $x$ is in the interval $[0, 2]$, and can take on any value from $0$ to $1$ when $x$ is in the interval $[2, 4]$.

This means that for the equation $| |x - 1| - 2 | = \frac{m}{100}$ to have $4$ distinct solutions, $\frac{m}{100}$ must be in the interval $(0, 1)$. Therefore, we must have $0 < \frac{m}{100} < 1$, which implies $0 < m < 100$.

The number of positive integers $m$ that satisfy this inequality is $99$.

Therefore, there are $99$ positive integers $m$ for which the equation $| |x - 1| - 2 | = \frac{m}{100}$ has $4$ distinct solutions. The answer is: $\boxed{99}$.

Approach:


We can start by analyzing the equation \[\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}.\]
The right side of the equation is a positive value, so the left side must be a positive value as well.
The expression inside the absolute value on the left side, \[\vert x-1 \vert -2,\] must be between -$\frac{m}{100}$ and $\frac{m}{100}$.
This gives us the following inequalities:
\[-\frac{m}{100} \leq \vert x-1 \vert -2 \leq \frac{m}{100}.\]
Now we can add 2 to each part of the inequalities:
\[2-\frac{m}{100} \leq \vert x-1 \vert \leq 2+\frac{m}{100}.\]
Next, we can split the absolute value inequality into two separate inequalities:
\[1-2+\frac{m}{100} \leq x \leq 1+2+\frac{m}{100},\]
\[1-2-\frac{m}{100} \geq x \geq 1+2-\frac{m}{100}.\]
Simplifying these inequalities gives:
\[-\frac{m}{100} +1 \leq x \leq \frac{m}{100} +3,\]
\[-\frac{m}{100} -1 \geq x \geq \frac{m}{100} -1.\]
Or in other words:
\[1-\frac{m}{100} \leq x \leq 3+\frac{m}{100},\]
\[-1-\frac{m}{100} \geq x \geq -1+\frac{m}{100}.\]
This means that the four distinct solutions to the equation are:
\[x = 1-\frac{m}{100}, \quad x = -1+\frac{m}{100}, \quad x = 3+\frac{m}{100}, \quad x = -1-\frac{m}{100}.\]
We want the number of positive integers $m$ such that this equation has four distinct solutions.
This happens when $0 < \frac{m}{100} < 1$, because if $\frac{m}{100} \geq 1$, then some of the solutions will be equal.
So we want the number of positive integers $m$ such that $0 < m < 100$.
There are 99 positive integers in this range, so the number of positive integers $m$ for which the equation has four distinct solutions is 99. The answer is: 99
