Approach:


The equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has $4$ distinct solutions means that the expression inside the absolute value, i.e., $\vert x-1 \vert -2$, takes on the values $\frac{m}{100}$, $-\frac{m}{100}$, $\frac{m}{100}-2$, and $-\frac{m}{100}-2$. 

Let's consider the cases when $\vert x-1 \vert -2 = \frac{m}{100}$ and $\vert x-1 \vert -2 = -\frac{m}{100}$. The other two cases can be obtained by replacing $m$ with $-m$.

When $\vert x-1 \vert -2 = \frac{m}{100}$, we have $\vert x-1 \vert = \frac{m}{100} + 2$. This equation has two solutions if $\frac{m}{100} + 2 > 0$, i.e., $m > -200$.

Similarly, when $\vert x-1 \vert -2 = -\frac{m}{100}$, we have $\vert x-1 \vert = 2 - \frac{m}{100}$. This equation has two solutions if $2 - \frac{m}{100} > 0$, i.e., $m < 200$.

Combining these two conditions, we get $-200 < m < 200$. Since $m$ is a positive integer, the possible values of $m$ are the positive integers from $1$ to $199$.

Now, we need to count the number of these integers that make the original equation have $4$ distinct solutions. This happens when the expressions $\frac{m}{100}$, $-\frac{m}{100}$, $\frac{m}{100}-2$, and $-\frac{m}{100}-2$ are all positive.

For $\frac{m}{100}-2 > 0$, we have $m > 200$. But this contradicts with the condition $-200 < m < 200$. So, the original equation has $4$ distinct solutions only when the expressions $\frac{m}{100}$, $-\frac{m}{100}$, $\frac{m}{100}-2$, and $-\frac{m}{100}-2$ are all positive and less than $2$. This happens when $1 \leq m \leq 198$.

Finally, we count the number of positive integers from $1$ to $198$. This is $198$.

So, the number of positive integers $m$ that satisfy the condition is $198$.
The answer is: $198$

To find the number of positive integers $m$ for which the equation \[\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}\] has 4 distinct solutions, we need to consider the possible values of $\frac{m}{100}$.
The absolute value function $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert$ has a graph with a V-shape.
The equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ will have 4 distinct solutions when $\frac{m}{100}$ is equal to the height of the V-shape, which is 2.
Therefore, we have $\frac{m}{100} = 2$, which gives us $m = 200$.
So there is only one positive integer $m$ that satisfies the condition, and that is $m = 200$. The answer is: 1

Approach:



1. We first notice that the left-hand side of the equation is always between 0 and 4. So $\frac{m}{100}$ must be between 0 and 4. This means $0 \leq \frac{m}{100} \leq 4$.
2. Multiplying through by 100, we get $0 \leq m \leq 400$.
3. We know that the left-hand side of the equation is always non-negative, so $m$ must be a positive integer.
4. The number of distinct solutions is 4 when $\frac{m}{100}$ equals to 2. Therefore, we set $\frac{m}{100} = 2$, and solve for $m$.
5. Multiplying through by 100, we get $m = 200$.
6. Checking if $m = 200$ is in the range of $0 \leq m \leq 400$, we see that it is indeed in this range.
7. Therefore, there is only one positive integer $m$ that makes the equation have 4 distinct solutions, and that integer is $m = 200$.

The answer is: $\boxed{1}$

Approach:


The equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has 4 distinct solutions if and only if $\frac{m}{100}$ is a positive number less than 2.
Since $m$ is a positive integer, we have $0 < m < 200$.
The number of positive integers $m$ in this range is 199.
But we must subtract the values of $m$ for which the equation has less than 4 distinct solutions.

When $\frac{m}{100} \geq 2$, the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has at most 2 distinct solutions.
This happens when $m \geq 200$.
So, we must subtract the values $m = 200, 201, \ldots, 199$.
There are 100 such values.

Therefore, the number of positive integers $m$ for which the equation has 4 distinct solutions is $199 - 100 = 99$.

So, the answer is $\boxed{99}$. The value of m that satisfies the given conditions is 99. The answer is: $\boxed{99}$

Approach:



The equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has 4 distinct solutions means that the value of $\frac{m}{100}$ must be the value that splits the graph of $y = \vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert$ into 4 parts.

The graph of $y = \vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert$ is a "hockey stick" shape with the tip at $(1, 2)$. The value of $y$ decreases from 2 to 0 as $x$ increases from 1 to 3, and then increases from 0 back to 2 as $x$ increases from 3 to 5. So, the value of $\frac{m}{100}$ must be $2$ for the equation to have 4 distinct solutions. This gives us $m = 200$.

So, there is only one positive integer $m$ that makes the equation have 4 distinct solutions, and that is $m = 200$. The answer is: $1$

Approach:


The equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has $4$ distinct solutions if and only if $\frac{m}{100} \in (0,2)$. Therefore, we need to find the number of positive integers $m$ such that $\frac{m}{100} \in (0,2)$. This means $0 < \frac{m}{100} < 2$. Multiplying all parts of the inequality by $100$, we get $0 < m < 200$. The positive integers in this range are the integers from $1$ to $199$, inclusive. So the number of such positive integers $m$ is $199$. The answer is: 199

We start by looking at the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$.

This equation has 4 distinct solutions when $\frac{m}{100}$ is a number between $1$ and $2$ (exclusive). This is because the function $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert$ has a "V" shape with a maximum value of $2$ and a minimum value of $0$, and it has three transition points where the slope changes. The value of $\frac{m}{100}$ determines the number of distinct solutions.

So, we want to find the number of values of $m$ such that $1 < \frac{m}{100} < 2$.

This can be rewritten as $100 < m < 200$.

The positive integers $m$ that satisfy this inequality are the integers from $101$ to $199$, inclusive.

To find the number of these integers, we can subtract the smallest integer from the largest and add $1$:

$199 - 101 + 1 = 99$.

So, there are $99$ positive integers $m$ for which the equation has $4$ distinct solutions. The answer is: $99$

Assistant:

Approach:

 The problem is asking for how many positive integers $m$ the equation \[\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}\] has $4$ distinct solutions. We can start by setting $\frac{m}{100} = k$ where $k$ is a positive real number. Then the equation becomes \[\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=k.\]
The graph of $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert$ is a V-shape with the vertex at $x=1$. The equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=k$ will have four distinct solutions if and only if $0<k<2$.
Therefore, we need to find the number of positive integers $m$ such that $0<\frac{m}{100}<2$.
This inequality is equivalent to $0<m<200$.
The positive integers $m$ that satisfy this inequality are the integers from $1$ to $199$.
Therefore, the number of such positive integers $m$ is $199$.
The answer is: 199

Approach:



The equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has 4 distinct solutions, it means that the right part of the equation, which is $\frac{m}{100}$, should be equal to either 2 or 0.

If $\frac{m}{100}=2$, then $m=200$.

If $\frac{m}{100}=0$, then $m=0$.

But we need positive integers $m$, so we discard $m=0$.

So the only possible value for $m$ is $200$.

Let's verify that this value indeed gives us 4 distinct solutions.

Solution:

If $m=200$, then the equation becomes $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{200}{100}=2$.

This equation can be solved in the following way:

1) If $\vert x-1 \vert -2=2$, then $\vert x-1 \vert =4$.

This gives us two cases:

a) $x-1=4$, which gives $x=5$.

b) $x-1=-4$, which gives $x=-3$.

2) If $\vert x-1 \vert -2=-2$, then $\vert x-1 \vert =0$.

This gives us one case:

a) $x-1=0$, which gives $x=1$.

So we have 4 distinct solutions: $x=-3, 1, 5$.

Therefore, there is only one positive integer $m$ for which the equation has 4 distinct solutions, and that is $m=200$. The answer is: $1$
