Solve the following problem with a Python Script (positive numerical answer):
"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"

Approach:


The equation $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + (\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + (\vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ is equal to zero if and only if either of the two factors is equal to zero. This gives us two sets of equations to solve:

1. $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + (\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$
2. $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + (\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$

For the first set of equations, we have $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. This implies that $x + y = \pm 10$ and $x - y = \pm 10$. Solving these equations gives us the vertices of the square: $(8, 2), (8, -2), (-8, 2), (-8, -2)$.

For the second set of equations, we have $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$. This implies that $x = \pm 8$ and $y = \pm 8$. Solving these equations gives us the vertices of the square: $(8, 8), (8, -8), (-8, 8), (-8, -8)$.

The convex polygon formed by the union of these two sets of vertices is a square with side length $10\sqrt{2}$. The area of a square is given by the square of the length of its side, so the area of this square is $(10\sqrt{2})^2 = 200$. The answer is: $200$

Approach:


The equation $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ is true if and only if either of the two factors is zero.

This gives us two sets of equations:
1. $\vert x + y \vert - 10 = 0 \implies \vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert - 10 = 0 \implies \vert x - y \vert = 10$.
2. $\vert x \vert - 8 = 0 \implies \vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert - 8 = 0 \implies \vert y \vert = 8$.

From the first set of equations, we get $x + y = \pm 10$ and $x - y = \pm 10$. Solving these equations, we find the points $(5, 5)$, $(5, -5)$, $(-5, 5)$, and $(-5, -5)$.

From the second set of equations, we get $x = \pm 8$ and $y = \pm 8$. Solving these equations, we find the points $(8, 0)$, $(0, 8)$, $(-8, 0)$, and $(0, -8)$.

All these points form a square with side length $10$. The area of this square is $10^2 = 100$. Therefore, the area of the convex polygon is $100$. The answer is: $100$

Approach:


The given equation is a product of two expressions equal to zero. Therefore, either the first expression is zero or the second expression is zero. We will consider each case separately.

Case 1: $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$
For the sum of two squares to be zero, both squares must be zero. That is, $\vert x + y \vert - 10 = 0$ and $\vert x - y \vert - 10 = 0$. This implies that $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. The only way this can happen is if $x = y = 5$ or $x = -y = -5$. This gives us two points $(5,5)$ and $(-5,-5)$.

Case 2: $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$
Similarly, for the sum of two squares to be zero, both squares must be zero. That is, $\vert x \vert - 8 = 0$ and $\vert y \vert - 8 = 0$. This implies that $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$. The only way this can happen is if $x = 8$ or $x = -8$, and $y = 8$ or $y = -8$. This gives us four points $(8,8)$, $(8,-8)$, $(-8,8)$, and $(-8,-8)$.

Now we have a total of 4 points: $(5,5)$, $(-5,-5)$, $(8,8)$, $(8,-8)$, $(-8,8)$, and $(-8,-8)$. These points form a square with side length $10$. The area of this square is $10^2 = 100$.
The answer is: $100$

Approach:



The equation is of the form $AB = 0$, so either $A = 0$ or $B = 0$. Thus, we have two separate cases to consider:

Case 1: $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$.

This implies that $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. The solutions to these equations are all points of the form $(x, y)$ where $x = \pm 10$ or $y = \pm 10$. This forms a square with side length 20.

Case 2: $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$.

This implies that $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$, which gives us a square with side length 16.

Therefore, the area of the convex polygon is the sum of the areas of these two squares. The area of a square with side length $a$ is $a^2$, so the total area is $20^2 + 16^2 = 400 + 256 = 656$.
The answer is: 656

"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"

Approach:


The equation is of the form $f(x, y) = 0$, where $f(x, y) = ((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2)$.
The product of two numbers is zero if and only if at least one of the numbers is zero.
So, either $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$.
The first equation implies that $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$, which represent two lines parallel to the x-axis and y-axis respectively, a distance of 10 units from the origin.
The second equation implies that $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$, which represent two lines parallel to the y-axis and x-axis respectively, a distance of 8 units from the origin.
The intersection of these lines forms a square with side length 16.
The area of this square is $16^2 = 256$.
The answer is: $256$

Approach:

 The equation $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + (\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ implies that $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. This implies that $x + y = \pm 10$ and $x - y = \pm 10$. Solving these equations, we get the vertices of the polygon as $(0, 10)$, $(0, -10)$, $(10, 0)$, $(-10, 0)$, $(8, 8)$, $(8, -8)$, $(-8, 8)$, and $(-8, -8)$.

Now, the equation $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + (\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ implies that $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$, which gives us the vertices $(8, 8)$, $(8, -8)$, $(-8, 8)$, and $(-8, -8)$.

The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + (\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + (\vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a square with side length 10. Therefore, the area of the convex polygon is $10^2 = 100$.

The answer is: $100$

Assistant:

Approach:

 The given equation is a product of two terms equal to zero, so either of the terms must be zero. This gives us four cases to consider:

1. $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$, which implies $\vert x + y \vert = 10$. This is a square with side length 20, and the area is $400$.
2. $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$, which implies $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. This is also a square with side length 20, and the area is $400$.
3. $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$, which implies $\vert x \vert = 8$. This is a rectangle with length 16 and width 16, and the area is $256$.
4. $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$, which implies $\vert y \vert = 8$. This is also a rectangle with length 16 and width 16, and the area is $256$.

The intersection of these squares and rectangles forms a regular octagon. To find the area of the octagon, we can subtract the areas of the four right triangles in the corners from the area of the large square. The side length of the octagon is 10 (from the squares), and the height of the right triangles is 8 (from the rectangles). So, the area of the octagon is:

$400 - 4 \cdot \frac{1}{2} \cdot 10 \cdot 8 = 400 - 160 = 240$.

So the area of the convex polygon is 240.
The answer is: 240

Solve the following problem with a Python Script (positive numerical answer):
"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"

Approach:



The given equation is a product of two expressions equal to zero, which means either of the expressions must be zero for the entire equation to be zero. So we can break this down into two cases:

Case 1: $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$
Case 2: $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$

For Case 1, both $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2$ and $( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2$ must be zero, which implies $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. This gives us a square with side length 10, so its area is $10^2 = 100$.

For Case 2, both $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2$ and $( \vert y \vert - 8)^2$ must be zero, which implies $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$. This gives us a square with side length 8, so its area is $8^2 = 64$.

However, the intersection of the two cases is not empty. The only points that satisfy both cases are the points on the square with side length 10 (Case 1), since the square with side length 8 (Case 2) is entirely contained within the square with side length 10.

Therefore, the area of the convex polygon is the area of the square with side length 10, which is 100. The answer is: $100$
