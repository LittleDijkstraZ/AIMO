 The expression $A \cdot B = 0$ is equivalent to $A = 0$ or $B = 0$. Therefore, the given equation is satisfied if either $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$, $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$, $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$, or $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$.

From $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$, we get $\vert x + y \vert = 10$, which implies $x + y = \pm 10$.
From $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$, we get $\vert x - y \vert = 10$, which implies $x - y = \pm 10$.
From $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$, we get $\vert x \vert = 8$, which implies $x = \pm 8$.
From $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$, we get $\vert y \vert = 8$, which implies $y = \pm 8$.

The solutions to these equations are the vertices of a square with side length 16. The area of this square is $16^2 = 256$.

So, the area of the convex polygon is 256.
The answer is: $256$

 The given equation is a product of two expressions equal to zero, so it is equal to zero when either of the expressions is zero. Therefore, the points that satisfy the equation are the solutions to each of the following equations:
1. $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$
2. $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$
3. $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$
4. $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$

From equations 1 and 2, we have $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$.
From equations 3 and 4, we have $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$.

The solutions to these equations are:
1. $x + y = \pm 10$
2. $x - y = \pm 10$
3. $x = \pm 8$
4. $y = \pm 8$

The solutions to these equations form a square with side length 16. The area of this square is $16^2 = 256$. Therefore, the area of the convex polygon is 256.

The answer is: $256$

"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"

The equation $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ implies that $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. This means that $x + y = \pm 10$ and $x - y = \pm 10$. Solving these equations, we get four lines: $x + y = 10$, $x + y = -10$, $x - y = 10$, and $x - y = -10$. These lines form a rectangle with vertices at $(10, 0)$, $(-10, 0)$, $(0, 10)$, and $(0, -10)$.

Similarly, the equation $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ implies that $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$. This means that $x = \pm 8$ and $y = \pm 8$. These lines form a square with vertices at $(8, 8)$, $(8, -8)$, $(-8, 8)$, and $(-8, -8)$.

The intersection of the rectangle and the square is the convex polygon we are looking for. The vertices of this polygon are the intersection points of the lines $x + y = 10$, $x + y = -10$, $x - y = 10$, $x - y = -10$, $x = 8$, $x = -8$, $y = 8$, and $y = -8$. By calculating these intersection points, we find that the vertices of the convex polygon are $(8, 2)$, $(8, -2)$, $(-8, 2)$, and $(-8, -2)$.

The length of each side of the square is 16, and the height of the rectangle is 20. Therefore, the area of the convex polygon is the area of the square minus the area of the rectangle. The area of the square is $16^2 = 256$, and the area of the rectangle is $20 \times 16 = 320$. So the area of the convex polygon is $256 - 320 = -64$. However, the area cannot be negative, so there must be a mistake in our calculation.

Let's go back and check our work. We found the vertices of the convex polygon by finding the intersection points of the lines. However, we should have also considered the intersection points of the lines with the square and rectangle. By doing so, we find that the vertices of the convex polygon are $(8, 2)$, $(8, -2)$, $(-8, 2)$, and $(-8, -2)$ as before, but we also find that the vertices are $(10, 0)$, $(-10, 0)$, $(0, 10)$, and $(0, -10)$, which are the vertices of the rectangle. Therefore, the convex polygon is actually the rectangle.

The area of the rectangle is the product of its length and height, which is $20 \times 16 = 320$. So the area of the convex polygon is 320. The mistake in our previous calculation was that we were not considering all the intersection points of the lines with the square and rectangle.

Therefore, the area of the convex polygon is 320. The answer is: $320$.

"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"

Assistant:

 The given equation is equal to zero if and only if both factors are equal to zero. This gives us the following four equations:

1. $|x + y| - 10 = 0$
2. $|x - y| - 10 = 0$
3. $|x| - 8 = 0$
4. $|y| - 8 = 0$

From equations 3 and 4, we get $x = \pm 8$ and $y = \pm 8$.

From equations 1 and 2, we get $|x + y| = 10$ and $|x - y| = 10$. This implies that $x + y = \pm 10$ and $x - y = \pm 10$. Solving these equations, we get the following four more points: $(8, 2)$, $(8, -2)$, $(-8, 2)$, and $(-8, -2)$.

So, the vertices of the polygon are $(8, 8)$, $(8, -8)$, $(-8, 8)$, and $(-8, -8)$, $(8, 2)$, $(8, -2)$, $(-8, 2)$, and $(-8, -2)$.

The polygon is a square with side length 16. Therefore, the area of the polygon is $16^2 = 256$. The answer is: $256$

The given equation is a product of two expressions equal to zero, so either one of the expressions must be zero.

The first expression is $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)$, and it equals zero if and only if both $\vert x + y \vert - 10 = 0$ and $\vert x - y \vert - 10 = 0$. This gives us $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$.

The second expression is $((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2)$, and it equals zero if and only if both $\vert x \vert - 8 = 0$ and $\vert y \vert - 8 = 0$. This gives us $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$.

Solving these equations, we find that the points that satisfy the equations are all the points in a square with side length 16 centered at the origin. The area of this square is $16^2 = 256$. So the area of the convex polygon is 256.
