"For how many positive integers $m$ does the equation \[\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}\] have $4$ distinct solutions?"

Assistant:

 To analyze this problem, we need to understand the graph of the function $f(x) = \vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert$. This function is a "V" shape with two "hills" and four segments, each segment a line of slope $\pm 1$. The function $f(x)$ is zero at $x = -1, 3, 5, 7$. The equation $f(x) = \frac{m}{100}$ therefore has four solutions for $m$ in the interval from $0$ to $100$. Therefore, $m$ can be any of the integers from $1$ to $100$. However, the problem asks for the number of positive integers $m$ for which the equation has exactly four distinct solutions. This happens when $m = 1$. Therefore, there is only one value of $m$ for which the equation has exactly four distinct solutions, so the answer is $1$.

Assistant:

 The given equation is a piecewise function with four cases, which depends on the value of $x$. We can analyze each case and find the number of positive integer solutions for $m$.

Case 1: $x-1 > 2$, i.e., $x > 3$. The equation becomes $\vert x-1 -2 \vert = \frac{m}{100}$, or $\vert x-3 \vert = \frac{m}{100}$. This further breaks into two sub-cases:
- If $x-3 > 0$, i.e., $x > 3$, then $x-3 = \frac{m}{100}$, or $x = \frac{m}{100} + 3$.
- If $x-3 < 0$, i.e., $x < 3$, then $-(x-3) = \frac{m}{100}$, or $x = 3 - \frac{m}{100}$.

Case 2: $1 \leq x \leq 3$. The equation becomes $\vert x-1 -2 \vert = \frac{m}{100}$, or $\vert x-3 \vert = \frac{m}{100}$. This further breaks into two sub-cases:
- If $x-3 > 0$, i.e., $x > 3$, then $x-3 = \frac{m}{100}$, or $x = \frac{m}{100} + 3$. But this case is not possible because $1 \leq x \leq 3$.
- If $x-3 < 0$, i.e., $x < 3$, then $-(x-3) = \frac{m}{100}$, or $x = 3 - \frac{m}{100}$.

Case 3: $x-1 < -2$, i.e., $x < -1$. The equation becomes $\vert -(x-1) -2 \vert = \frac{m}{100}$, or $\vert -x+1 -2 \vert = \frac{m}{100}$, or $\vert -x-1 \vert = \frac{m}{100}$. This further breaks into two sub-cases:
- If $-x-1 > 0$, i.e., $x < -1$, then $-x-1 = \frac{m}{100}$, or $x = -\frac{m}{100} - 1$.
- If $-x-1 < 0$, i.e., $x > -1$, then $-(x+1) = \frac{m}{100}$, or $x = -\frac{m}{100} - 1$. But this case is not possible because $x < -1$.

Case 4: $x-1 > -2$, i.e., $x > -1$. The equation becomes $\vert x-1 -2 \vert = \frac{m}{100}$, or $\vert x-3 \vert = \frac{m}{100}$. This further breaks into two sub-cases:
- If $x-3 > 0$, i.e., $x > 3$, then $x-3 = \frac{m}{100}$, or $x = \frac{m}{100} + 3$. But this case is not possible because $x > -1$.
- If $x-3 < 0$, i.e., $x < 3$, then $-(x-3) = \frac{m}{100}$, or $x = 3 - \frac{m}{100}$. This is the only possible case.

Therefore, the equation has four distinct solutions if $0 < \frac{m}{100} < 2$, or $0 < m < 200$. The positive integers $m$ that satisfy this condition are the integers from $1$ to $199$. The number of such integers is $199$.
The answer is: $199$

Assistant:

 The number of distinct solutions to the equation $|\vert x-1 \vert -2|=\frac{m}{100}$ is equal to 4 when $\frac{m}{100}=2$. This is because the expression inside the absolute value, $\vert x-1 \vert -2$, changes its sign twice when $x$ varies from $0$ to $4$.

To find the value of $m$, we simply multiply both sides of the equation $\frac{m}{100}=2$ by $100$ to obtain $m=200$.
The value of $m$ that satisfies the equation is $200$. The answer is: $\boxed{200}$

Assistant:


This problem is a bit tricky, and it may be easier to understand visually. The equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ describes a "wavy" function that has four distinct solutions if and only if $\frac{m}{100}$ is between $1$ and $2$. This means $1 \leq \frac{m}{100} < 2$, or equivalently, $100 \leq m < 200$.
The number of positive integers in this range is simply the difference of the largest and smallest integers plus one (the "+1" is because both endpoints are included), so the number of positive integers $m$ for which the equation has four distinct solutions is $200 - 100 + 1 = 101$. The answer is: 101.

Assistant:

 To solve this problem, we first need to understand the nature of the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$. This equation has 4 distinct solutions if and only if $\frac{m}{100}$ is strictly between 1 and 2. This is because the function $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert$ oscillates between 1 and 2 as $x$ varies. Therefore, we have $1 < \frac{m}{100} < 2$, which gives $100 < m < 200$. The number of positive integers $m$ in this range is $200 - 100 - 1 = 99$.

Below is a math problem you are to solve (positive numerical answer!):
"For how many positive integers $m$ does the equation \[\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}\] have $4$ distinct solutions?"

Assistant:

 The problem asks for the number of positive integers $m$ such that the equation $| |x-1| - 2| = \frac{m}{100}$ has 4 distinct solutions.
The right-hand side of the equation, $\frac{m}{100}$, is always positive. This means that the absolute value on the left-hand side, $| |x-1| - 2|$, must also be positive. Therefore, $|x-1| - 2$ must be greater than 0, which implies $|x-1| > 2$. This means that $x-1 > 2$ or $x-1 < -2$. The solutions to these inequalities are $x > 3$ and $x < -1$.
Now, let's consider the two cases separately:
Case 1: $x > 3$. In this case, $|x-1| = x-1$, so the equation becomes $|x-1 - 2| = \frac{m}{100}$, which simplifies to $|x-3| = \frac{m}{100}$. This equation has two solutions $x = 3 + \frac{m}{100}$ and $x = 3 - \frac{m}{100}$. To have 4 distinct solutions, we need the second solution to be distinct from the first solution. This implies $3 - \frac{m}{100} \neq 3 + \frac{m}{100}$, or $\frac{m}{100} \neq \frac{m}{100}$. This is a contradiction, so there are no solutions in this case.
Case 2: $x < -1$. In this case, $|x-1| = -(x-1) = 1-x$, so the equation becomes $|1-x - 2| = \frac{m}{100}$, which simplifies to $|x+1| = \frac{m}{100}$. This equation has two solutions $x = -1 - \frac{m}{100}$ and $x = -1 + \frac{m}{100}$. To have 4 distinct solutions, we need the second solution to be distinct from the first solution. This implies $-1 + \frac{m}{100} \neq -1 - \frac{m}{100}$, or $\frac{m}{100} \neq -\frac{m}{100}$. This is true, so we need to find the values of $m$ such that $-1 + \frac{m}{100} > -1 - \frac{m}{100}$. This simplifies to $\frac{m}{100} > -\frac{m}{100}$, or $m > 0$. Since $m$ is a positive integer, the possible values of $m$ are 1, 2, ..., 100.
Therefore, the number of positive integers $m$ such that the equation $| |x-1| - 2| = \frac{m}{100}$ has 4 distinct solutions is 100.
The answer is: $100$

Assistant:

 To solve this problem, we need to analyze the equation \[\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}\] and find for how many positive integers $m$ it has $4$ distinct solutions.

First, let's consider the right-hand side of the equation, $\frac{m}{100}$. This value must be positive, so $m$ must be positive. Also, since the left-hand side of the equation, $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert$, is always between $0$ and $2$, we must have $\frac{m}{100} \leq 2$. Therefore, $m \leq 200$.

Next, we need to find the number of positive integers $m$ such that the equation has $4$ distinct solutions. This equation is a combination of two absolute values, so it can be rewritten as a piecewise function. Let's analyze the possible cases:

1. If $\vert x-1 \vert - 2 = \frac{m}{100}$, then $\vert x-1 \vert = \frac{m}{100} + 2$. This gives us two cases:
   a) $x-1 = \frac{m}{100} + 2$ when $x-1 \geq 0$, or
   b) $-(x-1) = \frac{m}{100} + 2$ when $x-1 < 0$.
2. If $\vert x-1 \vert - 2 = -\frac{m}{100}$, then $\vert x-1 \vert = 2 - \frac{m}{100}$. This gives us two cases:
   c) $x-1 = 2 - \frac{m}{100}$ when $x-1 \geq 0$, or
   d) $-(x-1) = 2 - \frac{m}{100}$ when $x-1 < 0$.

Each of these cases gives a quadratic equation in $x$. The number of solutions to a quadratic equation is $2$, $1$, or $0$ depending on the discriminant. By analyzing the discriminant of each case, we can find the values of $m$ for which the equation has $4$ distinct solutions.

After analyzing all cases, we find that the equation \[\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}\] has $4$ distinct solutions for $m = 100, 200$. Therefore, there are $2$ positive integers $m$ that satisfy the condition.

Therefore, the number of positive integers $m$ such that the equation \[\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}\] has $4$ distinct solutions is $2$.
The answer is: $2$

Assistant:

 The equation $| |x - 1| - 2 | = \frac{m}{100}$ has 4 distinct solutions when $\frac{m}{100} = 2$.
Therefore, we need to solve the equation $| |x - 1| - 2 | = 2$.
This equation breaks down into two cases:
1. $|x - 1| - 2 = 2$
2. $|x - 1| - 2 = -2$
For the first case, $|x - 1| = 4$. This breaks down into two sub-cases:
1.1. $x - 1 = 4$, so $x = 5$.
1.2. $x - 1 = -4$, so $x = -3$.
For the second case, $|x - 1| = 0$. This breaks down into one sub-case:
2.1. $x - 1 = 0$, so $x = 1$.
Therefore, the solutions are $x = -3, 1, 5$.
We are asked to find the value of $m$ such that the equation has 4 distinct solutions.
Since $\frac{m}{100} = 2$, we have $m = 200$.
Therefore, the value of $m$ that makes the equation have 4 distinct solutions is $200$. The answer is: $200$

 To find the value of $m$ for which the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has 4 distinct solutions, we can analyze the piecewise function of the left-hand side of the equation:

For $x \geq 3$, we have $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert = \vert x - 3 \vert$. So the equation becomes $\vert x - 3 \vert = \frac{m}{100}$. This has two solutions when $0 < \frac{m}{100} < 3-1$, or $0 < m < 200$.

For $1 < x < 3$, we have $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert = 2 - x$. So the equation becomes $2 - x = \frac{m}{100}$. This has two solutions when $0 < \frac{m}{100} < 2 - x$, or $0 < m < 200 - 100x$.

For $x \leq 1$, we have $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert = 3 - x$. So the equation becomes $3 - x = \frac{m}{100}$. This has two solutions when $0 < \frac{m}{100} < 3 - 1$, or $0 < m < 200$.

So the value of $m$ for which the equation has 4 distinct solutions is when the two inequalities $0 < m < 200 - 100x$ and $0 < m < 200$ intersect. This happens when $1 < x < 3$, and in this case, the intersection is the interval $0 < m < 100$. So the number of positive integers $m$ that satisfy the equation is $100$. The answer is: $100$

This problem involves understanding the behavior of the absolute value function and finding the number of solutions to an equation.
The graph of $y = |x - 1| - 2$ is a V-shape with the vertex at $(1, -2)$.
The graph of $y = \left| |x - 1| - 2 \right|$ is a "double V-shape", where the "inner V" is shifted 2 units downwards from the "outer V".
The graph of $y = \left| |x - 1| - 2 \right| - \frac{m}{100}$ is a vertical shift of the "double V" downward by $\frac{m}{100}$.
We want the number of distinct solutions to be 4.
This happens when the "inner V" and the "outer V" cross the line $y = \frac{m}{100}$ in different places.
From the graph, we can see that this happens when $\frac{m}{100}$ is between 1 and 2 (exclusive), i.e., $1 < \frac{m}{100} < 2$.
Multiplying all sides of the inequalities by 100 gives $100 < m < 200$.
The positive integers $m$ that satisfy this inequality are the integers from 101 to 199, inclusive.
To find the number of these integers, we subtract the smallest possible value from the largest possible value and add 1.
So the number of positive integers $m$ for which the equation has 4 distinct solutions is $199 - 101 + 1 = 99$.
The value of $m$ can be any of the 99 positive integers from 101 to 199. The answer is: $99$

 To solve this problem, we need to analyze the number of solutions for the given equation. The equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has 4 distinct solutions.
Let's consider the possible values of $m$:
1. If $m=1$, the equation becomes $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{1}{100}$. The number of solutions for this equation is 4. So, $m=1$ is a valid value.
2. If $m>1$, the value of $\frac{m}{100}$ increases, and the number of solutions for the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ decreases. 
So, there is only one possible value of $m$, which is $1$. The answer is: 1
