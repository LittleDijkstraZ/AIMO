Below is a math problem you are to solve (positive numerical answer!):
"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"
Analyze this problem and think step by step to come to a solution with programs. After solving the problem, output the final numerical answer within \boxed{}.

Assistant:

 The problem states that the equation $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ encloses a convex polygon.
The only way for the product of two numbers to be zero is if one or both of the numbers are zero. Therefore, either $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2) = 0$ or $((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$.
The equation $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2) = 0$ implies that $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. This represents a square with side length 20.
The equation $((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ implies that $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$. This represents a square with side length 16.
Therefore, the convex polygon is the union of these two squares, and its area is the sum of the areas of the two squares. The area of a square is given by side length squared, so the area of the larger square is $20^2 = 400$ and the area of the smaller square is $16^2 = 256$.
Therefore, the area of the convex polygon is $400 + 256 = 656$.

Below is a math problem you are to solve (positive numerical answer!):
"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"
Analyze this problem and think step by step to come to a solution with programs. After solving the problem, output the final numerical answer within \boxed{}.

Assistant:

 The expression $A \cdot B = 0$ is true if and only if at least one of $A$ or $B$ is zero. Thus, the given equation is satisfied if and only if at least one of the following two conditions is true:

1. $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$
2. $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$

For the first condition to be true, we must have $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. This implies that $x + y = \pm 10$ and $x - y = \pm 10$. Solving these equations gives us the vertices of the square: $(8, 2)$, $(8, -2)$, $(-8, -2)$, and $(-8, 2)$.

For the second condition to be true, we must have $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$. This implies that $x = \pm 8$ and $y = \pm 8$. Solving these equations gives us the vertices of the square: $(8, 8)$, $(8, -8)$, $(-8, -8)$, and $(-8, 8)$.

Combining these two sets of vertices, we see that the points encloses a 8x8 square. The area of this square is $8^2 = 64$. Therefore, the area of the convex polygon is 64 square units. The answer is: $64$

"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"
Analyze this problem and think step by step to come to a solution with programs. After solving the problem, output the final numerical answer within \boxed{}.

Assistant:

 The given equation is of the form $AB = 0$, where $A$ and $B$ are two expressions. For the product of two numbers to be zero, at least one of them must be zero. Therefore, we have two cases to consider:

1. $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + (\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$.
2. $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + (\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$.

For the first case, we have $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ and $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$. This implies that $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. This forms a square with side length 10.

For the second case, we have $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ and $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$. This implies that $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$. This forms a square with side length 16.

The points satisfying the given equation are those that satisfy either case 1 or case 2. Therefore, the convex polygon is the union of these two squares. The area of this polygon is the sum of the areas of the two squares.

The area of a square with side length $s$ is $s^2$. Therefore, the area of the first square (side length 10) is $10^2 = 100$, and the area of the second square (side length 16) is $16^2 = 256$. The sum of these two areas gives the area of the convex polygon: $100 + 256 = 356$.
The answer is: $356$

Analyze this problem and think step by step to come to a solution with programs. After solving the problem, output the final numerical answer within \boxed{}.

Assistant:

 The given equation is a product of two expressions equal to zero, so it must be the case that either the first expression is zero or the second expression is zero.

The first expression is $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)$. For this expression to be zero, it must be the case that both $\vert x + y \vert - 10 = 0$ and $\vert x - y \vert - 10 = 0$. This implies that $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. The only way both of these equations can hold true is if $x = y = 5$ or $x = -y = -5$. This gives us two points: $(5,5)$ and $(-5,-5)$.

The second expression is $((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2)$. For this expression to be zero, it must be the case that both $\vert x \vert - 8 = 0$ and $\vert y \vert - 8 = 0$. This implies that $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$. The only way both of these equations can hold true is if $x = 8$ or $x = -8$ and $y = 8$ or $y = -8$. This gives us four points: $(8,8)$, $(8,-8)$, $(-8,8)$, and $(-8,-8)$.

Putting these points together, we see that the polygon is a square with side length $10$. The area of a square is given by side length squared, so the area of the polygon is $10^2 = 100$. The answer is: $100$

Assistant:

 The equation is satisfied if and only if both of the factors are equal to zero.
The first factor is equal to zero if and only if $|x + y| = 10$ or $|x - y| = 10$.
The second factor is equal to zero if and only if $|x| = 8$ or $|y| = 8$.
The solutions to $|x + y| = 10$ are the lines $y = -x + 10$ and $y = -x - 10$.
The solutions to $|x - y| = 10$ are the lines $y = x + 10$ and $y = x - 10$.
The solutions to $|x| = 8$ are the lines $x = 8$ and $x = -8$.
The solutions to $|y| = 8$ are the lines $y = 8$ and $y = -8$.
Plotting these lines, we find that the points satisfying the equation form a square with side length 20. The area of this square is $20^2 = 400$. The answer is: 400.

Assistant:


The equation $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + (\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ implies that $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. This gives us four equations: $x + y = 10$, $x + y = -10$, $x - y = 10$, and $x - y = -10$. Solving these equations, we find the vertices of the polygon: $(8,2)$, $(8,-2)$, $(-8,2)$, and $(-8,-2)$.
The equation $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + (\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ implies that $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$. This gives us four more vertices: $(8,8)$, $(8,-8)$, $(-8,8)$, and $(-8,-8)$.
The eight vertices form a square with side length $16$. The area of this square is $16^2 = 256$.

Assistant:



The expression $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2$ equals to $0$ if and only if both $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. These two equations represent two squares of side length 10, one with slope 1 and the other with slope -1.

Similarly, $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ if and only if both $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$, which represents a square of side length 16.

The intersection of these two conditions is the square formed by the intersection of the two squares of side length 10 and the square of side length 16. This square has side length 8.

The area of this square is $8^2 = 64$.

So, the area of the convex polygon is 64.
The answer is: $64$

The given equation is a product of two expressions equal to zero, so either one of the expressions must be zero for the product to be zero. That means either $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$.

For the first expression to be zero, we must have $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. This implies that $x + y = \pm 10$ and $x - y = \pm 10$, which gives us four lines in the coordinate plane.

For the second expression to be zero, we must have $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$. This implies that $x = \pm 8$ and $y = \pm 8$, which gives us four lines in the coordinate plane.

"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"
Analyze this problem and think step by step to come to a solution with programs. After solving the problem, output the final numerical answer within \boxed{}.

Assistant:

 The problem statement mentions that the points satisfying the equation enclose a convex polygon. The only way for the product of two numbers to be zero is if at least one of the numbers is zero. Therefore, either $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$, $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$, $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$, or $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$.

For $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$, we have $\vert x + y \vert = 10$, which means $x + y = \pm 10$. Similarly, for $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$, we have $\vert x - y \vert = 10$, which means $x - y = \pm 10$. For $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$, we have $\vert x \vert = 8$, which means $x = \pm 8$. And for $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$, we have $\vert y \vert = 8$, which means $y = \pm 8$.

This gives us a total of 8 lines: $x + y = \pm 10$, $x - y = \pm 10$, $x = \pm 8$, and $y = \pm 8$. The intersection points of these lines form a square with side length 10, because the lines $x + y = \pm 10$ and $x - y = \pm 10$ form a square with side length 10 centered at the origin, and the lines $x = \pm 8$ and $y = \pm 8$ just adjust the position of the square.

The area of the square is the side length squared, which is $10^2 = 100$. Therefore, the area of the convex polygon is 100 square units. The answer is: 100

Assistant:

 The equation $A \cdot B = 0$ is satisfied if and only if $A = 0$ or $B = 0$. Therefore, the given equation is satisfied if and only if either $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$.

If $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$, then both $\vert x + y \vert - 10 = 0$ and $\vert x - y \vert - 10 = 0$, which means $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. This is the equation of a square with side length 20.

If $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$, then both $\vert x \vert - 8 = 0$ and $\vert y \vert - 8 = 0$, which means $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$. This is the equation of a square with side length 16.

The area of the convex polygon is the sum of the areas of these two squares. The area of a square with side length $a$ is $a^2$, so the area of the first square is $20^2 = 400$ and the area of the second square is $16^2 = 256$. Therefore, the total area of the convex polygon is $400 + 256 = 656$. The answer is: $656$

Assistant:


The equation $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + (\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + (\vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ is satisfied only if both of the factors are zero. This means that either $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + (\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2) = 0$ or $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + (\vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$.

The first factor is zero if $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. This means that the points $(x, y)$ lie on the lines $x + y = 10$ and $x - y = 10$.

The second factor is zero if $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$. This means that the points $(x, y)$ lie on the lines $x = 8$ and $y = 8$.

The intersection of these lines forms a square with side length 10, as shown below:

[asy]
size(200);
draw((0,0)--(10,0)--(10,10)--(0,10)--cycle);
draw((0,0)--(0,8)--(8,8)--(8,0),dotted);
[/asy]

The area of this square is $10^2 = 100$. So the area of the convex polygon is 100 square units. The answer is: $100$.

 The given equation is a product of two terms equal to zero, so either the first term is zero or the second term is zero.

The first term is $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)$. This term is zero if and only if both $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. This gives us a square with side length 20, so its area is $20^2 = 400$.

The second term is $((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2)$. This term is zero if and only if both $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$, which gives us a square with side length 16, so its area is $16^2 = 256$.

However, the intersection of the two squares is a smaller square with side length 8 and area $8^2 = 64$. To find the area of the convex polygon, we need to sum the areas of the two squares and subtract the area of their intersection.

So the area of the convex polygon is $400 + 256 - 64 = 592$. The answer is: $592$

 To solve this problem, we need to first understand the equation and then analyze the points that satisfy the equation.

The equation is $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$. For the product of two numbers to be zero, one of them must be zero. Therefore, we have two cases:

1. $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ or
2. $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$.

In the first case, $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$, it implies that $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. This is the equation of a square with side length $10\sqrt{2}$ and diagonals $20$.

In the second case, $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$, it implies that $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$. This is the equation of a square with side length $16$ and diagonals $16\sqrt{2}$.

Therefore, the convex polygon formed by the points that satisfy the equation is the union of these two squares. The area of the convex polygon is the sum of the areas of the two squares.

The area of a square is given by the formula $s^2$, where $s$ is the side length of the square. So the area of the first square is $(10\sqrt{2})^2 = 200$ and the area of the second square is $(16)^2 = 256$. The total area of the convex polygon is $200 + 256 = 456$.

So the area of the convex polygon is $456$. The answer is: $456$

This problem might seem complex at first, but it's actually a bit of a trick question. The equation $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ is satisfied only when both $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2$ and $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2$ are zero, and also both $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2$ and $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2$ are zero. This happens only when $x = \pm 8$ and $y = \pm 8$. In other words, the points that satisfy the equation are just the four corners of a square with side length 16. The area of this square is therefore $16^2 = 256$.

So the area of the convex polygon is 256.

Since this is a multiple-choice question, the answer is: $256$. The answer is: $256$.
