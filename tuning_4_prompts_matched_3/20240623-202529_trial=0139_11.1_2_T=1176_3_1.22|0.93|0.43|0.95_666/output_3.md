Solve the following problem with a Python Script (positive numerical answer):
"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"
Write comments to indicate the steps you take. Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Approach:


The equation $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ implies that $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$.

The equation $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ implies that $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$.

Combining these results, we have a square with side length 16. The area of this square is $16^2 = 256$. So the area of the convex polygon is $256$.

The answer is: $256$

We know that the product of two numbers is zero if and only if at least one of the numbers is zero. Therefore, we can break down the given equation into two separate equations and solve them individually:

1. $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$
2. $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$

For the first equation, both $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2$ and $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2$ need to be equal to zero, which implies that $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. This forms a square with side length of 20 units.

For the second equation, both $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2$ and $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2$ need to be equal to zero, which implies that $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$. This forms a square with side length of 16 units.

To find the area of the convex polygon, we add the areas of the two squares. The area of a square is given by the square of the length of its side.

The area of the larger square is $20^2 = 400$ square units, and the area of the smaller square is $16^2 = 256$ square units.

Adding the two areas together gives the total area of the convex polygon: $400 + 256 = 656$ square units.

Therefore, the area of the convex polygon is 656 square units.
The answer is: $656$

To solve the problem, we first recognize that the given equation equals zero, which implies that one of the factors must be zero. This gives us two sets of absolute value equations to solve:
1. $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ and $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ and $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$.
2. $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$

For each of these equations, we set the absolute value expressions equal to zero and solve for $x$ and $y$. This gives us the vertices of the polygon. Then, we can use the Shoelace formula to compute the area of the polygon.

After solving the equations and determining the vertices of the polygon, we find that the polygon is a square with side length 16. The area of a square is simply the side length squared, so the area of the convex polygon is $16^2 = 256$.

```python


INTERMEDIATE OUT :

def square_area():
    side_length = 16
    area = side_length ** 2
    return area

result = square_area()
print(result)
```

CODE RESULTS 256

INTERMEDIATE OUT :
```output
256
```
The area of the convex polygon is 256 square units. The answer is $\boxed{256}$.

Solve the following problem with a Python Script (positive numerical answer):
"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"

Approach:


First, we can observe that the product of two numbers is zero if and only if at least one of the numbers is zero. Therefore, we have two separate cases to consider:
1. $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2) = 0$ or
2. $((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$

For the first case, $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$, we can only satisfy this equation if both terms are zero. That is, $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. The solutions to these two equations are the lines $x + y = 10$, $x + y = -10$, $x - y = 10$, and $x - y = -10$.

For the second case, $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$, we can only satisfy this equation if both terms are zero. That is, $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$. The solutions to these two equations are the lines $x = 8$, $x = -8$, $y = 8$, and $y = -8$.

These lines form a square with side length 10 (the distance between the lines $x + y = 10$ and $x + y = -10$). The area of this square is $10^2 = 100$.

So the area of the convex polygon is 100. The answer is: $100$

Approach:

 The equation $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + (\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ implies that $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. Solving these two equations separately gives the vertices of the square with side length 20: $(10, 0)$, $(0, 10)$, $(-10, 0)$, and $(0, -10)$.

Similarly, the equation $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + (\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ implies that $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$, giving the vertices of the square with side length 16: $(8, 0)$, $(0, 8)$, $(-8, 0)$, and $(0, -8)$.

However, the intersection of the two regions is empty, as the side lengths of the squares are different. Thus, the only possible area of the convex polygon is the sum of the areas of the two squares.

Calculate the area of each square: The area of the square with side length 20 is $20^2 = 400$, and the area of the square with side length 16 is $16^2 = 256$.

Therefore, the area of the convex polygon is $400 + 256 = 656$.
The answer is: $656$

Solve the following problem with a Python Script (positive numerical answer):
"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"

Approach:


The equation $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ implies $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$.
The equation $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ implies $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$.

From $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x \vert = 8$, we get the following four cases:

1. $x + y = 10$ and $x = 8$, which gives $y = 2$.
2. $x + y = 10$ and $x = -8$, which gives $y = 18$.
3. $-(x + y) = 10$ and $x = 8$, which gives $y = -18$.
4. $-(x + y) = 10$ and $x = -8$, which gives $y = -2$.

Similarly, from $\vert x - y \vert = 10$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$, we get the following four cases:

1. $x - y = 10$ and $y = 8$, which gives $x = 18$.
2. $x - y = 10$ and $y = -8$, which gives $x = 2$.
3. $-(x - y) = 10$ and $y = 8$, which gives $x = -2$.
4. $-(x - y) = 10$ and $y = -8$, which gives $x = -18$.

Combining the four cases for each equation, we get the vertices of the polygon as:

$(8, 2)$, $(8, -18)$, $(-8, -18)$, $(-8, -2)$, $(18, 8)$, $(18, 2)$, $(-18, 2)$, $(-18, -8)$.

The polygon is a square with side length $20$. Therefore, its area is $20^2 = 400$.
The answer is: $\boxed{400}$

"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"

Approach:


The equation given is a product of two terms, which is zero if and only if at least one of the terms is zero. This gives us two sets of equations: 

1. $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ and $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ and $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$.
2. $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ and $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ and $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$.

From these sets of equations, we can deduce that the points that satisfy the equation are the points where each of the absolute value expressions equals 10 or 8. This results in a square of side length 16, and the square of side length 20.

Now, we find the intersection of these two squares. The square of side length 20 is completely inside the square of side length 16, so the only points of intersection are on the vertices of the square of side length 16.

The area of a square is side length squared, so the area of the convex polygon is the area of the square of side length 16, which is $16^2 = 256$.
The answer is $\boxed{256}$.
