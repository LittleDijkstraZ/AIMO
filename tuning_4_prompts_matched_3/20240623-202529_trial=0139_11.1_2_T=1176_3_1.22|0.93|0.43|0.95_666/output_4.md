Approach:



We will first try to find the value of $f(1)$ using the second equation of the problem. Setting $n = 1$ in the second equation, we get $f(2) = 2f(1) + 1$. Then, setting $n = f(1)$ in the first equation, we get $f(f(f(1))) = 8f(1) - 7$. Since $f(f(f(1))) = f(f(2)) = f(2f(1) + 1)$, we can substitute the value of $f(2)$ into this equation to get $f(2f(1) + 1) = 8f(1) - 7$.

We also know that $f(2) = 2f(1) + 1$, so we can substitute this into the previous equation to get $f(2f(1) + 1) = 8f(1) - 7 = 2f(2) + 1$. This simplifies to $8f(1) - 7 = 2(2f(1) + 1) + 1$. Expanding the right side and simplifying, we get $8f(1) - 7 = 4f(1) + 3$, which simplifies further to $4f(1) = 10$, and finally, $f(1) = \frac{5}{2}$. However, this is a contradiction since $f(1)$ must be a positive integer.

This indicates that our assumption about finding $f(1)$ using the second equation may be incorrect. Instead, we will try to find a pattern or relation between $f(n)$ and $n$. Let's substitute $f(1)$ with $x$ and see what we can find.

The first equation becomes $f(f(f(x))) = 8x - 7$. For $x = 1$, this equation becomes $f(f(f(1))) = 8 - 7$, so $f(f(f(1))) = 1$.

From the second equation, we have $f(2) = 2f(1) + 1 = 2x + 1$. Let's set $x = 2$, then $f(2) = 2*2 + 1 = 5$. 

Then $f(f(f(2))) = f(f(5)) = f(f(2*2+1)) = f(f(5)) = 8*2 - 7 = 9$. 

Now we have found $f(f(5)) = 9$. According to the second equation, $f(10) = 2*f(5) + 1 = 2*9 + 1 = 19$. 

Therefore, $f(100) = 2*f(50) + 1$. 

Continuing this pattern, we find $f(50) = 2*f(25) + 1 = 2*(2*f(12.5) + 1) + 1 = 2*(2*(2*f(6.25) + 1) + 1) + 1 = 2*(2*(2*(2*f(3.125) + 1) + 1) + 1) + 1$.

Since $f(x)$ maps from natural numbers to natural numbers and $3.125$ is not a natural number, we must have reached a point where $x$ is a power of 2. Let's start from $x=4$:

$f(4) = 2*f(2) + 1 = 2*(2*f(1) + 1) + 1 = 2*(2*(2*f(0.5) + 1) + 1) + 1 = 2*(2*(2*1 + 1) + 1) + 1 = 2*(2*(3) + 1) + 1 = 2*(7) + 1 = 15$.

Now we can continue with $f(50)$:

$f(50) = 2*f(25) + 1 = 2*(2*f(12.5) + 1) + 1 = 2*(2*(2*f(6.25) + 1) + 1) + 1 = 2*(2*(2*(2*f(3.125) + 1) + 1) + 1) = 2*(2*(2*(2*f(1.5625) + 1) + 1) + 1) = 2*(2*(2*(2*(2*f(0.78125) + 1) + 1) + 1) + 1) = 2*(2*(2*(2*(2*1 + 1) + 1) + 1) + 1) = 2*(2*(2*(3) + 1) + 1) + 1 = 2*(2*(7) + 1) + 1 = 2*(15) + 1 = 31$.

Finally, $f(100) = 2*f(50) + 1 = 2*31 + 1 = 63$.
So, the value of $f(100)$ is 63. The answer is: $63$

Approach:


We can approach this problem by substituting $n = 100$ into the second condition $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$. This will give us an equation with $f(100)$ which we can solve for.

Step 1: Substitute $n = 100$ into $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$ to get $f(200) = 2f(100) + 1$.

Step 2: Substitute $n = 50$ into the same equation to get $f(100) = 2f(50) + 1$.

Step 3: Substitute $n = 25$ into the same equation to get $f(50) = 2f(25) + 1$.

Step 4: Substitute $n = 12.5$ (which is not a valid input for a function defined on natural numbers) into the equation, we need to find a way to express $f(25)$ in terms of $f(12.5)$ using the first condition $f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$. Let $x = f(12.5)$, then $f(f(f(12.5))) = 8*12.5 - 7 = 100$. Also, $f(f(f(12.5))) = f(f(x)) = f(y) = z$, where $y = f(x)$, and $z = f(y)$. Thus, we have $z = 100$, and by the first equation, we have $f(f(x)) = 8*12.5 - 7 = 100$, so $f(y) = 100$.

Step 5: Substitute $y = f(x)$ into the equation $f(y) = 100$ to get $f(f(x)) = 100$. By the first equation, we have $f(f(x)) = 8x - 7$, so we have $8x - 7 = 100$, and solving for $x$ gives $x = 12.75$, but this is not a valid input for a function defined on natural numbers. This is likely due to a mistake in our reasoning, so let's go back and retrace our steps.

Upon revisiting the steps, we realize that our mistake was when we substituted $n = 12.5$ into the first condition. In the original problem statement, the function $f$ is defined on natural numbers, so we cannot directly apply the first condition to $n = 12.5$. However, we can still use the second condition iteratively to express $f(25)$ in terms of $f(100)$. From $f(50) = 2f(25) + 1$, we have $f(25) = \frac{f(50) - 1}{2}$. From $f(100) = 2f(50) + 1$, we can solve for $f(50)$ to get $f(50) = \frac{f(100) - 1}{2}$. Substituting this into the equation for $f(25)$ gives $f(25) = \frac{(\frac{f(100) - 1}{2}) - 1}{2} = \frac{f(100) - 3}{4}$.

Step 6: Substitute $f(25) = \frac{f(100) - 3}{4}$ into the equation $f(50) = 2f(25) + 1$ to get $f(50) = 2*\frac{f(100) - 3}{4} + 1 = \frac{f(100) - 3}{2} + 1 = \frac{f(100) + 1}{2}$.

Step 7: Substitute $f(50) = \frac{f(100) + 1}{2}$ into the equation $f(100) = 2f(50) + 1$ to get $f(100) = 2*\frac{f(100) + 1}{2} + 1 = f(100) + 1 + 1 = f(100) + 2$.

Step 8: Solving the equation $f(100) = f(100) + 2$ gives $0 = 2$, which is a contradiction. This means that our initial assumption of using the first condition with $n = 12.5$ is incorrect. Instead, let's go back to Step 4 and try to express $f(25)$ in terms of $f(100)$ using the second condition iteratively.

Step 4 (revisited): From $f(50) = 2f(25) + 1$, we can solve for $f(25)$ to get $f(25) = \frac{f(50) - 1}{2}$. From $f(100) = 2f(50) + 1$, we can solve for $f(50)$ to get $f(50) = \frac{f(100) - 1}{2}$. Substituting this into the equation for $f(25)$ gives $f(25) = \frac{(\frac{f(100) - 1}{2}) - 1}{2} = \frac{f(100) - 3}{4}$.

Step 9: Substitute $f(25) = \frac{f(100) - 3}{4}$ into the equation $f(50) = 2f(25) + 1$ to get $f(50) = 2*\frac{f(100) - 3}{4} + 1 = \frac{f(100) - 3}{2} + 1 = \frac{f(100) + 1}{2}$.

Step 10: Substitute $f(50) = \frac{f(100) + 1}{2}$ into the equation $f(100) = 2f(50) + 1$ to get $f(100) = 2*\frac{f(100) + 1}{2} + 1 = f(100) + 1 + 1 = f(100) + 2$.

Step 11: Solving the equation $f(100) = f(100) + 2$ gives $0 = 2$, which is a contradiction. This means that our initial assumption of using the first condition with $n = 12.5$ is incorrect. Let's go back to Step 5 and try to express $f(25)$ in terms of $f

Approach:


We can start by calculating some small values of $f(n)$ using the given conditions to see if we can find a pattern or identify a function that satisfies the conditions. 

For $n=1$, we have $f(f(f(1)))=8(1)-7=1$, so $f(f(1))=1$, and then $f(1)=1$.

For $n=2$, we have $f(f(f(2)))=8(2)-7=9$, and using $f(1)=1$, we get $f(f(2))=9$, so $f(2)=3$ (since $2(1)+1=3$).

For $n=3$, we have $f(f(f(3)))=8(3)-7=17$, and using $f(2)=3$, we get $f(f(3))=17$, so $f(3)=9$ (since $2(3)+1=7$, but this doesn't fit the pattern, something might be wrong). 

However, we also have $f(f(f(1)))=1$, so $f(f(1))=1$, and then $f(1)=1$. 

For $n=2$, we have $f(f(f(2)))=8(2)-7=9$, and using $f(1)=1$, we get $f(f(2))=9$, so $f(2)=3$ (since $2(1)+1=3$).

For $n=3$, we have $f(f(f(3)))=8(3)-7=17$, and using $f(2)=3$, we get $f(f(3))=17$, so $f(3)=9$ (since $2(3)+1=7$).

With these values, we notice that the function $f(n) = 2n-1$ seems to satisfy both conditions. We can verify that this function indeed satisfies the conditions:

1. For the first condition, $f(f(f(n))) = f(f(2n-1)) = f(2(2n-1) - 1) = f(4n-3) = 2(4n-3) - 1 = 8n-7$, so it satisfies the condition.

2. For the second condition, $f(2n) = 2(2n) - 1 = 4n - 1 = 2f(n) + 1$ (since $f(n) = 2n-1$), so it also satisfies the condition.

Now that we have found a function that satisfies the conditions, we can use it to calculate $f(100)$.

Calculation:
The function we found is $f(n) = 2n-1$, so $f(100) = 2(100) - 1 = 199$.
The answer is: $\boxed{199}$

We are given two conditions for the function $f$. We can use these conditions to find $f(100)$ step by step.

Step 1: We know that $f(f(f(100))) = 8 \cdot 100 - 7 = 793$.

Step 2: From the second condition, we can find $f(200) = 2f(100) + 1$.

Step 3: Substituting $f(200) = 793$ into the equation from step 2, we get $793 = 2f(100) + 1$.

Step 4: Solving for $f(100)$, we find $f(100) = \frac{793 - 1}{2} = 396$.

So, the value of $f(100)$ is 396. The answer is: $396$

This problem can be solved by recursive calculation. Using the second condition, we know that $f(100) = 2f(50) + 1$. Then, we need to find $f(50)$, which is $2f(25) + 1$. Continuing this process, we can reach $f(1)$ or $f(2)$ at some point, for which we can directly use the first condition to find the value. Finally, we can work our way back up to find $f(100)$.

Let's compute:

First, $f(1) = 2f(0) + 1$ cannot be directly solved using the given conditions. However, we can use the first condition for $n = 1$: $f(f(f(1))) = 8 - 7 = 1$, which implies $f(f(1)) = 1$. Then, using the second condition, $f(2) = 2f(1) + 1 = 2(1) + 1 = 3$. Now, we can find $f(25)$:
\[f(25) = 2f(12) + 1 = 2(2f(6) + 1) + 1 = 2(2(2f(3) + 1) + 1) + 1 = 2(2(2(3) + 1) + 1) + 1 = 2(2(7) + 1) + 1 = 2(15) + 1 = 31.\]
Next, we can find $f(50)$:
\[f(50) = 2f(25) + 1 = 2(31) + 1 = 62 + 1 = 63.\]
Finally, we can find $f(100)$:
\[f(100) = 2f(50) + 1 = 2(63) + 1 = 126 + 1 = 127.\]
Therefore, $f(100) = 127$.

Solution:
$f(100) = \boxed{127}$.
The answer is: $\boxed{127}$

Approach:

 We will try to find a way to simplify the function or find a pattern that can help us calculate $f(100)$. The second given condition gives us a hint that we can do this by calculating $f(n)$ for some simple values of $n$. Let's start with $n=1$.

From the second condition, we have $f(2)=2f(1)+1$. But we also know that $f(f(f(1)))=8(1)-7=1$. So $f(f(1))=1$. Substituting this into the second condition again, we get $f(1)=2f(1/2)+1$. Since $f(1/2)$ doesn't make sense in our context, let's try another value of $n$.

If we plug in $n=2$ into the second condition, we get $f(4)=2f(2)+1$. We know $f(4)$ from the first condition: $f(f(f(2)))=8(2)-7=9$, so $f(4)=9$. Substituting this into our equation we get $9=2f(2)+1$. Solving this we find $f(2)=4$. Now we can calculate $f(1)$ using the equation $f(2)=2f(1)+1$. Plugging in the value of $f(2)=4$ we find $4=2f(1)+1$ and thus $f(1)= \frac{3}{2}$, which doesn't make sense because $f(n)$ is defined only for natural numbers.

Maybe we made a mistake in our calculations, let's go back and check them again. 

From $f(f(f(1)))=1$, we can infer that $f(1)=1$ because the only natural number $f(1)$ that satisfies this equation given the first condition is 1.

Now we can check our previous calculation of $f(2)$ using the second condition $f(4)=2f(2)+1$. We know $f(4)=9$ from the first condition and $f(1)=1$, so $f(2)=2(1)+1=3$.

Now let's try to find $f(100)$. We know from the second condition that $f(200)=2f(100)+1$. We also know from the first condition that $f(f(f(100)))=8(100)-7=793$. So $f(f(100))=793$.

Now we can use the second condition again to find $f(100)$: $793=2f(100)+1$, so $f(100)=\frac{793-1}{2}=396$.
So $f(100)=\boxed{396}$.
The final answer is: 396

Solve the following problem with a Python Script (positive numerical answer):
"A function $f: \mathbb N \to \mathbb N$ satisfies the following two conditions for all positive integers $n$:$f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$ and $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$. Calculate $f(100)$."

Approach:


We start with the second equation given, $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$. We can use this equation to find a pattern by substituting some values. For example, setting $n=1$, we get $f(2) = 2f(1) + 1$. Let's denote $f(1) = a$, then we have $f(2) = 2a + 1$. 
Similarly, setting $n=2$ gives $f(4) = 2f(2) + 1 = 2(2a+1) + 1 = 4a + 3$.
And setting $n=4$ gives $f(8) = 2f(4) + 1 = 2(4a + 3) + 1 = 8a + 7$.

Now, notice that from the first equation given, $f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$, if we set $n=1$, we get $f(f(f(1)))=8*1-7=1$. Since $f(1)=a$, this implies $f(a)=1$. 
And we found that $f(8) = 8a + 7$. If we set this equal to 1, we get $8a + 7 = 1$, which gives $a = 0$. But this doesn't make sense, because $f: \mathbb N \to \mathbb N$ and $a$ is a natural number.

To continue our search for a pattern, let's substitute $f(2)=2a+1$ into the equation $f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$, and set $n=2$. We get $f(f(f(2)))=8*2-7=9$.
From $f(2) = 2a + 1$, we have $f(f(2)) = f(2a + 1) = 2f(a+1) + 1 = 2(a+1) + 1 = 2a+3$.
So the equation $f(f(f(2)))=9$ becomes $f(2a+3)=9$. This implies that $2a+3=3$, but this would lead to $a=0$, which we found earlier to be incorrect.

We need to reconsider our approach. Instead of substituting values into the equations, let's try to find a functional equation.

Setting $n=f(n)$ in the equation $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$, we get $f(2f(n))=2f(n)+1$. 
Let's denote $f(n)=x$, then we have $f(2x)=2x+1$.
Setting $n=x$ in the equation $f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$, we get $f(f(f(x)))=8x-7$.
From $f(2x)=2x+1$, we can substitute $x=f(x)$ to get $f(2f(x))=2f(x)+1$.
This simplifies to $f(2x)=2x+1$, where $x=f(x)$. So we have $f(2f(x))=2f(x)+1$.

Now, from $f(2f(x))=2f(x)+1$, and $f(f(f(x)))=8x-7$, we can equate the two expressions:
\[2f(x)+1=8x-7.\]
This simplifies to $2f(x)=8x-8$, and further simplifies to $f(x)=4x-4$.

Now we can find $f(100)$ using this equation:
\[f(100) = 4(100) - 4 = 400 - 4 = 396.\]
The value of $f(100)$ is $396$. The answer is: $\boxed{396}$

Solve the following problem with a Python Script (positive numerical answer):
"A function $f: \mathbb N \to \mathbb N$ satisfies the following two conditions for all positive integers $n$:$f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$ and $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$. Calculate $f(100)$."

Assistant:

Approach:


To calculate $f(100)$, we need to find a way to express 100 in terms of the known inputs of the function, i.e., the ones where $f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$ and $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$.

From the first equation $f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$, we can see that $f(f(f(1)))=8-7=1$. This implies that $f(1)$ is the only value that when fed into the function three times gives 1. 

Now, let's use the second equation $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$ to find the value of $f(1)$. We know that $f(2)=2f(1)+1$. Since $f(1)$ is the only value that when fed into the function three times gives 1, we can substitute $f(1)$ with 1 in the equation above. So, $f(2)=2*1+1=3$.

Now we can use this information to find the value of $f(f(1))$ using the second equation again. $f(f(1))=2f(1)+1=2*1+1=3$.

Similarly, we can find the value of $f(f(f(1)))$ using the second equation again. $f(f(f(1)))=2f(f(1))+1=2*3+1=7$. But from the first equation, we know that $f(f(f(1)))=1$, so 7 must be equivalent to 1.

Now we can substitute $n=1$ into the equation $f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$ and get $f(f(f(1)))=8*1-7=1$, confirming our earlier finding.

We have found that $f(1)=1$. Now let's find the value of $f(f(1))$, using the equation $f(f(1))=2f(1)+1=2*1+1=3$.

Finally, we need to find the value of $f(100)$. We can express 100 as $2*2*25$. Now we can use the second equation repeatedly to find the value of $f(100)$.

We have $f(100)=f(2*2*25)=2f(2*25)+1=2[2f(25)+1]+1=2[2[2f(5)+1]+1]+1=2[2[2[2f(1)+1]+1]+1]=2[2[2[2*1+1]+1]+1]=2[2[2[3]+1]+1]=2[2[7]+1]=2[15]=30$.

So $f(100)=30$.
The value of $f(100)$ is 30. The answer is: $\boxed{30}$

Approach:


We will try to find a value of $f(1)$ first, then use the second equation to find $f(2)$, $f(4)$, etc. until we can find $f(100)$.

Let's set $n=1$ in the equation $f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$, we have $f(f(f(1)))=8*1-7=1$. Since $f(f(f(1)))=1$, we have $f(f(1))=1$, and hence $f(1)=1$.

Now we can use the equation $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$ to find $f(2)$, $f(4)$, etc.

$f(2)=2f(1)+1=2*1+1=3$.
$f(4)=2f(2)+1=2*3+1=7$.
$f(8)=2f(4)+1=2*7+1=15$.
$f(16)=2f(8)+1=2*15+1=31$.

We can observe that $f(2^k)=2^k+1-2$. This is because $f(2^k)=2f(2^{k-1})+1=2(2^{k-1}+1-2)+1=2^k+1-2$.

Therefore, $f(100)=f(2^6+2^2)=2^6+1-2=63$.
The answer is: $\boxed{63}$

Approach:



The problem can be solved by substitution. Given the conditions $f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$ and $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$, we can start by calculating $f(100)$ using the second condition and then substituting that result into the first condition to get $f(f(f(100)))$ and so on, until we reach $f(1)$.

Let's start:

First, we use the second condition to calculate $f(200)$:
\[f(200) = 2f(100) + 1.\]
We don't know $f(100)$ yet, so let's denote it as $x$, so the equation becomes:
\[f(200) = 2x + 1.\]

Next, we substitute $200$ into the first condition:
\[f(f(f(200))) = 8 \cdot 200 - 7 = 1593.\]
Using the result from the second step:
\[f(f(2x+1)) = 1593.\]
Again, let's substitute $2x+1$ into the first condition:
\[f(f(2x+1)) = f(4x+2) = 8(4x+2) - 7 = 32x+16-7 = 32x+9.\]

Setting this equal to $1593$ gives us:
\[32x+9 = 1593.\]
Subtracting $9$ from both sides gives:
\[32x = 1584.\]
Dividing by $32$:
\[x = \frac{1584}{32} = 49.5.\]
This doesn't make sense because $f(100)$ should be a natural number. So, we must have made a mistake somewhere. Let's retrace our steps and see where we made a mistake.

After thinking about it, we realize that in the step where we substituted $200$ into the first condition, we should have used the second condition first to simplify the expression. So let's go back and correct that:

First, using the second condition:
\[f(200) = 2f(100) + 1 = 2x + 1.\]
Now, substitute $f(200)$ into the first condition:
\[f(f(f(200))) = 8 \cdot 200 - 7.\]
This gives us:
\[f(f(2x+1)) = 1593.\]

Then substitute $2x+1$ into the first condition:
\[f(f(2x+1)) = f(4x+2) = 8(4x+2) - 7 = 32x+16-7 = 32x+9.\]

Setting this equal to $1593$ gives us:
\[32x+9 = 1593.\]
Subtracting $9$ from both sides gives:
\[32x = 1584.\]
Dividing by $32$:
\[x = \frac{1584}{32} = 49.5.\]
This again doesn't make sense because $f(100)$ should be a natural number. So, we must have made a mistake somewhere.

After revisiting our steps, we realize that in the step where we set up the equation $32x+9 = 1593$, we should have remembered that $f(f(f(n)))$ equals $8n - 7$. So let's correct that and try again:

First, using the second condition:
\[f(200) = 2f(100) + 1 = 2x + 1.\]
Now, substitute $f(200)$ into the first condition:
\[f(f(f(200))) = 8 \cdot 200 - 7.\]
This gives us:
\[f(f(2x+1)) = 1593.\]

Then substitute $2x+1$ into the first condition:
\[f(f(2x+1)) = f(4x+2) = 8(4x+2) - 7 = 32x+16-7 = 32x+9.\]

Setting this equal to $8 \cdot 200 - 7$ gives us:
\[32x+9 = 1593.\]
Subtracting $9$ from both sides gives:
\[32x = 1584.\]
Dividing by $32$:
\[x = \frac{1584}{32} = 49.5.\]
This again doesn't make sense because $f(100)$ should be a natural number. So, we must have made a mistake somewhere.

After revisiting our steps again, we realize that in the step where we calculated $f(200) = 2x+1$, we should have been careful with the equality sign. It should have been $f(200) = 2f(100) = 2x$, not $f(200) = 2x + 1$. Let's correct that and try again:

Using the second condition:
\[f(200) = 2f(100) = 2x.\]
Now, substitute $f(200)$ into the first condition:
\[f(f(f(200))) = 8 \cdot 200 - 7.\]
This gives us:
\[f(f(2x)) = 1593.\]

Then substitute $2x$ into the first condition:
\[f(f(2x)) = f(4x) = 8(4x) - 7 = 32x - 7.\]

Setting this equal to $8 \cdot 200 - 7$ gives us:
\[32x - 7 = 1593.\]
Adding $7$ to both sides gives:
\[32x = 1593 + 7 = 1600.\]
Dividing by $32$:
\[x = \frac{1600}{32} = 50.\]
This makes sense because $f(100)$ should be a natural number. So, $x = f(100) = 50$.

Now we can calculate $f(100)$:
\[f(100) = 50.\]

We find that $f(100) = 50$. Therefore, the value of $f(100)$ is 50. So, the answer is:
\[f(100) = 50.\]
The answer is: $\boxed{50}$

Solve the following problem with a Python Script (positive numerical answer):
"A function $f: \mathbb N \to \mathbb N$ satisfies the following two conditions for all positive integers $n$:$f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$ and $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$. Calculate $f(100)$."

We can't directly find $f(100)$ using the given equations directly. We need to find a pattern or a base case to work with. Let's first try to simplify the first equation $f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$. If we set $n=1$, we get $f(f(f(1)))=8*1-7=1$, so $f(f(1))=1$. This suggests that $f(1)=1$ as well, because if $f(f(1))=1$, then $f(1)=1$.

Now let's use this result and the second equation to find $f(100)$. From the second equation, we know that $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$. If we let $n=50$, we get $f(100)=2f(50)+1$. But we still don't know $f(50)$. Let's try to find it using the second equation again. If we let $n=25$, we get $f(50)=2f(25)+1$. Now we are stuck again, because we don't know $f(25)$. But we can use the first equation here. If we let $n=12.5$, which is not a positive integer, so we need to look for another way.

Let's try to set $n=1$ in the second equation, we get $f(2)=2f(1)+1=2*1+1=3$. If we set $n=2$, we get $f(4)=2f(2)+1=2*3+1=7$. If we set $n=4$, we get $f(8)=2f(4)+1=2*7+1=15$. If we set $n=8$, we get $f(16)=2f(8)+1=2*15+1=31$. We can see a pattern here, that $f(2^k)=2^{k+1}-1$ for all positive integers $k$. So $f(50)=2^{5+1}-1=63$ and $f(100)=2f(50)+1=2*63+1=127$.

So the solution is $f(100)=127$.

The Python code to find $f(100)$ would be:

```python


INTERMEDIATE OUT :

def f(n):
    if n == 1:
        return 1
    elif n % 2 == 0:
        return 2 * f(n // 2) + 1
    else:
        return 1

print(f(100))
```
```output

The Python code is incorrect. The code is trying to find $f(n)$ using the second equation, but it is not handling the case where $n$ is not a power of 2 correctly. The code is not using the pattern we found from the first equation. Let's correct the code:

```python


INTERMEDIATE OUT :

def f(n):
    if n == 1:
        return 1
    elif n % 2 == 0:
        return 2 * f(n // 2) + 1
    else:
        return 1

    return f_100

print(find_f_100())
```
```output

CODE RESULTS 7

INTERMEDIATE OUT :

The corrected Python code still gives the wrong result. The problem is that the second equation is not sufficient to find a general expression for $f(n)$ for all positive integers $n$. We need to use the first equation to find a base case and then use the second equation to find $f(100)$. The base case we found was $f(1)=1$. 

Let's correct the code again:

```python


INTERMEDIATE OUT :

def f(n):
    if n == 1:
        return 1
    elif n % 2 == 0:

    else:

    f_32 = 2 * f_16 + 1 = 63
    f_50 = f_32 * (50 // 32) + f_16 * (50 % 32) = 63
    f_100 = 2 * f_50 + 1 = 127
    return f_100

print(find_f_100())
```

The Python code is still incorrect, but the error is not from the calculation. The error is that we can't set the variables directly in the `=` equals sign in Python. The correct way to set the variables would be:

```python

def f(n):

Approach:

 We start by applying the second equation of the function $f$ repeatedly on $f(100)$, until we can directly calculate $f(100)$ from the result.

Let's calculate $f(f(f(100)))$ step by step:

We know $f(f(f(100)))=8*100-7=793$.

Then we can apply the first equation $f(f(100)) = \frac{793}{8} = 99.125$, but the function domain and codomain are both natural numbers, so this result can't be true. 

So we must have made a mistake. Let's try to find the mistake. 

After examining the equations, we realize that the mistake is in the first equation, we should have $f(f(f(n)))=8n+7$, not $8n-7$. 

Now let's start again:

We know $f(f(f(100)))=8*100+7=807$.

Then we can apply the first equation $f(f(100)) = \frac{807}{8} = 100.875$, but the function domain and codomain are both natural numbers, so this result can't be true either. 

So we must have made another mistake. Let's try to find the mistake.

Then we can apply the corrected first equation $f(f(100)) = \frac{807}{8} = 100.875$, but the function domain and codomain are both natural numbers, so this result can't be true.

After examining the corrected equations again, we realize that the corrected second equation is still not correct. It should be $f(2n)=2f(n)-1$, not $2f(n)-1$.

Approach:



To find $f(100)$, we need to work with the given equations. The first equation, $f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$, is not easy to solve directly. However, we can use the second equation to simplify the problem.

Notice that if we let $n=2$ in the second equation, we have $f(4)=2f(2)+1$. Then, substituting $n=f(2)$ into the second equation again, we have $f(f(2))=2f(f(1))+1$. Combining these two equations, we can replace $f(f(f(2)))$ with $f(f(4))$ in the first equation. That is, $f(f(4))=8*2-7=9$.

We can keep going. Let's find $f(4)$: From $f(f(2))=2f(f(1))+1$ and $f(f(f(2)))=9$, we get $9=2f(f(1))+1$. Solving for $f(f(1))$, we get $f(f(1))=\frac{9-1}{2}=4$.

Then from $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$, we can let $n=1$ to find $f(2)=2f(1)+1$. Substituting $f(1)=2$ (from $f(f(1))=4$), we get $f(2)=2*2+1=5$.

Now we have all the tools to find $f(100)$. We notice that $100=2*50$, and from $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$, we can get $f(100)=2f(50)+1$. Similarly, $50=2*25$, so $f(50)=2f(25)+1$. We can continue this process until we reach $f(2)$, which we know is $5$.

So $f(100)=2f(50)+1=2(2f(25)+1)+1=2(2(2f(12.5)+1)+1)+1=2(2(2(2f(6.25)+1)+1)+1)+1$. Since $6.25=2*3.125$, and $3.125=2*1.5625$, and $1.5625=2*0.78125$, and $0.78125=2*0.390625$, and $0.390625=2*0.1953125$, and $0.1953125=2*0.09765625$. Since $0.09765625=2^{-6}$, and we stop here because we reach a power of $2$, and we know $f(2^x)=2^x$ for $x$ being an integer, we get $f(0.09765625)=2^{-6}$. So $f(100)=2(2(2(2(2(2(2^{-6})+1)+1)+1)+1)+1)+1=127$.

Therefore, $f(100)=127$.

```
Sorry for the mistake in the Python code. The $f(100)$ computation needs a slightly different approach.

Let's start from the equation $f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$. If we let $n=1$, we get $f(f(f(1)))=8*1-7=1$. Since $f(1)=2$, we have $f(2)=1$. Now, substituting $n=2$ into $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$, we get $f(4)=2f(2)+1=2*1+1=3$. Continuing this way, we can find $f(8)=2f(4)+1=2*3+1=7$, $f(16)=2f(8)+1=2*7+1=15$, and so on. We can see a pattern here. If $n=2^k$, then $f(n)=2^k-1$.

So we want to find $k$ such that $n=2^k=100$. Taking the logarithm base 2 of both sides, we get $k=\log_2 100$. Since $2^6=64$ and $2^7=128$, we have $6<\log_2 100<7$. So $k$ must be an integer between 6 and 7. We can try different values of $k$ to see which one gives us $n=100$.

If we try $k=6$, we get $n=2^6=64$. If we try $k=7$, we get $n=2^7=128$. Neither of these values is 100. This means we made an error somewhere. Let's go back and re-evaluate the problem.

We notice that if we let $n=2$ in the second equation, we have $f(4)=2f(2)+1$. This seems to lead us to a dead end. Let's try a different approach.

We can start from the equation $f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$. If we let $n=2$, we get $f(f(f(2)))=8*2-7=9$. Then, substituting $n=f(2)$ into $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$, we get $f(f(2))=2f(f(1))+1$. This is exactly the equation we got before, $9=2f(f(1))+1$. We can solve this equation to find $f(f(1))$.

Solving for $f(f(1))$, we get $f(f(1))=\frac{9-1}{2}=4$. Now, substituting $n=f(1)$ into the second equation $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$, we get $f(2f(1))=2f(f(1))+1$, or $f(2*2)=2*4+1$. This simplifies to $f(4)=9$.

So far, we have found $f(2)=5$ and $f(4)=9

Approach:



We are given two equations: $f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$ and $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$.
To find $f(100)$, we need to use the second equation repeatedly until we reach $f(50)$, $f(25)$, and then $f(1)$. After that, we can work our way up to $f(100)$ using the second equation again.

First, we notice that $100 = 2*50$, so we can apply the second equation to find $f(100)$ in terms of $f(50)$:
$$f(100) = 2f(50) + 1.$$

Next, $50 = 2*25$, so we can apply the second equation again to find $f(50)$ in terms of $f(25)$:
$$f(50) = 2f(25) + 1.$$

Then, $25 = 5*5$, so we can apply the second equation one more time to find $f(25)$ in terms of $f(5)$:
$$f(25) = 2f(5) + 1.$$

Now, we need to find $f(5)$. Since $5$ is not a power of $2$, we cannot directly apply the second equation. However, we can use the first equation with $n = 5$:
$$f(f(f(5))) = 8*5 - 7 = 33.$$

We want to express $f(5)$ in terms of the output of the first equation, which gives us:
$$f(f(f(5))) = f(f(5)) = 33.$$

Now, we can apply the second equation to $f(5)$:
$$f(f(5)) = 2f(5) + 1 = 33.$$
Solving for $f(5)$, we get:
$$f(5) = \frac{33 - 1}{2} = 16.$$

Substituting this back into our expressions for $f(25)$, $f(50)$, and $f(100)$, we get:
$$f(25) = 2*16 + 1 = 33,$$
$$f(50) = 2*33 + 1 = 67,$$
$$f(100) = 2*67 + 1 = 135.$$

So, $f(100) = 135$.
The answer is: $135$

Approach:


The first thing we can notice is that by setting $n=1$ in the second condition, we get $f(2) = 2f(1) + 1$. We also know from the first condition that $f(f(f(1))) = 8*1 - 7 = 1$. Since $f(f(f(1))) = 1$, we can conclude that $f(1) = f$.
Substituting this into the equation from the second condition, we get $f(2) = 2f + 1$.

Next, we substitute $n=2$ into the second condition to get $f(4) = 2f(2) + 1$. We can substitute the expression we just found for $f(2)$ into this equation to get $f(4) = 2(2f+1) + 1 = 4f + 3$.

We can continue this process, finding expressions for $f(8), f(16), \dots$ until we find an expression for $f(32)$, because we know that $32$ is the smallest power of $2$ that is greater than $100$. 

Using the first condition, we can easily verify that $f(f(f(2))) = 1$. So, $f(2) = 3$. Then, using the second condition we get $f(4) = 2f(2) + 1 = 2*3 + 1 = 7$. Continuing this way, we get $f(8) = 2f(4) + 1 = 2*7 + 1 = 15$, $f(16) = 2f(8) + 1 = 2*15 + 1 = 31$, and so on. 

After finding $f(32) = 63$, we can now use the second condition to find $f(64) = 2f(32) + 1 = 2*63 + 1 = 127$.

Now, we notice a pattern: $f(2^n) = 2^n - 1$. This is easy to verify by induction on $n$. We can use this pattern to find $f(100)$, since $100 = 2^2 + 2^2 + 2^2 + 2^3 + 2^0$. Therefore, $f(100) = f(2^2) + f(2^2) + f(2^2) + f(2^3) + f(2^0) = 3 + 3 + 3 + 7 + 1 = 17$. 

However, this is incorrect. The pattern only works for the powers of two, and we cannot simply add the individual values of $f(2^n)$ to find $f(100)$. 

To find $f(100)$, we need to use the first condition. We know that $f(f(f(100))) = 8*100 - 7 = 793$. We know the values of $f(100)$ for powers of 2 from the pattern we found, so we can start by setting $n=100$ in the second condition to get $f(200) = 2f(100) + 1$. If we know the value of $f(200)$, we can then find $f(100)$ by using the first condition. 

However, this approach is still quite complex, and it is likely that there is a more elegant solution. 

An important hint comes from the fact that $f(2) = 3$. This suggests that the function $f$ might be an increasing function. If this is the case, then we know that $f(100)$ must be greater than $f(1)$, which we already found to be $f$. 

By trying different small values for $n$ in the first condition, we can find that $f(3) = 5$, $f(5) = 9$, and so on. This shows that the function $f$ is indeed an increasing function. 

Now, we can use this information to find $f(100)$ by trying different values. We know that $f(100)$ must be between $f$ and $f(200)$, and it must satisfy $f(f(f(100))) = 793$. By trying different values in the range of $f$ to $f(200)$, we find that $f(7) = 11$, $f(11) = 19$, $f(19) = 35$, $f(35) = 67$, $f(67) = 127$, and $f(127) = 247$. We can then continue trying values, and eventually find that $f(17) = 33$, $f(33) = 63$, $f(63) = 123$, and $f(123) = 241$. Finally, $f(241) = 475$, and $f(475) = 943$. However, this is too large. 

We then try smaller values, and eventually find that $f(15) = 29$, $f(29) = 55$, $f(55) = 107$, and $f(107) = 211$. We then continue trying values, and eventually find that $f(11) = 19$, $f(19) = 35$, $f(35) = 67$, $f(67) = 127$, $f(127) = 247$, $f(247) = 487$, $f(487) = 967$. However, this is still too large. 

We then try larger values, and eventually find that $f(19) = 35$, $f(35) = 67$, $f(67) = 127$, and $f(127) = 247$. We then continue trying values, and eventually find that $f(21) = 39$, $f(39) = 75$, $f(75) = 147$, and $f(147) = 289$. Finally, $f(289) = 571$, and $f(571) = 1135$. However, this is still too large. 

Continuing in this way, we eventually find that $f(17) = 33$, $f(33) = 63$, $f(63) = 123$, $f(123) = 241$, and $f(241) = 475$. Then, $f(475) = 943$,

Approach:


To find $f(100)$, we will iterate through the given functional equation. However, this function is quite complex and we need to simplify it step by step.

First, let's set $n = 1$ in the equation $f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$. We get $f(f(f(1)))=8*1-7=1$. Since $f(1)$ is also a natural number, it implies that $f(f(1))=1$. Now, if we set $n = f(1)$ in the equation $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$, we get $f(2f(1))=2f(f(1))+1=2*1+1=3$. This means $f(2f(1))=3$. So we have $f(2f(1))=3$ and $f(f(1))=1$, we can conclude that $f(1) = 2$.

Then we can calculate $f(f(1))=f(2)=1$. And also substitute $f(1)=2$ into the equation $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$, we can get $f(4)=2f(2)+1=2*1+1=3$.

Now, we substitute $f(2)=1$ into the equation $f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$, we get $f(f(1))=8*1-7=1$, so $f(1)=1$.

At this point, we notice that $f(1)=1$, from the function $f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$, if we substitute $n=1$, we'll get: $f(f(1))=8*1-7=1$, so $f(1)=1$. Thus we confirm $f(1) = 1$. 

Continuing from our previous calculations, we have $f(2)=1$ and $f(4)=3$. With these values we can determine $f(8)$ using the equation $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$. Plugging in $n=4$, we get $f(8) = 2f(4) + 1 = 2*3+1 = 7$. 

And we can also get $f(3)=3$ from the equation $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$ with $n=1.5$ (since $f(1)=1$). Then we calculate $f(6) = 2f(3) + 1 = 2*3+1 = 7$.

Finally, we can determine $f(100)$ with the two values $f(8) = 7$ and $f(6) = 7$ and using the equation $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$. Plugging in $n=50$, we get $f(100) = 2f(50) + 1$. However, we still don't know the value of $f(50)$. But from the equation $f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$, setting $n=50$, we get $f(f(50))=8*50-7=393$. 

And if we set $n=f(50)$ in the equation $f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$, we get $f(f(f(50)))=8f(50)-7$, and since we know $f(f(50))=393$, then we have $393=8f(50)-7$, so $f(50)=\frac{393+7}{8}=50$. 

With $f(50) = 50$, we then have $f(100) = 2f(50) + 1 = 2*50 + 1 = 101$.

Therefore, the value of $f(100)$ is 101. The answer is: $101$
