Approach:

 The equation given is a product of two expressions equal to zero. This means that either the first expression is zero or the second expression is zero. We can break this down into two cases to find the possible values of $(x, y)$.

Case 1: $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$. This can only happen if $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. This means that $x + y = \pm 10$ and $x - y = \pm 10$. Solving these equations, we get the vertices of the polygon as $(0, 10)$, $(0, -10)$, $(10, 0)$, and $(-10, 0)$.

Case 2: $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$. This can only happen if $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$. This means that $x = \pm 8$ and $y = \pm 8$. Solving these equations, we get the vertices of the polygon as $(8, 8)$, $(8, -8)$, $(-8, 8)$, and $(-8, -8)$.

Now, we can plot these points on a graph to visualize the polygon. It turns out that the polygon is a square with side length $10$. The area of a square is given by the square of its side length, so the area of this square is $10^2 = 100$.

Therefore, the area of the convex polygon is $100$.
The answer is: $100$

Solve the following problem with a Python Script (positive numerical answer):
"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"

The equation $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ implies that either $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$.

If $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$, then $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$, which means $x + y = \pm 10$ and $x - y = \pm 10$. Solving these equations gives us the vertices of the square: $(8, 2)$, $(8, -2)$, $(-8, -2)$, and $(-8, 2)$.

If $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$, then $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$, which means $x = \pm 8$ and $y = \pm 8$. Solving these equations gives us the vertices of the square: $(8, 8)$, $(8, -8)$, $(-8, -8)$, and $(-8, 8)$.

Combining these two sets of vertices, we can see that the convex polygon is a 8x8 square. The area of a square is the side length squared, so the area of this square is $8^2 = 64$. The answer is: $64$

The equation given in the problem is a product of two expressions equal to zero. This means that either the first expression is zero or the second expression is zero. We will analyze each case separately.

1. $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$: This equation is satisfied only when $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. This implies that $x + y = \pm 10$ and $x - y = \pm 10$. Solving these four equations, we get the vertices of the polygon as $(0, 10), (0, -10), (10, 0), (-10, 0)$.

2. $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$: This equation is satisfied only when $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$. This implies that $x = \pm 8$ and $y = \pm 8$. Solving these four equations, we get the vertices of the polygon as $(8, 8), (8, -8), (-8, 8), (-8, -8)$.

The vertices of the polygon are $(0, 10), (0, -10), (10, 0), (-10, 0), (8, 8), (8, -8), (-8, 8), (-8, -8)$. These points form a square with side length 10. The area of the square is side length squared, so the area is $10^2 = 100$.

The answer is: $100$

Solve the following problem with a Python Script (positive numerical answer):
"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"

Approach:



The given equation is $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$. For the product of two numbers to be zero, either one of the numbers must be zero. Therefore, either $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$.

If $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$, then $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. This means $x + y = \pm 10$ and $x - y = \pm 10$. Solving these equations gives us the vertices of a square with side length 10.

If $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$, then $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$. This means $x = \pm 8$ and $y = \pm 8$. Solving these equations gives us the vertices of a square with side length 16.

The area of the convex polygon is the sum of the areas of the two squares. The area of a square with side length $a$ is $a^2$. Therefore, the area of the first square is $10^2 = 100$ and the area of the second square is $16^2 = 256$. So, the total area of the convex polygon is $100 + 256 = 356$.
The answer is: $356$

Solve the following problem with a Python Script (positive numerical answer):
"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"

Approach:


The equation given in the problem, $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$, is true if and only if either of the factors is zero. This means that the points that satisfy the equation are either on the set of points where $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ or on the set of points where $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$.

The set of points where $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ is the set of points such that $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. These are the points that form a square with side length 10. The area of this square is $10^2 = 100$.

The set of points where $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ is the set of points such that $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$. These are the points that form a square with side length 8. The area of this square is $8^2 = 64$.

Since the points that satisfy the equation are either on the set of points where $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ or on the set of points where $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$, the convex polygon formed by these points is the union of the two squares. The area of this union is the sum of the areas of the two squares, which is $100 + 64 = 164$.
The answer is: $164$

The given equation is $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$. This equation is satisfied only when either $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$.

If $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$, then $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. This implies that $x + y = \pm 10$ and $x - y = \pm 10$. Solving these equations, we get the vertices of the square as $(0, 10), (0, -10), (10, 0), (-10, 0)$.

If $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$, then $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$. This implies that $x = \pm 8$ and $y = \pm 8$. Solving these equations, we get the vertices of the square as $(8, 0), (-8, 0), (0, 8), (0, -8)$.

Therefore, the vertices of the convex polygon are $(0, 10), (0, -10), (10, 0), (-10, 0), (8, 0), (-8, 0), (0, 8), (0, -8)$. This polygon is a square with side length $10$.

The area of a square with side length $s$ is $s^2$. So, the area of this square is $10^2 = 100$.

Therefore, the area of the convex polygon is $100$.

The answer is: $100$

Assistant:

Approach:

 The equation $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ implies that $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. This is possible only when $x = \pm 10$ and $y = \pm 10$. Similarly, the equation $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ implies that $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$, which means $x = \pm 8$ and $y = \pm 8$.

So the polygon is a square with side length $20$ (from $-10$ to $10$ in both $x$ and $y$ directions for the first equation, and from $-8$ to $8$ in both $x$ and $y$ directions for the second equation).

The area of a square is given by side length squared, so the area of this square is $20^2 = 400$.

So, the area of the convex polygon is $400$.
The answer is: $400$

The equation $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ implies that $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$.
This means that the points $(x, y)$ lie on the lines $x + y = 10$ and $x - y = 10$ or $x + y = -10$ and $x - y = -10$.

Similarly, the equation $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ implies that $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$, which means the points $(x, y)$ lie on the lines $x = 8$ and $y = 8$ or $x = -8$ and $y = -8$.

The intersection of these lines forms a square with side length 10 (since the distance between the lines $x + y = 10$ and $x + y = -10$ is 20, and dividing by $\sqrt{2}$ gives the side length of the square).

The area of a square is given by side length squared, so the area of this square is $10^2 = 100$. The answer is: $100$
