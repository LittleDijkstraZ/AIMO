Approach:


The given equation is $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ and we want to find the number of positive integers $m$ for which the equation has $4$ distinct solutions.

We can start by considering the possible forms of the equation inside the absolute value signs. There are three cases to consider:

1. $\vert x-1 \vert -2 = \frac{m}{100}$
2. $-\vert x-1 \vert +2 = \frac{m}{100}$
3. $\vert x-1 \vert -2 = -\frac{m}{100}$

For each case, we can solve the equation inside the absolute value signs to find the number of solutions. Then, we can count the number of positive integers $m$ for which the equation has $4$ distinct solutions.

After solving the equation inside the absolute value signs for each case, we find that the number of solutions for each case is as follows:

1. Case 1: $4$ solutions for $m = 200$
2. Case 2: $4$ solutions for $m = 200$
3. Case 3: $4$ solutions for $m = 200$

So, there is only one positive integer $m$, which is $200$, for which the equation has $4$ distinct solutions. The answer is: $\boxed{1}$

Approach:


The given equation has four distinct solutions, and we know that the absolute value function $|x-1|$ produces a V-shaped graph with its vertex at $x=1$. Therefore, the equation $| |x-1| - 2 | = m/100$ will have four distinct solutions when the right side of the equation ($m/100$) is equal to the distance between the vertices of the V-shape formed by $| |x-1| - 2 |$.

The distance between the vertices of the V-shape formed by $| |x-1| - 2 |$ is 2. Therefore, we have $m/100 = 2$, which gives $m = 200$. So, there is only one positive integer $m$ that makes the equation have four distinct solutions. The answer is: $1$

We want the equation $| |x - 1| - 2 | = \frac{m}{100}$ to have 4 distinct solutions. This equation is a combination of two absolute value functions, and its graph will be a series of V-shaped segments. The number of segments will be equal to the number of times the value inside the absolute value changes its sign.

The expression $|x - 1| - 2$ changes its sign at $x = 1$. So we need to consider the cases $x < 1$ and $x \geq 1$ separately.

1. For $x < 1$, $|x - 1| = -(x - 1) = 1 - x$. So the equation becomes $|1 - x - 2| = | -x - 1| = |-x - 1| = \frac{m}{100}$. This changes its sign at $x = -1$, so we need to consider the sub-cases $x < -1$ and $-1 \leq x < 1$.

2. For $x \geq 1$, $|x - 1| = x - 1$. So the equation becomes $|x - 1 - 2| = |x - 3| = \frac{m}{100}$. This changes its sign at $x = 3$, so we need to consider the sub-cases $1 \leq x < 3$ and $x \geq 3$.

Now we analyze each sub-case:

1. For $x < -1$, the equation becomes $|-x - 1 - 2| = |-x - 3| = \frac{m}{100}$. This changes its sign at $x = -3$, but this doesn't fall into our range $x < -1$. So this case gives us no solutions.

2. For $-1 \leq x < 1$, the equation becomes $|-x - 1 - 2| = |-x - 3| = \frac{m}{100}$. This changes its sign at $x = -3$, but this doesn't fall into our range $-1 \leq x < 1$. So this case gives us no solutions.

3. For $1 \leq x < 3$, the equation becomes $|x - 3| = \frac{m}{100}$. This changes its sign at $x = 3$, but this doesn't fall into our range $1 \leq x < 3$. So this case gives us no solutions.

4. For $x \geq 3$, the equation becomes $|x - 3 - 2| = |x - 5| = \frac{m}{100}$. This changes its sign at $x = 5$, and falls into our range $x \geq 3$. So this case gives us two solutions.

So, the equation $| |x - 1| - 2 | = \frac{m}{100}$ has 4 distinct solutions when $\frac{m}{100}$ falls into the range $0 < \frac{m}{100} \leq 2$. This means $0 < m \leq 200$. The positive integers $m$ that satisfy this condition are 1, 2, ..., 200, of which there are 200.

However, we have overcounted the cases. The case $m = 0$ does not give us any solutions, and the case $m = 200$ gives us only one solution. So we must subtract these two cases from our total. Therefore, the number of positive integers $m$ for which the equation has 4 distinct solutions is $200 - 2 = 198$.

So the answer is $\boxed{198}$.

The Python code to calculate this would be:

```python


INTERMEDIATE OUT :

def count_m():
    m_values = list(range(1, 201))
    count = len(m_values) - 2
    return count

result = count_m()
print(result)
```

CODE RESULTS 198

INTERMEDIATE OUT :
```output
198
```
The answer is $\boxed{198}$.

Approach:



The equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has 4 distinct solutions if and only if $\frac{m}{100}$ is strictly between 1 and 2. This is because the function $f(x) = \vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert$ has a graph that consists of a series of line segments, and it equals 1 at exactly two points and equals 2 at exactly two other points. Thus, for the equation to have 4 distinct solutions, the right-hand side must be strictly between 1 and 2.

So, we want to find the number of positive integers $m$ such that $1 < \frac{m}{100} < 2$. This is equivalent to $100 < m < 200$. The positive integers in this range are the integers from 101 to 199, inclusive. To find the number of these integers, we subtract the smallest integer in the range from the largest integer in the range and add 1. So, the number of such integers is $199 - 101 + 1 = 99$.
The answer is: $99$

The equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has 4 distinct solutions if and only if $\frac{m}{100} = 2$. 

To see why, consider the graph of $y = \vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert$. This graph is a "V" shape with its minimum at $y=0$. The equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ is asking for the values of $m$ such that the line $y = \frac{m}{100}$ intersects the graph at 4 distinct points. 

The graph of $y = \vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert$ intersects the line $y = \frac{m}{100}$ at 4 distinct points when $\frac{m}{100} = 2$. 

So, we need to solve the equation $\frac{m}{100} = 2$ for $m$. Multiplying both sides of the equation by 100 gives $m = 200$.

Therefore, the only positive integer $m$ for which the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has 4 distinct solutions is $m = 200$.

So, the answer is $\boxed{1}$.
The answer is $\boxed{1}$.

Approach:


The equation $| |x-1|-2|=\frac{m}{100}$ has 4 distinct solutions if and only if $\frac{m}{100}$ is less than 2 but greater than or equal to 0. This is because the expression on the left side of the equation, $| |x-1|-2|$, can only take values between 0 and 2. If $\frac{m}{100}$ is less than 0, the equation has no solutions. If $\frac{m}{100}$ is equal to 2 or more, the equation has either 2 or 4 solutions. So we need to find the number of positive integers $m$ such that $0 \leq \frac{m}{100} < 2$. Multiplying all sides of the inequalities by 100 gives $0 \leq m < 200$. The number of positive integers in this range is $200 - 1 = 199$. However, we need to exclude the values of $m$ for which the equation has only 2 solutions. These occur when $\frac{m}{100}$ is equal to 0 or 2. So we need to subtract 2 from 199. Therefore, the number of positive integers $m$ for which the equation has 4 distinct solutions is $199 - 2 = 197$.

So, the number of positive integers $m$ for which the equation $| |x-1|-2|=\frac{m}{100}$ has 4 distinct solutions is 197. The answer is: 197

Approach:


The equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has 4 distinct solutions if and only if $\frac{m}{100} = 2$. This is because the function $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert$ attains the value of 2 exactly 4 times. 

To find $m$, we can multiply both sides of the equation $\frac{m}{100} = 2$ by 100 to get $m = 200$.

So, the number of positive integers $m$ that satisfy the condition is 1, since there is only one positive integer value for $m$ that gives 4 distinct solutions to the equation.

The answer is: $1$
