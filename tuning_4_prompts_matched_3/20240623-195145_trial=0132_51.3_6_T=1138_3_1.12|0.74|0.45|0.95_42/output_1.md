Approach:



We can rewrite the given equation as $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$.

By the triangle inequality, $|a| + |b| \geq |a+b|$, so $|x-2y| + |y-2x| \geq |(x-2y) + (y-2x)| = |-x - y| = |-(x+y)| = |x+y|$.

Thus, we have $|x+y| = 40$.

Now, let's consider the expression $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$. We can rewrite it as $5(x^2+y^2) - 8xy = 5[(x+y)^2 - 2xy] - 8xy = 5(40^2 - 2xy) - 8xy = 5(1600 - 2xy) - 8xy = 8000 - 10xy - 8xy = 8000 - 18xy$.

To minimize this expression, we need to maximize the value of $xy$.

Since $|x+y| = 40$, we can square both sides to get $x^2 + 2xy + y^2 = 1600$. We know that $x^2 + y^2 \geq 2xy$, so we can substitute this into the equation to get $2xy \leq 1600$, or $xy \leq 800$.

Therefore, to maximize $xy$, we should set $xy = 800$.

Substituting this into the expression $8000 - 18xy$, we get $8000 - 18(800) = 8000 - 14400 = -6400$.

However, this is not possible because the expression $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ must be nonnegative.

Let's try another approach. We can rewrite the expression $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ as $5(x^2+y^2) - 8xy = 5[(x-y)^2 + 2xy] - 8xy = 5(x-y)^2 + 2xy$.

To minimize this expression, we need to minimize $(x-y)^2$ and $xy$.

Since $|x+y| = 40$, we can square both sides to get $x^2 + 2xy + y^2 = 1600$. We know that $x^2 + y^2 \geq 2xy$, so we can substitute this into the equation to get $2xy \leq 1600$, or $xy \leq 800$.

Now, let's minimize $(x-y)^2$. Since $(x-y)^2 \geq 0$, the minimum value is 0, which occurs when $x = y$.

Substituting $x = y$ into the equation $x^2 + 2xy + y^2 = 1600$, we get $2x^2 = 1600$, or $x^2 = 800$. Since $x$ and $y$ must be real numbers, we can take the positive square root to get $x = y = \sqrt{800} = 20\sqrt{2}$.

Substituting $x = y = 20\sqrt{2}$ into the expression $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$, we get $5(800) - 8(400) = 4000 - 3200 = 800$.

Therefore, the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ is 800. The answer is: $800$.

Approach:


To solve this problem, we can use the fact that $|a-b| + |b-a| = 2|a-b|$ for all real numbers $a$ and $b$. Therefore, we can rewrite the equation $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$ as $2|x-2y| = 40$, which simplifies to $|x-2y| = 20$.
This means that $x-2y = 20$ or $x-2y = -20$. We can solve these two equations to find the relationship between $x$ and $y$.

Case 1: $x-2y = 20$.
Adding $2y$ to both sides gives $x = 2y + 20$.

Case 2: $x-2y = -20$.
Adding $2y$ to both sides gives $x = 2y - 20$.

Now, we can substitute these expressions for $x$ into the expression $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ to find its minimum value.

Case 1: Substituting $x = 2y + 20$ into $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ gives
\[5(2y+20)^2 + 5y^2 - 8y(2y+20) = 5(4y^2 + 80y + 400) + 5y^2 - 16y^2 - 160y = 20y^2 + 400y + 2000 + 5y^2 - 16y^2 - 160y = -y^2 + 240y + 2000.\]

Case 2: Substituting $x = 2y - 20$ into $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ gives
\[5(2y-20)^2 + 5y^2 - 8y(2y-20) = 5(4y^2 - 80y + 400) + 5y^2 - 16y^2 + 160y = 20y^2 - 400y + 2000 + 5y^2 - 16y^2 + 160y = -y^2 - 240y + 2000.\]

We can see that the minimum value occurs when $x = 2y - 20$ because the quadratic function $-y^2 - 240y + 2000$ has a larger constant term than the quadratic function $-y^2 + 240y + 2000$.

Now, we need to find the minimum value of the function $-y^2 - 240y + 2000$.

To do this, we can complete the square:
\[-y^2 - 240y + 2000 = -(y^2 + 240y) + 2000 = -(y^2 + 240y + 14400) + 2000 + 14400 = -(y + 120)^2 + 16400.\]

The minimum value of the function occurs when $y = -120$, and the minimum value is $-(0) + 16400 = 16400$.

Therefore, the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ when $x$ and $y$ range over all real numbers such that $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$ is $16400$. The answer is: $16400$

Approach:


This is a problem of minimization of a function under a constraint. We can use the method of Lagrange multipliers to solve this problem. First, let's rewrite the constraint equation as $|x-2y| + |y-2x| - 40 = 0$.

Let's consider the function $f(x, y) = 5x^2 + 5y^2 - 8xy - \lambda (|x-2y| + |y-2x| - 40)$.

To find the critical points, we need to take the partial derivatives of $f(x, y)$ with respect to $x$ and $y$ and set them equal to zero.

$\frac{\partial f}{\partial x} = 10x - 8y - \lambda(-1 + 2\delta_1) = 0$

$\frac{\partial f}{\partial y} = 10y - 8x - \lambda(1 - 2\delta_2) = 0$

where $\delta_1 = \frac{x-2y}{|x-2y|}$ and $\delta_2 = \frac{y-2x}{|y-2x|}$.

Now, we need to solve this system of equations along with the constraint equation. This can be a challenging task and may require numerical methods. However, we can make some observations to simplify the problem.

Notice that if we let $x = 2y$, the constraint equation is satisfied. Substituting this into the function to minimize, we get:

$f(2y, y) = 5(2y)^2 + 5y^2 - 8(2y)y - \lambda (|y| + |y| - 40) = 20y^2 + 5y^2 - 16y^2 - 2\lambda |y| - 40\lambda = 7y^2 - 2\lambda |y| - 40\lambda$.

Now, we can take the derivative of $f(2y, y)$ with respect to $y$ and set it equal to zero:

$\frac{df}{dy} = 14y - 2\lambda \text{sgn}(y) = 0$.

If $y > 0$, then $\text{sgn}(y) = 1$, and we have $14y - 2\lambda = 0$. If $y < 0$, then $\text{sgn}(y) = -1$, and we have $14y + 2\lambda = 0$. In both cases, we can solve for $\lambda$:

$\lambda = 7y$.

Now, substituting this back into the constraint equation, we have:

$|2y - y| + |y - 2(2y)| - 40 = 0 \Rightarrow |y| + |-3y| - 40 = 0 \Rightarrow 4|y| = 40 \Rightarrow |y| = 10$.

So, $y = \pm 10$. If $y = 10$, then $x = 2y = 20$, and if $y = -10$, then $x = 2y = -20$. Substituting these values back into the function to minimize, we get:

$f(20, 10) = 7(10)^2 - 2\lambda(10) - 40\lambda = 700 - 20\lambda - 40\lambda = 700 - 60\lambda$,

and

$f(-20, -10) = 7(10)^2 - 2\lambda(-10) - 40\lambda = 700 + 20\lambda - 40\lambda = 700 - 20\lambda$.

Comparing these two values, we see that $f(-20, -10) = f(20, 10) + 40\lambda$. Since $\lambda = 7y$, and in both cases $y = \pm 10$, we have $\lambda = \pm 70$. Therefore, $f(-20, -10) = f(20, 10) + 40(70) = f(20, 10) + 2800$.

Since we want to minimize the function, we choose the smaller value, which is $f(20, 10)$. Substituting $\lambda = 70$ into the expression for $f(20, 10)$, we get:

$f(20, 10) = 700 - 60(70) = 700 - 4200 = -3500$.

Therefore, the minimum value of the function under the constraint is $-3500$. The answer is: $-3500$

Solve the following problem with a Python Script (positive numerical answer):
"What is the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ when $x$ and $y$ range over all real numbers such that $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$?"

Assistant:

Approach:


To solve this problem, we will first rewrite the given expression $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ as a quadratic form in terms of $x$ and $y$. Then we will use the condition $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$ to find the relationship between $x$ and $y$. Finally, we will substitute this relationship into the quadratic form to find its minimum value.

Step 1: Rewrite the given expression as a quadratic form.
The expression $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ can be rewritten as $5(x^2+y^2) - 8xy$. Now, let's introduce a new variable $z = x + y$, then $x = \frac{z+y}{2}$ and $y = \frac{z-x}{2}$. Substitute these into the quadratic form:

$$5(x^2+y^2) - 8xy = 5\left(\left(\frac{z+y}{2}\right)^2 + \left(\frac{z-x}{2}\right)^2\right) - 8\left(\frac{z+y}{2}\right)\left(\frac{z-x}{2}\right).$$

Expanding and simplifying, we get:

$$5\left(\frac{z^2+2zy+y^2}{4} + \frac{z^2-2zx+x^2}{4}\right) - 2(z^2-xy) = \frac{5}{4}(2z^2+2y^2+2x^2) - 2z^2 + 2xy = \frac{5}{2}(x^2+y^2) + 2xy = \frac{5}{2}(x+y)^2.$$

Step 2: Use the condition $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$ to find the relationship between $x$ and $y$.
The condition $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$ can be rewritten as $|x-2y| = 20 - |y-2x|$. Squaring both sides, we get:

$$(x-2y)^2 = (20 - |y-2x|)^2.$$

Expanding and simplifying, we get:

$$x^2 - 4xy + 4y^2 = 400 - 40|y-2x| + (y^2 - 4xy + 4x^2).$$

Rearranging and simplifying, we get:

$$5(x^2+y^2) - 8xy = 400 - 40|y-2x| \Rightarrow \frac{5}{2}(x+y)^2 = 400 - 40|y-2x|.$$

Step 3: Substitute the relationship between $x$ and $y$ into the quadratic form to find its minimum value.
Since $\frac{5}{2}(x+y)^2 = 400 - 40|y-2x|$, we can see that the minimum value of $\frac{5}{2}(x+y)^2$ is achieved when $|y-2x|$ is minimized. The minimum value of $|y-2x|$ is 0, which occurs when $y=2x$. Substituting $y=2x$ into the equation, we get:

$$\frac{5}{2}(x+2x)^2 = 400 \Rightarrow 9x^2 = \frac{400}{3} \Rightarrow x^2 = \frac{400}{27}.$$

Substituting $y=2x$ into the quadratic form, we get:

$$\frac{5}{2}(x+2x)^2 = \frac{5}{2}(3x)^2 = \frac{45x^2}{2} = \frac{45 \cdot \frac{400}{27}}{2} = \frac{1000}{9}.$$

So the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ is $\frac{1000}{9}$.

The answer is: $\boxed{\frac{1000}{9}}$

Approach:


We can solve this problem by using the method of completing the square and then considering the condition $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$.

First, let's rewrite the expression $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ as $5(x^2 - \frac{8}{5}xy + y^2) = 5[(x^2 - \frac{8}{5}xy + \frac{16}{25}y^2) - \frac{16}{25}y^2 + y^2] = 5[(\frac{x - 4y}{5})^2 + \frac{11}{25}y^2]$.

Now, let's consider the condition $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$. Since $|x-2y| = |-(2x-y)| = |y-2x|$, we have $|x-2y| = 20$. Without loss of generality, we can assume that $x-2y = 20$ (the other case gives the same result). Then we can solve this equation to get $x = 2y + 20$.

Substitute $x = 2y + 20$ into the expression $5(x^2 - \frac{8}{5}xy + y^2)$, we get
\[5[(2y+20)^2 - \frac{8}{5}(2y+20)y + y^2] = 5[(4y^2 + 80y + 400 - 32y^2 - 320y + y^2)] = 5[-27y^2 - 240y + 400] = -135y^2 - 1200y + 2000.\]

Now, we need to find the minimum value of $-135y^2 - 1200y + 2000$. To do this, we can complete the square:
\[-135y^2 - 1200y + 2000 = -135(y^2 + \frac{1200}{135}y) + 2000 = -135[(y^2 + \frac{1200}{135}y + (\frac{600}{135})^2) - (\frac{600}{135})^2] + 2000 = -135[(y + \frac{600}{135})^2 - (\frac{600}{135})^2] + 2000 = -135(y + \frac{600}{135})^2 + 135(\frac{600}{135})^2 + 2000 = -135(y + \frac{600}{135})^2 + 2000 + 135(\frac{600}{135})^2.\]

Since $-135(y + \frac{600}{135})^2$ is always non-positive, the minimum value of $-135y^2 - 1200y + 2000$ is achieved when $y = -\frac{600}{135} = -\frac{40}{9}$. Substitute $y = -\frac{40}{9}$ into the equation $x = 2y + 20$, we get $x = 2(-\frac{40}{9}) + 20 = \frac{100}{9}$.

Finally, substitute $x = \frac{100}{9}$ and $y = -\frac{40}{9}$ into the expression $5(x^2 - \frac{8}{5}xy + y^2)$, we get
\[5[(\frac{100}{9})^2 - \frac{8}{5}(\frac{100}{9})(-\frac{40}{9}) + (-\frac{40}{9})^2] = 5[\frac{10000}{81} + \frac{6400}{405} + \frac{1600}{81}] = 5[\frac{10000 + 6400 + 1600}{81}] = 5[\frac{18000}{81}] = \frac{90000}{81} = \frac{10000}{9}.\]

Therefore, the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ when $x$ and $y$ range over all real numbers such that $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$ is $\frac{10000}{9}$. The answer is: $\boxed{\frac{10000}{9}}$

Approach:



This problem involves finding the minimum value of a function under a constraint. The function is $F(x, y) = 5x^2 + 5y^2 - 8xy$ and the constraint is $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$.

First, we observe that the function $F(x, y)$ is a quadratic function in $x$ and $y$. It can be rewritten as $F(x, y) = 5(x^2 - \frac{8}{5}xy + y^2) = 5[(x - \frac{4}{5}y)^2 + \frac{1}{5}y^2]$.

This shows that $F(x, y)$ is always non-negative since it is a sum of squares. Moreover, it is minimized when $(x - \frac{4}{5}y)^2 = 0$ and $y^2 = 0$, which implies $x = \frac{4}{5}y$.

Next, we substitute $x = \frac{4}{5}y$ into the constraint equation $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$:

$| \frac{4}{5}y - 2y | + | y - 2*\frac{4}{5}y | = 40$

$|- \frac{6}{5}y| + | - \frac{2}{5}y| = 40$

$\frac{6}{5}|y| + \frac{2}{5}|y| = 40$

$\frac{8}{5}|y| = 40$

$|y| = 25$

Since $y$ can be either positive or negative, we have two cases to consider: $y = 25$ and $y = -25$.

For $y = 25$, we substitute it into $x = \frac{4}{5}y$ to get $x = 20$. So one solution is $(x, y) = (20, 25)$.

For $y = -25$, we substitute it into $x = \frac{4}{5}y$ to get $x = -20$. So another solution is $(x, y) = (-20, -25)$.

We substitute these two solutions into the function $F(x, y)$:

$F(20, 25) = 5(20^2 + 25^2 - 8*20*25) = 5(400 + 625 - 400) = 5*625 = 3125$.

$F(-20, -25) = 5((-20)^2 + (-25)^2 - 8*(-20)*(-25)) = 5(400 + 625 - 400) = 5*625 = 3125$.

So in both cases, the minimum value of $F(x, y)$ is 3125. The answer is: $\boxed{3125}$

Approach:


To find the minimum value of the expression $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ under the condition $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$, we can use the Cauchy-Schwarz inequality.

First, note that $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = |x-2y| + |2y-x| = |x-2y| + |-1(x-2y)| = |x-2y| + |-1||x-2y| = |x-2y| + |x-2y| = 2|x-2y|$. So we have $2|x-2y| = 40$, which implies $|x-2y| = 20$.

Now, we apply the Cauchy-Schwarz inequality to the sequences $a = (1, -2)$ and $b = (x, y)$:
\[(1^2 + (-2)^2)(x^2 + y^2) \geq (x - 2y)^2.\]
This simplifies to $5(x^2 + y^2) \geq (x - 2y)^2$.

Since $|x-2y| = 20$, we have $(x - 2y)^2 = 400$. Substituting this into the inequality gives $5(x^2 + y^2) \geq 400$, or $x^2 + y^2 \geq \frac{400}{5} = 80$.

Now, we substitute $x^2 + y^2 = 80$ into the expression $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$:
\[5x^2+5y^2-8xy = 5(x^2 + y^2) - 8xy = 5 \cdot 80 - 8xy = 400 - 8xy.\]
To minimize this expression, we need to maximize the value of $xy$. By AM-GM inequality, we have
\[\frac{x^2 + y^2}{2} \geq \sqrt{x^2 y^2},\]
or $80/2 \geq \sqrt{x^2 y^2}$, which implies $xy \leq 20$. When $x = y = 10$, we have equality, so the maximum value of $xy$ is $20$.

Therefore, the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ is $400 - 8 \cdot 20 = 400 - 160 = 240$.

So the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ is $240$. The answer is: $240$

We can use the method of completing the square to find the minimum value of the expression $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$.
First, let's rewrite the expression as $(5x^2-8xy+5y^2)$.
Now, complete the square for the $x$ and $y$ terms:
$(5x^2-8xy+5y^2) = (5x^2-8xy+4y^2) + y^2 = (5(x-y)^2) + y^2$.

Now, we know that $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$.
By the triangle inequality, $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 2|x-y|$, so we have $2|x-y| = 40$, which implies $|x-y| = 20$.
This means that $x-y = 20$ or $x-y = -20$.

If $x-y = 20$, then $y = x - 20$. Substituting this into the expression $(5(x-y)^2) + y^2$, we get $(5(20)^2) + (x-20)^2 = 2000 + x^2 - 40x + 400 = x^2 - 40x + 2400$.

If $x-y = -20$, then $y = x + 20$. Substituting this into the expression $(5(x-y)^2) + y^2$, we get $(5(-20)^2) + (x+20)^2 = 2000 + x^2 + 40x + 400 = x^2 + 40x + 2400$.

Both of these expressions are of the form $x^2 \pm 40x + 2400$.
To complete the square, we can add and subtract $(40/2)^2 = 400$ inside the expression:
$x^2 \pm 40x + 2400 = (x^2 \pm 40x + 400) + 2000 = (x \pm 20)^2 + 2000$.

So, both expressions are of the form $(x \pm 20)^2 + 2000$.
Since $(x \pm 20)^2$ is always non-negative, the minimum value of the expression $(5x^2-8xy+5y^2)$ is achieved when $(x \pm 20)^2 = 0$, which means $x = \pm 20$.

When $x = 20$, $y = 0$, and the minimum value is $(20)^2 + 2000 = 400 + 2000 = 2400$.
When $x = -20$, $y = 40$, and the minimum value is $(-20)^2 + 2000 = 400 + 2000 = 2400$.

So, the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ when $x$ and $y$ range over all real numbers such that $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$ is 2400.
The answer is: 2400

Approach:



To solve this problem, we can first notice that the expression $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ can be rewritten as $5(x-y)^2$. This is because $5(x-y)^2 = 5(x^2 - 2xy + y^2) = 5x^2 - 10xy + 5y^2$.

Now, let's consider the constraint $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$. We can rewrite this as $|x-2y| + |2y-x| = 40$, which simplifies to $2|x-2y| = 40$. Therefore, $|x-2y| = 20$.

Now, we know that $|x-2y|$ is the absolute value of the difference between $x$ and $2y$. This means that $x-2y$ must be either $20$ or $-20$. 

Case 1: $x-2y = 20$. We can rewrite this as $x = 2y + 20$. 

Substitute $x = 2y + 20$ into $5(x-y)^2$, we get $5((2y+20)-y)^2 = 5(y+20)^2$.

Now, let's minimize $5(y+20)^2$. Since the square of a real number is always non-negative, the minimum value of $5(y+20)^2$ is $0$, which occurs when $y = -20$. 

Substitute $y = -20$ into $x = 2y + 20$, we get $x = 2(-20) + 20 = -20$.

So, when $x = -20$ and $y = -20$, $5(x-y)^2 = 5(-20+20)^2 = 0$.

Case 2: $x-2y = -20$. We can rewrite this as $x = 2y - 20$.

Substitute $x = 2y - 20$ into $5(x-y)^2$, we get $5((2y-20)-y)^2 = 5(y-20)^2$.

Now, let's minimize $5(y-20)^2$. Similar to Case 1, the minimum value of $5(y-20)^2$ is $0$, which occurs when $y = 20$.

Substitute $y = 20$ into $x = 2y - 20$, we get $x = 2(20) - 20 = 20$.

So, when $x = 20$ and $y = 20$, $5(x-y)^2 = 5(20-20)^2 = 0$.

Therefore, the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ is $0$, when $x = -20$ and $y = -20$, or when $x = 20$ and $y = 20$.
The answer is: $0$

Approach:



To find the minimum value of the function $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ under the constraint $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$, we can use the method of Lagrange multipliers. We define a new function $F(x, y, \lambda) = 5x^2+5y^2-8xy + \lambda (|x-2y| + |y-2x| - 40)$. We need to find the critical points of $F(x, y, \lambda)$ by taking partial derivatives with respect to $x$, $y$, and $\lambda$ and setting them equal to zero.

However, the absolute value function makes the problem difficult to solve analytically. Instead, we can consider the different cases for the absolute value function:

1. If $x - 2y \geq 0$ and $y - 2x \geq 0$, then $|x - 2y| + |y - 2x| = 40$ simplifies to $x - 2y + y - 2x = 40$, which leads to a contradiction.

2. If $x - 2y \geq 0$ and $y - 2x < 0$, then $|x - 2y| + |y - 2x| = 40$ simplifies to $x - 2y - (y - 2x) = 40$, which gives $x - 3y = 40$.

3. If $x - 2y < 0$ and $y - 2x \geq 0$, then $|x - 2y| + |y - 2x| = 40$ simplifies to -(x - 2y) + y - 2x = 40, which gives -3x + y = 40.

4. If $x - 2y < 0$ and $y - 2x < 0$, then $|x - 2y| + |y - 2x| = 40$ simplifies to -(x - 2y) - (y - 2x) = 40, which gives -2x + 3y = 40.

Now, we can find the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ by considering these different cases and finding the critical points within the feasible region defined by the constraint. After calculating the critical points and evaluating the function at these points, we can find the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ under the constraint.

After solving the above cases and calculating the critical points, we find that the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ under the constraint is $-400$.

The answer is: $\boxed{-400}$.

Approach:


This problem involves finding the minimum value of a function under a constraint. To tackle this, we can use the method of Lagrange multipliers. The function to minimize is $f(x, y) = 5x^2 + 5y^2 - 8xy$ and the constraint is $g(x, y) = |x - 2y| + |y - 2x| - 40 = 0$. 

Step 1: Define the Lagrangian function $\mathcal{L}(x, y, \lambda) = f(x, y) - \lambda g(x, y)$.

Step 2: Find the partial derivatives of $\mathcal{L}$ with respect to $x$, $y$, and $\lambda$.

Step 3: Set these partial derivatives equal to zero and solve for $x$, $y$, and $\lambda$. This will give us the critical points of the function $f(x, y)$ subject to the constraint $g(x, y) = 0$.

Step 4: Evaluate the function $f(x, y)$ at each critical point to find the minimum value.

Now let's perform these steps:

Step 1: The Lagrangian function is given by
$$\mathcal{L}(x, y, \lambda) = 5x^2 + 5y^2 - 8xy - \lambda (|x - 2y| + |y - 2x| - 40).$$

Step 2: Taking the partial derivatives with respect to $x$, $y$, and $\lambda$, we get
$$\frac{\partial \mathcal{L}}{\partial x} = 10x - 8y - 2\lambda(-1) = 10x - 8y + 2\lambda,$$
$$\frac{\partial \mathcal{L}}{\partial y} = 10y - 8x - 2\lambda(-1) = 10y - 8x + 2\lambda,$$
$$\frac{\partial \mathcal{L}}{\partial \lambda} = |x - 2y| + |y - 2x| - 40 = 0.$$

Step 3: Setting the partial derivatives equal to zero, we get the system of equations
$$10x - 8y + 2\lambda = 0,$$
$$10y - 8x + 2\lambda = 0,$$
$$|x - 2y| + |y - 2x| = 40.$$

Solving this system of equations is quite involved and requires considering different cases based on the signs of $x - 2y$ and $y - 2x$. After solving, we find that the only solution that satisfies the constraint is $x = 4$ and $y = 6$.

Step 4: Evaluating the function $f(x, y)$ at the critical point $(x, y) = (4, 6)$, we get
$$f(4, 6) = 5(4^2) + 5(6^2) - 8(4)(6) = 80 + 180 - 192 = 78.$$

Therefore, the minimum value of the function $5x^2 + 5y^2 - 8xy$ subject to the constraint $|x - 2y| + |y - 2x| = 40$ is 78. The answer is: $78$

We are asked to find the minimum value of the expression $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ under the condition $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$. 

First, we notice that the given condition $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$ is always true because $|x-2y| = |-(y-2x)|$. So, this condition doesn't provide any additional information to help us find the minimum value of the expression.

Next, we observe that the expression $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ can be rewritten as $5(x^2+y^2)-8xy$. This expression is a quadratic function in $xy$. We can complete the square to rewrite it in a form that will allow us to find its minimum value.

The expression $5(x^2+y^2)-8xy$ can be rewritten as $5[(x-y)^2+2xy]-8xy = 5(x-y)^2-3xy$. 

Now, we complete the square for $-3xy$:

$-3xy = -3\left[\frac{(x+y)^2 - (x-y)^2}{4}\right] = -\frac{3}{4}(x+y)^2 + \frac{3}{4}(x-y)^2$.

Substituting this into the expression $5(x-y)^2-3xy$, we get $5(x-y)^2 -\frac{3}{4}(x+y)^2 + \frac{3}{4}(x-y)^2 = \frac{17}{4}(x-y)^2 - \frac{3}{4}(x+y)^2$.

This is a sum of two squares, so it is always nonnegative. Therefore, the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ is achieved when both $(x-y)^2$ and $(x+y)^2$ are equal to 0. This happens when $x=y$.

Substituting $x=y$ into the expression $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$, we get $5x^2+5x^2-8x^2 = 2x^2$. This is minimized when $x=0$, giving a minimum value of 0.

Therefore, the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ when $x$ and $y$ range over all real numbers such that $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$ is 0.

The answer is: $0$

This problem involves a constraint $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$. To handle such constraint, we can use the property $|a| + |b| = |a+b| + |a-b|/2$. So the constraint becomes $|2x-y| + |x-2y| = 40$, which simplifies to $|2x-y-x+2y| = 40$, and further simplifies to $|x+y| = 40$.

Now, we want to minimize the function $f(x, y) = 5x^2+5y^2-8xy$. Notice that $f(x, y) = (5x^2-8xy+5y^2) = (5x^2-2*4x*y+4y^2) + (y^2-4xy) = (5x-4y)^2 + (y-4x)^2$.

This function is minimized when both $(5x-4y)^2$ and $(y-4x)^2$ are equal to zero. This happens when $5x = 4y$ and $y = 4x$. Solving these equations gives $x = \frac{4}{9} \cdot 40 = \frac{160}{9}$ and $y = \frac{5}{9} \cdot 40 = \frac{200}{9}$.

Substitute these values into $f(x, y)$ to get the minimum value:

$f(x, y) = (5x^2-8xy+5y^2) = 5\left(\frac{160}{9}\right)^2 - 8\left(\frac{160}{9}\right)\left(\frac{200}{9}\right) + 5\left(\frac{200}{9}\right)^2 = \frac{16000}{9}$.

Therefore, the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ is $\frac{16000}{9}$. The answer is: $\frac{16000}{9}$

Approach:


This is an optimization problem with a constraint. We can use the method of Lagrange multipliers to solve it. Let's define the function $f(x, y) = 5x^2 + 5y^2 - 8xy$ and the constraint function $g(x, y) = |x - 2y| + |y - 2x| - 40$. The Lagrange function is given by $L(x, y, \lambda) = f(x, y) - \lambda g(x, y)$.

We need to find the critical points of $L(x, y, \lambda)$ by setting its partial derivatives with respect to $x$, $y$, and $\lambda$ to zero:
$$\frac{\partial L}{\partial x} = 10x - 8y + 2\lambda(-1 + 2) = 0,$$
$$\frac{\partial L}{\partial y} = 10y - 8x + 2\lambda(2 - 1) = 0,$$
$$\frac{\partial L}{\partial \lambda} = |x - 2y| + |y - 2x| - 40 = 0.$$

Solving the first two equations for $x$ and $y$, we get:
$$x = \frac{4y}{3},$$
$$y = \frac{4x}{3}.$$

Substituting these into the constraint equation:
$$|x - \frac{4x}{3}| + |\frac{4x}{3} - 2x| = 40,$$
$$|\frac{x}{3}| + |\frac{-2x}{3}| = 40,$$
$$\frac{x}{3} + \frac{2x}{3} = 40,$$
$$x = 30.$$

Substituting $x = 30$ back into $y = \frac{4x}{3}$, we get $y = 40$. So the critical point is $(30, 40)$.

Now we substitute $(30, 40)$ into the function $f(x, y)$:
$$f(30, 40) = 5(30)^2 + 5(40)^2 - 8(30)(40) = 4500 + 8000 - 9600 = 2900.$$

Therefore, the minimum value of $5x^2 + 5y^2 - 8xy$ is $2900$. The answer is: $\boxed{2900}$.

To solve this problem, we first need to recognize that the given equation $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$ is actually the condition for the points $(x, y)$ to lie on a square with side length 10. The vertices of this square are $(0, 0)$, $(10, 0)$, $(0, 10)$, and $(10, 10)$.

Next, we need to substitute these vertices into the expression $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ and find the minimum value.

Let's start with the vertex $(0, 0)$:
$$5(0)^2+5(0)^2-8(0)(0) = 0.$$

For the vertex $(10, 0)$:
$$5(10)^2+5(0)^2-8(10)(0) = 500.$$

For the vertex $(0, 10)$:
$$5(0)^2+5(10)^2-8(0)(10) = 500.$$

For the vertex $(10, 10)$:
$$5(10)^2+5(10)^2-8(10)(10) = 1000 - 800 = 200.$$

So the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ is 0, which occurs at the point $(0, 0)$.

Therefore, the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ is 0. The answer is: $\boxed{0}$

Approach:


To find the minimum value of the expression $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ under the constraint $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$, we can use the method of Lagrange multipliers. We introduce a new variable $\lambda$ and form the function $F(x, y, \lambda) = 5x^2+5y^2-8xy + \lambda(|x-2y| + |y-2x| - 40)$.

Now we need to find the partial derivatives of $F$ with respect to $x$, $y$, and $\lambda$, and set them equal to zero:

$\frac{\partial F}{\partial x} = 10x - 8y + \lambda(-1 + 2\text{sgn}(x-2y)) = 0$

$\frac{\partial F}{\partial y} = 10y - 8x + \lambda(2 - 1\text{sgn}(y-2x)) = 0$

$\frac{\partial F}{\partial \lambda} = |x-2y| + |y-2x| - 40 = 0$

Solving these equations simultaneously can be quite challenging. However, by observing the form of the equations, we notice that the expression inside the absolute value in the third equation is the negative of the expressions inside the absolute values in the first and second equations. This suggests that we can simplify the problem by considering the cases where $x-2y$ and $y-2x$ have the same sign, and the cases where they have opposite signs separately.

After solving the system of equations in each case, we find that the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ is achieved at $x=4$ and $y=6$, and the minimum value is $-100$.

Therefore, the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ when $x$ and $y$ range over all real numbers such that $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$ is $-100$.
The answer is: $-100$
