Question (hint: positive numerical answer):
"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"
Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:


The given equation is of the form $AB=0$, so $A=0$ or $B=0$. We therefore have two cases to consider.

Case 1: $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$.
Since squares of real numbers are always nonnegative, the only way for the sum of two nonnegative numbers to be zero is if both numbers are zero. Therefore, we have $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$.
These equations imply that $x + y = \pm 10$ and $x - y = \pm 10$, which can be solved to give $x = \pm 5, y = \pm 5$.

Case 2: $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$.
Again, this implies $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$, which can be solved to give $x = \pm 8, y = \pm 8$.

Plotting these points on a coordinate plane, we see that they form a square with side length 10 units. The area of this square is $10^2 = 100$. Therefore, the area of the convex polygon is 100 square units. The answer is: $100$

Question (hint: positive numerical answer):
"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"
Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:


The expression $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2)$ is equal to zero if and only if either $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$, $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$, $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$, or $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$.
This happens if and only if $|x+y| = 10$, $|x-y| = 10$, $|x| = 8$, or $|y| = 8$.
The first two equations give us the lines $x+y = \pm 10$ and $x-y = \pm 10$. The last two equations give us the lines $x = \pm 8$ and $y = \pm 8$.
These lines form a square with side length $20$. The area of this square is $20^2 = 400$. So, the area of the convex polygon is 400. The answer is: $400$

Question (hint: positive numerical answer):
"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"
Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:


The product of two numbers is zero if and only if at least one of the numbers is zero. Therefore, for the equation to hold, either $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$.
The first equation is satisfied if and only if $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$, which are the equations of two lines. The second equation is satisfied if and only if $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$, which are the equations of four lines.
The solution region is thus the intersection of the regions defined by $\vert x + y \vert = 10$, $\vert x - y \vert = 10$, $\vert x \vert = 8$, and $\vert y \vert = 8$. This intersection forms a square with side length 16. Therefore, the area of the convex polygon is $16^2 = 256$. The answer is: $256$

Question (hint: positive numerical answer):
"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"
Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:


For the product of two numbers to be zero, at least one of the numbers must be zero. So, we have two cases:
Case 1: $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2) = 0$. This happens when both $\vert x + y \vert - 10 = 0$ and $\vert x - y \vert - 10 = 0$, which implies $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. The solutions to these equations are all points of the form $(x, y)$ where the distance between the points $(x, y)$ and $(0, 0)$ is 10. This forms a square with side length 20.
Case 2: $((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$. This happens when both $\vert x \vert - 8 = 0$ and $\vert y \vert - 8 = 0$, which implies $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$. The solutions to these equations are all points of the form $(x, y)$ where the distance between the points $(x, y)$ and the origin $(0, 0)$ is 8. This forms a square with side length 16.
The convex polygon enclosed by the points satisfying the given equation is the intersection of the two squares from the two cases. The intersection of the two squares is also a square, but with side length equal to the side length of the smaller square, which is 16.
To find the area of the square, we simply square the side length: $16^2 = 256$.
Therefore, the area of the convex polygon is 256 square units.
The answer is: $256$

Question (hint: positive numerical answer):
"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"
Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:


The product of two numbers is zero if and only if at least one of the numbers is zero. Therefore, the given equation is equivalent to
\[((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + (\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2) = 0 \quad \text{or} \quad ((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + (\vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0.\]
The first equation implies that $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$.
The second equation implies that $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$.
Solving the first equation, we have four cases to consider:
1) $x + y = 10$ and $x - y = 10$, which gives us $x = 10$ and $y = 0$.
2) $x + y = 10$ and $x - y = -10$, which gives us $x = 0$ and $y = 10$.
3) $x + y = -10$ and $x - y = 10$, which gives us $x = -10$ and $y = 0$.
4) $x + y = -10$ and $x - y = -10$, which gives us $x = 0$ and $y = -10$.
Solving the second equation, we have four more cases:
5) $x = 8$ and $y = 8$.
6) $x = 8$ and $y = -8$.
7) $x = -8$ and $y = 8$.
8) $x = -8$ and $y = -8$.
The eight points $(x, y)$ that satisfy the equations are:
(10, 0), (0, 10), (-10, 0), (0, -10), (8, 8), (8, -8), (-8, 8), and (-8, -8).
These points form a square with side length 20. The area of this square is $20^2 = 400$. Therefore, the area of the convex polygon is 400 square units.
The value of the area of the convex polygon is $\boxed{400}$.
The answer is: $\boxed{400}$.

Question (hint: positive numerical answer):
"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"
Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:


The product of two real numbers is zero if and only if at least one of the numbers is zero. Therefore, we have two cases:

1. Either $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + (\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + (\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$.
2. Both of the above are zero at the same time.

From the first case, we get that $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$, which implies that $x + y = \pm 10$ and $x - y = \pm 10$. Solving these systems of equations, we find that the points satisfying this case are $(0,10)$, $(0,-10)$, $(10,0)$, and $(-10,0)$.

From the second case, we get that $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$, which implies that $x = \pm 8$ and $y = \pm 8$. Solving these systems of equations, we find that the points satisfying this case are $(8,8)$, $(8,-8)$, $(-8,8)$, and $(-8,-8)$.

Plotting these points, we find that they form a square with side length $20$. The area of this square is $20^2 = 400$. Therefore, the area of the convex polygon is $400$.
The answer is: $400$.

"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"
Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:


The product of two factors is equal to zero if and only if at least one of the factors is zero. Therefore, the equation
\[((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0\]
is satisfied if and only if either
\[((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2) = 0\]
or
\[((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0.\]
The first equation is satisfied if and only if $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$,
which simplifies to $x + y = \pm 10$ and $x - y = \pm 10$.
Solving these equations, we find that the points satisfying this system of equations are $(\pm 10, 0)$ and $(0, \pm 10)$.
The second equation is satisfied if and only if $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$,
which simplifies to $x = \pm 8$ and $y = \pm 8$.
Solving these equations, we find that the points satisfying this system of equations are $(\pm 8, 0)$, $(0, \pm 8)$, $(\pm 8, \pm 8)$.
Putting all these points together, we find that the polygon is a square with side length 10.
The area of this square is $10^2 = 100$.
The answer is: $100$.

"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"
Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:


The expression $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ is true if either of the two factors is zero.
If $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$, then $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. This gives us the lines $x + y = \pm 10$ and $x - y = \pm 10$.
If $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$, then $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$. This gives us the lines $x = \pm 8$ and $y = \pm 8$.
These lines enclose a rectangle with side lengths $20$ and $16$, so the area of the rectangle is $20 \times 16 = 320$. The answer is: $320$

Question (hint: positive numerical answer):
"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"
Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:


First, let's analyze the equation $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + (\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ and $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + (\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$.

The equation $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + (\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ implies that $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. This means that $x + y = \pm 10$ and $x - y = \pm 10$. Solving these four equations, we get the vertices of the square: $(8, 2)$, $(8, -2)$, $(-8, -2)$, $(-8, 2)$.

The equation $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + (\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ implies that $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$. This means that $x = \pm 8$ and $y = \pm 8$. So we have another square with vertices: $(8, 8)$, $(-8, 8)$, $(-8, -8)$, $(8, -8)$.

The intersection of these two squares is a smaller square with side length 8 and vertices: $(8, 2)$, $(8, -2)$, $(-8, -2)$, $(-8, 2)$.

The area of this square is $8^2 = 64$. So the area of the convex polygon is $\boxed{64}$.
The answer is: $64$

"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"
Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:


To find the area of the convex polygon, we need to find the vertices of the polygon.
The equation $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ tells us that either $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$.
If $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$, then $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. This implies $x + y = \pm 10$ and $x - y = \pm 10$. Solving these equations, we get the vertices of the polygon: $(10, 0)$, $(0, 10)$, $(-10, 0)$, $(0, -10)$, $(0, 10)$, $(10, 0)$, $(0, -10)$, and $(-10, 0)$. These points form a square with side length 20.
The area of the square is $20^2 = 400$.
Therefore, the area of the convex polygon is 400.
The answer is: $400$
