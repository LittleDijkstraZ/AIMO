Question (hint: positive numerical answer):
"For how many positive integers $m$ does the equation \[\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}\] have $4$ distinct solutions?"
Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:


The equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has 4 distinct solutions if and only if $\frac{m}{100}$ is equal to 2.

So we solve the equation $\frac{m}{100} = 2$ to find $m$.

Multiplying both sides of the equation by 100, we get $m = 200$.

Therefore, the number of positive integers $m$ for which the equation has 4 distinct solutions is 1, since there is only one positive integer that makes $\frac{m}{100}$ equal to 2, which is 200.
The value of $m$ is 200. The answer is: $\boxed{1}$

Question (hint: positive numerical answer):
"For how many positive integers $m$ does the equation \[\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}\] have $4$ distinct solutions?"
Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:


The number of distinct solutions to the equation $| |x-1| - 2| = \frac{m}{100}$ is equal to $4$ if and only if $\frac{m}{100} = 2$. This is because the function $| |x-1| - 2|$ is a piecewise function with a characteristic "V" shape, with the vertex at $(1, 2)$. For the function to have $4$ distinct solutions, the right arm of the "V" must be level with the x-axis. This occurs when the equation is set equal to $2$.

So, we solve the equation $\frac{m}{100} = 2$ for $m$:
\[m = 2 \cdot 100 = 200.\]

Therefore, there is only $1$ positive integer $m$ for which the equation has $4$ distinct solutions, and that integer is $200$. The answer is: $1$. The answer is: 1

Question (hint: positive numerical answer):
"For how many positive integers $m$ does the equation \[\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}\] have $4$ distinct solutions?"
Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:



The equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has four distinct solutions.
This means that the absolute value equation $\vert x-1 \vert -2=\frac{m}{100}$ or $\vert x-1 \vert -2=-\frac{m}{100}$ has two pairs of solutions (one positive and one negative in each pair).

Let's first consider the equation $\vert x-1 \vert -2=\frac{m}{100}$.
Adding 2 to both sides, we get $\vert x-1 \vert=\frac{m}{100}+2$.

For this equation to have two distinct solutions, $\frac{m}{100}+2>0$.
This simplifies to $m>-200$.

Next, consider the equation $\vert x-1 \vert -2=-\frac{m}{100}$.
Adding 2 to both sides, we get $\vert x-1 \vert =2-\frac{m}{100}$.

For this equation to have two distinct solutions, $2-\frac{m}{100}>0$.
This simplifies to $m<200$.

Therefore, the positive integer $m$ must satisfy $-200<m<200$.
The positive integers in this range are 1, 2, ..., 199.
Counting the numbers gives us 199 positive integers.

So, the number of positive integers $m$ for which the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has four distinct solutions is 199. The answer is: $199$.

Question (hint: positive numerical answer):
"For how many positive integers $m$ does the equation \[\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}\] have $4$ distinct solutions?"
Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:


To have 4 distinct solutions, the right-hand side $\frac{m}{100}$ must be equal to either $2$ or $0$. 
If $\frac{m}{100}=2$, then $m=200$.
If $\frac{m}{100}=0$, then $m=0$. 
But the problem asks for positive integers $m$, so $m=200$ is the only valid solution.
The answer is: $\boxed{1}$.
The answer is $\boxed{1}$.

Question (hint: positive numerical answer):
"For how many positive integers $m$ does the equation \[\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}\] have $4$ distinct solutions?"
Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:


To solve this problem, we need to understand the properties of the absolute value function.
The equation $|x - 1| - 2 = \frac{m}{100}$ has four distinct solutions if and only if the value $\frac{m}{100}$ is between 0 and 2.
Therefore, we have $0 < \frac{m}{100} < 2$, which simplifies to $0 < m < 200$.
The positive integers $m$ that satisfy this inequality are $1, 2, \ldots, 199$.
The number of these positive integers is $199$.
The answer is: 199

Question (hint: positive numerical answer):
"For how many positive integers $m$ does the equation \[\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}\] have $4$ distinct solutions?"
Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:


The equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has four distinct solutions means that the right side of the equation $\frac{m}{100}$ must be in the range $(0, 2)$. This is because the left side of the equation, $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert$, is a function that has a value of $0$ at $x=3$ and $x=-1$, a value of $2$ at $x=5$ and $x=-3$, and the function oscillates between $0$ and $2$ for values of $x$ in between these points.

So we want to find how many positive integers $m$ are in the interval $(0, 200)$. There are exactly 200 such integers. However, we need to exclude those for which the equation has less than four distinct solutions.

The equation has less than four distinct solutions if $\frac{m}{100}$ is equal to either $0$ or $2$. This happens when $m=0$ or $m=200$. So we need to exclude these two values.

Therefore, the number of positive integers $m$ for which the equation has four distinct solutions is $200 - 2 = 198$. The answer is: $198$

Question (hint: positive numerical answer):
"For how many positive integers $m$ does the equation \[\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}\] have $4$ distinct solutions?"
Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:



The equation $| |x-1|-2|=\frac{m}{100}$ has 4 distinct solutions if and only if $\frac{m}{100}$ is between 1 and 2 (not inclusive). This is because the function $| |x-1|-2|$ has its maximum value of 2 and minimum value of 0, and the equation has 4 solutions when $\frac{m}{100}$ is within this range.

If $\frac{m}{100}$ is between 1 and 2, then $m$ must be between 100 and 200. Therefore, the number of positive integers $m$ that satisfy the condition is $200-100-1=99$. 

So, there are 99 positive integers $m$ such that the equation has 4 distinct solutions. The answer is: $99$

Question (hint: positive numerical answer):
"For how many positive integers $m$ does the equation \[\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}\] have $4$ distinct solutions?"
Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:


The equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has $4$ distinct solutions, we know that $\frac{m}{100}$ must be equal to $2$ because the absolute value function "flattens" at its value, so we need $\frac{m}{100} = 2$.

Solving for $m$ gives $m = 200$.

Therefore, there is only one positive integer $m$ that satisfies the condition, which is $m = 200$. The answer is: $\boxed{1}$
