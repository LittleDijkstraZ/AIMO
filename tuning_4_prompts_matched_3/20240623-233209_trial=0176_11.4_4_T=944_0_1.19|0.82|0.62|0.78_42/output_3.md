"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"
Analyze this problem and think step by step to come to a solution with programs. After solving the problem, output the final numerical answer within \boxed{}.

Assistant:

 The equation $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + (\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ and $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + (\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ are both satisfied if and only if $\vert x + y \vert = 10$, $\vert x - y \vert = 10$, $\vert x \vert = 8$, and $\vert y \vert = 8$.
The solutions to $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ are given by the lines $x + y = 10$ and $x + y = -10$. Similarly, the solutions to $\vert x - y \vert = 10$ are given by the lines $x - y = 10$ and $x - y = -10$, $\vert x \vert = 8$ gives the lines $x = 8$ and $x = -8$, and $\vert y \vert = 8$ gives the lines $y = 8$ and $y = -8$.
The eight lines intersect to form a square with side length 16. Therefore, the area of the convex polygon is $16^2 = 256$.
The answer is: $256$

Below is a math problem you are to solve (positive numerical answer!):
"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"
Analyze this problem and think step by step to come to a solution with programs. After solving the problem, output the final numerical answer within \boxed{}.

Assistant:


The given equation is a product of two expressions equal to zero, so either $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$.

If $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$, then $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. This implies that $x + y = \pm 10$ and $x - y = \pm 10$. Solving these equations gives us the vertices of the square: $(8, 2)$, $(8, -2)$, $(-8, -2)$, and $(-8, 2)$.

If $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$, then $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$. This implies that $x = \pm 8$ and $y = \pm 8$.

So the points $\left(x, y\right)$ that satisfy the given equation form a square with side length 16. The area of the square is $16^2 = 256$. The answer is: $256$

Below is a math problem you are to solve (positive numerical answer!):
"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"

Assistant:

 The equation $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ is satisfied only when at least one of the two factors is zero.
The first factor is zero when $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ or $\vert x - y \vert = 10$, which are the equations of two circles in the $xy$-plane.
The second factor is zero when $\vert x \vert = 8$ or $\vert y \vert = 8$, which are the equations of two more circles in the $xy$-plane.
Therefore, the points that satisfy the equation form a rectangle with side lengths 16 and 20. The area of this rectangle is $16 \times 20 = 320$.
The answer is: $320$

Below is a math problem you are to solve (positive numerical answer!):
"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"

 The equation $AB = 0$ is satisfied if and only if $A = 0$ or $B = 0$. So, the given equation is satisfied if and only if either $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$.
The first equation implies that $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$, which means $x + y = \pm 10$ and $x - y = \pm 10$. Solving these equations gives us the vertices of the square: $(8,2)$, $(8,-2)$, $(-8,2)$, and $(-8,-2)$.
The second equation implies that $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$, which means $x = \pm 8$ and $y = \pm 8$. Solving these equations gives us the vertices of the square: $(8,8)$, $(8,-8)$, $(-8,8)$, and $(-8,-8)$.
The convex polygon formed by these points is a 8x8 square. The area of a square is side length squared, so the area of this square is $8^2 = 64$.
Therefore, the area of the convex polygon is 64. The answer is: $64$

Below is a math problem you are to solve (positive numerical answer!):
"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"
Analyze this problem and think step by step to come to a solution with programs. After solving the problem, output the final numerical answer within \boxed{}.

Assistant:

 To solve this problem, we need to analyze the given equation and determine the conditions under which it equals zero. The equation is:
$$((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0.$$
This equation equals zero if either of the two factors equals zero.

The first factor equals zero if either $(\vert x + y \vert - 10) = 0$ or $(\vert x - y \vert - 10) = 0$, which means $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ or $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. This represents a diamond shape centered at the origin with side length 10 units.

The second factor equals zero if either $(\vert x \vert - 8) = 0$ or $(\vert y \vert - 8) = 0$, which means $\vert x \vert = 8$ or $\vert y \vert = 8$. This represents a square with side length 16 units centered at the origin.

The intersection of these two shapes is a square with side length 8 units, centered at the origin. Therefore, the area of the convex polygon is the area of the square, which is $8^2 = 64$. The answer is: $64$

Below is a math problem you are to solve (positive numerical answer!):
"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"
Analyze this problem and think step by step to come to a solution with programs. After solving the problem, output the final numerical answer within \boxed{}.

Assistant:

 The equation $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ implies that either $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2) = 0$ or $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$.
The first equation implies that $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$, which means that $x + y = \pm 10$ and $x - y = \pm 10$.
The second equation implies that $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$, which means that $x = \pm 8$ and $y = \pm 8$.
The solutions to these equations are the vertices of a square with side length 16.
The area of this square is $16^2 = 256$.
So the area of the convex polygon is 256.
The answer is: $256$

Below is a math problem you are to solve (positive numerical answer!):
"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"
Analyze this problem and think step by step to come to a solution with programs. After solving the problem, output the final numerical answer within \boxed{}.

Assistant:

 To find the area of the convex polygon, we need to first understand the equation $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + (\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + (\vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$.
The equation is equal to zero when either of the factors is zero. 
For the first factor to be zero, we need $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. 
For the second factor to be zero, we need $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$.
These equations describe a square with side length 16 centered at the origin.
To find the area of the square, we can simply square the side length: $16^2 = 256$.
So, the area of the convex polygon is 256. The answer is: $256$
