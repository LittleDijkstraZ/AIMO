Question (hint: positive numerical answer):
"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"
Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:



First, we see that the product of two numbers is zero if and only if at least one of the numbers is zero. Thus, we have two cases to consider:

1. $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ and $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ and $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$.
2. $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ and $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ and $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$.

For the first case, we have $\vert x + y \vert = 10$, $\vert x \vert = 8$, and $\vert y \vert = 8$. This gives us the lines $x + y = 10$, $x = 8$, and $y = 8$.

For the second case, we have $\vert x - y \vert = 10$, $\vert x \vert = 8$, and $\vert y \vert = 8$. This gives us the lines $x - y = 10$, $x = 8$, and $y = 8$.

The intersection points of these lines are: $(8,2)$, $(8,-2)$, $(6,8)$, and $(10,0)$.

The area of the convex polygon is a square with side length 8 units, so its area is $8^2 = 64$ square units. The answer is: $64$

Question (hint: positive numerical answer):
"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"
Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:


The product of two numbers is zero if and only if at least one of the numbers is zero. Therefore, the equation $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + (\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + (\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ must be true for all points $(x, y)$ in the polygon.

If $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + (\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$, then both $\vert x + y \vert - 10 = 0$ and $\vert x - y \vert - 10 = 0$. This means $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. Solving these absolute value equations gives us four lines: $x + y = 10$, $x + y = -10$, $x - y = 10$, and $x - y = -10$.

If $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + (\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$, then both $\vert x \vert - 8 = 0$ and $\vert y \vert - 8 = 0$. This means $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$. Solving these absolute value equations gives us four lines: $x = 8$, $x = -8$, $y = 8$, and $y = -8$.

The lines $x + y = 10$, $x + y = -10$, $x - y = 10$, and $x - y = -10$ form a square with side length $10\sqrt{2}$ (because the distance between the lines $x + y = 10$ and $x + y = -10$ is $20$ divided by $\sqrt{2}$, and similarly for the lines $x - y = 10$ and $x - y = -10$). The lines $x = 8$, $x = -8$, $y = 8$, and $y = -8$ form a square with side length $16$.

The area of the larger square is $(10\sqrt{2})^2 = 200$, and the area of the smaller square is $16^2 = 256$. The polygon enclosed by these lines is the intersection of these two squares, so it is a smaller square. Therefore, the area of the convex polygon is the area of the smaller square, which is $256$. The answer is: $256$.

Question (hint: positive numerical answer):
"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"
Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:



The product of two numbers is zero if and only if at least one of the numbers is zero. So, the equation $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ is satisfied if and only if at least one of the following two conditions is satisfied:

1. $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$.
2. $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$.

For the first condition to be true, we must have both $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. This implies that $x + y = \pm 10$ and $x - y = \pm 10$. Solving these equations gives us the vertices of the square: $(8, 2)$, $(8, -2)$, $(-8, -2)$, and $(-8, 2)$.

For the second condition to be true, we must have both $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$. This implies that $x = \pm 8$ and $y = \pm 8$. Solving these equations gives us the vertices of the square: $(8, 8)$, $(8, -8)$, $(-8, -8)$, and $(-8, 8)$.

The convex polygon formed by the union of these two squares is a $4 \times 4$ square with side length 8. The area of this square is $8^2 = 64$. The answer is: $\boxed{64}$.

"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"
Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:


The product of two numbers is zero if and only if at least one of the numbers is zero. So, we have two cases to consider:

Case 1: $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$.
This can only happen if both $\vert x + y \vert - 10 = 0$ and $\vert x - y \vert - 10 = 0$.
So, we have $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$.
This means that $x + y = \pm 10$ and $x - y = \pm 10$.
Solving these equations, we get four lines: $x + y = 10$, $x + y = -10$, $x - y = 10$, and $x - y = -10$.

Case 2: $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$.
This can only happen if both $\vert x \vert - 8 = 0$ and $\vert y \vert - 8 = 0$.
So, we have $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$.
This means that $x = \pm 8$ and $y = \pm 8$.
So, we get four more lines: $x = 8$, $x = -8$, $y = 8$, and $y = -8$.

The eight lines enclose a square with side length 16. The area of this square is $16^2 = 256$. So, the area of the convex polygon is 256. The answer is: $256$

"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"
Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:


The product of two numbers is zero if and only if at least one of the numbers is zero. Therefore, the equation $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ is satisfied if either of the following conditions is satisfied:
1. $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$.
2. $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$.
The first condition is satisfied if and only if $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$, which implies that $x = 0$ and $y = 0$. The second condition is satisfied if and only if $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$, which implies that $x = 8$ or $x = -8$ and $y = 8$ or $y = -8$. Therefore, the points satisfying the equation are $(0, 0)$, $(8, 8)$, $(8, -8)$, and $(-8, -8)$. These points form a square with side length 16. The area of this square is $16^2 = 256$. Therefore, the area of the convex polygon is 256. The answer is: $256$

"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"
Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:


The product of two numbers is zero if and only if at least one of the numbers is zero. So, the equation is satisfied if either $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$, $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$, $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$, or $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$.
If $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$, then $\vert x + y \vert = 10$, which means $x + y = \pm 10$.
If $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$, then $\vert x - y \vert = 10$, which means $x - y = \pm 10$.
If $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$, then $\vert x \vert = 8$, which means $x = \pm 8$.
If $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$, then $\vert y \vert = 8$, which means $y = \pm 8$.
The four lines $x + y = 10$, $x + y = -10$, $x - y = 10$, $x - y = -10$, $x = 8$, $x = -8$, $y = 8$, and $y = -8$ form a square with side length 10. The area of this square is $10 \times 10 = 100$.
The answer is: $100$.

Question (hint: positive numerical answer):
"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"
Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:


The product of two numbers is zero if and only if at least one of the numbers is zero. This means that either $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$.

If $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$, then $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. This means that $x + y = \pm 10$ and $x - y = \pm 10$. Solving these four equations, we get the vertices of the square $(5,5)$, $(5,-5)$, $(-5,-5)$, and $(-5,5)$.

If $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$, then $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$. This means that $x = \pm 8$ and $y = \pm 8$. Solving these four equations, we get the vertices of the square $(8,8)$, $(8,-8)$, $(-8,-8)$, and $(-8,8)$.

Therefore, the points that satisfy the given equation are the vertices of two squares. The smaller square has side length 10 and the larger square has side length 16. The convex polygon formed by these points is a rectangle, and its area is the product of its length and width. The length is the side length of the larger square, which is 16, and the width is the side length of the smaller square, which is 10. Therefore, the area of the convex polygon is $16 \times 10 = 160$.
The answer is: $160$

"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"
Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:


The product of two numbers is zero if and only if at least one of the numbers is zero. So, the equation $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ is satisfied if and only if at least one of the following two conditions holds:

1. $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$.
2. $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$.

For the first condition to hold, we must have $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. This means $x + y = \pm 10$ and $x - y = \pm 10$. Solving these four equations, we get the vertices of the square are $(8, 2)$, $(8, -2)$, $(-8, 2)$, and $(-8, -2)$.

For the second condition to hold, we must have $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$. This means $x = \pm 8$ and $y = \pm 8$. Solving these four equations, we get the vertices of the square are $(8, 8)$, $(8, -8)$, $(-8, 8)$, and $(-8, -8)$.

The intersection of these two squares is the required convex polygon. This polygon is a square with side length $10$. The area of a square is the square of its side length, so the area of this square is $10^2 = 100$. The answer is: $\boxed{100}$

Question (hint: positive numerical answer):
"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"
Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:



The expression $ab = 0$ is equivalent to saying that at least one of $a$ or $b$ is equal to zero. Therefore, the given equation is equivalent to saying that either $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$, $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$, $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$, or $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$.

The equation $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ implies $\vert x + y \vert = 10$, which means $x + y = 10$ or $x + y = -10$. The equations $x + y = 10$ and $x + y = -10$ are parallel lines. Similarly, the equations $\vert x - y \vert = 10$, $\vert x \vert = 8$, and $\vert y \vert = 8$ represent other parallel lines.

The intersection points of these lines are the vertices of the polygon. By plotting these lines, we find that the vertices of the polygon are $(8,8)$, $(-8,8)$, $(-8,-8)$, and $(8,-8)$.

The polygon is a square with side length $16$. The area of the square is therefore $16^2 = 256$.
The answer is: $256$
