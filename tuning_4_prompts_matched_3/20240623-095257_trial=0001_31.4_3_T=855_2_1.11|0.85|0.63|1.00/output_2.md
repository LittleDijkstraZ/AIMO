Question (hint: positive numerical answer):
"For how many positive integers $m$ does the equation \[\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}\] have $4$ distinct solutions?"
Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:


The equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has 4 distinct solutions if and only if $\frac{m}{100}=1$. This is because the expression on the left side of the equation, $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert$, oscillates between 0 and 4, and it equals 1 exactly twice.

If $\frac{m}{100}=1$, then we can solve for $m$ by multiplying both sides of the equation by 100 to get $m=100$.

Therefore, there is only one positive integer $m$ that makes the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ have 4 distinct solutions, and that integer is $100$.
The value of $m$ is $100$. The answer is: $100$

Question (hint: positive numerical answer):
"For how many positive integers $m$ does the equation \[\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}\] have $4$ distinct solutions?"
Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:


The equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has four distinct solutions if and only if $\frac{m}{100}=2$.

Solving the equation $\frac{m}{100}=2$, we get $m=200$.

So there is only one positive integer $m$ that makes the equation have four distinct solutions.
The value of $m$ is 200. The answer is: $1$

"For how many positive integers $m$ does the equation \[\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}\] have $4$ distinct solutions?"
Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:


The equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has 4 distinct solutions if and only if $\frac{m}{100}$ is equal to 2. This is because the expression inside the absolute value, $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert$, takes on the value of 2 exactly four times. Therefore, we have $\frac{m}{100}=2$, which implies $m=200$. So, there is only one positive integer $m$ for which the equation has 4 distinct solutions, and that is 200. The answer is: 1

Question (hint: positive numerical answer):
"For how many positive integers $m$ does the equation \[\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}\] have $4$ distinct solutions?"
Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:


The equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has $4$ distinct solutions.
We know that the absolute value function $\vert \cdot \vert$ makes all values positive, so the left side of the equation is always nonnegative.
This means that $\frac{m}{100}$ must be positive, so $m$ must be positive.
Therefore, $m$ is a positive integer.

To find the value of $m$, we can start by analyzing the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$.
The expression $\vert x-1 \vert -2$ is equal to $\frac{m}{100}$ or its negation.
We can set up two cases:
Case 1: $\vert x-1 \vert -2 = \frac{m}{100}$
In this case, we have $\vert x-1 \vert = \frac{m}{100} + 2$.
The expression inside the absolute value can be either positive or negative.
So we can set up two subcases:
Subcase 1.1: $x-1 = \frac{m}{100} + 2$. Solving for $x$, we get $x = \frac{m}{100} + 3$.
Subcase 1.2: $-(x-1) = \frac{m}{100} + 2$. Solving for $x$, we get $x = 1 - \frac{m}{100} - 2 = - \frac{m}{100} - 1$.
Case 2: $\vert x-1 \vert -2 = - \frac{m}{100}$
In this case, we have $\vert x-1 \vert = 2 - \frac{m}{100}$.
Again, we can set up two subcases:
Subcase 2.1: $x-1 = 2 - \frac{m}{100}$. Solving for $x$, we get $x = 3 - \frac{m}{100}$.
Subcase 2.2: $-(x-1) = 2 - \frac{m}{100}$. Solving for $x$, we get $x = - \frac{m}{100} + 1$.

For each value of $m$, we can count the number of distinct solutions to the equation.
From the subcases above, we can see that the number of distinct solutions is equal to the number of solutions to the equations:
1. $x = \frac{m}{100} + 3$
2. $x = - \frac{m}{100} - 1$
3. $x = 3 - \frac{m}{100}$
4. $x = - \frac{m}{100} + 1$

We want to find the value of $m$ for which there are exactly 4 distinct solutions.
After solving these equations, we find that there are 4 distinct solutions when $m = 100$.

Therefore, the only positive integer value of $m$ that makes the equation have 4 distinct solutions is $m = 100$. The answer is: $1$

Question (hint: positive numerical answer):
"For how many positive integers $m$ does the equation \[\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}\] have $4$ distinct solutions?"
Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:


To solve this problem, we first need to understand the structure of the equation \[\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}.\]

The equation is asking for the number of values of $m$ such that the absolute value equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has exactly 4 distinct solutions.

We know that the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has exactly 4 distinct solutions if $\frac{m}{100}$ is between 0 and 2. This is because the expression inside the absolute value, $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert$, will take on all values between 0 and 2 when $x$ varies over the real numbers.

So we need to find the values of $m$ such that $0 \leq \frac{m}{100} \leq 2$. This simplifies to $0 \leq m \leq 200$.

The number of positive integers $m$ in this range is $200$. Therefore, the number of positive integers $m$ such that the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has exactly 4 distinct solutions is 200.
The answer is: 200.

Question (hint: positive numerical answer):
"For how many positive integers $m$ does the equation \[\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}\] have $4$ distinct solutions?"
Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:


To find the number of positive integers $m$ such that the equation \[\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}\] has $4$ distinct solutions,
we can start by looking at the graph of $y = \vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert$.
This graph is a V-shape with the vertex at $(1,2)$.
The equation \[\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}\] will have $4$ distinct solutions when $\frac{m}{100}$ is equal to the distance from the vertex to each of the "corners" of the V-shape.
The distance from the vertex to each of the corners is $2$, so we need $\frac{m}{100} = 2$.
Solving this equation, we find $m = 200$.
Thus, there is only $1$ positive integer $m$ that satisfies the condition, namely $m = 200$.
The answer is: $1$
