Question (hint: positive numerical answer):
"A function $f: \mathbb N \to \mathbb N$ satisfies the following two conditions for all positive integers $n$:$f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$ and $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$. Calculate $f(100)$."
Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:


To solve this problem, we need to find the value of $f(100)$ using the given functional equations.

First, let's try to find $f(1)$ using the second equation:
$f(2*1) = 2f(1) + 1$, so $f(2) = 2f(1) + 1$.

But we also know that $f(f(f(1))) = 8*1 - 7 = 1$. So, if $f(1) = 1$, then $f(f(f(1))) = f(1) = 1$. This means that 1 is a fixed point of the function $f$.

Now, let's find $f(2)$:
$f(2) = 2f(1) + 1 = 2*1 + 1 = 3$.

Then, $f(f(f(2))) = f(3) = 8*2 - 7 = 9$.

And if $f(2) = 3$, then $f(f(f(2))) = f(f(3)) = f(9)$.

So, we have $f(9) = 9$.

Now, let's find $f(3)$:
$f(f(f(3))) = f(9) = 9$, so $f(3) = \frac{9 + 7}{8} = 2$.

Then, $f(f(f(4))) = f(8) = 8*4 - 7 = 25$.

And if $f(4) = 2*2 + 1 = 5$, then $f(f(f(4))) = f(f(5)) = f(25)$.

So, we have $f(25) = 25$.

Now, let's find $f(5)$:
$f(f(f(5))) = f(25) = 25$, so $f(5) = \frac{25 + 7}{8} = 4$.

And so on. We can continue this process to find $f(100)$.

After a few steps, we find that $f(100) = 101$.
The value of $f(100)$ is $101$.
The answer is: $101$

Question (hint: positive numerical answer):
"A function $f: \mathbb N \to \mathbb N$ satisfies the following two conditions for all positive integers $n$:$f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$ and $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$. Calculate $f(100)$."
Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:


We can start by plugging in $n=1$ into the second condition $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$, we get $f(2)=2f(1)+1$.
Since $f(f(f(1)))=8(1)-7=1$, we have $f(1)=1$.
Then we can plug in $n=1$ into the first condition $f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$, we get $f(f(f(1)))=8(1)-7=1$.
This means $f(1)=1$.
Now we can use the second condition to find $f(2)$: $f(2)=2f(1)+1=2(1)+1=3$.
Then we can use the first condition to find $f(f(1))$: $f(f(1))=f(1)=1$.
So $f(1)=1$.
We can continue this process to find $f(3)$, $f(4)$, etc.
After calculating several values, we find that $f(n)=2n-1$ for all positive integers $n$.
Now we can find $f(100)$ by substituting $n=100$ into $f(n)=2n-1$: $f(100)=2(100)-1=199$.
So $f(100)=199$.
The answer is: $199$

Question (hint: positive numerical answer):
"A function $f: \mathbb N \to \mathbb N$ satisfies the following two conditions for all positive integers $n$:$f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$ and $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$. Calculate $f(100)$."
Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:


To solve this problem, we need to find the value of $f(100)$ given the function $f: \mathbb N \to \mathbb N$ with the conditions $f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$ and $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$.

First, let's see what we can deduce from the second condition $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$.

When $n=1$, we have $f(2)=2f(1)+1$.
When $n=2$, we have $f(4)=2f(2)+1$.
When $n=4$, we have $f(8)=2f(4)+1$.

We can continue this pattern to find that $f(2^k) = 2f(2^{k-1}) + 1$.

Let's calculate the first few terms:
$f(2) = 2f(1) + 1$,
$f(4) = 2f(2) + 1 = 2(2f(1) + 1) + 1 = 4f(1) + 3$,
$f(8) = 2f(4) + 1 = 2(4f(1) + 3) + 1 = 8f(1) + 7$.

By induction, we can prove that $f(2^k) = 2^k f(1) + (2^k - 1)$.

Now, let's use the first condition $f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$.

When $n=1$, we have $f(f(f(1)))=8*1-7=1$.
Since $f(1)$ is the only value we are looking for, we can set $f(1)=x$ and solve for $x$.
We have $f(f(f(1)))=f(f(x))=f(x)=1$.
So $f(x)=1$ gives us the equation $x=2^k f(1) + (2^k - 1) = 2^k x + (2^k - 1)$.

Solving for $x$, we get $x(2^k - 1) = 2^k - 1$, so $x=1$.

Therefore, $f(1)=1$.

Now, we can find $f(100)$.
Since $100=2^6 \cdot 1$, we can use the pattern we found earlier:
$f(100) = 2^6 f(1) + (2^6 - 1) = 64 + 63 = 127$.

So, $f(100) = 127$.
The value of $f(100)$ is 127. The answer is: $127$

Question (hint: positive numerical answer):
"A function $f: \mathbb N \to \mathbb N$ satisfies the following two conditions for all positive integers $n$:$f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$ and $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$. Calculate $f(100)$."
Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:


We are given that $f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$ and $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$. We want to find the value of $f(100)$.

Let's start by finding the value of $f(f(f(1)))$. According to the first condition, $f(f(f(1)))=8(1)-7=1$. So, $f(1)$ must be a number such that when it is input into the function $f$ three times, we get 1.

Now, let's consider the second condition, $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$. If we input $n=1$ into this equation, we get $f(2)=2f(1)+1$. Since we know that $f(1)$ is a number such that $f(f(f(1)))=1$, we can substitute $f(1)$ with 1 in the equation $f(2)=2f(1)+1$ to get $f(2)=2(1)+1=3$.

Now, let's use the second condition again to find $f(4)$. We have $f(4)=2f(2)+1=2(3)+1=7$.

Again, using the second condition, we can find $f(8)$ as $f(8)=2f(4)+1=2(7)+1=15$.

Continuing this process, we can find that $f(16)=31$, $f(32)=63$, and so on. We can see a pattern that $f(2^k)=2^k-1$ for all positive integers $k$.

Now, we want to find $f(100)$. We can express 100 as $2^2 \cdot 5^2$. According to the second condition, $f(100)=2f(50)+1$. We can express 50 as $2 \cdot 25$. Again using the second condition, $f(50)=2f(25)+1$. We can express 25 as $5^2$, so $f(25)=2f(5)+1=2(2f(2.5)+1)+1=2(2(2f(1.25)+1)+1)+1=2(2(2(2f(0.625)+1)+1)+1)+1=2(2(2(2(2f(0.3125)+1)+1)+1)+1)+1=2(2(2(2(2(2f(0.15625)+1)+1)+1)+1)+1)+1$. Since $f(2^k)=2^k-1$ for all positive integers $k$, we can continue this process until we reach $f(0.15625)=2^{0.15625}-1=1$.

So, working backwards, we have $f(0.3125)=2(1)+1=3$, $f(0.625)=2(3)+1=7$, $f(1.25)=2(7)+1=15$, $f(2.5)=2(15)+1=31$, $f(5)=2(31)+1=63$, and finally $f(100)=2(63)+1=127$.

Therefore, the value of $f(100)$ is 127. The answer is: $127$

Question (hint: positive numerical answer):
"A function $f: \mathbb N \to \mathbb N$ satisfies the following two conditions for all positive integers $n$:$f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$ and $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$. Calculate $f(100)$."
Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:



To solve this problem, we need to use the given two conditions to find the value of $f(100)$.

First, let's use the second condition $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$ to find the value of $f(100)$.

We know that $100 = 2 \times 50$, so we can use the second condition to find $f(100)$ as follows:
\[f(100) = 2f(50) + 1.\]

Now, we need to find the value of $f(50)$. We know that $50 = 2 \times 25$, so we can use the second condition again to find $f(50)$:
\[f(50) = 2f(25) + 1.\]

Similarly, we need to find the value of $f(25)$. We know that $25 = 2 \times 12 + 1$, so we can use the second condition again to find $f(25)$:
\[f(25) = 2f(12) + 1.\]

Now, we need to find the value of $f(12)$. We know that $12 = 2 \times 6$, so we can use the second condition again to find $f(12)$:
\[f(12) = 2f(6).\]

Similarly, we need to find the value of $f(6)$. We know that $6 = 2 \times 3$, so we can use the second condition again to find $f(6)$:
\[f(6) = 2f(3).\]

Finally, we need to find the value of $f(3)$. We know that $3 = f(f(f(3)))$ from the first condition, and we also know that $f(f(f(3))) = 8 \times 3 - 7 = 19$. So we have:
\[f(3) = 19.\]

Now, we can work our way back up to find the value of $f(6)$, $f(12)$, $f(25)$, $f(50)$, and finally $f(100)$.

From $f(3) = 19$, we can find $f(6)$:
\[f(6) = 2f(3) = 2 \times 19 = 38.\]

From $f(6) = 38$, we can find $f(12)$:
\[f(12) = 2f(6) = 2 \times 38 = 76.\]

From $f(12) = 76$, we can find $f(25)$:
\[f(25) = 2f(12) + 1 = 2 \times 76 + 1 = 153.\]

From $f(25) = 153$, we can find $f(50)$:
\[f(50) = 2f(25) + 1 = 2 \times 153 + 1 = 307.\]

Finally, from $f(50) = 307$, we can find $f(100)$:
\[f(100) = 2f(50) + 1 = 2 \times 307 + 1 = 615.\]

So, $f(100) = 615$. The answer is: $615$

Question (hint: positive numerical answer):
"A function $f: \mathbb N \to \mathbb N$ satisfies the following two conditions for all positive integers $n$:$f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$ and $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$. Calculate $f(100)$."
Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:



Let's try to find the value of $f(100)$ using the given conditions.

First, let's plug $n=1$ into the equation $f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$. We get
\[f(f(f(1)))=8(1)-7=1.\]
Since $f(f(f(1)))=1$, and $f(1)$ must be a positive integer, we can conclude that $f(1)=1$.

Now, let's use the second condition $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$. If we plug in $n=1$, we get
\[f(2)=2f(1)+1=2(1)+1=3.\]

Again, using the second condition, if we plug in $n=2$, we get
\[f(4)=2f(2)+1=2(3)+1=7.\]

If we plug in $n=4$, in the first equation, we get
\[f(f(f(4)))=8(4)-7=23.\]
But we know from the first condition that $f(f(f(4)))=f(f(7))=f(23)$.

Now, if we plug in $n=7$ in the second condition, we get
\[f(14)=2f(7)+1=2f(23)+1.\]
And if we plug in $n=14$, in the first condition, we get
\[f(f(f(14)))=8(14)-7=109.\]
So, we have
\[f(2f(7)+1)=109.\]
Substituting $2f(7)+1=14$ into this equation gives
\[f(14)=109.\]

Now, if we plug in $n=14$ in the second condition, we get
\[f(28)=2f(14)+1=2(109)+1=219.\]

If we plug in $n=28$, in the first condition, we get
\[f(f(f(28)))=8(28)-7=215.\]
So, we have
\[f(2f(14)+1)=215.\]
Substituting $2f(14)+1=28$ into this equation gives
\[f(28)=215.\]
But we have already calculated that $f(28)=219$, a contradiction.

However, we made a mistake in our calculations. Let's go back and retrace our steps.

From $f(f(f(4)))=8(4)-7=23$, we get $f(f(7))=23$.
And from $f(2f(7)+1)=109$, we get $f(14)=109$.
And from $f(2f(14)+1)=215$, we get $f(28)=215$.

But if we plug in $n=28$ in the second condition, we get
\[f(56)=2f(28)+1=2(215)+1=431.\]
And if we plug in $n=56$ in the first condition, we get
\[f(f(f(56)))=8(56)-7=443.\]
So, we have
\[f(2f(28)+1)=443.\]
Substituting $2f(28)+1=56$ into this equation gives
\[f(56)=443.\]

Now, if we plug in $n=56$ in the second condition, we get
\[f(112)=2f(56)+1=2(443)+1=887.\]

And if we plug in $n=112$ in the first condition, we get
\[f(f(f(112)))=8(112)-7=889.\]
So, we have
\[f(2f(56)+1)=889.\]
Substituting $2f(56)+1=112$ into this equation gives
\[f(112)=889.\]

We have reached a point where the values are getting larger and larger, so it is likely that we have made an error in our calculations. Let's retrace our steps and try to find where we went wrong.

From $f(f(f(4)))=8(4)-7=23$, we get $f(f(7))=23$.
And from $f(2f(7)+1)=109$, we get $f(14)=109$.
And from $f(2f(14)+1)=215$, we get $f(28)=215$.
And from $f(2f(28)+1)=431$, we get $f(56)=431$.
And from $f(2f(56)+1)=883$, we get $f(112)=883$.

But if we plug in $n=112$ in the first condition, we get
\[f(f(f(112)))=8(112)-7=889.\]
So, we have
\[f(f(f(112)))=889.\]

This means that $f(f(112))=889$. And since $f(112)=883$, we have
\[f(883)=889.\]

If we plug in $n=883$ in the second condition, we get
\[f(1766)=2f(883)+1=2(889)+1=1781.\]

But if we plug in $n=1766$ in the first condition, we get
\[f(f(f(1766)))=8(1766)-7=14119.\]
So, we have
\[f(f(1766))=14119.\]

This means that $f(1766)=14119$. But this value is much larger than any of the values we have calculated so far. It is likely that we have made a mistake in our calculations.

Let's go back and retrace our steps again.

From $f(f(f(4)))=8(4)-7=23$, we get $f(f(7))=23$.
And from $f(2f(7)+1)=109$, we get $f(14)=109$.
And from $f(2f(14)+1)=215$, we get $f(28)=215$.
And from $f(2f(28)+1)=431$, we get $f(56)=431$.
And from $f(

Question (hint: positive numerical answer):
"A function $f: \mathbb N \to \mathbb N$ satisfies the following two conditions for all positive integers $n$:$f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$ and $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$. Calculate $f(100)$."
Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:


To find $f(100)$, we need to first find a pattern in the function $f$.
From the second condition, we have $f(2n) = 2f(n) + 1$. This tells us that $f$ is an increasing function.
Now, let's try to find $f(1)$ using the first condition $f(f(f(n))) = 8n - 7$.
Setting $n = 1$, we have $f(f(f(1))) = 8(1) - 7 = -1$.
Since $f$ is defined only on positive integers, we know that $f(f(f(1))) = -1$ is impossible.
So let's try $n = 2$. We have $f(f(f(2))) = 8(2) - 7 = 9$.
Now, we know that $f(f(f(2))) = 9$ means that $f(f(2))$ is a number whose function value under $f$ is 9.
Using the second condition, we have $f(2(1)) = 2f(1) + 1$, so $f(2) = 2f(1) + 1$.
Since $f(f(2)) = 9$, we have $f(2f(1) + 1) = 9$.
From the second condition again, we have $f(2f(1)) = 2f(f(1)) + 1$.
So we have $f(2f(1) + 1) = 2f(f(1)) + 3$.
Setting this equal to 9, we have $2f(f(1)) + 3 = 9$, so $2f(f(1)) = 6$ and $f(f(1)) = 3$.
Now, let's try to find $f(1)$ using $f(f(1)) = 3$.
Since $f(f(1)) = 3$, we have $f(1)$ is a number whose function value under $f$ is 3.
From the second condition, we have $f(2(1)) = 2f(1) + 1$, so $f(2) = 2f(1) + 1$.
Since $f(f(1)) = 3$, we have $f(f(1)) = f(3) = 3$.
Using the first condition, we have $f(f(f(1))) = 8(1) - 7 = -1$, so $f(3) = -1$.
But this is impossible since $f$ is defined only on positive integers.
So let's try $n = 3$. We have $f(f(f(3))) = 8(3) - 7 = 17$.
Now, we know that $f(f(f(3))) = 17$ means that $f(f(3))$ is a number whose function value under $f$ is 17.
Using the second condition, we have $f(2(1)) = 2f(1) + 1$, so $f(2) = 2f(1) + 1$.
Since $f(f(3)) = 17$, we have $f(2f(1) + 1) = 17$.
From the second condition again, we have $f(2f(1)) = 2f(f(1)) + 1$.
So we have $f(2f(1) + 1) = 2f(f(1)) + 3$.
Setting this equal to 17, we have $2f(f(1)) + 3 = 17$, so $2f(f(1)) = 14$ and $f(f(1)) = 7$.
Now, let's try to find $f(1)$ using $f(f(1)) = 7$.
Since $f(f(1)) = 7$, we have $f(1)$ is a number whose function value under $f$ is 7.
From the second condition, we have $f(2(1)) = 2f(1) + 1$, so $f(2) = 2f(1) + 1$.
Since $f(f(1)) = 7$, we have $f(f(1)) = f(7) = 7$.
Using the first condition, we have $f(f(f(1))) = 8(1) - 7 = -1$, so $f(7) = -1$.
But this is impossible since $f$ is defined only on positive integers.
So let's try $n = 4$. We have $f(f(f(4))) = 8(4) - 7 = 27$.
Now, we know that $f(f(f(4))) = 27$ means that $f(f(4))$ is a number whose function value under $f$ is 27.
Using the second condition, we have $f(2(1)) = 2f(1) + 1$, so $f(2) = 2f(1) + 1$.
Since $f(f(4)) = 27$, we have $f(2f(1)) = 27$.
From the second condition again, we have $f(2f(1)) = 2f(f(1)) + 1$.
So we have $2f(f(1)) + 1 = 27$, so $2f(f(1)) = 26$ and $f(f(1)) = 13$.
Now, let's try to find $f(1)$ using $f(f(1)) = 13$.
Since $f(f(1)) = 13$, we have $f(1)$ is a number whose function value under $f$ is 13.
From the second condition, we have $f(2(1)) = 2f(1) + 1$, so $f(2) = 2f(1) + 1$.
Since $f(f(1)) = 13$, we have $f(f(1)) = f(13) = 13$.
Using the first condition, we have $f(f(f(1))) = 8(1) - 7 = -1$, so $f(13) = -1$.
But this is impossible since $f$ is defined only on positive integers.
Continuing this process, we find that $f(1)$ must be 1.
We can then check that $f(2) = 3$, $f(3) = 5$, $f(4) = 7$, and so on.
We find that $f(n) = 2n - 1$ for all positive integers $n$.
Therefore, $f(100) = 2(100) - 1 = 19

Question (hint: positive numerical answer):
"A function $f: \mathbb N \to \mathbb N$ satisfies the following two conditions for all positive integers $n$:$f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$ and $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$. Calculate $f(100)$."
Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:


To find $f(100)$, we need to find the function $f$ that satisfies the given conditions.

Let's start with the second condition $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$. This means that if we double any input, the function output doubles and then increases by 1.

Now, let's use the first condition $f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$. This condition tells us that applying the function three times to any input $n$ results in $8n-7$.

Let's see if we can use these conditions to find $f(100)$.

First, let's find $f(f(100))$. Using the second condition, we know that $f(200) = 2f(100) + 1$. Now, let's apply the first condition again to find $f(f(200))$. We have $f(f(200)) = 8 \cdot 200 - 7 = 1600 - 7 = 1593$. But we also know from the second condition that $f(f(200)) = f(2f(100) + 1)$.

Setting these two expressions for $f(f(200))$ equal to each other, we have $f(2f(100) + 1) = 1593$.

This equation is quite difficult to solve directly. However, we can make a guess and check that $f(n) = 2n - 1$ satisfies both conditions.

For the first condition, we have $f(f(f(n))) = f(f(2n - 1)) = f(2(2n - 1) - 1) = f(4n - 3) = 2(4n - 3) - 1 = 8n - 7$. So the first condition is satisfied.

For the second condition, we have $f(2n) = 2(2n) - 1 = 4n - 1 = 2f(n) + 1$. So the second condition is also satisfied.

Therefore, $f(n) = 2n - 1$ is the function that satisfies both conditions.

Now we can find $f(100)$ by substituting $n = 100$ into the function $f(n) = 2n - 1$. We have $f(100) = 2 \cdot 100 - 1 = 200 - 1 = 199$.

So, the value of $f(100)$ is 199. The answer is: $199$

Question (hint: positive numerical answer):
"A function $f: \mathbb N \to \mathbb N$ satisfies the following two conditions for all positive integers $n$:$f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$ and $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$. Calculate $f(100)$."
Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:



First, let's plug in $n = 1$ into the equation $f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$. We get
\[f(f(f(1)))=8(1)-7=1.\]
This means that $f(f(f(1)))=1$.

Now, let's plug in $n = 1$ into the equation $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$. We get
\[f(2(1))=2f(1)+1.\]
This simplifies to $f(2)=2f(1)+1$.

Since $f(f(f(1)))=1$, we can deduce that $f(1)$ is a number such that when you apply the function $f$ three times to it, you get 1. Looking at the equation $f(2)=2f(1)+1$, we can see that if we find a number $a$ such that $f(a)=1$, then $f(2)=2(1)+1=3$.

Now let's look at the equation $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$. If we plug in $n=2$, we get
\[f(2(2))=2f(2)+1.\]
This simplifies to $f(4)=2f(2)+1$.

Since we know that $f(2)=3$, we can substitute that into the equation to get $f(4)=2(3)+1=7$.

Continuing this pattern, we can find that $f(8)=2(7)+1=15$, $f(16)=2(15)+1=31$, and so on. We can see a pattern here: $f(2^k)=2^{k+2}-3$ for positive integers $k$.

Now, we want to find $f(100)$. We can express 100 as $2^2 \cdot 25$. Using the property $f(ab)=f(a)f(b)$ (which follows from the original functional equation), we have
\[f(100)=f(2^2 \cdot 25)=f(2^2)f(25).\]
Using the pattern we found earlier, we have $f(2^2)=2^{2+2}-3=7$ and $f(25)$ is the number we're trying to find. To find $f(25)$, we can start with $f(1)$ and keep applying the function $f$.

From $f(1)=a$, we have $f(2)=2a+1$, $f(4)=2(2a+1)+1=4a+3$, $f(8)=2(4a+3)+1=8a+7$, and so on. Continuing this pattern, we find that $f(16)=2(8a+7)+1=16a+15$ and $f(32)=2(16a+15)+1=32a+31$. Since $25=32/4$, we have $f(25)=8a+7$.

Substituting this into the equation for $f(100)$, we get
\[f(100)=7(8a+7)=56a+49.\]
We know that $f(f(f(1)))=1$, so $f(1)=a$ must be a solution to the equation $f(f(f(a)))=8a-7$. Substituting $f(a)=8a-7$ into the equation, we get
\[f(f(8a-7))=8a-7.\]
But $f(f(8a-7))=8(8a-7)-7=64a-56-7=64a-63$. So we have
\[64a-63=8a-7.\]
Solving this equation, we find $a=1$.

Substituting $a=1$ into the equation for $f(100)$, we get
\[f(100)=56(1)+49=105.\]
So $f(100)=105$. The answer is: $105$

Question (hint: positive numerical answer):
"A function $f: \mathbb N \to \mathbb N$ satisfies the following two conditions for all positive integers $n$:$f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$ and $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$. Calculate $f(100)$."
Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:


To find $f(100)$, we first need to find a pattern in the function $f$.
From the second condition, we have $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$.
This means that if we know the value of $f(n)$ for some $n$, we can find the value of $f(2n)$.
Using this, we can find the value of $f(100)$.
$100$ can be written as $2^2 \cdot 25$.
We can find $f(25)$ and then use the second condition to find $f(100)$.
From the first condition, we have $f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$.
If we let $n=25$, we have $f(f(f(25)))=8 \cdot 25 - 7 = 193$.
So, $f(f(f(25)))=193$.
Now, let's find $f(25)$.
From the first condition, we have $f(f(f(25)))=8 \cdot 25 - 7 = 193$.
If we let $f(f(25))=x$, then we have $f(x)=193$.
From the first condition, we also have $f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$.
If we let $n=x$, we have $f(f(x))=8x-7$.
So, $f(f(x))=8x-7$.
Since we know that $f(x)=193$, we have $f(193)=8x-7$.
But we also know that $f(f(f(25)))=193$, so $f(193)=193$.
Therefore, we have $193=8x-7$.
Solving for $x$, we get $x=\frac{193+7}{8}=24$.
So, $f(25)=24$.
Now, we can find $f(100)$.
Using the second condition, we have $f(100)=2f(50)+1$.
We can continue to use the second condition to find $f(50)$:
$f(50)=2f(25)+1=2 \cdot 24 + 1 = 49$.
So, $f(50)=49$.
Now, we can find $f(100)$:
$f(100)=2f(50)+1=2 \cdot 49 + 1 = 99$.
Therefore, $f(100)=99$. The answer is: $99$

Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:


First, we can see that $f(f(f(1)))=8*1-7=1$.
Since $f(f(f(1)))=1$, we have $f(1)=1$.
Then, using the second equation, we have $f(2)=2f(1)+1=2*1+1=3$.
Again, using the second equation, we have $f(4)=2f(2)+1=2*3+1=7$.
And $f(f(f(4)))=8*4-7=27$.
But we know $f(f(f(4)))=f(7)$, so $f(7)=27$.
Again, using the second equation, we have $f(14)=2f(7)+1=2*27+1=55$.
And $f(f(f(14)))=8*14-7=109$.
But we know $f(f(f(14)))=f(55)$, so $f(55)=109$.
Now, we can see a pattern. For any positive integer $n$, we have $f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$.
So, if we have $f(m)=n$, then $f(f(f(m)))=f(n)=8m-7$.
Thus, $f(n)=8m-7$ for some $m$.
So, $f(55)=109$ implies that $8m-7=109$, which gives $m=15$.
Then, $f(15)=63$.
Again, using the second equation, we have $f(30)=2f(15)+1=2*63+1=127$.
And $f(f(f(30)))=8*30-7=233$.
But we know $f(f(f(30)))=f(127)$, so $f(127)=233$.
We can continue this process, but it seems that the values of $f(n)$ are getting larger and larger.
However, we can notice that $f(1)=1$, $f(2)=3$, $f(4)=7$, $f(14)=55$, $f(55)=109$, $f(15)=63$, $f(30)=127$, $f(127)=233$.
The pattern seems to be that $f(n)=2n+1$ for odd $n$, and $f(n)=4n-1$ for even $n$.
So, $f(100)=4*100-1=399$.
The value of $f(100)$ is 399.
The answer is: $399$

Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:


We first calculate $f(1)$ using the second condition: $f(2 \cdot 1) = 2f(1) + 1 \Rightarrow f(2) = 2f(1) + 1$.
We then substitute $f(2)$ into the first condition: $f(f(f(1))) = 8 \cdot 1 - 7 \Rightarrow f(f(2)) = 1 \Rightarrow f(2f(1) + 1) = 1$.
Using the second condition again, we have $f(2f(1) + 1) = 2f(f(1)) + 1 = 1 \Rightarrow 2f(f(1)) = 0 \Rightarrow f(f(1)) = 0$.
Since $f$ is a function from natural numbers to natural numbers, $f(1)$ must be a positive integer. Therefore, we conclude that $f(1) = 1$.
Now we can use the second condition to find $f(2)$: $f(2 \cdot 1) = 2f(1) + 1 \Rightarrow f(2) = 2 \cdot 1 + 1 = 3$.
Continuing this process, we can find $f(3)$: $f(2 \cdot 2) = 2f(2) + 1 \Rightarrow f(4) = 2 \cdot 3 + 1 = 7$.
Then $f(7)$: $f(2 \cdot 3) = 2f(3) + 1 \Rightarrow f(6) = 2 \cdot 7 + 1 = 15$.
And $f(15)$: $f(2 \cdot 7) = 2f(7) + 1 \Rightarrow f(14) = 2 \cdot 15 + 1 = 31$.
And $f(31)$: $f(2 \cdot 15) = 2f(15) + 1 \Rightarrow f(30) = 2 \cdot 31 + 1 = 63$.
Finally, $f(63)$: $f(2 \cdot 31) = 2f(31) + 1 \Rightarrow f(62) = 2 \cdot 63 + 1 = 127$.
We can verify that $f(f(f(1))) = f(f(1)) = f(1) = 1 = 8 \cdot 1 - 7$.
Therefore, we have found that $f(1) = 1$, $f(2) = 3$, $f(3) = 7$, $f(7) = 15$, $f(15) = 31$, $f(31) = 63$, and $f(63) = 127$.
We can conjecture that $f(n) = 2^n - 1$ for all positive integers $n$.
To prove this, we can use mathematical induction.
Base case: $n = 1$, $f(1) = 1 = 2^1 - 1$.
Inductive step: Assume that $f(n) = 2^n - 1$. We want to prove that $f(2n) = 2f(n) + 1$.
By the second condition, $f(2n) = 2f(n) + 1$. Since $f(n) = 2^n - 1$, we have $f(2n) = 2(2^n - 1) + 1 = 2^{n+1} - 2 + 1 = 2^{n+1} - 1$. This proves the inductive step.
Therefore, by mathematical induction, $f(n) = 2^n - 1$ for all positive integers $n$.
Finally, to calculate $f(100)$, we simply substitute $n = 100$ into the formula: $f(100) = 2^{100} - 1$.
The value of $f(100)$ is $2^{100} - 1$. However, since the value is too large to be practical, we cannot provide a numerical answer here.
The answer is: $2^{100}-1$

"A function $f: \mathbb N \to \mathbb N$ satisfies the following two conditions for all positive integers $n$:$f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$ and $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$. Calculate $f(100)$."
Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:


We want to find $f(100)$. We can start by using the second condition, $f(2n) = 2f(n) + 1$. We can apply this condition to $n = 50$ to get $f(100) = 2f(50) + 1$.

Now, we need to find $f(50)$. We can apply the second condition again, this time with $n = 25$: $f(50) = 2f(25) + 1$.

Continuing, we need to find $f(25)$. We can apply the second condition one more time, with $n = 12.5$. However, $n$ must be a positive integer, so this method will not help us directly.

However, we can use the first condition, $f(f(f(n))) = 8n - 7$, to help us. If we set $n = 13$, we get $f(f(f(13))) = 8*13 - 7 = 99$.

Now, let's set $n = f(13)$ in the first condition: $f(f(f(f(13)))) = f(99) = 8*13 - 7 = 99$.

But we know from the first condition that $f(f(f(13))) = 99$, so we have $f(99) = 99$. This means that $f(n) = n$ when $n = 99$.

So, if $f(13) = 99$, then $f(25) = 2*f(13) + 1 = 2*99 + 1 = 199$.

Then, $f(50) = 2*f(25) + 1 = 2*199 + 1 = 399$.

Finally, $f(100) = 2*f(50) + 1 = 2*399 + 1 = 799$.

So, $f(100) = 799$. The answer is: $799$

Question (hint: positive numerical answer):
"A function $f: \mathbb N \to \mathbb N$ satisfies the following two conditions for all positive integers $n$:$f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$ and $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$. Calculate $f(100)$."
Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:


To find $f(100)$, we need to use the given equations and manipulate them to find a pattern or relationship that can help us find $f(100)$.
First, let's substitute $n = 1$ into the equation $f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$ to find $f(f(f(1)))=8(1)-7=1$. Since $f(1)$ is also an input for the function $f$ in the equation $f(f(f(1)))=1$, we have $f(f(1))=1$. Then, substituting $n = f(1)$ into $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$, we have $f(2f(1))=2f(f(1))+1$, which simplifies to $f(2)=2f(f(1))+1=2(1)+1=3$.
Now, let's substitute $n = 2$ into the equation $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$ to find $f(4)=2f(2)+1=2(3)+1=7$.
We can continue this process to find $f(8)=15$, $f(16)=31$, and so on.
By examining the sequence of values we've found for $f(2^k)$, we notice that $f(2^k) = 2^k - 1$ for all positive integers $k$.
Now, we can use this pattern to find $f(100)$. Since $100 = 2^2 \cdot 5^2$, we can write $100$ as $2^2 \cdot 5^2 = 2^2 \cdot (5^2)$. Thus, $f(100) = f(2^2 \cdot (5^2)) = f((2 \cdot 5)^2) = f(10^2) = f(100)$.
Using the pattern we found, $f(100) = 2^{100} - 1$. However, this is not a positive numerical answer.
Let's go back and re-examine the given equations. Notice that the equation $f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$ can be rearranged as $f(f(f(n)))+7=8n$. This suggests that $f(n)$ might be $8n-7$.
To confirm this, let's substitute $f(n) = 8n - 7$ into the equation $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$ and see if it holds true. We have:
$$f(2n) = 8(2n) - 7 = 16n - 7,$$ and $$2f(n) + 1 = 2(8n - 7) + 1 = 16n - 14 + 1 = 16n - 13.$$
Clearly, $16n - 7 \neq 16n - 13$, so $f(n) = 8n - 7$ is not the correct function.
However, if we substitute $f(n) = 8n - 7$ into $f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$, we get:
$$f(f(f(n))) = 8n - 7.$$
Substituting $f(n) = 8n - 7$ into the left side of the equation, we have:
$$f(f(f(n))) = f(f(8n - 7)) = f(8(8n - 7) - 7) = f(8^2n - 56 - 7) = f(8^2n - 63) = 8(8^2n - 63) - 7 = 8^3n - 544.$$
So we have $8^3n - 544 = 8n - 7$, which simplifies to $8^3n - 8n = 537$. This is not true for all positive integers $n$, so $f(n) = 8n - 7$ is not the correct function either.
However, notice that if we start with $f(n) = 8n - 7$ and apply the transformation $f(n) \to f(n) + 1$, we get a new function $g(n) = 8n - 6$.
Substituting $g(n) = 8n - 6$ into the equation $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$, we have:
$$g(2n) = 8(2n) - 6 = 16n - 6,$$ and $$2g(n) + 1 = 2(8n - 6) + 1 = 16n - 12 + 1 = 16n - 11.$$
Now, $16n - 6 = 16n - 11$, so the equation holds true.
Similarly, substituting $g(n) = 8n - 6$ into the equation $f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$, we have:
$$g(g(g(n))) = 8n - 7.$$
Substituting $g(n) = 8n - 6$ into the left side of the equation, we have:
$$g(g(g(n))) = g(g(8n - 6)) = g(8(8n - 6) - 6) = g(8^2n - 48 - 6) = g(8^2n - 54) = 8(8^2n - 54) - 6 = 8^3n - 434.$$
So we have $8^3n - 434 = 8n - 7$, which simplifies to $8^3n - 8n = 427$. This is true for all positive integers $n$, so $g(n) = 8n - 6$ is a valid function.
Now, we can find $g(100) = 8(100) - 6 = 794$.
Therefore, $f(100) = 794$.
The answer is: $794$

Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:


First, we substitute $n=1$ into the second equation to get $f(2)=2f(1)+1$.
Since $f(f(f(1)))=8\cdot1-7=1$, we have $f(f(1))=1$.
Then, substituting $n=f(1)$ into the second equation again, we get $f(2f(1))=2f(f(1))+1$,
which simplifies to $f(2)=2+1=3$.
Now we can substitute $n=2$ into the second equation to get $f(4)=2f(2)+1=2\cdot3+1=7$.
Again, substituting $n=f(2)$ into the second equation, we get $f(2f(2))=2f(f(2))+1$,
which simplifies to $f(6)=2f(3)+1$.
But we already know that $f(f(f(1)))=1$, so $f(f(1))=1$.
And since $f(f(1))=1$, we have $f(1)=1$.
Then, substituting $n=1$ into the second equation, we get $f(2)=2f(1)+1=2\cdot1+1=3$.
Continuing this process, we can find that $f(3)=5$, $f(5)=9$, $f(9)=17$, and so on.
By continuing this process, we can find that $f(100)=199$.
The value of $f(100)$ is 199.
The answer is: $199$

We know that $f(f(f(100)))=8(100)-7=793$. Let's set $f(100)=x$, then we have $f(f(f(100)))=f(f(x))=f(x)=793$. 

We also know that $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$. Let's set $n=50$, then we have $f(100)=2f(50)+1$.

Substituting $f(100)=x$, we have $x=2f(50)+1$.

But we know $f(50)$ can be found by using the equation $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$. Set $n=25$, we have $f(50)=2f(25)+1$.

Continuing, $f(25)=2f(12.5)$, but $12.5$ is not an integer, so we stop here. 

However, we have found a recurrence relation for $f(n)$: $f(n)=2f(\frac{n}{2})+1$ if $n$ is even, and $f(n)=f(n)$ if $n$ is odd.

Now we can use this recurrence relation to find $f(50)$ and $f(25)$ step by step:

$f(50)=2f(25)+1$, 
$f(25)=2f(12.5)$, 
$f(12.5)$ is not an integer, so we stop here. 

But we know $f(f(f(100)))=793$, so $f(x)=793$, and we can find $x$ by trial and error:

If we let $x=793$, then $f(f(793))=793$.
If we let $x=396.5$, then $f(f(396.5))$ is not an integer, so we stop here.

So we have found that $x=793$, which is the value of $f(100)$.

Therefore, $f(100)=793$. The answer is: $793$
