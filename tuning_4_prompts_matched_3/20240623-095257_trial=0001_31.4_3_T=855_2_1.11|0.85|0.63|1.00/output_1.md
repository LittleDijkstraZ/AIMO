Question (hint: positive numerical answer):
"What is the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ when $x$ and $y$ range over all real numbers such that $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$?"
Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:



The given equation $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$ can be rewritten as $|2y-x| + |2x-y| = 40$.
We can use the property $|a-b| = |b-a|$ to simplify the equation further:
$|2y-x| + |2x-y| = |2y-x| + |x-2y| = 40$.
This equation states that the sum of the absolute values of two expressions is 40.
We know that the sum of two absolute values is minimized when the two expressions have the same absolute value.
So, we set $|2y-x| = |x-2y|$ and solve for $x$ and $y$.
This gives us $2y-x = x-2y$ or $2y-x = -(x-2y)$.
Solving the first equation $2y-x = x-2y$ gives $4y=2x$, or $x=2y$.
Substituting $x=2y$ into the second equation $2y-x = -(x-2y)$ gives $2y-2y = -2y+2y$, which is true.
So, the equation $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$ is satisfied when $x=2y$.
Now, we substitute $x=2y$ into the expression $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$:
$5(2y)^2 + 5y^2 - 8(2y)(y) = 20y^2 + 5y^2 - 16y^2 = 9y^2$.
So, the expression $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ simplifies to $9y^2$.
We want to find the minimum value of $9y^2$.
Since $y^2$ is always non-negative, the minimum value of $9y^2$ is 0.
This occurs when $y=0$.
Substituting $y=0$ into $x=2y$, we get $x=0$.
So, the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ is achieved when $x=0$ and $y=0$.
Substituting these values into the expression $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$, we get $5(0)^2 + 5(0)^2 - 8(0)(0) = 0$.
Therefore, the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ is 0.
The answer is: $0$

Question (hint: positive numerical answer):
"What is the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ when $x$ and $y$ range over all real numbers such that $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$?"
Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:


First, we can simplify the given equation $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$.
By the absolute value definition, we have $|a| = a$ or $|a| = -a$.
So we have two cases to consider:
Case 1: $|x-2y| = x-2y$ and $|y-2x| = y-2x$.
Then the equation becomes $(x-2y) + (y-2x) = 40$, which simplifies to $-y = 40$, a contradiction since $y$ cannot be negative.
Case 2: $|x-2y| = -(x-2y)$ and $|y-2x| = -(y-2x)$.
Then the equation becomes $-(x-2y) - (y-2x) = 40$, which simplifies to $-x + 2y - y + 2x = 40$, or $y = 40$.
But this also leads to a contradiction because $y$ cannot be a constant value.
However, we can notice that the equation $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$ actually represents the perimeter of a parallelogram with vertices at $(0,0)$, $(x,y)$, $(2x,2y)$, and $(2y,x)$.
And the perimeter of a parallelogram is always twice the sum of its side lengths.
So the equation $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$ implies that the side lengths of the parallelogram sum up to 20.
Now we need to find the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ under the condition that the sum of the side lengths of the parallelogram is 20.
By the Cauchy-Schwarz inequality, we have $(1^2 + (-4)^2)(x^2 + y^2) \geq (x - 4y)^2$, which simplifies to $17(x^2 + y^2) \geq (x - 4y)^2$.
Similarly, we have $(4^2 + 1^2)(x^2 + y^2) \geq (4x - y)^2$, which simplifies to $17(x^2 + y^2) \geq (4x - y)^2$.
Adding these two inequalities, we get $34(x^2 + y^2) \geq (x - 4y)^2 + (4x - y)^2$.
Since the sum of the side lengths of the parallelogram is 20, we have $x + 4y = 10$ or $4x + y = 10$.
Without loss of generality, let's assume $x + 4y = 10$. Then we have $x = 10 - 4y$.
Substituting this into the inequality, we get $34(x^2 + y^2) \geq (10 - 4y - 4y)^2 + (4(10 - 4y) - y)^2$, which simplifies to $34(x^2 + y^2) \geq (10 - 8y)^2 + (40 - 17y)^2$.
To minimize the value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$, we need to minimize the value of $x^2 + y^2$.
By the inequality we derived, the minimum value of $x^2 + y^2$ occurs when $(10 - 8y)^2 + (40 - 17y)^2 = 0$, which implies $y = \frac{10}{4} = \frac{5}{2}$.
Substituting this value of $y$ back into the equation $x + 4y = 10$, we get $x = 10 - 4\left(\frac{5}{2}\right) = 0$.
So the minimum value of $x^2 + y^2$ is $\left(0\right)^2 + \left(\frac{5}{2}\right)^2 = \frac{25}{4}$.
Finally, substituting this value back into the expression $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$, we get $5\left(0\right)^2 + 5\left(\frac{5}{2}\right)^2 - 8\left(0\right)\left(\frac{5}{2}\right) = \frac{125}{4}$.
So the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ is $\frac{125}{4}$. The answer is: $\frac{125}{4}$

Question (hint: positive numerical answer):
"What is the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ when $x$ and $y$ range over all real numbers such that $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$?"
Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:


First, we need to find a relation between $x$ and $y$ from the given equation $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$.
By the triangle inequality, we know that $|a| + |b| \ge |a+b|$ for any real numbers $a$ and $b$.
So we have $|x-2y| + |y-2x| \ge |(x-2y) + (y-2x)| = |-x - y| = |-(x+y)| = |x+y|$.
And we are given that $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$, so $|x+y| = 40$.
Now let's consider the expression $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$.
We can rewrite this as $(5x^2-8xy+5y^2)$.
By completing the square, we have $5(x^2 - \frac{8}{5}xy + y^2) = 5[(x-\frac{4}{5}y)^2 - \frac{16}{25}y^2 + y^2] = 5[(x-\frac{4}{5}y)^2 + \frac{9}{25}y^2]$.
Now we can see that $(x-\frac{4}{5}y)^2 \ge 0$ and $\frac{9}{25}y^2 \ge 0$, so their sum is always non-negative.
Therefore, the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ is 0, when $x = \frac{4}{5}y$.
Substituting this into the equation $|x+y| = 40$, we have $|\frac{4}{5}y + y| = 40$, or $|\frac{9}{5}y| = 40$.
Solving this gives $y = \frac{200}{9}$, and substituting back into $x = \frac{4}{5}y$ gives $x = \frac{80}{9}$.
So the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ when $x$ and $y$ satisfy the given condition is indeed 0. The answer is: $0$

Question (hint: positive numerical answer):
"What is the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ when $x$ and $y$ range over all real numbers such that $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$?"
Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:


To solve this problem, we need to use the Cauchy-Schwarz inequality, which states that for any real numbers $a_1, a_2, ..., a_n$ and $b_1, b_2, ..., b_n$, we have
\[(a_1^2 + a_2^2 + ... + a_n^2)(b_1^2 + b_2^2 + ... + b_n^2) \geq (a_1b_1 + a_2b_2 + ... + a_nb_n)^2.\]

Let's set $a_1 = x - 2y$, $a_2 = y - 2x$, $b_1 = 1$, and $b_2 = 1$. Then we have
\[(a_1^2 + a_2^2)(b_1^2 + b_2^2) \geq (a_1b_1 + a_2b_2)^2.\]
Substituting the values of $a_1$, $a_2$, $b_1$, and $b_2$, we get
\[((x - 2y)^2 + (y - 2x)^2)(1^2 + 1^2) \geq ((x - 2y)(1) + (y - 2x)(1))^2.\]
Simplifying the left side gives
\[((x - 2y)^2 + (y - 2x)^2)(2) \geq (x - 2y + y - 2x)^2.\]
Simplifying the right side gives
\[((x - 2y)^2 + (y - 2x)^2)(2) \geq (-x + y)^2.\]
Since $|x - 2y| + |y - 2x| = 40$, we have $-x + y = 20$ or $x - y = 20$.
If $-x + y = 20$, then $y = x + 20$, and substituting this into the inequality gives
\[((x - 2(x + 20))^2 + ((x + 20) - 2x)^2)(2) \geq (20)^2.\]
Simplifying this gives
\[(400 + 400)(2) \geq 400.\]
This is true, so the minimum value of the expression $5x^2 + 5y^2 - 8xy$ under the condition $|x - 2y| + |y - 2x| = 40$ is achieved when $y = x + 20$.

Substituting $y = x + 20$ into the expression $5x^2 + 5y^2 - 8xy$ gives
\[5x^2 + 5(x + 20)^2 - 8x(x + 20).\]
Expanding and simplifying this gives
\[5x^2 + 5(x^2 + 40x + 400) - 8x^2 - 160x = -3x^2 - 120x + 2000.\]
This expression is minimized when $x = -120/(-6) = 20$.

Substituting $x = 20$ into the equation $y = x + 20$ gives $y = 40$.

So the minimum value of the expression $5x^2 + 5y^2 - 8xy$ under the condition $|x - 2y| + |y - 2x| = 40$ is achieved when $x = 20$ and $y = 40$, and is equal to
\[-3(20)^2 - 120(20) + 2000 = -1200 - 2400 + 2000 = -2600.\]

Therefore, the minimum value of $5x^2 + 5y^2 - 8xy$ when $x$ and $y$ range over all real numbers such that $|x - 2y| + |y - 2x| = 40$ is $-2600$. The answer is: $-2600$

Question (hint: positive numerical answer):
"What is the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ when $x$ and $y$ range over all real numbers such that $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$?"
Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:



We start by noting that $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$ can be rewritten as $|2y-x| + |2x-y| = 40$.
By the triangle inequality, we know that $|a| + |b| \ge |a+b|$, so $|2y-x| + |2x-y| \ge |(2y-x) + (2x-y)| = |y| = y$.
Hence, $y = 40$.
Substituting $y = 40$ into the equation $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$, we get $|x-80| + |40-2x| = 40$.
Again by the triangle inequality, we know that $|a| + |b| \ge |a-b|$, so $|x-80| + |40-2x| \ge |(x-80) - (40-2x)| = |x-120|$.
Hence, $|x-120| = 40$, which implies that $x = 160$ or $x = 80$.
Now, we substitute $x = 160$ and $y = 40$ into the expression $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$, we get
\[5(160)^2+5(40)^2-8(160)(40) = 128000.\]
Similarly, when we substitute $x = 80$ and $y = 40$ into the expression $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$, we get
\[5(80)^2+5(40)^2-8(80)(40) = 128000.\]
Therefore, the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ is $128000$. The answer is: $128000$

Question (hint: positive numerical answer):
"What is the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ when $x$ and $y$ range over all real numbers such that $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$?"
Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:


First, we notice that $|x-2y| + |y-2x|$ is the sum of the distances between the points $(x,y)$ and $(2y,y)$ and between $(y,2x)$ and $(x,y)$ on the plane. This sum is equal to 40. This means that the point $(x,y)$ lies on the boundary of a square with vertices at $(2y,y)$, $(y,2x)$, $(-2y,-y)$, and $(-y,-2x)$, and the side length of the square is 20.

Next, we want to minimize the value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$. We can rewrite this as $5(x^2+y^2)-8xy$. Now, we notice that $(x-4y)^2 = x^2-8xy+16y^2 \geq 0$, so $x^2+y^2 \geq 8xy$. Substituting this into our expression, we have:

$$5(x^2+y^2)-8xy \geq 5(8xy) - 8xy = 32xy - 8xy = 24xy.$$

Now, we want to maximize $24xy$ under the condition that $(x,y)$ lies on the boundary of the square. Since the square has side length 20, the maximum value of $xy$ is achieved when $(x,y)$ is one of the vertices of the square, say $(20,0)$. In this case, $xy = 0$, so the maximum value of $24xy$ is 0.

Therefore, the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ is achieved when $(x,y)$ is one of the vertices of the square, and the minimum value is $0$. The answer is: $0$
