 The given equation is a product of two terms equal to zero. This means that either the first term is zero or the second term is zero.

The first term, $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)$, is equal to zero when both $(\vert x + y \vert - 10) = 0$ and $(\vert x - y \vert - 10) = 0$. This gives us $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. The solutions to these equations are the lines $x + y = 10$, $x + y = -10$, $x - y = 10$, and $x - y = -10$.

The second term, $((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2)$, is equal to zero when both $(\vert x \vert - 8) = 0$ and $(\vert y \vert - 8) = 0$. This gives us $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$. The solutions to these equations are the lines $x = 8$, $x = -8$, $y = 8$, and $y = -8$.

These eight lines form a rectangle with side lengths 16 and 20. The area of this rectangle is $16 \times 20 = 320$. Therefore, the area of the convex polygon is 320 square units.

"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"

Assistant:


The expression $A \cdot B = 0$ is true if and only if $A = 0$ or $B = 0$. Therefore, the given equation is equivalent to either $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$.
The first equation is true if and only if $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. This implies that $x + y = \pm 10$ and $x - y = \pm 10$, which results in four lines $x + y = \pm 10$ and $x - y = \pm 10$. The intersection points of these lines form a rectangle with side lengths of 20 in the x and y directions. The area of this rectangle is $20 \times 20 = 400$.
The second equation is true if and only if $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$, which results in four lines $x = \pm 8$ and $y = \pm 8$. The intersection points of these lines form a square with side length 16. The area of this square is $16 \times 16 = 256$.
Therefore, the area of the convex polygon is the sum of the areas of the rectangle and the square, which is $400 + 256 = 656$. The answer is: $656$

Below is a math problem you are to solve (positive numerical answer!):
"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"

Assistant:

 The equation $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + (\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + (\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ is satisfied only when at least one of the factors is zero.

The factors $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2$ and $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2$ can be zero only when $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. These are the equations of two lines, forming a cross shape.

The factors $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2$ and $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2$ can be zero only when $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$, which are the equations of two circles centered at the origin with radius 8.

The intersection of these two shapes is a square with side length 16, and thus the area is $16^2 = 256$. So, the area of the convex polygon is 256. The answer is: $256$

The given equation is the product of two expressions, and it equals to zero. This means that either the first expression equals zero or the second expression equals zero. 

The first expression is $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)$, and it equals to zero if and only if both $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. This implies that the points $(x, y)$ lie on the lines $x + y = \pm 10$ and $x - y = \pm 10$.

The second expression is $((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2)$, and it equals to zero if and only if both $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$. This implies that the points $(x, y)$ lie on the lines $x = \pm 8$ and $y = \pm 8$.

The lines $x + y = \pm 10$, $x - y = \pm 10$, $x = \pm 8$, and $y = \pm 8$ enclose a convex polygon, which is a square with side length 16. The area of this square is $16^2 = 256$.

So the area of the convex polygon is 256. The answer is: $256$

Assistant:

 The given equation is a product of two expressions equal to zero. Therefore, either of the two expressions must be zero for the equation to hold.

The first expression is $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)$. This expression is zero if and only if both $\vert x + y \vert - 10 = 0$ and $\vert x - y \vert - 10 = 0$, which implies $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. This gives us a square with side length $20$, centered at the origin.

The second expression is $((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2)$. This expression is zero if and only if both $\vert x \vert - 8 = 0$ and $\vert y \vert - 8 = 0$, which implies $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$. This gives us a square with side length $16$, also centered at the origin.

The intersection of the two squares is the convex polygon we are interested in. The side length of this square is the minimum of the side lengths of the two squares, which is $8$. Therefore, the area of the convex polygon is $8^2 = 64$. The answer is: $64$

"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"
Analyze this problem and think step by step to come to a solution with programs. After solving the problem, output the final numerical answer within \boxed{}.

Assistant:

 The given equation is equal to zero if and only if at least one of the factors is equal to zero. So we have two cases to consider:
1. $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$.
2. $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$.
For case 1, we have $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. This means that $x + y = \pm 10$ and $x - y = \pm 10$. Solving these equations gives us the vertices of the polygon.
For case 2, we have $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$. This means that $x = \pm 8$ and $y = \pm 8$. Solving these equations gives us the vertices of the polygon.
Now we can find the vertices of the polygon:
1. From $x + y = \pm 10$ and $x - y = \pm 10$, we get four vertices: $(0, 10)$, $(0, -10)$, $(10, 0)$, and $(-10, 0)$.
2. From $x = \pm 8$ and $y = \pm 8$, we get four vertices: $(8, 0)$, $(-8, 0)$, $(0, 8)$, and $(0, -8)$.
The polygon is a square with side length 10. The area of the square is $10^2 = 100$.
The answer is $\boxed{100}$.

"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"
Analyze this problem and think step by step to come to a solution with programs. After solving the problem, output the final numerical answer within \boxed{}.

Assistant:

 The given equation is a product of two terms equal to zero. Therefore, either of the terms must be zero. This gives us two sets of equations to solve:

1. $\vert x + y \vert - 10 = 0$, $\vert x - y \vert - 10 = 0$, $\vert x \vert - 8 = 0$, and $\vert y \vert - 8 = 0$.
2. Any term in the product can be zero without making the whole product zero. This means that the points satisfying the given equation are exactly the solutions of the individual terms being zero.

For the first set of equations, we have:

1. $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$ give us $x + y = \pm 10$ and $x - y = \pm 10$. Solving these equations we get the points: $(8,2)$, $(8,-2)$, $(-8,2)$, and $(-8,-2)$.
2. $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$ give us $x = \pm 8$ and $y = \pm 8$. Solving these equations we get the points: $(8,8)$, $(8,-8)$, $(-8,8)$, and $(-8,-8)$.

These points are the vertices of a square with side length 16. The area of a square is given by the square of the length of its side, so the area of this square is $16^2 = 256$.

So, the area of the convex polygon is 256 square units. The answer is: $256$

 The problem statement seems to have a typo. The expression $ ((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0 $ is equivalent to either $ (\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0 $ or $ (\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0 $ or $ (\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0 $ or $ (\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0 $. This implies that either $x + y = \pm 10$, $x - y = \pm 10$, $x = \pm 8$, or $y = \pm 8$. These equations describe a square with side length $20$. Therefore, the area of the convex polygon is $20^2 = 400$.

 The given equation is equal to zero if and only if both $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ and $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ and $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ and $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$.
From these equations, we have $\vert x + y \vert = 10$, $\vert x \vert = 8$, $\vert x - y \vert = 10$, and $\vert y \vert = 8$.
This implies that $-10 \leq x+y \leq 10$, $-8 \leq x \leq 8$, $-10 \leq x-y \leq 10$, and $-8 \leq y \leq 8$.
The solution set is a rectangle with side lengths $20$ and $16$, so the area of the rectangle is $20 \times 16 = 320$. The answer is: $320$

Below is a math problem you are to solve (positive numerical answer!):
"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"
Analyze this problem and think step by step to come to a solution with programs. After solving the problem, output the final numerical answer within \boxed{}.

Assistant:

 To find the area of the convex polygon enclosed by the points satisfying the equation, we first need to find the points that satisfy the equation.

The equation is:

$$((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$$

This equation is equal to 0 if either of the two factors is equal to 0. Therefore, we have two cases to consider:

1. $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$
2. $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$

For the first case, we have:

$$\vert x + y \vert = 10$$ and $$\vert x - y \vert = 10$$

This gives us four equations:

1. $x + y = 10$
2. $x + y = -10$
3. $x - y = 10$
4. $x - y = -10$

For the second case, we have:

$$\vert x \vert = 8$$ and $$\vert y \vert = 8$$

This gives us four more equations:

5. $x = 8$
6. $x = -8$
7. $y = 8$
8. $y = -8$

The solutions to these eight equations are the vertices of the polygon. By plotting these points and connecting them, we can see that the polygon is a square with side length 20. The area of a square is given by side length squared, so the area of the polygon is $20^2 = 400$. The answer is: $400$
