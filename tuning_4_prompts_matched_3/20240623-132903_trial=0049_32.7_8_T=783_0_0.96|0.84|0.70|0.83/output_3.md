Assistant:

 The equation $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + (\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + (\vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ is true if and only if at least one of the following conditions is met:
1. $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ and $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ and $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$.
2. $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ and $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ and $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$.
From condition 1, we have $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$. This means $-8 \leq x, y \leq 8$.
From condition 2, we have $\vert x - y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$. This means $x = y$ or $x = -y$.
Combining these conditions, we find that the points $(x, y)$ satisfying the equation are those that lie on the square with vertices at $(8, 8)$, $(-8, 8)$, $(-8, -8)$, and $(8, -8)$.
The area of this square is $8^2 \times 2^2 = 256$. Therefore, the area of the convex polygon is 256.
The answer is: $256$

Below is a math problem you are to solve (positive numerical answer!):
"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"
Analyze this problem and think step by step to come to a solution with programs. After solving the problem, output the final numerical answer within \boxed{}.

Assistant:

 The given equation is $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$. For the product of two numbers to be zero, either one of them must be zero. Therefore, we have two cases to consider:

1. $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ or
2. $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$.

For the first case, either $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ or $( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$. This implies that $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. The solutions to these equations are the lines $x + y = 10$, $x + y = -10$, $x - y = 10$, and $x - y = -10$. These lines form a rectangle with side lengths 20 and 10.

For the second case, either $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ or $( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$. This implies that $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$. The solutions to these equations are the lines $x = 8$, $x = -8$, $y = 8$, and $y = -8$. These lines form a square with side length 16.

The convex polygon formed by the intersection of the solutions to the two cases is a rectangle with a smaller square inside it. To find the area of this polygon, we need to subtract the area of the square from the area of the rectangle.

The area of the rectangle is $20 \times 10 = 200$, and the area of the square is $16 \times 16 = 256$. Therefore, the area of the convex polygon is $200 - 256 = -56$. However, the area cannot be negative, so there must have been a mistake in our calculations.

Upon reexamination, we realize that the second case should be $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ and $( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$, which implies that $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$. The solutions to these equations are the lines $x = 8$, $x = -8$, $y = 8$, and $y = -8$. These lines form a square with side length 16.

The correct area of the convex polygon is the area of the rectangle minus the area of the square, which is $200 - 256 = -56$. However, the area cannot be negative, so there must have been a mistake in our calculations.

Upon reexamination, we realize that we made an error in the first case. The correct equation should be $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ and $( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$, which implies that $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. The solutions to these equations are the lines $x + y = 10$, $x + y = -10$, $x - y = 10$, and $x - y = -10$. These lines form a square with side length 20.

The correct area of the convex polygon is the area of the square minus the area of the smaller square, which is $20^2 - 16^2 = 400 - 256 = 144$. The area of the convex polygon is 144 square units. The answer is: $144$

"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"

Assistant:

 The given equation is $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$.
The product of two numbers is zero if and only if at least one of the numbers is zero. So, either $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$.
If $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$, then $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. This means that $x + y = \pm 10$ and $x - y = \pm 10$. Solving these equations, we get the vertices of the polygon as $(0, 10)$, $(0, -10)$, $(10, 0)$, $(-10, 0)$, $(8, 8)$, $(-8, 8)$, $(-8, -8)$, and $(8, -8)$.
If $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$, then $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$. This means that $x = \pm 8$ and $y = \pm 8$.
The polygon is a square with side length 16. So, its area is $16^2 = 256$. The answer is: $256$

 The given equation is equal to zero if and only if both $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ and $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ and $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ and $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$.
This means that $\vert x + y \vert = 10$, $\vert x \vert = 8$, $\vert x - y \vert = 10$, and $\vert y \vert = 8$.
The solutions to these equations are the points $(x, y)$ that lie on the lines $x + y = \pm 10$, $x = \pm 8$, $x - y = \pm 10$, and $y = \pm 8$.
Plotting these lines, we find that they enclose a square with side length 16.
The area of this square is $16^2 = 256$. The answer is: 256.
The answer is: $256$

"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"

The given equation is a product of two expressions equal to zero, so it must be the case that either the first expression is zero or the second expression is zero. This means that the points that satisfy the equation must either lie on the curve defined by the first expression being zero or lie on the curve defined by the second expression being zero.

The first expression is $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2) = 0$. This expression is zero if and only if both $\vert x + y \vert - 10 = 0$ and $\vert x - y \vert - 10 = 0$. This implies that $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$, which means that $x + y = \pm 10$ and $x - y = \pm 10$. These four lines are the sides of a square with side length 20.

The second expression is $((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$. This expression is zero if and only if both $\vert x \vert - 8 = 0$ and $\vert y \vert - 8 = 0$, which means that $x = \pm 8$ and $y = \pm 8$. This forms a square with side length 16.

The points that satisfy the equation must lie on either the square with side length 20 or the square with side length 16. The convex polygon formed by these points is the intersection of these two squares, which is a smaller square with side length 8.

The area of a square is given by the square of the length of its side, so the area of the convex polygon is $8^2 = 64$. The answer is: $64$

"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"

The equation $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ is satisfied if either of the two factors is equal to zero.

The first factor is zero when $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ or $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. These are the equations of two squares with side length 10 centered at the origin.

The second factor is zero when $\vert x \vert = 8$ or $\vert y \vert = 8$. These are the equations of two squares with side length 16 centered at the origin.

The intersection of these two sets of points is the set of all points that are at a distance of 10 from the origin in the x+y or x-y direction and at a distance of 8 in the x or y direction. This set of points encloses a convex polygon that is the intersection of the two squares.

The area of this convex polygon is the area of the square with side length 10 minus the area of the square with side length 8. The area of a square with side length s is $s^2$, so the area of the convex polygon is $10^2 - 8^2 = 100 - 64 = 36$.

Therefore, the area of the convex polygon is 36.

The answer is: $36$

This problem involves understanding the properties of absolute value and the concept of the equation being equal to zero. The equation will be zero if either of the factors is zero. This gives us four conditions to consider:

1. $|x+y| - 10 = 0$ and $|x| - 8 = 0$ and $|y| - 8 = 0$.
2. $|x+y| - 10 = 0$ and $|x| - 8 = 0$ and $|y| - 8 \neq 0$.
3. $|x+y| - 10 = 0$ and $|x| - 8 \neq 0$ and $|y| - 8 = 0$.
4. $|x+y| - 10 \neq 0$ and $|x| - 8 = 0$ and $|y| - 8 = 0$.

From condition 1, we get $x = y = 8$.
From condition 2, we get $x = 8$ and $y$ can be any value.
From condition 3, we get $y = 8$ and $x$ can be any value.
From condition 4, we get $x + y = 10$, which gives us a line.

So, the points that satisfy the equation are $(8, 8)$ and all points on the line $x + y = 10$. These points form a square with side length 8. The area of the square is $8^2 = 64$.

For the first factor to be zero, we must have $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. This means that $x + y = \pm 10$ and $x - y = \pm 10$. Solving these equations, we find that the points that satisfy this condition are $(5,5)$, $(5,-5)$, $(-5,5)$, and $(-5,-5)$.

For the second factor to be zero, we must have $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$. This means that $x = \pm 8$ and $y = \pm 8$. Solving these equations, we find that the points that satisfy this condition are $(8,8)$, $(8,-8)$, $(-8,8)$, and $(-8,-8)$.

The convex polygon formed by these points is a square with side length 10. Therefore, the area of the polygon is $10^2 = 100$. The answer is: $100$

This means that either $\vert x + y \vert = 10$, $\vert x - y \vert = 10$, $\vert x \vert = 8$, or $\vert y \vert = 8$.
The absolute value equations give the following solutions:
- $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ gives $x + y = 10$ or $x + y = -10$.
- $\vert x - y \vert = 10$ gives $x - y = 10$ or $x - y = -10$.
- $\vert x \vert = 8$ gives $x = 8$ or $x = -8$.
- $\vert y \vert = 8$ gives $y = 8$ or $y = -8$.
