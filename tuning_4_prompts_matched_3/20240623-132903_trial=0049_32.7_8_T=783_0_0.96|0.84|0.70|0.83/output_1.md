 To solve this problem, we can use the inequality $|a| + |b| \geq |a+b|$ for all real numbers $a$ and $b$. Applying this inequality to the given equation $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$, we get:

\[|x-2y| + |y-2x| \geq |(x-2y) + (y-2x)| = |-x - y| = |-(x+y)| = |x+y|.\]

So, $|x+y| = 40$. Now, let's find the minimum value of the expression $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$. We can rewrite it as:

\[5(x^2+y^2) - 8xy = 5[(x+y)^2 - 2xy] - 8xy = 5(40^2 - 2xy) - 8xy.\]

Let $A = xy$. Then the expression becomes $5(1600 - 2A) - 8A = 8000 - 10A - 8A = 8000 - 18A$. To minimize this expression, we need to maximize $A$. From $|x+y| = 40$, we know that $x+y$ can take any value in the range $(-40, 40)$. By the Cauchy-Schwarz inequality, we have:

\[(1^2 + 1^2)(x^2 + y^2) \geq (x+y)^2,\]

which simplifies to $2(x^2 + y^2) \geq (x+y)^2 = 40^2 = 1600$. Hence, $x^2 + y^2 \geq \frac{1600}{2} = 800$. Now, let's find the maximum value of $A = xy$. By the AM-GM inequality, we have:

\[A = xy = \frac{(x+y)^2 - (x^2 + y^2)}{2} \leq \frac{(x+y)^2}{2} - \frac{1600}{2} = 0.\]

So, the maximum value of $A = xy$ is 0. Therefore, the minimum value of the expression $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ is:

\[8000 - 18A = 8000 - 18 \cdot 0 = 8000.\]

So, the minimum value of the expression $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ is 8000.

 This problem seems to be an optimization problem with a constraint. The constraint is $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$. This constraint is a bit complicated to work with directly. Instead, let's try to simplify it. We know that $|a-b| = |b-a|$, so we can rewrite the constraint as $|x-2y| + |2y-x| = 40$. Then, we can use the property $|a+b| \leq |a| + |b|$ to simplify further: $|x-2y| + |2y-x| = |x-2y| + |-(x-2y)| = 2|x-2y| = 40$, so $|x-2y| = 20$.

Now we can rewrite the expression $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ as $5(x^2 + y^2 - \frac{8}{5}xy)$. We know that $x^2 + y^2 - \frac{8}{5}xy = \left(x - \frac{4}{5}y\right)^2 - \frac{16}{25}y^2$. Since $|x-2y| = 20$, we know that $|x - \frac{4}{5}y| = 20$. Therefore, the expression $5(x^2 + y^2 - \frac{8}{5}xy)$ is minimized when $x = \frac{4}{5}y$. Substituting $x = \frac{4}{5}y$ into the expression, we get $5\left(\left(\frac{4}{5}y\right)^2 + y^2 - \frac{8}{5}\left(\frac{4}{5}y\right)y\right) = 5\left(\frac{16}{25}y^2 + y^2 - \frac{32}{25}y^2\right) = 5\left(\frac{9}{25}y^2\right) = \frac{9}{5}y^2$.

Since $|x - \frac{4}{5}y| = 20$, we know that $|y| = \frac{5}{4} \cdot 20 = 25$. Therefore, the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ is $\frac{9}{5} \cdot 25^2 = \frac{5625}{5} = 1125$. The answer is: $1125$.

This problem requires a bit of mathematical analysis and manipulation to solve it. Here's a step-by-step approach:

1. First, we notice that the given equation $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$ can be rewritten as $|x-2y| + |2y-x| = 40$, which simplifies to $|x-2y| + |x-2y| = 40$, or $2|x-2y| = 40$.
2. Solving for $|x-2y|$, we get $|x-2y| = 20$. This implies that $x-2y = \pm 20$.
3. Now, let's express $x$ and $y$ in terms of a parameter $t$: $x = 2y \pm 20$.
4. Substitute $x = 2y \pm 20$ into the expression $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$:
   $$5(2y \pm 20)^2 + 5y^2 - 8y(2y \pm 20) = 5(4y^2 \pm 80y + 400) + 5y^2 - 16y^2 \mp 160y = 20y^2 \mp 80y + 2000 + 5y^2 - 16y^2 \mp 160y = -y^2 \mp 240y + 2000.$$
5. To find the minimum value of this expression, we can find its derivative with respect to $y$ and set it equal to zero: $-2y - 240 = 0$, which gives $y = -120$.
6. Substituting $y = -120$ back into $x = 2y \pm 20$, we get $x = 2(-120) \pm 20 = -240 \pm 20$, so $x = -220$ or $x = -260$.
7. Now, substitute $x = -220$ and $y = -120$ into the expression $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$:
   $$5(-220)^2 + 5(-120)^2 - 8(-220)(-120) = 242000 + 72000 - 192000 = 250000.$$
8. Substitute $x = -260$ and $y = -120$ into the expression $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$:
   $$5(-260)^2 + 5(-120)^2 - 8(-260)(-120) = 338000 + 72000 - 249600 = 250000.$$
9. So in both cases, the expression $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ evaluates to 250000.

Therefore, the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ when $x$ and $y$ range over all real numbers such that $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$ is 250000. The answer is: $250000$.

 To solve this problem, we can use the method of completing the square. First, let's rewrite the expression $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ as $(x-y)^2 + (3x-3y)^2$. Now, let's analyze the equation $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$.

By the triangle inequality, $|x-2y| + |y-2x| \geq |x-2y + y-2x| = |x-y|$, so $|x-y| = 20$. This implies that $x-y = \pm 20$. Similarly, $|3x-3y| = 60$, so $3x-3y = \pm 60$.

Now, let's consider the expression $(x-y)^2 + (3x-3y)^2$. If $x-y = 20$ and $3x-3y = 60$, then
\[(x-y)^2 + (3x-3y)^2 = 20^2 + 60^2 = 400 + 3600 = 4000.\]
If $x-y = -20$ and $3x-3y = -60$, then
\[(x-y)^2 + (3x-3y)^2 = (-20)^2 + (-60)^2 = 400 + 3600 = 4000.\]
So the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ is 4000.
The answer is: $4000$
