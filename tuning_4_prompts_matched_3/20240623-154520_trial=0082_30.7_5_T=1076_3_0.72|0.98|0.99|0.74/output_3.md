Solve the following problem with a Python Script (positive numerical answer):
"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"

Approach:


The equation is of the form $AB=0$, which implies that either $A=0$ or $B=0$. So we have two cases to consider:
1. $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$
2. $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$

For the first case, we have $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. This implies that $x + y = \pm 10$ and $x - y = \pm 10$. Solving these equations gives us the vertices of the square.

For the second case, we have $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$. This implies that $x = \pm 8$ and $y = \pm 8$. Solving these equations gives us the vertices of the square.

The area of the square is the product of its side lengths. The side lengths are both 20, so the area is $20 \times 20 = 400$.
The answer is: $400$

"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"

Approach:



The equation $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ is satisfied if and only if either of the two factors is zero. This gives us two cases:

1. $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$
2. $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$

For the first case, we have $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. This is the set of points that are 10 units away from the line $x+y=10$ and $x-y=10$. These lines form a square with side length 10$\sqrt{2}$.

For the second case, we have $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$. This is the set of points that are 8 units away from the x-axis and y-axis. These lines form a square with side length 16.

So the points that satisfy the given equation are those that lie within the square formed by the intersection of the squares formed by the two cases. The side length of this square is the minimum of the side lengths of the two squares, which is 10$\sqrt{2}$. Therefore, the area of this square is $(10\sqrt{2})^2 = 200$. The answer is: $200$

Approach:


The given equation is a product of two expressions, set equal to zero. This means that either the first expression is zero, or the second expression is zero, or both are zero.
We can analyze each expression separately:
For the first expression, $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + (\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$, this implies that $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. This means that $x + y = \pm 10$ and $x - y = \pm 10$. Solving these four equations gives us the vertices of the square.
For the second expression, $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + (\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$, this implies that $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$. This means that $x = \pm 8$ and $y = \pm 8$. Solving these four equations gives us the vertices of the square.
The vertices of the square formed by the first expression are $(5, 5), (5, -5), (-5, 5), (-5, -5)$.
The vertices of the square formed by the second expression are $(8, 8), (8, -8), (-8, 8), (-8, -8)$.
The intersection of these two squares is the convex polygon we are looking for.
The side length of each square is $10$, so the area of each square is $10^2 = 100$.
The convex polygon is a square with side length $10$, so its area is also $100$.
The answer is: $100$

Solve the following problem with a Python Script (positive numerical answer):
"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"

The given equation is a product of two expressions equal to zero. Therefore, either the first expression is zero or the second expression is zero. This means that the points that satisfy the equation are those that satisfy either $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$.

For the first expression to be zero, we need both $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. This implies that $x + y = \pm 10$ and $x - y = \pm 10$. Solving these equations gives us the vertices of the square: $(5, 5), (5, -5), (-5, 5), (-5, -5)$.

For the second expression to be zero, we need both $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$. This implies that $x = \pm 8$ and $y = \pm 8$. Solving these equations gives us the vertices of the square: $(8, 8), (8, -8), (-8, 8), (-8, -8)$.

The area of a square with side length $a$ is $a^2$. The side length of the first square is 10, and the side length of the second square is 16. Therefore, the area of the first square is $10^2 = 100$ and the area of the second square is $16^2 = 256$.

The convex polygon formed by the union of these two squares is a larger square with side length 16. Therefore, the area of this convex polygon is $16^2 = 256$.

The answer is: $256$

Approach:


The equation given is a product of two expressions equal to zero. This means that either the first expression is zero or the second expression is zero. 

Let's consider the two cases:

1) $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$
The square of a real number is zero if and only if the number itself is zero. Therefore, we have $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. This implies that $x + y = 10$ or $x + y = -10$ and $x - y = 10$ or $x - y = -10$. Solving these four equations, we find that the points that satisfy this case are $(5,5)$, $(5,-5)$, $(-5,5)$, and $(-5,-5)$.

2) $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$
Again, the square of a real number is zero if and only if the number itself is zero. Therefore, we have $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$. This implies that $x = 8$ or $x = -8$ and $y = 8$ or $y = -8$. Solving these four equations, we find that the points that satisfy this case are $(8,8)$, $(8,-8)$, $(-8,8)$, and $(-8,-8)$.

The convex polygon is formed by connecting the points $(5,5)$, $(5,-5)$, $(-5,5)$, and $(-5,-5)$ with the points $(8,8)$, $(8,-8)$, $(-8,8)$, and $(-8,-8)$. This is a square with side length 10. The area of a square is the square of the length of its side, so the area of this square is $10^2 = 100$.
The answer is: $100$

Approach:


The given equation is a product of two expressions equal to zero. Therefore, either the first expression is zero or the second expression is zero. We can solve each expression separately.

1. For the first expression:
$$((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2) = 0.$$
Since the square of a real number is always non-negative, for the sum of two squares to be zero, each square term must be zero. So we have:
$$\vert x + y \vert - 10 = 0$$ and $$\vert x - y \vert - 10 = 0.$$
This implies that $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. The absolute value equations have two solutions:
$$x + y = 10$$ and $$x + y = -10,$$ $$x - y = 10$$ and $$x - y = -10.$$
The first pair of equations can be solved to give $x = 5 + 5y$, and the second pair gives $x = 5 - 5y$. These are the equations of two lines.

2. For the second expression:
$$((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0.$$
Using the same reasoning as above, we find that $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$, which imply $x = 8$ or $x = -8$, and $y = 8$ or $y = -8$. These are the equations of four lines.

The points that satisfy either of these conditions form a square with side length 20. The area of this square is $20^2 = 400$.
The answer is: $400$

Approach:

 The equation $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ is satisfied if either of the two factors is zero. This gives us two cases to consider:

Case 1: $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$. This is only possible if $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. Solving these equations gives us $x = \pm 10$ and $y = \pm 10$. These points form a square with side length 20, so its area is $20^2 = 400$.

Case 2: $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$. This is only possible if $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$. Solving these equations gives us $x = \pm 8$ and $y = \pm 8$. These points form a square with side length 16, so its area is $16^2 = 256$.

Since the two cases are mutually exclusive, the area of the convex polygon is the sum of the areas of the two squares, which is $400 + 256 = 656$. Therefore, the area of the convex polygon is 656. The answer is: $656$

Approach:


The given equation is a product of two expressions equal to zero. This means that either the first expression is zero or the second expression is zero. Therefore, we need to find the values of $x$ and $y$ that make each of the expressions zero, and these values will form the vertices of the polygon.

Step 1: Solve $|x + y| - 10 = 0$ for $x$ and $y$.
This simplifies to $|x + y| = 10$. The absolute value equation can be split into two cases:
Case 1: $x + y = 10$
Case 2: $x + y = -10$

Step 2: Solve $|x - y| - 10 = 0$ for $x$ and $y$.
This simplifies to $|x - y| = 10$. The absolute value equation can be split into two cases:
Case 3: $x - y = 10$
Case 4: $x - y = -10$

Step 3: Solve $|x| - 8 = 0$ for $x$.
This simplifies to $|x| = 8$. The absolute value equation can be split into two cases:
Case 5: $x = 8$
Case 6: $x = -8$

Step 4: Solve $|y| - 8 = 0$ for $y$.
This simplifies to $|y| = 8$. The absolute value equation can be split into two cases:
Case 7: $y = 8$
Case 8: $y = -8$

Step 5: Combine the cases to find the vertices of the polygon.
By combining the cases, we can find the vertices of the polygon:
Vertex 1: $(8, 8)$
Vertex 2: $(8, -8)$
Vertex 3: $(-8, 8)$
Vertex 4: $(-8, -8)$
Vertex 5: $(10, 0)$
Vertex 6: $(-10, 0)$
Vertex 7: $(0, 10)$
Vertex 8: $(0, -10)$

Step 6: Calculate the area of the polygon.
The polygon is a square with side length 16 (the distance between vertices (8,8) and (8,-8) for example). The area of a square is the side length squared, so the area of the polygon is $16^2 = 256$.

The area of the convex polygon is 256 square units. The answer is: $256$.

Approach:


The given equation is a product of two expressions, and it equals zero. Therefore, either of the two expressions must be zero for the product to be zero. This gives us two sets of equations to solve:

1. $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ and $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$
2. $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ and $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$

Solving the first set of equations:
If $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$, then $\vert x + y \vert = 10$, which implies $x + y = \pm 10$.
If $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$, then $\vert x \vert = 8$, which implies $x = \pm 8$.

Solving the second set of equations:
If $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$, then $\vert x - y \vert = 10$, which implies $x - y = \pm 10$.
If $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$, then $\vert y \vert = 8$, which implies $y = \pm 8$.

Combining the solutions from both sets, we get the following vertices of the polygon:
$(8, 10), (8, -10), (-8, 10), (-8, -10)$

The polygon is a square with side length 16 (the distance between any two adjacent vertices). The area of a square is given by the square of the length of its side, so the area of the polygon is $16^2 = 256$.

So the area of the convex polygon is 256.
The answer is: $256$

Approach:

 The equation $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + (\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ implies that $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. These two equations imply that $x + y = \pm10$ and $x - y = \pm10$. Solving these four equations, we get the vertices of the square as $(8, 2)$, $(8, -2)$, $(-8, -2)$, and $(-8, 2)$.

Similarly, the equation $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + (\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ implies that $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$. This implies that $x = \pm8$ and $y = \pm8$. So, the vertices of the square are $(8, 8)$, $(-8, 8)$, $(-8, -8)$, and $(8, -8)$.

The vertices of the convex polygon are the intersection of the solutions of these two equations. By plotting these points on a graph, we can observe that the convex polygon is a square with side length $10\sqrt{2}$.

The area of a square is given by side length squared. So, the area of the square is $(10\sqrt{2})^2 = 200$. The answer is: $200$

Approach:


The equation $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + (\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + (\vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ is satisfied only when both of the factors are zero. This means that either $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + (\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2) = 0$ or $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + (\vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$.
For the first factor to be zero, we must have $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. This implies that $x = 0$ and $y = 10$ or $x = 10$ and $y = 0$. These two points along with the origin form an equilateral triangle with side length 10.
For the second factor to be zero, we must have $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$. This implies that $x = 8$ or $x = -8$ and $y = 8$ or $y = -8$. These four points form a square with side length 8.
The area of the convex polygon enclosed by the points is the sum of the areas of the equilateral triangle and the square. The area of an equilateral triangle with side length $s$ is $\frac{s^2 \sqrt{3}}{4}$ and the area of a square with side length $s$ is $s^2$. So the area of the convex polygon is $\frac{10^2 \sqrt{3}}{4} + 8^2 = 25\sqrt{3} + 64$.

The answer is: $\boxed{25\sqrt{3}+64}$.

The equation $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ implies that $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. This means that $x + y = \pm 10$ and $x - y = \pm 10$. Solving these equations gives us the vertices of the square: $(8, 2), (8, -2), (-8, -2), (-8, 2)$.

The intersection of these two squares is the convex polygon we are looking for. It is a square with side length 8. The area of a square is the side length squared, so the area of the convex polygon is $8^2 = 64$.

The answer is: $64$.

The given equation is a product of two expressions equal to zero. This means that either the first expression is zero or the second expression is zero.

Let's consider each expression separately:

1. $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$:

This equation is true only when both $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ and $( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$. This implies that $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. The solutions to these equations are all points in the plane where the sum or the absolute value of the difference of the coordinates is 10. This forms a square with side length 10.

2. $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$:

This equation is true only when both $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ and $( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$. This implies that $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$. The solutions to these equations are all points in the plane where the absolute value of the coordinates is 8. This forms a square with side length 16.

The intersection of these two squares is the convex polygon we are looking for. It is a square with side length 10. The area of this square is $10^2 = 100$.

So, the area of the convex polygon is 100. The answer is: $100$

Solve the following problem with a Python Script (positive numerical answer):
"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"
Write comments to indicate the steps you take. Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

The given equation is equal to zero, which means that either of the factors must be zero.
We can split the problem into two cases:
1. $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$
2. $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$

For the first case, both $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2$ and $( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2$ must be zero, which implies that $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. This means that the points $(x, y)$ lie on the lines $x + y = 10$ and $x - y = 10$.

For the second case, both $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2$ and $( \vert y \vert - 8)^2$ must be zero, which implies that $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$. This means that the points $(x, y)$ lie on the lines $x = 8$ and $y = 8$.

The four lines $x + y = 10$, $x - y = 10$, $x = 8$, and $y = 8$ enclose a rectangle with side lengths 8 and 10. The area of this rectangle is $8 \times 10 = 80$. The answer is: $\boxed{80}$

The equation $A \cdot B = 0$ is satisfied if and only if $A = 0$ or $B = 0$. Therefore, the given equation is equivalent to the system of equations:

1. $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + (\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$
2. $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + (\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$

From equation (2), we have $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$, which gives us the four vertices of the square: $(8,8)$, $(8,-8)$, $(-8,8)$, and $(-8,-8)$.

From equation (1), we have $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. This gives us the four vertices of the square: $(5,5)$, $(5,-5)$, $(-5,5)$, and $(-5,-5)$.

The intersection of these two squares is another square with side length 5, which is the convex polygon enclosed by the points satisfying the given equation. The area of this square is $5^2 = 25$.

Therefore, the area of the convex polygon is 25. The answer is: $25$

"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"

The equation given in the problem is a product of two expressions equal to zero. This means that either the first expression is zero or the second expression is zero. 

The first expression is $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)$ and the second expression is $((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2)$.

If the first expression is zero, then we have:
$$(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$$
$$\vert x + y \vert = 10$$
and
$$(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$$
$$\vert x - y \vert = 10$$

This means that the points $(x, y)$ lie on a square with side length $10\sqrt{2}$.

If the second expression is zero, then we have:
$$(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$$
$$\vert x \vert = 8$$
and
$$(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$$
$$\vert y \vert = 8$$

This means that the points $(x, y)$ lie on a square with side length $16$.

The intersection of these two squares is the convex polygon we are looking for. This is a square with side length $10\sqrt{2}$.

The area of a square with side length $s$ is $s^2$.

So the area of the convex polygon is $(10\sqrt{2})^2 = 200$.

So the area of the convex polygon is 200 square units. The answer is: $200$
