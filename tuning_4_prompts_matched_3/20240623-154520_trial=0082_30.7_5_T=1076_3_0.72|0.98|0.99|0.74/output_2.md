"For how many positive integers $m$ does the equation \[\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}\] have $4$ distinct solutions?"
Write comments to indicate the steps you take. Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Assistant:

Approach:



The equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has 4 distinct solutions if and only if $\frac{m}{100} = 2$. This is because the expression inside the absolute value, $\vert x-1 \vert -2$, can be either $2$ or $-2$. 

So we have $\frac{m}{100} = 2$, which implies $m = 200$.

So the only positive integer $m$ for which the equation has 4 distinct solutions is 200.

Therefore, the answer is $\boxed{1}$.

Solution:

So the number of positive integers $m$ for which the equation has 4 distinct solutions is 1. The answer is: $1$

The equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has 4 distinct solutions, which means the right side $\frac{m}{100}$ must be equal to 2.

So, we have $\frac{m}{100}=2$, and solving for $m$ gives us $m=200$.

Therefore, there is only one positive integer $m$ that makes the equation have 4 distinct solutions, and that is $200$.

The answer is: 1

Approach:

 The equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has four distinct solutions if and only if $\frac{m}{100}$ is strictly between $1$ and $3$. This is because the expression inside the absolute value, $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert$, oscillates between $1$ and $3$. 

So we have $1 < \frac{m}{100} < 3$, and multiplying all sides of the inequalities by $100$ gives $100 < m < 300$. The positive integers $m$ that satisfy this inequality are the integers from $101$ to $299$, inclusive. To find the number of these integers, we subtract the smallest integer from the largest and add $1$:

\[299 - 101 + 1 = 198.\]

So there are $198$ positive integers $m$ for which the equation has four distinct solutions. The answer is: $198$

Approach:


To solve the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ with $4$ distinct solutions, we first need to understand the number of solutions of the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=k$ where $k$ is a positive constant. The equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=k$ has $4$ distinct solutions when $1<k<2$. Therefore, we need to find the values of $m$ such that $\frac{m}{100}$ falls in the range $(1,2)$.

Solving the inequalities $1<\frac{m}{100}<2$ we get $100<m<200$. So the positive integers $m$ that satisfy the condition are the integers from $101$ to $199$, inclusive. To find the number of these integers, we subtract the smallest integer from the largest and add $1$. So the number of positive integers $m$ is $199-101+1=100$.
The answer is: 100.

Approach:


The equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has 4 distinct solutions means that the right side of the equation, $\frac{m}{100}$, is equal to 2. This is because the absolute value function $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert$ is equal to 2 at 4 distinct points. Therefore, we have $\frac{m}{100}=2$, which implies $m=200$.

To confirm this, we can substitute $m=200$ back into the original equation and see if it has 4 distinct solutions. The equation becomes $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{200}{100}=2$.

Let's solve this step by step:
1. If $\vert x-1 \vert -2=2$, then $\vert x-1 \vert =4$. This gives us two equations: $x-1=4$ or $x-1=-4$. The solutions are $x=5$ and $x=-3$.
2. If $\vert x-1 \vert -2=-2$, then $\vert x-1 \vert =0$. This gives us the solution $x=1$.

So, the solutions to the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=2$ are $x=5$, $x=-3$, and $x=1$. This means that the equation indeed has 4 distinct solutions when $m=200$.

Therefore, the number of positive integers $m$ that satisfy the condition is 1, and the answer is $1$. However, this solution doesn't fit the condition of the problem, as we assumed that the right side of the equation is equal to 2.

Let's re-examine the problem. The equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has 4 distinct solutions means that the right side of the equation, $\frac{m}{100}$, should be greater than 2. The absolute value function $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert$ is equal to a value greater than 2 at 4 distinct points. This means that $\frac{m}{100}$ should be greater than 2. So, $m$ should be greater than 200.

However, the question asks for the number of positive integers $m$, not the values of $m$. To find the number of positive integers $m$, we need to find the number of positive integers greater than 200. There is only one positive integer greater than 200, which is 201.

Therefore, the number of positive integers $m$ that satisfy the condition is 1, and the answer is $1$. But this result doesn't fit the condition of the problem, as we assumed that the right side of the equation is equal to 2.

So, $m$ should be greater than 200.

However, the question asks for the number of positive integers $m$, not the values of $m$. To find the number of positive integers $m$, we need to find the number of positive integers greater than 200. The number of positive integers greater than 200 is infinite. But the question asks for the number of positive integers $m$ that satisfy the condition. To find this, we need to check if there are any values of $m$ greater than 200 that will give us 4 distinct solutions.

By checking the values of $m$ greater than 200, we find that when $m=201$, the equation becomes $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{201}{100}=2.01$. This value is not equal to 2, so it doesn't give us 4 distinct solutions.

By checking the values of $m$ greater than 200, we find that when $m=202$, the equation becomes $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{202}{100}=2.02$. This value is also not equal to 2, so it doesn't give us 4 distinct solutions.

By continuing this process, we find that when $m=300$, the equation becomes $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{300}{100}=3$. This value gives us 4 distinct solutions.

Therefore, the number of positive integers $m$ that satisfy the condition is 1, and the answer is $1$. But this result doesn't fit the condition of the problem, as we assumed that the right side of the equation is equal to 2.

Approach:


The equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has four distinct solutions if the value of $\frac{m}{100}$ is such that the graph of $y = \vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert$ intersects the line $y = \frac{m}{100}$ in four distinct points.

We know that the graph of $y = \vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert$ is a "V" shape with the vertex at $(1, 2)$. The "V" shape opens upwards since the innermost absolute value function is positive.

The line $y = \frac{m}{100}$ is a horizontal line that intersects the y-axis at $\frac{m}{100}$. For the equation to have four distinct solutions, the line must intersect the graph in four distinct points. This occurs when $0 < \frac{m}{100} < 1$.

To find the value of $m$ that satisfies this condition, we multiply all sides of the inequality by $100$ to get $0 < m < 100$.

So the number of positive integers $m$ that satisfy this condition is the number of integers from $1$ to $99$, inclusive.

This is a simple arithmetic sequence, where the first term $a_1 = 1$ and the last term $a_n = 99$. The number of terms $n$ is given by the formula $n = \frac{a_n - a_1 + 1}{1} = \frac{99 - 1 + 1}{1} = 99$.

So the number of positive integers $m$ for which the equation has four distinct solutions is $99$.
The value of $m$ that satisfies the inequality $0 < m < 100$ are the positive integers from $1$ to $99$, inclusive. The number of such integers is $99$. The answer is: $\boxed{99}$

Approach:


The number of distinct solutions depends on the value of $m$. The right side of the equation $\frac{m}{100}$ must be positive, so $m$ must be a positive integer. We want to find how many values of $m$ will give us 4 distinct solutions.

To find the number of distinct solutions, we need to consider the number of times the absolute value function $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert$ crosses the horizontal line $\frac{m}{100}$.

The function $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert$ has a graph that looks like a "V" shape, with the vertex at $x=1$. The graph is symmetric about $x=1$, and the distance between the two branches of the "V" is 4.

For the equation to have 4 distinct solutions, the line $\frac{m}{100}$ must cross the graph of $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert$ at 4 distinct points. This happens when $\frac{m}{100}$ is strictly between 0 and 4, but not equal to either 0 or 4.

This means $0 < \frac{m}{100} < 4$, or equivalently, $0 < m < 400$. The positive integer values of $m$ in this range are 1, 2, 3,..., 399. So there are 399 values of $m$.

However, we need to exclude the cases when $\frac{m}{100}$ equals 0 or 4. If $\frac{m}{100}=0$, then $m=0$, which is not a positive integer. If $\frac{m}{100}=4$, then $m=400$, which is not in our range $0 < m < 400$. So we need to exclude these two cases.

Therefore, the number of positive integer values of $m$ for which the equation has 4 distinct solutions is 399 - 2 = 397.

The answer is: $\boxed{397}$

We first note that the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has $4$ distinct solutions if and only if $\frac{m}{100}$ is a positive number less than $2$ but greater than or equal to $0$. This is because the expression inside the absolute value, $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert$, varies between $0$ and $4$, and we want $\frac{m}{100}$ to be a value in this range.

We find the range of $m$ by setting up the inequalities:

\[0 \leq \frac{m}{100} < 2.\]

Multiplying all sides by $100$ gives

\[0 \leq m < 200.\]

Since $m$ is a positive integer, the possible values of $m$ are the integers from $1$ to $199$.

We need to find the number of these values of $m$ for which the equation has $4$ distinct solutions. Since $\frac{m}{100}$ must be less than $2$ but greater than or equal to $0$, $m$ must be less than $200$ but greater than or equal to $0$. The only integers in this range are the integers from $0$ to $199$.

Therefore, the number of positive integers $m$ for which the equation has $4$ distinct solutions is the number of integers from $1$ to $199$, which is $199$.

However, we have overcounted. The value $m=0$ does not give a valid equation because it would make the right-hand side zero, and the left-hand side cannot be zero. Therefore, we must subtract $1$ from our count, giving $198$.

But we have made another mistake. The value $m=200$ does not give a valid equation either, because it would make the right-hand side greater than $2$, and the left-hand side cannot be greater than $2$. Therefore, we must subtract $1$ from our count again, giving $197$.

However, this still doesn't give the correct answer. The mistake here is that when we set up the inequality $0 \leq \frac{m}{100} < 2$, we assumed that $m$ must be an integer. But in fact, $m$ does not have to be an integer. For example, if $m=1.5$, then $\frac{m}{100} = 0.015$, which is between $0$ and $2$. So we must reconsider the range of $m$.

Since $0 \leq \frac{m}{100} < 2$, multiplying all sides by $100$ gives $0 \leq m < 200$. The values of $m$ that satisfy this inequality are all the real numbers from $0$ to $200$. However, we are asked to find the number of positive integers $m$ that satisfy this inequality and give the equation $4$ distinct solutions.

We know that the equation has $4$ distinct solutions when $0 \leq \frac{m}{100} < 2$, or equivalently, $0 \leq m < 200$. The only positive integers in this range are the integers from $1$ to $199$. Therefore, the number of positive integers $m$ for which the equation has $4$ distinct solutions is $199$.

However, we have made a mistake again. The value $m=200$ does not give a valid equation, because it would make the right-hand side greater than $2$, and the left-hand side cannot be greater than $2$. Therefore, we must subtract $1$ from our count, giving $198$.

To solve the problem, we need to find the number of positive integers $m$ such that the equation \[\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}\] has $4$ distinct solutions.

First, we notice that the right side of the equation, $\frac{m}{100}$, must be nonnegative, so $m$ must be a nonnegative integer. 

The left side of the equation, $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert$, is the distance between $x$ and $1$, minus $2$. It takes on the value of $0$ at $x=3$ and $x=-1$, and the value of $2$ at $x=5$ and $x=-3$. Therefore, the equation has $4$ distinct solutions if and only if $\frac{m}{100}=2$, or $m=200$.

Therefore, there is only one positive integer $m$ for which the equation has $4$ distinct solutions, namely $m=200$.
The answer is: $1$

Approach:


We start by analyzing the equation \[\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}.\]
The absolute value function makes the expression inside it non-negative, so we have two cases to consider:
1. If $\vert x - 1 \vert - 2 = \frac{m}{100}$, then $\vert x - 1 \vert = 2 + \frac{m}{100}$.
2. If $\vert x - 1 \vert - 2 = -\frac{m}{100}$, then $\vert x - 1 \vert = 2 - \frac{m}{100}$.

For the first case, we have $\vert x - 1 \vert = 2 + \frac{m}{100}$. This means that $x - 1 = 2 + \frac{m}{100}$ or $x - 1 = -(2 + \frac{m}{100})$. Solving these two equations gives us $x = 3 + \frac{m}{100}$ and $x = - \frac{m}{100} + 1$.

For the second case, we have $\vert x - 1 \vert = 2 - \frac{m}{100}$. This means that $x - 1 = 2 - \frac{m}{100}$ or $x - 1 = -(2 - \frac{m}{100})$. Solving these two equations gives us $x = 3 - \frac{m}{100}$ and $x = \frac{m}{100} + 1$.

So, the four distinct solutions are $3 + \frac{m}{100}$, $- \frac{m}{100} + 1$, $3 - \frac{m}{100}$, and $\frac{m}{100} + 1$.

For these four solutions to be distinct, the four numbers $3 + \frac{m}{100}$, $- \frac{m}{100} + 1$, $3 - \frac{m}{100}$, and $\frac{m}{100} + 1$ must all be different. This means that the expressions inside the absolute value signs must be different.

We have the following inequalities:
1. $3 + \frac{m}{100} \neq - \frac{m}{100} + 1$.
2. $3 + \frac{m}{100} \neq 3 - \frac{m}{100}$.
3. $3 + \frac{m}{100} \neq \frac{m}{100} + 1$.
4. $- \frac{m}{100} + 1 \neq 3 - \frac{m}{100}$.
5. $- \frac{m}{100} + 1 \neq \frac{m}{100} + 1$.
6. $3 - \frac{m}{100} \neq \frac{m}{100} + 1$.

Simplifying these inequalities gives us:
1. $\frac{2m}{100} \neq -2$, which is always true since $m$ is a positive integer.
2. $\frac{2m}{100} \neq 0$, which is also always true.
3. $\frac{2m}{100} \neq 1$, which gives us $m \neq 50$.
4. $2 \neq \frac{2m}{100}$, which is always true.
5. $1 \neq \frac{2m}{100}$, which gives us $m \neq 50$.
6. $2 \neq \frac{2m}{100}$, which is always true.

So, all six inequalities are true for any positive integer $m \neq 50$. This means that the equation \[\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}\] has 4 distinct solutions for any positive integer $m \neq 50$. Therefore, there are 99 positive integers $m$ that satisfy this condition. The answer is: $99$

Approach:



The equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has 4 distinct solutions means that the right side of the equation $\frac{m}{100}$ is the maximum value of the function $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert$.

The function $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert$ has a maximum value of 2. So we need to find the value of $m$ such that $\frac{m}{100}=2$.

We can solve the equation $2=\frac{m}{100}$ for $m$ to find $m=200$.

Therefore, there is only one positive integer $m$ that makes the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ have 4 distinct solutions. So the number of such $m$ is 1.

The answer is: $1$.
