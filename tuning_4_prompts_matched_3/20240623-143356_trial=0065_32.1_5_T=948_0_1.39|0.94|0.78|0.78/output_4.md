To solve the problem $f(100)$, we can use the second equation $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$ recursively to simplify $f(100)$.

Since $100 = 2 \times 50$, we can substitute $n = 50$ into the equation to get $f(100) = 2f(50) + 1$.

Next, $50 = 2 \times 25$, so substitute $n = 25$ into the equation to get $f(50) = 2f(25) + 1$.

Continuing this process, we find that $25 = 2 \times 12 + 1$, so substitute $n = 12$ into the equation to get $f(25) = 2f(12) + 1$.

Finally, $12 = 2 \times 6$, so substitute $n = 6$ into the equation to get $f(12) = 2f(6)$.

But we need to find the value of $f(6)$.

Since $6 = 2 \times 3$, substitute $n = 3$ into the equation $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$ to get $f(6) = 2f(3) + 1$.

For $f(3)$, the only we have to go down from 100 is by steps of 2, so substitute $n = 3$ into the equation $f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$ to get $f(f(f(3)))=8 \times 3 - 7 = 17$, and therefore $f(3) = \frac{17 + 7}{8} = 2.5$, which is not an integer, so it is not the value of function $f(n)$ for an integer $n$, and hence this solution is invalid.

Let's go back to the recursive steps we had stopped at, we have $f(12) = 2f(6)$. But we have not found the value of $f(6)$ yet.

We know that $f(6) = 2f(3) + 1$, but from the first equation, we see that $f(3)$ is not an integer, so it is not the value of function $f(n)$ for an integer $n$.

This seems to be a dead end. Let's go back to analyze the two equations given in the problem.

The first equation $f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$ gives us a hint of what the function $f(n)$ might look like. Since $f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$, if we know the value of $f(n)$, we can determine the value of $n$ by plugging in the value of $f(n)$ into the equation. And by knowing $n$, we can calculate the value of $f(n)$ using the second equation $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$.

However, the first equation is not a straightforward recursive function, and without more information or insight into the function $f(n)$, it is challenging to solve the problem directly.

But we can observe that for small values of $n$, the second equation $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$ seems to hold. For example, if $n=1$, we get $f(2) = 2f(1) + 1$. And if $n=2$, we get $f(4) = 2f(2) + 1$.

We can start with a guess of $f(1) = 1$, and then use the second equation to calculate the other values.

By substituting $n = 1$ into the equation $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$, we get $f(2) = 2f(1) + 1 = 2 \times 1 + 1 = 3$.

Then, substitute $n = 2$ into the same equation to get $f(4) = 2f(2) + 1 = 2 \times 3 + 1 = 7$.

And so on. By continuing this process, we can calculate the values of $f(n)$ for small values of $n$. We find that $f(1) = 1$, $f(2) = 3$, $f(3) = 5$, $f(4) = 7$, $f(5) = 9$, $f(6) = 11$, $f(7) = 13$, $f(8) = 15$, $f(9) = 17$, $f(10) = 19$, $f(11) = 21$, $f(12) = 23$, $f(13) = 25$, $f(14) = 27$, $f(15) = 29$, $f(16) = 31$.

And then, by substituting these values into the second equation $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$, we find that these values also satisfy the first equation $f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$.

So we can conjecture that the function $f(n)$ is the same as the function $g(n) = 2n - 1$ for all positive integers $n$. We can easily check that this conjecture holds true for the small values we have calculated.

So, now we have a functional form for $f(n)$, we can go back and calculate $f(100)$.

Using the conjectured function $f(n) = 2n - 1$, we find that $f(100) = 2 \times 100 - 1 = 199$.
The answer is: $199$

Assistant:

 To solve this problem, it is helpful to start by looking at the base case of the second equation. When $n=1$, we have $f(2) = 2f(1) + 1$. Since $f(f(f(1)))=8*1-7=1$, it follows that $f(f(1)) = 1$. Then from the equation $f(2) = 2f(1) + 1$, we can infer that $f(1)$ must be 1. With this information, we can apply the second equation to find $f(2) = 2f(1) + 1 = 3$ and $f(4) = 2f(2) + 1 = 7$. Then we can apply the first equation to find $f(f(f(2)) = f(3) = 8*2 - 7 = 9$. Continuing this way, we find $f(f(f(4)) = f(7) = 8*4 - 7 = 29$. Now it is easy to see the pattern that $f(n) = 2n - 1$ for all positive integers $n$. The function $f(n) = 2n - 1$ satisfies both conditions of the problem. 

Therefore, we can use the function $f(n) = 2n - 1$ to calculate $f(100)$, which is $f(100) = 2*100 - 1 = 199$. Hence the answer is $199$. The function $f(n) = 2n - 1$ can also be verified by substituting $n = 100$ into both conditions of the problem and confirming their validity.

Analyze this problem and think step by step to come to a solution with programs. After solving the problem, output the final numerical answer within \boxed{}.

Assistant:


Since we know the expression of $f(f(f(n)))$, we can use it to find the value of $f(f(100))$ first, then $f(f(f(100))) = 8 \times 100 - 7 = 793$, so we can obtain the equation $f(f(100)) = n$ by setting $n$ such that $f(n) = 793$. Using the second condition $f(2n) = 2f(n) + 1$, we substitute $n$ with $f(100)$, and obtain $f(2f(100)) = 2f(f(100)) + 1 = 2 \times 793 + 1 = 1587$. Set $1587 = f(n)$, we can find that $n = 2 \times 793 + 1 = 1587$, this leads to the equation $f(1587) = n$, and let $n = f(100)$. So, we need to find such an $n$ that $f(n) = 1587$. Use the equation $f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$, let $n = 1587$, we can obtain $f(f(1587)) = 8 \times 1587 - 7 = 12685$.

To continue finding the value of $f(100)$, we can use the fact $f(f(1587)) = 12685$ to find $f(1587) = n$ such that $f(n) = 12685$. And then continue this process until we find the value of $f(100)$. This process would be time-consuming. Therefore, we need to find an alternative approach.

If we revisit the equations given in the problem, we notice that the second equation provides us a method to reduce the value of $n$. Specifically, given $f(2n) = 2f(n) + 1$, we can keep halving $n$ while applying the equation to simplify computation. Take $f(100)$ as example, first we have $f(100)$, then halving $100$ gives $50$ with $f(50) = 2f(100) + 1$, next is $25$ with $f(25) = 2f(50) + 1 = 4f(100) + 3$, $12.5$ with $f(12.5) = 2f(25) + 1 = 8f(100) + 7$, and so on.

By setting $n = 1$ in the first equation, we have $f(f(f(1))) = 8*1 - 7 = 1$, so $f(f(1)) = n$ where $f(n) = 1$. From this we can find that $n = 2$, so we have $f(2) = 1$. Setting $n = 2$ in the second equation, we get $f(4) = 2f(2) + 1 = 3$. Continuing in this manner we can find that
$$f(1) = 2, f(2) = 1, f(4) = 3, f(8) = 7, f(16) = 15, f(32) = 31, f(64) = 63.$$From these we can infer a general rule $f(2^k) = 2^k - 1$. This greatly simplifies the calculation. Now we can return to our original goal of calculating $f(100)$. $100 = 64 + 32 + 4$, applying the second equation repeatedly gives us
$$f(100) = 2f(50) + 1 = 4f(25) + 3 = 8f(12.5) + 7.$$And we already found $f(12.5) = 8*f(100) + 7$. Thus we have an equation $f(100) = 8f(100) + 7$, which simplifies to $f(100) = -7$. But $f(100)$ can not be negative, where have we made a mistake?

The mistake comes from the equation $f(12.5) = 8f(100) + 7$. It's not possible to directly apply the second equation to numbers with fractional parts like $12.5$. We have made a mistake here. Let's correct it and redo the calculation:

For the sake of simplicity we denote $f(100) = x$, then by $f(100) = 2f(50) + 1 = 4f(25) + 3 = 8f(12.5) + 7$ we get
$$f(100) = 2f(50) + 1 = 4f(25) + 3 = 8(2f(25) + 1) + 7 = 16f(25) + 15 = 16(4f(12.5) + 3) + 15 = 64f(6.25) + 63.$$Substituting $f(6.25) = 2f(12.5) + 1 = 2(8x + 7) + 1 = 16x + 15$ into the equation we get
$$f(100) = 64(16x + 15) + 63 = 1024x + 1008 + 63 = 1024x + 1071.$$Then setting $f(100) = x$ we get
$$x = 1024x + 1071.$$Solving this equation gives $x = -1071/1023$. Again we see that $f(100)$ can't be negative, where have we made another mistake?

The mistake comes from the equation $x = 1024x + 1071$. It's not possible to directly equate $f(100)$ with $x$ in such a complex equation. It's better to use the fact that $f(100) = 2f(50) + 1 = 4f(25) + 3 = 8f(12.5) + 7$, we get
$$f(100) = 8f(100) + 7 \Rightarrow 7f(100) = -7 \Rightarrow f(100) = -1.$$But $f(100)$ can not be negative, again we have made another mistake

Assistant:


We have $f(f(f(100)))=8*100-7 = 793$. Since $f$ is a function, for every output $f(x)$, there should be exactly one input $x$ such that $f(x)=f(f(f(100)))$. So, we can have the equation $f(f(f(100)))=f(100)$, this means $f(100)$ is the solution of the equation $f(f(f(100)))=8*100-7$.
Then by substituting $f(100)=y$, the equation turns into $f(f(y))=8*100-7$. Again by substitution $f(y)=z$, the equation transforms into $f(z)=8*100-7$. By using the given equation $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$, we find $f(f(y))=2f(y)+1$. So $2f(y)+1=8*100-7$, then $2f(y)=8*100-8$, thus $f(y)=8*100-4=796$.
From the last step we have $f(y)=796$ and $y$ is exactly $f(100)$, then we can obtain the result $f(100)=796$. Hence, the numerical answer is $796$.
```python

Assistant:

 To find $f(100)$, we can first try to find a pattern in the function $f$. From the second condition $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$, we can find that $f(1)=1$, $f(2)=3$, $f(4)=7$, $f(8)=15$, and so on. The general form of $f(2^k)$ is $f(2^k)=2f(2^{k-1})+1=2(2f(2^{k-2})+1)+1=2^2f(2^{k-2})+2+1=2^k-1$.

Using the first condition $f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$, we can see that $f(f(f(2^k)))=8*2^k-7$. Given that $f(2^k)=2^k-1$, we can deduce that $f(8*2^k-7)=2^k$.

To find $f(100)$, we first need to express 100 in terms of powers of 2. We can write 100 as $64+32+4=2^6+2^5+2^2$. Now we can use the second condition to find $f(100)$:

\[
f(100) = f(2^6+2^5+2^2) = f(64+32+4) = f(f(f(2^6))+f(f(2^5))+f(f(2^2)))
\]

Since $f(f(f(2^k)))=8*2^k-7$, we have

\[
f(100) = 8*2^6-7+8*2^5-7+8*2^2-7 = 192-7+80-7+16-7 = 254-21 = 233.
\]

Therefore, $f(100) = 233$. The answer is: $233$.

To solve this problem, we can first find $f(1)$ using the second equation with $n = 1$. This gives us
\[f(2) = 2f(1) + 1.\]
We can also apply the first equation to $f(1)$, which gives
\[f(f(f(1))) = 8(1) - 7 = -1.\]
Assuming $f$ is a function defined on the natural numbers, it would be strange for $f(f(f(1)))$ to be negative. So we need to look for a pattern in how the second equation applies to $f(2), f(4), f(8), \ldots$. We have
\[f(2) = 2f(1) + 1,\]
\[f(4) = 2f(2) + 1 = 2(2f(1) + 1) + 1 = 4f(1) + 3,\]
\[f(8) = 2f(4) + 1 = 2(4f(1) + 3) + 1 = 8f(1) + 7.\]
We see that $f(2^k) = 2^k f(1) + (2^k - 1)$ for all $k \geq 1$. In particular, for $k=3$, we have $f(8) = 8f(1) + 7$. Since $f(f(f(1))) = -1$ from the first equation, we also have $f(8) = -1$. Setting these two equal gives $-1 = 8f(1) + 7$, so $f(1) = -1$. However, this doesn't seem to work because $f$ is supposed to be a function defined on the natural numbers.

From the pattern in the second equation above, we can guess that $f(n) = 1$ for $n \leq 7$ and $f(n) = n - 7$ for $n > 7$. We check that this function satisfies the first equation:
\[f(f(f(n)) = f(f(n-7)) = f(n-14) = n - 21.\]
\[8n - 7 - (n - 21) = 7n + 14 = 7(n + 2).\]
So $f(f(f(n))) = 8n - 7$ for all $n \in \mathbb{N}$. Moreover, it's clear that this function satisfies the second equation as well. Therefore, the function $f(n) = 1$ for $n \leq 7$ and $f(n) = n - 7$ for $n > 7$ is the solution to the problem.

Now we can calculate $f(100)$:
\[f(100) = 100 - 7 = \boxed{93}.\]
So the value of $f(100)$ is 93.

Note: The solution involves a lot of trial and error, and it's not clear that the "pattern" we used to guess the solution is always going to work. However, this approach works in this particular case because the problem is restricted to natural numbers and the function we found actually works. For more general problems like this, other techniques might be needed.

To solve this problem, we need to find a value for $f(100)$ based on the given functional equations. We can start by trying simple values for $n$ to see if we can spot a pattern or simplify the problem.

Let's start with $n = 1$:
From the equation $f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$, we have $f(f(f(1)))=8*1-7=1$, which means $f(f(1))=1$.
Now, we can use the second equation $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$: if we let $n = f(1)$, we get $f(2f(1)) = 2f(f(1))+1 = 2*1+1=3$.
But we also know that $f(2f(1)) = 2*f(f(1)) = 2*1 = 2$, which means we have a contradiction.

Let's try $n = 2$:
From the equation $f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$, we have $f(f(f(2)))=8*2-7=9$, which means $f(f(2))=9$.
Now, we can use the second equation $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$: if we let $n = f(2)$, we get $f(2f(2)) = 2f(f(2))+1 = 2*9+1=19$.
But we also know that $f(2f(2)) = f(9)$, and from the first equation we have $f(f(f(2)))=9$, so $f(9)=9$.
Hence $f(2f(2)) = f(9) = 9$. We have found that $f(2f(2)) = 2f(f(2))+1 = 19$. But $f(2f(2)) = 9$ and $f(2f(2)) = 19$ contradict each other.

Let's try $n = 3$:
From the equation $f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$, we have $f(f(f(3)))=8*3-7=17$, which means $f(f(3))=17$.
Now, we can use the second equation $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$: if we let $n = f(3)$, we get $f(2f(3)) = 2f(f(3))+1 = 2*17+1=35$.
But we also know that $f(2f(3)) = 2*f(f(3)) = 2*17 = 34$, which means we have another contradiction.

It seems we have found a problem with our current approach. Let's revise the problem and try again.

In a previous version of this problem, we found contradictions when trying small values of $n$. This might indicate that we need to approach this problem differently. We can try to rewrite the first equation to make it easier to use.

From $f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$, we can also say that $f(m) = n$ where $m$ is a value such that $f(f(m)) = 8m - 7$. This can also be written as $f(f(m)) + 7 = 8m$. 

Notice that if we define a new function $g(n) = f(n) + 7$, then we have $g(f(n)) = 8n$. This means that $g$ is the inverse function of $f(n)/8$.

Let's start by calculating $g(1)$ using the value of $f(1)$ found earlier:

If $f(1) = 1$, then $g(1) = f(1) + 7 = 1 + 7 = 8$, and we check that indeed $g(f(1)) = g(1) = 8$.

Now, since $f(n) = 8n - 7$ when $f(f(n)) = n$, we can also find the value of $g(2)$ using the value of $f(2)$:

If $f(2) = 9$, then $g(2) = f(2) + 7 = 9 + 7 = 16$, and we check that indeed $g(f(2)) = g(9) = 16$.

We can continue this pattern to find $g(n) = 8n$ for all positive integers $n$.

Now we can use the original function $f(n)$ to find $f(100)$ by finding $g(100)$ and subtracting $7$:
\[
g(100) = 8 * 100 = 800 \Rightarrow f(100) = g(100) - 7 = 800 - 7 = 793.
\]

So, $f(100) = 793$. The answer is:
\[
793.
\]

Assistant:

 Analyzing the function $f(n)$, we see that $f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$.
Taking $n=1$, we get $f(f(f(1)))=8(1)-7=1$. This means $f(f(1))=1$.
Since $f(f(1))=1$, we then have $f(1)=1$.
Next, we use the given equation $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$. 
Taking $n=1$, we get $f(2)=2f(1)+1=2(1)+1=3$.
Again, taking $n=2$, we get $f(4)=2f(2)+1=2(3)+1=7$.
Continuing this way, we can keep finding the values of $f(n)$ for integer values of $n$. 
We find that $f(1)=1$, $f(2)=3$, $f(4)=7$, $f(8)=15$, $f(16)=31$, $f(32)=63$, $f(64)=127$, and so on.
We notice a pattern: $f(2^n)=2^n-1$ for all positive integers $n$.

Therefore, to find $f(100)$, we first need to express 100 as a power of 2. Since $2^6=64$ and $2^7=128$, we see that $100=2^6+2^2=64+4$.

We use the property of the function $f(n)$ and get: $f(100)=f(2^6+2^2)=f(64+4)=f(2^6)+f(2^2)=2^6-1+2^2-1=64-1+4-1=66$.

Therefore, $f(100)=66$. The value of $f(100)$ is 66. Therefore, the answer is: $66$.

 First, we note that the value $f(100)$ is just a particular value of the function $f$. If we can find a general expression for $f(n)$, then we can substitute $n=100$ into that expression to find $f(100)$.

We are given the equations $f(f(f(n)))=8n-7$ and $f(2n)=2f(n)+1$. Let's try to use these equations to find a general expression for $f(n)$.

Let's start by using the second equation repeatedly to simplify $f(f(f(n)))$:
$$f(f(f(n)))=f(2f(f(n))-1)=2f(f(n))-1=8n-7.$$
Setting $f(f(n))=a$, we can rewrite the above equation as
$$f(a)=2a-1.$$
Now, we can substitute $a=f(f(n))$ into the above equation to get
$$f(f(f(n)))=f(f(n))=2f(f(n))-1.$$
This simplifies to $f(f(n))=2f(f(n))-1$. Let's solve this equation for $f(f(n))$. Subtracting $2f(f(n))$ from both sides gives
$$-f(f(n))=-1.$$
Multiplying both sides by -1 gives $f(f(n))=1$.

Now we have $f(a)=2a-1$, and we know $f(f(n))=1$. Substituting $a=f(n)$ into the equation $f(a)=2a-1$ gives us
$$f(f(n))=2f(n)-1.$$
Substituting $f(f(n))=1$ into the above equation gives us
$$1=2f(n)-1.$$
Adding 1 to both sides gives us $2=2f(n)$, so $f(n)=1$.

Now we have found $f(n)=1$ for all $n$. We can check that this solution satisfies both given equations:
$f(f(f(n)))=f(f(1))=f(1)=1=8n-7$, which is only true for $n=1$. Similarly, $f(2n)=f(2)=1=2f(1)+1$, which is also true.

Therefore, the only solution for the function $f$ that satisfies both given equations is $f(n)=1$ for all $n$. In particular, $f(100)=1$. The answer is: 1

 This problem doesn't have a straightforward programming solution as it involves understanding the properties of the function $f$ and using its given properties to compute $f(100)$. Trying different function formulas will just lead to an endless loop of trial and error without any clear path to the solution. Instead, we can solve this problem by mathematical reasoning as follows:

From the given function properties, we can reason that if $n=1$, then $f(f(f(1)))=f(f(1))=f(3)=8-7=1$. By combining this with the second function property, we get $f(2)=2f(1)+1=2*1+1=3$.

Then if $n=2$, we have $f(f(f(2)))=f(f(3))=f(7)=15$. By combining this with the second function property, we get $f(6)=2f(3)+1=2*3+1=7$ and $f(12)=2f(6)+1=2*7+1=15$. This shows that $f(3)=7$ and $f(7)=15$.

If $n=3$, we have $f(f(f(3)))=f(f(7))=f(15)=31$. By combining this with the second function property, we get $f(14)=2f(7)+1=2*15+1=31$. This shows that $f(7)=15$.

If $n=7$, we have $f(f(f(7)))=f(f(15))=f(31)=63$. By combining this with the second function property, we get $f(30)=2f(15)+1=2*31+1=63$. This shows that $f(15)=31$.

By continuing this process, we can find that $f(2^{i+1}-1)=2f(2^i-1)+1$. Using this formula, we can compute $f(100)=f(2^{7}-1)=2f(2^{6}-1)+1=2f(63)+1=2*63+1=127$.

So the value of $f(100)$ is 127. The answer is: $127$

Solving this problem directly using functions or equations may not be easy. However, we can try to find some patterns by calculating the first few values of the function.
Using the second condition, $f(2n) = 2f(n) + 1$, we can start with $n=1$:
$f(2) = 2f(1) + 1$.
Then using the first equation $f(f(f(n))) = 8n - 7$, we can test the value of $f(2)$:
$f(f(f(1))) = 8 \cdot 1 - 7 = -1$.
Since -1 doesn't make sense as an input or output for the function $f$, we might need to modify our approach. Let's try to plug in some other values and see if we can find any patterns.
For $n=2$:
$f(4) = 2f(2) + 1$.
Using the value of $f(2)$ from above:
$f(4) = 2(2f(1) + 1) + 1 = 4f(1) + 3$.
And using the first equation again:
$f(f(f(2))) = 8 \cdot 2 - 7 = 9$.
So $f(f(f(2))) = f(f(4)) = 9$.
From $f(f(f(2))) = 9$, we can deduce that $f(f(4)) = 9$.
We can now find the value of $f(4)$ by substituting $f(f(4)) = 9$ into the equation $f(f(4)) = f(4)$:
$9 = f(4)$, so $f(4) = 9$.
And we can find the value of $f(2)$ by substituting $f(4) = 9$ into the equation $f(4) = 4f(1) + 3$:
$9 = 4f(1) + 3$, so $6 = 4f(1)$, and $f(1) = \frac{6}{4} = 1.5$.
But a function cannot have a fractional input, so maybe we made a mistake somewhere. Let's go back and rethink our approach.
Let's try to find another value of $f(n)$ using the second condition.
For $n=3$:
$f(6) = 2f(3) + 1$.
Using the first equation again:
$f(f(f(3))) = 8 \cdot 3 - 7 = 17$.
So $f(f(f(3))) = f(f(6)) = 17$.
From $f(f(f(3))) = 17$, we can deduce that $f(f(6)) = 17$.
We can now find the value of $f(6)$ by substituting $f(f(6)) = 17$ into the equation $f(f(6)) = f(6)$:
$17 = f(6)$, so $f(6) = 17$.
And we can find the value of $f(3)$ by substituting $f(6) = 17$ into the equation $f(6) = 2f(3) + 1$:
$17 = 2f(3) + 1$, so $16 = 2f(3)$, and $f(3) = \frac{16}{2} = 8$.
Now we can start to find some pattern.
We have $f(1) = 1.5$, $f(2) = 5$, $f(3) = 8$, and $f(4) = 9$.
Let's try to find $f(100)$:
Since we don't have a formula for the function $f$, we can use pattern recognition to guess that $f(n) = 2n - 1$ might be a correct function.
To verify this guess, let's check if it satisfies both conditions.
For the first condition:
$f(f(f(n))) = f(f(2n - 1)) = f(2(2n - 1) - 1) = f(4n - 3) = 2(4n - 3) - 1 = 8n - 7$.
So the first condition is satisfied for $f(n) = 2n - 1$.
For the second condition:
$f(2n) = 2(2n) - 1 = 4n - 1 = 2(2n - 1) + 1 = 2f(n) + 1$.
So the second condition is also satisfied for $f(n) = 2n - 1$.
Therefore, our guess of $f(n) = 2n - 1$ is correct.
Now we can find the value of $f(100)$:
$f(100) = 2 \cdot 100 - 1 = 200 - 1 = 199$.
So the value of $f(100)$ is 199. The answer is: 199
