Interesting, let's analyze step by step:



1. The product of two terms is zero if and only if at least one of the terms is zero. So, the given equation is equivalent to:

$$((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2) = 0$$

or

$$((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0.$$

2. The second equation implies that $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$, which means $x = \pm 8$ and $y = \pm 8$. So, the vertices of the polygon are $(\pm 8, \pm 8)$.

3. The first equation implies that $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. This gives us four cases to consider:

  - Case 1: $x + y = 10$ and $x - y = 10$. Solving these equations gives $x = 10$ and $y = 0$.
  - Case 2: $x + y = 10$ and $x - y = -10$. Solving these equations gives $x = 0$ and $y = 10$.
  - Case 3: $x + y = -10$ and $x - y = 10$. Solving these equations gives $x = 0$ and $y = -10$.
  - Case 4: $x + y = -10$ and $x - y = -10$. Solving these equations gives $x = -10$ and $y = 0$.

4. So, the vertices of the polygon are $(\pm 10, 0)$, $(0, \pm 10)$.

5. The polygon is a square with side length 20. The area of a square is given by the square of its side length, so the area is $20^2 = 400$.

Therefore, the area of the convex polygon is $400$. The answer is: $400$

Interesting, let's analyze step by step:



First, we have four absolute value functions. The absolute value function $|x|$ is 0 if $x=0$, and $|x|$ is $x$ if $x\geq0$, and $-x$ if $x<0$. Thus, the product of the two terms is zero if either $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$, $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$, $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$, or $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$.

This gives us the following system of equations:

1. $\vert x + y \vert = 10$
2. $\vert x - y \vert = 10$
3. $\vert x \vert = 8$
4. $\vert y \vert = 8$

From equation (3), we have $x = 8$ or $x = -8$. Similarly, from equation (4), we have $y = 8$ or $y = -8$. Now we need to solve the system of equations (1) and (2) for each combination of $x$ and $y$.

Case 1: $x = 8$, $y = 8$
From equation (1), we have $\vert 8 + 8 \vert = 16$, which is not equal to 10. This case is not valid.

Case 2: $x = 8$, $y = -8$
From equation (1), we have $\vert 8 - 8 \vert = 0$, which is not equal to 10. This case is not valid.

Case 3: $x = -8$, $y = 8$
From equation (1), we have $\vert -8 + 8 \vert = 0$, which is not equal to 10. This case is not valid.

Case 4: $x = -8$, $y = -8$
From equation (1), we have $\vert -8 - 8 \vert = 16$, which is not equal to 10. This case is not valid.

None of the cases are valid, which means the original equation must be true if and only if both terms are zero. This implies that the solution set is the intersection of the four absolute value equations:

1. $\vert x + y \vert = 10$
2. $\vert x - y \vert = 10$
3. $\vert x \vert = 8$
4. $\vert y \vert = 8$

The solution set is the vertices of a square with side length 16. The area of this square is $16^2 = 256$. Therefore, the area of the convex polygon is 256.

The answer is: $256$

Interesting, let's analyze step by step:


The product of two numbers is zero if and only if at least one of the numbers is zero. So we have two cases:

1) $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2) = 0$ or
2) $((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$

For the first case, we have $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. This means that the absolute values of the sum and difference of x and y are both 10. This happens when $x + y = \pm 10$ and $x - y = \pm 10$. Solving these equations we find that the vertices of the polygon are $(0, 10), (0, -10), (10, 0), (-10, 0)$.

For the second case, we have $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$. This means that the absolute values of x and y are both 8. This happens when $x = \pm 8$ and $y = \pm 8$. Solving these equations we find that the vertices of the polygon are $(8, 8), (8, -8), (-8, 8), (-8, -8)$.

Now we can calculate the area of the polygon. The polygon formed by the vertices $(0, 10), (0, -10), (10, 0), (-10, 0)$ is a square with side length $20$. So its area is $20^2 = 400$. The polygon formed by the vertices $(8, 8), (8, -8), (-8, 8), (-8, -8)$ is a square with side length $16$. So its area is $16^2 = 256$.

The total area of the convex polygon is the sum of the areas of the two squares, which is $400 + 256 = 656$. So the area of the convex polygon is 656.

The answer is: $656$

We are given the equation:
\[((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0\]

For the product of two factors to be zero, either one of the factors must be zero. Therefore, we have two sets of equations to solve:

1. $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ and $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$
2. $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ and $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$

For the first set of equations, we have:
\[\vert x + y \vert = 10 \quad \text{and} \quad \vert x \vert = 8, \vert y \vert = 8\]

This implies that the points must lie on the square with vertices at $(8, 8), (-8, 8), (-8, -8), (8, -8)$.

For the second set of equations, we have:
\[\vert x - y \vert = 10 \quad \text{and} \quad \vert x \vert = 8, \vert y \vert = 8\]

This implies that the points must lie on the square with vertices at $(8, -8), (-8, -8), (-8, 8), (8, 8)$.

Since the two sets of solutions are the same, the points satisfying the equation are those lying on a single square. The side length of the square is 16 (as the distance from -8 to 8 is 16), and the area of a square is given by the square of the side length, so the area of the square is $16^2 = 256$.

Therefore, the area of the convex polygon formed by the points satisfying the given equation is 256. The answer is: $256$

Interesting, let's analyze step by step:


The term $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2$ will be zero if and only if $\vert x + y \vert = 10$. Similarly, the term $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2$ will be zero if and only if $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. This gives us two lines: $x + y = 10$ and $x - y = 10$.
Similarly, the term $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2$ will be zero if and only if $\vert x \vert = 8$, which gives us two lines: $x = 8$ and $x = -8$. The term $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2$ will be zero if and only if $\vert y \vert = 8$, which gives us two lines: $y = 8$ and $y = -8$.
These lines form a square with vertices at $(8,8), (8,-8), (-8, -8),$ and $(-8, 8)$. The side length of the square is $16$, so the area is $256$.
Therefore, the area of the convex polygon is $256$.
The answer is: $256$

Interesting, let's analyze step by step:



If the product of two numbers is zero, then at least one of them must be zero. Therefore, we have two separate cases to consider:

1. $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ and $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ and $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ and $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$
2. One of the four expressions is not equal to zero.

For case 1, we have $\vert x + y \vert = 10$, $\vert x \vert = 8$, $\vert x - y \vert = 10$, and $\vert y \vert = 8$. This gives us the following system of equations:

1. $x + y = \pm 10$
2. $x = \pm 8$
3. $x - y = \pm 10$
4. $y = \pm 8$

Solving this system, we find that there are 4 solutions: $(8, 2)$, $(8, -2)$, $(-8, 2)$, and $(-8, -2)$. These points are the vertices of a square with side length 10. The area of this square is $10^2 = 100$.

For case 2, at least one of the four expressions must be non-zero. However, this cannot be true, as it would mean that the product of the two factors is not zero. Therefore, only case 1 is valid, and the area of the convex polygon is 100. The answer is: $100$

1. We have a product of two expressions, and we know that a product equals zero if and only if at least one of the factors equals zero. So, we have two cases to consider:

Case 1: $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$
Case 2: $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$

2. In Case 1, both $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2$ and $( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2$ must be zero for the entire expression to be zero. This happens when $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. These are the equations of two lines in the plane.

3. In Case 2, both $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2$ and $( \vert y \vert - 8)^2$ must be zero for the entire expression to be zero. This happens when $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$, which are the equations of two circles in the plane.

4. The intersection of the lines and the circles gives us the vertices of the polygon. By plotting these on a graph and calculating the area, we find that the area of the polygon is 128 square units. This is a positive integer, so our answer is:

The area of the convex polygon is $128$. The answer is: $128$.

Interesting, let's analyze step by step:



The equation $A \cdot B = 0$ is satisfied if either $A = 0$ or $B = 0$. Thus the given equation implies two systems of equations:

1) $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$, that is $\vert x + y \vert = 10$. The absolute value equation splits into $x + y = 10$ and $x + y = -10$.
2) $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$, that is $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. The absolute value equation splits into $x - y = 10$ and $x - y = -10$.
3) $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$, that is $\vert x \vert = 8$. The absolute value equation splits into $x = 8$ and $x = -8$.
4) $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$, that is $\vert y \vert = 8$. The absolute value equation splits into $y = 8$ and $y = -8$.

Now we have the following systems of equations:

I) $\begin{cases} x + y = 10 \\ x - y = 10 \end{cases}$,
II) $\begin{cases} x + y = 10 \\ x - y = -10 \end{cases}$,
III) $\begin{cases} x = 8 \\ y = 8 \end{cases}$,
IV) $\begin{cases} x = -8 \\ y = -8 \end{cases}$.

From I) we get $x = 10$, $y = 0$. From II) we get $x = 0$, $y = -10$. From III) we get the point $(8, 8)$ and from IV) we get the point $(-8, -8)$.

So the four vertices of the polygon are $(10, 0)$, $(0, -10)$, $(8, 8)$, and $(-8, -8)$. These are the points $(x, y)$ that satisfy the given equation. The polygon is a square with side length $20$.

Area of square $= \text{side}^2 = 20^2 = 400$. The area is a positive integer.
The answer is: $\boxed{400}$.

Interesting, let's analyze step by step:



In the problem, we are asked to find the area of the region where the points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfy $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$. This equation is equal to zero if either of the two factors is zero.

So we have two sets of equations to solve:

1. $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ and $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$.
2. $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ and $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$.

For the first set of equations:

From $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$, we have $\vert x + y \vert = 10$, which implies $x + y = \pm 10$.
From $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$, we have $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$, which implies $x = \pm 8$ and $y = \pm 8$.

For the second set of equations:

From $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$, we have $\vert x - y \vert = 10$, which implies $x - y = \pm 10$.
From $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$, we have $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$, which implies $x = \pm 8$ and $y = \pm 8$.

The solutions are the intersections of the lines $x + y = \pm 10$ and $x - y = \pm 10$ with the circles $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$. These intersections form a square with side length 16.

The area of this square is $16^2 = 256$. So the area of the convex polygon is $256$. Since we have a positive integer as the area, we can conclude our answer is correct. The area of the convex polygon is $256$. The answer is: $256$
