Interesting, let's analyze step by step:



The problem is asking for the area of a polygon enclosed by the points that satisfy the given equation. The equation is:

$$((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$$

For the product of two terms to be zero, either one or both terms must be zero. This gives us two sets of equations to solve:

1. $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ and $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$
2. $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ and $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$

For the first set of equations, $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ implies $\vert x + y \vert = 10$, which gives $x + y = \pm 10$. And $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ implies $\vert x \vert = \vert y \vert = 8$, which gives $x = \pm 8$ and $y = \pm 8$. Combining these two conditions, we get the vertices of the polygon as $(8, 8)$, $(-8, 8)$, $(-8, -8)$, and $(8, -8)$.

For the second set of equations, $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ implies $\vert x - y \vert = 10$, which gives $x - y = \pm 10$. And $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ implies $\vert x \vert = \vert y \vert = 8$, which gives $x = \pm 8$ and $y = \pm 8$. Combining these two conditions, we get the vertices of the polygon as $(8, -8)$, $(-8, -8)$, $(-8, 8)$, and $(8, 8)$.

We can see that the vertices of the polygon are $(8, 8)$, $(-8, 8)$, $(-8, -8)$, and $(8, -8)$, which form a square with side length 16. The area of this square is $16^2 = 256$.

So the area of the convex polygon is $256$. Since we are asked for a positive numerical answer, our result is valid. The answer is:

$$\boxed{256}$$

Interesting, let's analyze step by step:



The product of two numbers is zero if and only if at least one of them is zero. Hence, the equation
$$((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$$
implies that
$$((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2) = 0 \quad \text{or} \quad ((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0.$$
From the first equation, we get $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$,
which imply $x + y = \pm 10$ and $x - y = \pm 10$.
Solving these equations, we obtain the vertices of the square: $(8, 2)$, $(8, -2)$, $(-8, -2)$, and $(-8, 2)$.
From the second equation, we get $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$,
which imply $x = \pm 8$ and $y = \pm 8$.
Thus, we obtain the vertices of the square: $(8, 8)$, $(8, -8)$, $(-8, -8)$, and $(-8, 8)$.
The side length of the square is $2 \cdot 8 = 16$, so the area of the square is $16^2 = 256$.
Since the area of the square is a positive integer, we can conclude that the area of the convex polygon is 256.

The answer is: $256$

Interesting, let's analyze step by step:



The given equation is $0$ if and only if at least one of the factors is $0$.
So, we have two cases to consider:

Case 1: $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$.
In this case, $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ or $\vert x - y \vert = 10$.
This represents a square with side length $20$.

Case 2: $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$.
In this case, $\vert x \vert = 8$ or $\vert y \vert = 8$.
This represents a square with side length $16$.

Now, we need to find the intersection of these two squares to form the convex polygon.
The intersection of the two squares is a smaller square with side length $8$.

The area of a square with side length $a$ is $a^2$.
So, the area of the convex polygon is $8^2 = 64$.

The positive integer area of the convex polygon is $64$. The answer is: $64$

Interesting, let's analyze step by step:



The equation $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + (\vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ is satisfied if and only if either of the following two conditions are true:

1. $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$. This implies $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. The only way this can be true is if $x = 5$ and $y = 5$.
2. $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + (\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$. This implies $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$. The only way this can be true is if $x = 8$ or $x = -8$ and $y = 8$ or $y = -8$.

So the points that satisfy the equation are $(5, 5)$, $(8, 8)$, $(8, -8)$ and $(-8, -8)$. These points form a square with side length 10. The area of this square is $10^2 = 100$.

Therefore, the area of the convex polygon is $100$. The answer is: $100$

Interesting, let's analyze step by step:



The problem provides a condition: $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$
This condition is true if and only if either:
1. $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ and $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ and $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$
2. $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ and $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ and $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$

For both cases, we have $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$, which implies $-8 \leq x, y \leq 8$. So the points lie in a square with side length 16.

The area of this square is $16^2 = 256$. So the area of the convex polygon is 256.

```python


INTERMEDIATE OUT :

from sympy import symbols, simplify

def calculate_area():
    # The side length of the square
    side_length = 16

    # Calculate the area of the square
    area = side_length**2

    return area

result = calculate_area()
print(result)
```

CODE RESULTS 256

INTERMEDIATE OUT :
```output
256
```
The area of the convex polygon is 256. The answer is $\boxed{256}$.
