"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"

Approach:


The equation given is a product of two expressions equal to zero. This means that either the first expression is zero or the second expression is zero.
Let's first analyze the two expressions separately.

For the first expression: $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2) = 0$, we see that the square of two quantities is zero if and only if each quantity is zero. This means that $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. This results in the points $(x, y)$ being on the lines $x + y = 10$ and $x - y = 10$ or $x + y = -10$ and $x - y = -10$. These lines are all parallel to the x-axis or y-axis, and form a rectangle with vertices at $(10,0)$, $(0,10)$, $(-10,0)$ and $(0,-10)$.

For the second expression: $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$, we again have a square equal to zero, so each quantity must be zero. This gives $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$, which corresponds to the points $(x, y)$ being on the lines $x = 8$ and $x = -8$ and $y = 8$ and $y = -8$. These lines form a square with vertices at $(8,8)$, $(8,-8)$, $(-8,8)$ and $(-8,-8)$.

Now, we can find the intersection of these two figures. The rectangle formed by the lines $x + y = 10$, $x - y = 10$, $x + y = -10$ and $x - y = -10$ and the square formed by the lines $x = 8$, $x = -8$, $y = 8$ and $y = -8$ intersect at the points $(8, 2)$, $(8, -2)$, $(-8, 2)$ and $(-8, -2)$. The area of the convex polygon enclosed by these points is the area of the square formed by these points minus the area of the four right triangles formed by the sides of the square and the sides of the rectangle inside the square.

The side length of the square is $8$ (since the distance from the origin to any of the vertices is $8\sqrt{2}$, and the side length of the square is twice the distance from the origin to any of its vertices), so the area of the square is $8^2 = 64$. The base and height of each right triangle is $8$ and $6$, respectively (since the distance from $(0,0)$ to any of the vertices of the rectangle is $10$, and the side length of the square is $8$, the height of the right triangle is $10 - 8 = 2$ times the base length of $4$), so the area of each triangle is $\frac{1}{2} \times 8 \times 6 = 24$. Since there are four such triangles, the total area of the triangles is $4 \times 24 = 96$.

Finally, we subtract the area of the triangles from the area of the square to get the area of the convex polygon: $64 - 96 = -32$. However, the area cannot be negative, so we must have made a mistake in our calculations. Let's retrace our steps and look for the mistake.

After a closer inspection, we realize that we made a mistake in the last step. The area of the square is indeed $64$, but the area of each right triangle is $\frac{1}{2} \times 8 \times 6 = 24$, not $48$ as we calculated earlier. Since there are four such triangles, the total area of the triangles is $4 \times 24 = 96$, not $480$ as we previously calculated.

Now, let's correct this: $64 - 96 = -32$. Again, we realize that we made another mistake. We cannot simply subtract the total area of the triangles from the area of the square to get the area of the convex polygon. Instead, we need to subtract the total area of the triangles from the area of the square formed by the vertices of the rectangle. The side length of this square is $10$, so its area is $10^2 = 100$. Now, we subtract the total area of the triangles from the area of this square: $100 - 96 = 4$.

However, this still doesn't seem correct. The area of the convex polygon must be positive, and it can't be $4$. We must have made another mistake. Let's retrace our steps once more.

Upon closer inspection, we realize that the intersection of the rectangle and the square is not just a simple square of side length $8$. The vertices of the square formed by the intersection are actually the points $(8, 2)$, $(8, -2)$, $(-8, 2)$ and $(-8, -2)$. The side length of this square is not $8$, but rather $8\sqrt{2}$. Therefore, the area of this square is $(8\sqrt{2})^2 = 128$, not $64$ as we previously calculated.

Now, we correct this: $128 - 96 = 32$. This is still not the correct area of the convex polygon. We must have made another mistake.

Upon further inspection, we realize that we misunderstood the problem statement. The problem is asking for the area of the region enclosed by the points, which is the union of the rectangle and the square. To find the area of the union of two figures, we simply add the areas of the two figures together, not subtract one from the other. Therefore, the area of the convex polygon is the sum of the area of the rectangle and the area of the square, not their difference.

The area of the rectangle is the product of its side lengths, which are $20$ and $16$, so its area is $20 \times 16 = 320$. The area of the square is $64$, as we originally calculated. Therefore, the area of the convex polygon is $320 + 64 = 384$.

Therefore, the area of the convex polygon is 384.
The answer is: $384$

Approach:



The equation is of the form $A \cdot B = 0$, which means that either $A = 0$ or $B = 0$. Thus, we can break down the problem into two separate cases and solve them separately.

Case 1: $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + (\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$. This equation is satisfied if and only if $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. These are two pairs of parallel lines with distance $10$ from each other. The solution set is thus a square with side length $20$.

Case 2: $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + (\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$. This equation is satisfied if and only if $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$. These are two pairs of parallel lines with distance $8$ from each other. The solution set is thus a square with side length $16$.

Therefore, the area of the convex polygon is the sum of the areas of the two squares.

```python

def area_of_polygon():
    # Side lengths of the squares

Solve the following problem with a Python Script (positive numerical answer):
"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"

Approach:

 The expression $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + (\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2$ equals $0$ if and only if $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. Similarly, the expression $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + (\vert y \vert - 8)^2$ equals $0$ if and only if $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$. So, the points that satisfy the given equation are the intersections of the lines $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$ with the circle $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$.

The lines $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$ are two squares with side length $10$, and the circle $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$ is a square with side length $16$. Therefore, the area of the convex polygon is the area of the square with side length $16$.

The area of a square with side length $a$ is $a^2$, so the area of the convex polygon is $16^2 = 256$. The answer is: $256$

Approach:

 The equation given is a product of two terms equal to zero. Therefore, either of the terms must be zero. This gives us four conditions to consider:

1. $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ which implies $\vert x + y \vert = 10$.
2. $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ which implies $\vert x - y \vert = 10$.
3. $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ which implies $\vert x \vert = 8$.
4. $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ which implies $\vert y \vert = 8$.

The solutions to these conditions are as follows:

1. $x + y = 10$ or $x + y = -10$.
2. $x - y = 10$ or $x - y = -10$.
3. $x = 8$ or $x = -8$.
4. $y = 8$ or $y = -8$.

By considering all possible combinations of these conditions, we find that the points $(x, y)$ that satisfy the equation are the vertices of a square with side length $10$ centered at the origin. The area of this square is $10^2 = 100$. Therefore, the area of the convex polygon is $100$. The answer is: $\boxed{100}$

Solve the following problem with a Python Script (positive numerical answer):
"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"

Approach:



The equation $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ is true only when at least one of the factors is zero.

1. If $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$, then $\vert x + y \vert = 10$, which implies $x + y = 10$ or $x + y = -10$.
2. If $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$, then $\vert x - y \vert = 10$, which implies $x - y = 10$ or $x - y = -10$.
3. If $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$, then $\vert x \vert = 8$, which implies $x = 8$ or $x = -8$.
4. If $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$, then $\vert y \vert = 8$, which implies $y = 8$ or $y = -8$.

From 1 and 2, we get a square with side length 10. The square is formed by the intersection of the lines $x + y = 10$, $x + y = -10$, $x - y = 10$, and $x - y = -10$. The vertices of the square are $(10, 0)$, $(0, 10)$, $(-10, 0)$, and $(0, -10)$.

From 3 and 4, we get a square with side length 16. The square is formed by the intersection of the lines $x = 8$, $x = -8$, $y = 8$, and $y = -8$. The vertices of the square are $(8, 8)$, $(8, -8)$, $(-8, 8)$, and $(-8, -8)$.

Therefore, the convex polygon formed by the intersection of these two squares is a smaller square. The side length of this smaller square is the distance between $(8, 8)$ and $(8, -8)$, which is $16$. So, the area of the convex polygon is $16^2 = 256$. The answer is: $256$

Approach:


The equation $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ implies $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$, which gives $x + y = \pm 10$ and $x - y = \pm 10$.

These four equations represent the sides of a square with side length 20.

The equation $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ implies $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$, which gives $x = \pm 8$ and $y = \pm 8$.

These four equations represent the sides of a square with side length 16.

The intersection of these two squares forms a smaller square with side length 20 - 16 = 4.

Therefore, the area of the convex polygon is the area of the smaller square, which is $4^2 = 16$.
The answer is: $\boxed{16}$.

Approach:


The given equation $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ will be equal to zero if any of the two factors is zero. This gives us two cases to consider:

1. $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$.
2. $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$.

For the first case, both $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2$ and $( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2$ must be zero, which means $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. These are the equations of two squares, one with side length 20 and the other with side length 10. The intersection of these squares forms a square with side length 10.

For the second case, both $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2$ and $( \vert y \vert - 8)^2$ must be zero, which means $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$. This is a square with side length 16.

To find the area of the convex polygon formed by the intersection of these squares, we just need to find the area of the square with side length 10. The area of this square is $10^2 = 100$. So the area of the convex polygon is 100 square units.

The answer is: $100$

Approach:



This problem involves the absolute value function, and the equation given is a product of two functions equal to zero. Therefore, we can set each function equal to zero and solve for the points that satisfy the equation.

First, set each factor equal to zero:
1. $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0 \implies \vert x + y \vert = 10$
2. $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0 \implies \vert x - y \vert = 10$
3. $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0 \implies \vert x \vert = 8$
4. $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0 \implies \vert y \vert = 8$

Now, we can solve these equations:
1. $x + y = 10$ or $x + y = -10$
2. $x - y = 10$ or $x - y = -10$
3. $x = 8$ or $x = -8$
4. $y = 8$ or $y = -8$

Solving these equations, we get the following points that satisfy the equation:
$(8, 2), (8, -2), (-8, 2), (-8, -2), (2, 8), (-2, 8), (2, -8), (-2, -8)$

These points form a square with side length 8*2 = 16 units. The area of a square is given by side length squared, so the area of the square is $16^2 = 256$ square units.

So the area of the convex polygon is 256 square units.
The answer is: $256$

Approach:

 The equation given in the problem, $ ((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$, is satisfied if either of the factors is zero. Therefore, either $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$.

For the first factor to be zero, both $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2$ and $( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2$ must be zero. This means $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. Solving these absolute value equations gives four equations: $x + y = 10$, $x + y = -10$, $x - y = 10$, and $x - y = -10$. These equations represent the lines in the coordinate plane, and the points that satisfy all four of them form a square with side length 10. The area of this square is $10^2 = 100$.

For the second factor to be zero, both $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2$ and $( \vert y \vert - 8)^2$ must be zero. This means $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$. Solving these absolute value equations gives four equations: $x = 8$, $x = -8$, $y = 8$, and $y = -8$. These equations represent the lines in the coordinate plane, and the points that satisfy all four of them form a square with side length 16. The area of this square is $16^2 = 256$.

However, the area of the convex polygon enclosed by the points satisfying the given equation must be the area of the smaller square, since the points on the larger square are not part of the polygon. Therefore, the area of the convex polygon is 100. The answer is: $100$

Approach:

 The equation $A \cdot B = 0$ is satisfied if and only if $A=0$ or $B=0$. Therefore, the given equation is equivalent to either $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$. 

The first equation implies that $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$, which means that $x + y = \pm 10$ and $x - y = \pm 10$. Solving these equations gives us the coordinates of the vertices of the square.

The second equation implies that $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$, which means that $x = \pm 8$ and $y = \pm 8$. Solving these equations gives us the coordinates of the vertices of the square.

So, the points satisfying the equation form a square. The length of each side of the square is 20 (since the difference of absolute values is equivalent to the distance between the values, and the distance from $-10$ to $10$ or from $-8$ to $8$ is 20). Therefore, the area of the square is $20^2 = 400$.

The answer is: $\boxed{400}$.

Approach:

 The expression equals zero if and only if both of the terms equals zero. So, we need to solve the following two sets of equations:

1. $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0 \implies \vert x + y \vert = 10$
2. $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0 \implies \vert x - y \vert = 10$
3. $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0 \implies \vert x \vert = 8$
4. $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0 \implies \vert y \vert = 8$

From equations 3 and 4, we find that x is in the interval $[-8, 8]$ and y is in the interval $[-8, 8]$.

From equations 1 and 2, we find that $x + y = \pm 10$ and $x - y = \pm 10$. Solving these four systems of equations will give us the coordinates of the vertices of the polygon.

Solving $x + y = 10$ and $x - y = 10$, we get $x = 10$ and $y = 0$.
Solving $x + y = 10$ and $x - y = -10$, we get $x = 0$ and $y = 10$.
Solving $x + y = -10$ and $x - y = 10$, we get $x = -10$ and $y = 0$.
Solving $x + y = -10$ and $x - y = -10$, we get $x = 0$ and $y = -10$.

So the vertices of the polygon are $(-10, 0)$, $(0, 10)$, $(10, 0)$, and $(0, -10)$.

This forms a rectangle with side lengths 20 and 20. The area of this rectangle is $20 \times 20 = 400$. The answer is: $400$

Solve the following problem with a Python Script (positive numerical answer):
"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"

Approach:



We know that the product of two numbers is zero if and only if at least one of the numbers is zero. Therefore, we can set each factor equal to zero and solve for the possible solutions.

For the first factor:
$(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0 \Rightarrow \vert x + y \vert = 10$
and $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0 \Rightarrow \vert x - y \vert = 10$.

For the second factor:
$(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0 \Rightarrow \vert x \vert = 8$
and $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0 \Rightarrow \vert y \vert = 8$.

The solution $\vert x \vert = 8$ gives $x = 8$ or $x = -8$, and the solution $\vert y \vert = 8$ gives $y = 8$ or $y = -8$. The solutions $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$ can be plotted on a graph to visualize the polygon.

By plotting the solutions, we find that the polygon is a square with side length 16. The area of a square is given by the square of the length of its side, so the area of the polygon is $16^2 = 256$.

Therefore, the area of the convex polygon is 256.
The answer is: $256$
