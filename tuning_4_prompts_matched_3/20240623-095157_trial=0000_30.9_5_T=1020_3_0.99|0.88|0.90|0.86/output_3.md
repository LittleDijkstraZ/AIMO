Approach:



The given equation is a product of two terms equal to zero. Therefore, either of the terms should be zero for the equation to hold true. 

This gives us two sets of equations:

1. $|x+y| - 10 = 0$ and $|x-y| - 10 = 0$
2. $|x| - 8 = 0$ and $|y| - 8 = 0$

Solving the first set of equations:

1. $|x+y| = 10$ implies $x+y = \pm 10$
2. $|x-y| = 10$ implies $x-y = \pm 10$

Solving the second set of equations:

1. $|x| = 8$ implies $x = \pm 8$
2. $|y| = 8$ implies $y = \pm 8$

The solutions for the system of equations are the intersections of these sets. This gives us the vertices of the polygon: $(8,8), (8,-8), (-8,8), (-8,-8)$.

The polygon is a square with side length $16$. The area of a square is given by the square of the length of its side. Therefore, the area of the polygon is $16^2 = 256$.

So, the area of the convex polygon is $256$. The answer is: $256$

"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"

The given equation is $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$. This equation equals to zero if either of the two expressions equals to zero. This gives us two sets of equations to solve:

1. $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ and $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$
2. $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ and $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$

For each set of equations, the first equation implies $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ or $\vert x - y \vert = 10$, and the second equation implies $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$.

By analyzing these equations, we find that the first set of equations gives us the vertices of a square with side length $16$, and the second set of equations gives us the vertices of a square with side length $20$.

The area of a square with side length $a$ is $a^2$. Therefore, the area of the convex polygon is the sum of the areas of the two squares, which is $16^2 + 20^2 = 256 + 400 = 656$.

So, the area of the convex polygon is $656$. The answer is: $656$

Solve the following problem with a Python Script (positive numerical answer):
"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"

The equation $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ is satisfied if either of the two factors is zero. 

1. If $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$, then $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. This means that the points $(x, y)$ lie on the lines $x + y = 10$ and $x - y = 10$.

2. If $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$, then $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$. This means that the points $(x, y)$ lie on a square with side length 16 centered at the origin.

The intersection of these two conditions is a square with side length 10, centered at the origin. To find the area of this square, we square the side length: $10^2 = 100$.

So the area of the convex polygon is 100 square units. The answer is: $100$

"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"

Approach:

 The equation $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + (\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ implies that $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. This is only possible if $x = \pm 10$ and $y = \pm 10$. Similarly, $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + (\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ implies that $x = \pm 8$ and $y = \pm 8$.
The points $(x, y)$ that satisfy both conditions are $(10, 10), (10, -10), (-10, 10), (-10, -10), (8, 8), (8, -8), (-8, 8), (-8, -8)$. These points form a square with side length 20. Therefore, the area of the square is $20^2 = 400$. The answer is: $400$

Approach:


The expression $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ implies that $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. These are the equations of two lines passing through the origin making an angle of 90 degrees between them.
Similarly, the expression $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ implies that $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$, which are the equations of two circles of radius 8 centered at the origin.
The intersection of these lines and circles forms a square with side length 16.
The area of this square is $16^2 = 256$.
The answer is: $256$

Solve the following problem with a Python Script (positive numerical answer):
"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"

Approach:

 The equation $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ is satisfied when either of the two factors is zero. This gives us four conditions:

1. $\vert x + y \vert - 10 = 0$ and $\vert x \vert - 8 = 0$ and $\vert y \vert - 8 = 0$. From this we get $x = \pm 8$ and $y = \pm 8$. This gives us a total of four points: $(8, 8)$, $(8, -8)$, $(-8, 8)$, and $(-8, -8)$.

2. $\vert x + y \vert - 10 = 0$ and $\vert x - y \vert - 10 = 0$. From this we get $x = y = \pm 5$. This gives us two more points: $(5, 5)$ and $(-5, -5)$.

3. $\vert x - y \vert - 10 = 0$ and $\vert x \vert - 8 = 0$ and $\vert y \vert - 8 = 0$. This leads to the same points as in condition 1.

4. $\vert x - y \vert - 10 = 0$ and $\vert x \vert - 8 = 0$. This leads to the same points as in condition 2.

The four points form a square with side length 16. The area of this square is $16^2 = 256$. So the area of the convex polygon is 256.
The answer is: 256

Solve the following problem with a Python Script (positive numerical answer):
"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"

Approach:



The equation $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + (\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + (\vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ is satisfied if either $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + (\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + (\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$.

If $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + (\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$, then $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. This implies that the points lie on the lines $x + y = 10$ and $x - y = 10$ or $x + y = -10$ and $x - y = -10$. These lines form a square with side length 10.

If $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + (\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$, then $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$. This implies that the points lie on the lines $x = 8$ and $y = 8$ or $x = -8$ and $y = -8$. These lines form a square with side length 16.

The combined region of these two squares is a larger square with side length 16. Therefore, the area of the convex polygon is $16^2 = 256$. The answer is: $256$.
