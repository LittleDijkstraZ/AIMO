Approach:



The equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has 4 distinct solutions if and only if the value $\frac{m}{100}$ is the distance between the two inner barriers of the “double bars” in the graph of the function $f(x) = \vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert$.

The graph of $f(x)$ has two inner barriers located at $x=1-2 = -1$ and $x=1+2 = 3$. The distance between these two barriers is $3 - (-1) = 4$.

So we must have $\frac{m}{100} = 4$, which implies $m = 400$.

Thus, there is only one positive integer $m$ that satisfies the condition, namely $m = 400$. The answer is: $1$

Solve the following problem with a Python Script (positive numerical answer):
"For how many positive integers $m$ does the equation \[\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}\] have $4$ distinct solutions?"

Approach:



The equation $| |x - 1| - 2| = \frac{m}{100}$ has 4 distinct solutions means that the right-hand side, $\frac{m}{100}$, is the distance between two "pieces" of the graph of $|x - 1| - 2$. Since the graph of $|x - 1| - 2$ is a V-shape, the distance between the two "pieces" of the V-shape is 2. This means that $\frac{m}{100} = 2$, so $m = 200$.

So the value of $m$ that makes the equation have 4 distinct solutions is 200.

To confirm this, we can solve the equation $| |x - 1| - 2| = \frac{200}{100}$ step by step:

1. Simplify the right-hand side: $| |x - 1| - 2| = 2$.

2. Split the absolute value on the left-hand side into two separate cases:
   a) $|x - 1| - 2 = 2$, which simplifies to $|x - 1| = 4$.
   b) $|x - 1| - 2 = -2$, which simplifies to $|x - 1| = 0$.

3. For case (a), $|x - 1| = 4$, we split it into two separate cases again:
   a1) $x - 1 = 4$, which simplifies to $x = 5$.
   a2) $x - 1 = -4$, which simplifies to $x = -3$.

4. For case (b), $|x - 1| = 0$, we have $x - 1 = 0$, which simplifies to $x = 1$.

5. We have found three distinct solutions $x = -3$, $x = 1$, and $x = 5$. The fourth solution can be found by considering the reflection of the equation $| |x - 1| - 2| = 2$ in the y-axis, which gives $| | -x - 1| - 2| = 2$. This simplifies to $| | -x - 1| - 2| = 2$, and further simplifies to $| -x - 1 - 2| = 2$, which simplifies to $|-x - 3| = 2$. This splits into two cases:
   b1) $-x - 3 = 2$, which simplifies to $-x = 5$, and then $x = -5$.
   b2) $-x - 3 = -2$, which simplifies to $-x = 1$, and then $x = -1$.

So the four distinct solutions are $x = -5$, $x = -3$, $x = 1$, and $x = 5$.

Therefore, the value of $m$ that makes the equation have 4 distinct solutions is indeed 200.

The answer is: $1$

Solve the following problem with a Python Script (positive numerical answer):
"For how many positive integers $m$ does the equation \[\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}\] have $4$ distinct solutions?"

Approach:


To solve this problem, we need to find the number of positive integers $m$ such that the equation $| |x-1|-2|=\frac{m}{100}$ has $4$ distinct solutions.
We can start by considering the inner absolute value expression $|x-1|-2$. This expression can take on two possible values, $y$ and $-y$, where $y = |x-1|-2$.
Then we have two cases to consider:
1. $|y| = \frac{m}{100}$, which gives us two sub-cases: $y = \frac{m}{100}$ and $y = -\frac{m}{100}$.
2. $|-y| = \frac{m}{100}$, which also gives us two sub-cases: $-y = \frac{m}{100}$ and $-y = -\frac{m}{100}$.

For each of these cases, we need to solve the equations and find the number of distinct solutions.

Let's solve the cases:

Case 1: $y = |x-1|-2 = \frac{m}{100}$.
We first solve the equation $|x-1| = \frac{m}{100} + 2$. This gives us two sub-cases:
- For $x \geq 1$, we have $x-1 = \frac{m}{100} + 2$, which simplifies to $x = \frac{m}{100} + 3$.
- For $x < 1$, we have $1-x = \frac{m}{100} + 2$, which simplifies to $x = 1 - \frac{m}{100} - 2 = - \frac{m}{100} - 1$.
For these solutions to be distinct, we need $\frac{m}{100} + 3 \neq - \frac{m}{100} - 1$, which simplifies to $m \neq -50$.

Case 2: $y = |x-1|-2 = -\frac{m}{100}$.
We first solve the equation $|x-1| = 2 - \frac{m}{100}$. This gives us two sub-cases:
- For $x \geq 1$, we have $x-1 = 2 - \frac{m}{100}$, which simplifies to $x = 3 - \frac{m}{100}$.
- For $x < 1$, we have $1-x = 2 - \frac{m}{100}$, which simplifies to $x = -1 + \frac{m}{100}$.
For these solutions to be distinct, we need $3 - \frac{m}{100} \neq -1 + \frac{m}{100}$, which simplifies to $m \neq 200$.

Case 3: $-y = |x-1|-2 = \frac{m}{100}$.
This is the same as Case 1.

Case 4: $-y = |x-1|-2 = -\frac{m}{100}$.
This is the same as Case 2.

To have 4 distinct solutions, we need the conditions $m \neq -50$ and $m \neq 200$ to hold. This means $m$ can be any positive integer except $50$ and $200$. There are $198$ such positive integers.

So, the number of positive integers $m$ such that the equation $| |x-1|-2|=\frac{m}{100}$ has $4$ distinct solutions is $198$.
The answer is: $198$

Approach:


The equation $| |x - 1| - 2| = \frac{m}{100}$ has 4 distinct solutions if and only if the number $\frac{m}{100}$ is equal to the distance between the two middle solutions of the equation $|x - 1| - 2 = 0$.
The solutions of the equation $|x - 1| - 2 = 0$ are $x = 3$ and $x = -1$.
The distance between these two solutions is $3 - (-1) = 4$.
So, we want to find how many positive integers $m$ satisfy $\frac{m}{100} = 4$, which implies $m = 400$.
Therefore, the number of positive integers $m$ for which the equation has 4 distinct solutions is 1.
The answer is: $1$

Solve the following problem with a Python Script (positive numerical answer):

Approach:



The equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has 4 distinct solutions if and only if $\frac{m}{100} = 1$. This is because the function $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert$ oscillates between 0 and 4, and it equals 1 exactly twice in this interval.

To see this, let's consider the absolute value function $\vert x - 1 \vert$. For $x \leq 1$, $\vert x - 1 \vert = 1 - x$, and for $x > 1$, $\vert x - 1 \vert = x - 1$. The function $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert$ is then:

- 0 if $x \leq 1$ and $1 - x \geq 2$, or $x \leq 1$ and $x - 1 \geq 2$. This is the case if $x \leq 1$ and $x \leq -1$ or $x \leq 1$ and $x \geq 3$, which has no solution.
- $2 - x$ if $x \leq 1$ and $1 - x < 2$, or $x \leq 1$ and $x - 1 < 2$. This is the case if $x \leq 1$ and $x > 1$, which means $1 < x \leq 3$.
- $x - 3$ if $x > 1$ and $x - 1 \geq 2$, or $x > 1$ and $1 - x \geq 2$. This is the case if $x > 1$ and $x \geq 3$, or $x > 1$ and $x \leq -1$, which has no solution.
- 0 if $x > 1$ and $x - 1 < 2$, or $x > 1$ and $1 - x < 2$. This is the case if $x > 1$ and $x < 3$, or $x > 1$ and $x > -1$, which means $1 < x < 3$.

So the function $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert$ oscillates between 0 and 4.

Therefore, the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has 4 distinct solutions if and only if $\frac{m}{100} = 1$, or $m = 100$.

So the number of positive integers $m$ for which the equation has 4 distinct solutions is 1.

The answer is: $1$
