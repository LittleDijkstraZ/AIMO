Interesting, let's analyze step by step:



The product of two numbers equals zero if and only if at least one of them is zero. Therefore, our original equation breaks down into two separate sets of equations to solve:

1. $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0 \ \text{and} \ (\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$.
2. $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0 \ \text{and} \ (\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$.

From the first equation in each set, we get:

1.1. $\vert x + y \vert = 10 \Rightarrow x + y = \pm 10$.
1.2. $\vert x \vert = 8 \Rightarrow x = \pm 8 \ \text{and} \ \vert y \vert = 8 \Rightarrow y = \pm 8$.

From the second equation in each set, we get:

2.1. $\vert x - y \vert = 10 \Rightarrow x - y = \pm 10$.
2.2. The same as in 1.2.

Now we need to find the intersections of the lines given by these equations. After graphing these equations, it is clear that the intersection points form a square with side length $16$. The area of this square is $16^2 = 256$.

So the area of the convex polygon is 256 square units. This is a positive integer, as required. The answer is: $256$

This problem is a mathematical expression which encloses a set of points $(x, y)$ that satisfy the equation. If the equation equals zero, that means the left part of the equation times the right part of the equation equals zero. This means that either the left part equals zero, or the right part equals zero, or both.

For the left part: $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2) = 0$, either both $|x+y| - 10 = 0$ and $|x - y| - 10 = 0$ or one of them is zero. These two equations translate to $|x+y| = 10$ and $|x - y| = 10$.

For the right part: $((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$, it translates to $|x| = 8$ and $|y| = 8$.

Now, we need to find the intersection of the solutions of these two sets of equations to get the set of points $(x, y)$ that satisfy the original equation.

The sets of solutions for the left and right parts give us:
- For the left part, the solutions are two lines with slopes of $+1$ and $-1$, and they pass through the points $(0, 10)$ and $(0, -10)$. The lines are $y = x + 10$ and $y = -x + 10$.
- For the right part, the solutions are two lines with slopes of $+1$ and $-1$, and they pass through the points $(8, 0)$ and $(-8, 0)$. The lines are $y = x - 8$ and $y = -x - 8$.

The intersection of these lines forms a square with side length 8 and area $8^2 = 64$. So the area of the convex polygon is 64 square units. The answer is: 64

Interesting, let's analyze step by step:



Step 1: The math problem asks for the area of the region enclosed by the points that satisfy the equation. The equation is given as
$$((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0.$$

Step 2: The product of two factors is zero if and only if at least one of the factors is zero. Therefore, we need to solve the following two equations:

$$((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2) = 0$$ and $$(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0.$$

Step 3: The first equation simplifies to $|x+y| = 10$ and $|x-y| = 10$. These are the equations of two pairs of parallel lines, each pair being 20 units apart. The intersection points of these lines form a square with side length 20.

The second equation simplifies to $|x| = 8$ and $|y| = 8$. These are the equations of two pairs of parallel lines, each pair being 16 units apart. The intersection points of these lines form a square with side length 16.

Step 4: The area of the first square is $20^2 = 400$, and the area of the second square is $16^2 = 256$.

Step 5: To find the total area of the region enclosed by the points that satisfy the equation, we simply add the areas of the two squares: $400 + 256 = 656$.

However, we must check if this is a positive integer. It is. Therefore, the area of the convex polygon enclosed by the points that satisfy the given equation is $656$. The answer is: $656$

Interesting, let's analyze step by step:



The product of two numbers is zero if and only if at least one of the numbers is zero. So we have the following four cases:
1. $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$.
2. $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$.
3. $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$.
4. $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$.

Let's analyze each case:

1. $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ or $-10$. If $\vert x + y \vert = 10$, then $x + y = 10$ or $x + y = -10$. Similarly, if $\vert x + y \vert = -10$, then $x + y = -10$ or $x + y = 10$. So in this case, we have four lines: $x + y = 10$, $x + y = -10$, $x + y = -10$, and $x + y = 10$. However, these are all the same lines, so we only get two parallel lines: $x + y = 10$ and $x + y = -10$.

2. $\vert x - y \vert = 10$ or $-10$. If $\vert x - y \vert = 10$, then $x - y = 10$ or $x - y = -10$. Similarly, if $\vert x - y \vert = -10$, then $x - y = -10$ or $x - y = 10$. So in this case, we have four lines: $x - y = 10$, $x - y = -10$, $x - y = -10$, and $x - y = 10$. However, these are all the same lines, so we only get two parallel lines: $x - y = 10$ and $x - y = -10$.

3. $\vert x \vert = 8$ or $-8$. If $\vert x \vert = 8$, then $x = 8$ or $x = -8$. Similarly, if $\vert x \vert = -8$, then $x = -8$ or $x = 8$. So in this case, we have four lines: $x = 8$, $x = -8$, $x = -8$, and $x = 8$. However, these are all the same lines, so we only get two parallel lines: $x = 8$ and $x = -8$.

4. $\vert y \vert = 8$ or $-8$. If $\vert y \vert = 8$, then $y = 8$ or $y = -8$. Similarly, if $\vert y \vert = -8$, then $y = -8$ or $y = 8$. So in this case, we have four lines: $y = 8$, $y = -8$, $y = -8$, and $y = 8$. However, these are all the same lines, so we only get two parallel lines: $y = 8$ and $y = -8$.

The intersection points of these lines are: $(8, 10)$, $(8, -10)$, $(-8, 10)$, and $(-8, -10)$. These points form a rectangle with side lengths $20$ and $16$. The area of this rectangle is $20 \times 16 = 320$. The value $320$ is a positive integer, so we can be confident in our solution. The area of the convex polygon is $320$. The answer is: $320$.

Interesting, let's analyze step by step:



The equation is of the form $A \cdot B = 0$, which implies either $A = 0$ or $B = 0$. So either $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$. 

1. If $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$, then $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. This implies $x + y = \pm 10$ and $x - y = \pm 10$. Solving these four equations, we get the vertices of the square: $(0, 10), (0, -10), (10, 0), (-10, 0)$.

2. If $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$, then $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$, which implies $x = \pm 8$ and $y = \pm 8$. Solving these four equations, we get the vertices of the square: $(8, 0), (-8, 0), (0, 8), (0, -8)$.

So the convex polygon is the union of the two squares, which is a 4x4 square. The area of this square is $4 \times 4 = 16$.

So the area of the convex polygon is $16$. Since we've derived the answer from a mathematical problem, the result is positive integer. The answer is: $\boxed{16}$.

Interesting, let's analyze step by step:



The equation $A \cdot B = 0$ implies that either $A = 0$ or $B = 0$. In this case, the polygon is the union of the solutions to the two separate equations:

$(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ and $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$, which give us $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$.

and

$(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ and $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$, which gives us $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$.

Now we just need to solve these four equations step by step.

1. For the equation $\vert x + y \vert = 10$, we get two possibilities: $x + y = 10$ or $x + y = -10$.
2. For the equation $\vert x - y \vert = 10$, we also get two possibilities: $x - y = 10$ or $x - y = -10$.
3. For the equation $\vert x \vert = 8$, we get two possibilities: $x = 8$ or $x = -8$.
4. For the equation $\vert y \vert = 8$, we also get two possibilities: $y = 8$ or $y = -8$.

Now we can create the vertices of the polygon by combining these possibilities:

- For $x = 8$ and $y = 8$, we get: $x + y = 16$, $x - y = 0$, which gives us the vertex $(8, 8)$.
- For $x = 8$ and $y = -8$, we get: $x + y = 0$, $x - y = 16$, which gives us the vertex $(8, -8)$.
- For $x = -8$ and $y = 8$, we get: $x + y = 0$, $x - y = -16$, which gives us the vertex $(-8, 8)$.
- For $x = -8$ and $y = -8$, we get: $x + y = -16$, $x - y = 0$, which gives us the vertex $(-8, -8)$.

Now we have the four vertices of the polygon: $(8, 8)$, $(8, -8)$, $(-8, 8)$, and $(-8, -8)$. The polygon is a square with side length $16$, so its area is $16^2 = 256$.
The answer is $\boxed{256}$.

Assistant:

Interesting, let's analyze step by step:



The condition $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ encloses a convex polygon. This means that either $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$. If the first term equals zero, it means that $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. The only possible solution for this is a square with side length $10\sqrt{2}$ (by the Pythagorean theorem). If the second term equals zero, it means that $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$, which is also a square with side length $16$. In conclusion, the points that satisfy this condition form two squares.

We can calculate the area of these squares using the standard formula for the area of a square ($side^2$):

Area of the smaller square: $(10\sqrt{2})^2 = 200$.
Area of the larger square: $(16)^2 = 256$.
The total area of the polygon is then the sum of the areas of these two squares: $200 + 256 = 456$.

To verify that the answer is positive and an integer, we just need to perform the addition:

456 is a positive integer. So the area of the convex polygon is 456 square units.

Now let's output the result:
The area of the convex polygon is 456 square units. The answer is: $456$

Assistant:

Interesting, let's analyze step by step:



Step 1: Identify the sympy functions required for each step.

We need to solve a complex system of equations. The Sympy library can help us with that. The `sympy.solve` function will be used to solve this system of equations.

Step 2: Implement these functions step-by-step, commenting each line for clarity.

The system of equations is obtained from the condition $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + (\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ and $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + (\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$. The solutions to the first equation are pairs $(x, y)$ such that $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. The only solutions to these equations are of the form $(x, y) = (8, 8)$, $(-8, -8)$, $(8, -8)$, or $(-8, 8)$. The solutions to the second equation are pairs $(x, y)$ such that $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$. So the solutions to the second equation are of the form $(x, y) = (8, 8)$, $(8, -8)$, $(-8, 8)$, or $(-8, -8)$. 

Now we can analyze these solutions: The set of solutions of the first equation is the set of vertices of a square with side length 16 and centered at the origin, and the set of solutions of the second equation is also the set of vertices of a square with side length 16 and centered at the origin. 

So the set of solutions of both equations is the union of these two squares, which is also a square with side length 16 and centered at the origin. The area of this square is $16^2 = 256$.

Step 3: Calculate the final answer and verify it's a positive integer.
The area of the square is 256, which is a positive integer.

Step 4: Output the result.

The area of the convex polygon is 256. Therefore, the answer is $256$. We put it in a box because it's a final answer:

$$256$$

Interesting, let's analyze step by step:



The equation given is $ ((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0 $. A product equals zero if either of the terms equals zero. This gives us two cases to consider:

1. $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0 \Rightarrow \vert x + y \vert = 10$
2. $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0 \Rightarrow \vert x \vert = 8$
3. $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0 \Rightarrow \vert x - y \vert = 10$
4. $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0 \Rightarrow \vert y \vert = 8$

Let's analyze these cases:

1. $\vert x + y \vert = 10 \Rightarrow x + y = \pm 10$
2. $\vert x \vert = 8 \Rightarrow x = \pm 8$
3. $\vert x - y \vert = 10 \Rightarrow x - y = \pm 10$
4. $\vert y \vert = 8 \Rightarrow y = \pm 8$

The points that satisfy all these conditions are the vertices of a square with side length 16 (the maximum of $\vert x \vert$ and $\vert y \vert$). Therefore, the area of this square is $16^2 = 256$. So, the area of the convex polygon is 256. The answer is: $256$
