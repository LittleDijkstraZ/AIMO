Below is a math problem you are to solve (positive numerical answer!):
"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"
Analyze this problem and think step by step to come to a solution with programs. After solving the problem, output the final numerical answer within \boxed{}.

Assistant:


The expression $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2)$ equals to zero if and only if both of the factors are zero. This happens if and only if $\vert x + y \vert = 10$, $\vert x - y \vert = 10$, $\vert x \vert = 8$, and $\vert y \vert = 8$.

The solutions to $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$ are the lines $x + y = \pm 10$ and $x - y = \pm 10$.

The solutions to $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$ are the lines $x = \pm 8$ and $y = \pm 8$.

These lines enclose a square with side length 16. The area of this square is $16^2 = 256$. Therefore, the area of the convex polygon is 256 square units.

The answer is: $256$

The equation given in the problem is a product of two terms equal to zero. This means that either the first term is zero or the second term is zero. 

The first term is zero when either $|x+y| - 10 = 0$ or $|x - y| - 10 = 0$. These simplify to $|x+y| = 10$ and $|x - y| = 10$. These are the equations of two lines passing through the origin at a 45-degree angle to the x and y axes.

The second term is zero when either $|x| - 8 = 0$ or $|y| - 8 = 0$. These simplify to $|x| = 8$ and $|y| = 8$, which are the equations of two circles with radius 8 centered at the origin.

The intersection of these lines and circles encloses a square with side length 16. The area of this square is $16^2 = 256$. So, the area of the convex polygon is 256.

"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"

Assistant:

 The given equation is of the form $(A)(B) = 0$, which means that either $A = 0$ or $B = 0$. Therefore, the points that satisfy this equation are the union of the points that satisfy $A = 0$ and the points that satisfy $B = 0$.

For $A = 0$, we have $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$, which implies $\vert x + y \vert = 10$. This gives us two lines: $x + y = 10$ and $x + y = -10$.

For $B = 0$, we have $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$, which implies $\vert x \vert = 8$. This gives us two lines: $x = 8$ and $x = -8$. Similarly, for $\vert y \vert = 8$, we get two lines: $y = 8$ and $y = -8$.

The points that satisfy the given equation are the intersections of these lines. Plotting these lines, we see that they enclose a square with side length 16. The area of this square is $16^2 = 256$.
The answer is: $256$
