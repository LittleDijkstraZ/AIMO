Below is a math problem you are to solve (positive numerical answer!):
"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"
Analyze this problem and think step by step to come to a solution with programs. After solving the problem, output the final numerical answer within \boxed{}.

Assistant:


The equation is satisfied if and only if either $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$. These conditions are met if and only if either $|x+y| = 10$, $|x-y| = 10$, $|x| = 8$, or $|y| = 8$.
These conditions represent the equations of four lines in the plane: $x+y = \pm 10$, $x-y = \pm 10$, $x = \pm 8$, and $y = \pm 8$. These lines form a square with side length 16. The area of this square is $16^2 = 256$. Therefore, the area of the convex polygon is 256.

Below is a math problem you are to solve (positive numerical answer!):
"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"
Analyze this problem and think step by step to come to a solution with programs. After solving the problem, output the final numerical answer within \boxed{}.

Assistant:

 To solve this problem, we first need to understand the given equation. The equation is equal to zero if and only if either of the two factors is equal to zero. This gives us two sets of equations to solve:

1. $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ and $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ and $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ and $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$.

2. $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ and $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ and $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ and $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$.

From these sets of equations, we can deduce that the vertices of the polygon are the points where $|x+y|=10$, $|x|=8$, $|x-y|=10$, and $|y|=8$.

These points form a square with side length 10 (from $|x+y|=10$ and $|x-y|=10$) and diagonals of length 16 (from $|x|=8$ and $|y|=8$). Using the Pythagorean theorem, we can find that the length of the diagonals is $\sqrt{16^2 + 16^2} = 16\sqrt{2}$. Therefore, the side length of the square is $\frac{16\sqrt{2}}{\sqrt{2}} = 16$.

The area of the square is then side length squared, which is $16^2 = 256$. Therefore, the area of the convex polygon is 256. The answer is: $256$

"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"
Analyze this problem and think step by step to come to a solution with programs. After solving the problem, output the final numerical answer within \boxed{}.

Assistant:

 To find the area of the convex polygon, we first need to understand the given equation and the conditions it imposes on $x$ and $y$.

The equation is $ ((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$.

For the product of two numbers to be zero, one of them must be zero. Therefore, either $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2) = 0$ or $((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$.

If $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2) = 0$, then both $\vert x + y \vert - 10 = 0$ and $\vert x - y \vert - 10 = 0$, which implies that $x + y = \pm 10$ and $x - y = \pm 10$. Solving these equations gives $x = y = \pm 5$.

If $((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$, then both $\vert x \vert - 8 = 0$ and $\vert y \vert - 8 = 0$, which implies that $x = \pm 8$ and $y = \pm 8$.

So, the points that satisfy the equation are $(8,8)$, $(-8,8)$, $(8,-8)$, and $(-8,-8)$, which form a square with side length 16. The area of this square is $16^2 = 256$.
The answer is: 256
