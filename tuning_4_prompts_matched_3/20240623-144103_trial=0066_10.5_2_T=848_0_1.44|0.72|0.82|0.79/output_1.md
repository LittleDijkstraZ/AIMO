 To solve this problem, we first note that the given equation $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$ is always true, because $|a| = |-a|$ for any real number $a$. Therefore, the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ will occur when the expression inside the absolute value in the equation is zero. Setting $x-2y = 0$ and $y-2x = 0$, we find that $x = 2y$ and $y = 2x$. Substituting the first equation into the second, we get $y = 4y$, so $y = 0$ and $x = 0$. Therefore, the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ occurs when $x = 0$ and $y = 0$. Substituting these values into the expression, we get $5(0)^2+5(0)^2-8(0)(0) = 0$. Therefore, the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ is 0. The answer is: $0$

To solve this problem, we first need to rewrite the constraint equation in a more manageable form. Let's substitute $a = x - 2y$ and $b = y - 2x$. Then the constraint equation becomes $|a| + |b| = 40$. 

Next, we express $x$ and $y$ in terms of $a$ and $b$:
\[x = \frac{a - 2b}{3} \quad \text{and} \quad y = \frac{2a - b}{3}.\]

Substitute these into the expression we want to minimize:
\[5x^2 + 5y^2 - 8xy = 5\left(\frac{a - 2b}{3}\right)^2 + 5\left(\frac{2a - b}{3}\right)^2 - 8\left(\frac{a - 2b}{3}\right)\left(\frac{2a - b}{3}\right).\]

After simplifying this expression, we find that it equals to $\frac{3}{2}(a^2 + b^2)$. 

The constraint equation $|a| + |b| = 40$ implies $a^2 + b^2 = (40 - |a - b|)^2$. 

Substituting this into the expression we want to minimize, we get:
\[\frac{3}{2}(a^2 + b^2) = \frac{3}{2}(40 - |a - b|)^2.\]

To minimize this expression, we need to maximize $|a - b|$. The maximum value of $|a - b|$ under the constraint $|a| + |b| = 40$ is 40 (when $a$ and $b$ have opposite signs). 

Substituting this into the expression, we get:
\[\frac{3}{2}(40 - 40)^2 = 0.\]

So the minimum value of $5x^2 + 5y^2 - 8xy$ under the given constraint is 0.

The minimum value of $5x^2 + 5y^2 - 8xy$ is 0. The answer is: $0$

Below is a math problem you are to solve (positive numerical answer!):

 The problem is a bit complicated to solve directly using Python, so we'll break it down into smaller steps.

Step 1: Use the condition $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$ to express $x$ or $y$ in terms of the other variable. Without loss of generality, we can express $y$ in terms of $x$:

\[|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40 \implies y = \frac{x \pm 20}{3}\]

Step 2: Substitute $y$ from step 1 into the expression $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$:

\[5x^2 + 5\left(\frac{x \pm 20}{3}\right)^2 - 8x\left(\frac{x \pm 20}{3}\right)\]

Step 3: Simplify the expression in step 2:

\[5x^2 + \frac{5(x^2 \pm 40x + 400)}{9} - \frac{8x(x \pm 20)}{3}\]

Step 4: Find the derivative of the expression in step 3 with respect to $x$:

\[\frac{d}{dx}\left(5x^2 + \frac{5(x^2 \pm 40x + 400)}{9} - \frac{8x(x \pm 20)}{3}\right)\]

Step 5: Set the derivative equal to zero and solve for $x$ to find the critical points:

\[\frac{d}{dx} = 0 \implies x = \pm 4\]

Step 6: Substitute the critical points into the expression in step 3 to find the corresponding $y$ values:

\[y = \frac{x \pm 20}{3} \implies y = \pm \frac{16}{3}\]

Step 7: Calculate the minimum value of the expression in step 3 by substituting the critical points $(x, y) = (4, \frac{16}{3})$ or $(-4, -\frac{16}{3})$:

\[5x^2 + 5y^2 - 8xy = 5(4)^2 + 5\left(\frac{16}{3}\right)^2 - 8(4)\left(\frac{16}{3}\right) = -\frac{640}{9}\]

Since we are looking for a positive numerical answer, we can disregard the negative value we obtained. Thus, the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ when $x$ and $y$ range over all real numbers such that $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$ is the positive value:

\[-\frac{640}{9} = -71.1111...\]

However, this is not a valid answer as it is negative. It seems we made a mistake in our calculations. Let's retrace our steps and see if we can find the error.

Upon re-examining our calculations, we realize that we should not have taken the absolute value of the expression in step 1. The correct expression should be:

\[y = \frac{x \pm 20}{3}\]

Now let's redo the calculations based on this corrected expression.

Step 1 (corrected): $y = \frac{x \pm 20}{3}$

Step 2 (corrected): Substitute $y$ from step 1 into the expression $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$:

\[5x^2 + 5\left(\frac{x \pm 20}{3}\right)^2 - 8x\left(\frac{x \pm 20}{3}\right)\]

Step 3 (corrected): Simplify the expression in step 2:

\[5x^2 + \frac{5(x^2 \pm 40x + 400)}{9} - \frac{8x(x \pm 20)}{3}\]

Step 4 (corrected): Find the derivative of the expression in step 3 with respect to $x$:

\[\frac{d}{dx}\left(5x^2 + \frac{5(x^2 \pm 40x + 400)}{9} - \frac{8x(x \pm 20)}{3}\right)\]

Step 5 (corrected): Set the derivative equal to zero and solve for $x$ to find the critical points:

\[\frac{d}{dx} = 0 \implies x = \pm 4\]

Step 6 (corrected): Substitute the critical points into the expression in step 3 to find the corresponding $y$ values:

\[y = \frac{x \pm 20}{3} \implies y = \pm \frac{16}{3}\]

Step 7 (corrected): Calculate the minimum value of the expression in step 3 by substituting the critical points $(x, y) = (4, \frac{16}{3})$ or $(-4, -\frac{16}{3})$:

\[5x^2 + 5y^2 - 8xy = 5(4)^2 + 5\left(\frac{16}{3}\right)^2 - 8(4)\left(\frac{16}{3}\right) = \frac{640}{9}\]

This time, we obtained a positive value. However, it seems this is not the correct minimum value either. Let's try another approach.

Let's express the given expression $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ in terms of a single variable. We know that $x$ and $y$ must satisfy the condition $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$. Without loss of generality, let's express $y$ in terms of $x$:

\[|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40 \implies y = \frac{x \pm 20}{3}\]

Substitute $y$ into the expression $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$:

\[5x^2 + 5\left(\frac{x \pm 20}{3}\right)^2 - 8x\left(\frac{x \pm 20}{3}\right)\]

Simplify:

\[5x^2 + \frac{5(x^2 \pm 40x + 400)}{9} - \frac{8x(x \pm 20)}{3}\]

This is a complicated expression, so let's try to simplify it further. Let's call the expression $F(x)$:

\[F(x) = 5x^2 + \frac{5(x^2 \pm 40x + 400)}{9} - \frac{8x(x \pm 20)}{3}\]

To find the minimum

 This problem requires a bit of clever manipulation to make it solvable by standard mathematical methods. Here's how to solve it:

First, let's denote $u = x - 2y$ and $v = y - 2x$. We are given that $|u| + |v| = 40$. Now, let's express $x$ and $y$ in terms of $u$ and $v$:

$$x = \frac{u - 2v}{3}$$
$$y = \frac{2u - v}{3}$$

Now, substitute these into the expression $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$:

$$5\left(\frac{u - 2v}{3}\right)^2 + 5\left(\frac{2u - v}{3}\right)^2 - 8\left(\frac{u - 2v}{3}\right)\left(\frac{2u - v}{3}\right)$$

This simplifies to:

$$\frac{5}{9}(u^2 + 4v^2 + 4uv) + \frac{5}{9}(4u^2 + v^2 - 4uv) - \frac{16}{9}(u^2 - 2uv + v^2)$$

Simplifying further, we get:

$$\frac{5}{9}(5u^2 + 5v^2) = \frac{25}{9}(u^2 + v^2)$$

Now, recall that $u^2 + v^2 = (x - 2y)^2 + (y - 2x)^2 = 40^2 = 1600$. Therefore, the expression simplifies to:

$$\frac{25}{9} \cdot 1600 = \frac{40000}{9}$$

Now, let's express the value of the minimum in a more readable format:

$$\frac{40000}{9} = 4444\frac{4}{9}$$

However, we know that the minimum value of the expression $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ is attained when $x = y = 0$. In this case, the value of the expression is 0. Therefore, the minimum value of the expression $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ subject to the constraint $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$ is 0.
