Approach:


The equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has 4 distinct solutions if and only if $\frac{m}{100} \in (0, 2)$. This is because the function $f(x) = \vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert$ has a maximum value of 2 and a minimum value of 0. Therefore, the equation $f(x) = \frac{m}{100}$ has 4 distinct solutions when $\frac{m}{100}$ is in the interval $(0, 2)$.

Now, we need to find how many positive integers $m$ satisfy this condition. The interval $(0, 2)$ contains all the numbers from 1 to 200, except 0 and 200. Since the problem asks for positive integers $m$, we can't have $m = 0$ or $m = 200$. Therefore, the number of positive integers $m$ that satisfy the condition is $200 - 2 = 198$.

So, the number of positive integers $m$ for which the equation has 4 distinct solutions is 198.

The answer is: 198.

Approach:

 To find the number of positive integers $m$ for which the equation $| |x-1|-2|=\frac{m}{100}$ has four distinct solutions, we need to analyze the behavior of the left-hand side of the equation.

The expression $| |x-1|-2|$ represents the distance between $x$ and $1$, minus $2$. This expression equals $\frac{m}{100}$ for four different values of $x$. 

When $m = 200$, the right-hand side of the equation is $2$. The left-hand side $| |x-1|-2|$ equals $2$ when $|x-1|=4$, which gives us two solutions $x=5$ and $x=-3$. However, since we are only interested in positive solutions, we discard the negative solution.

When $m = 100$, the right-hand side of the equation is $1$. The left-hand side $| |x-1|-2|$ equals $1$ when $|x-1|=3$, which gives us two solutions $x=4$ and $x=-2$. Again, we discard the negative solution.

When $m = 50$, the right-hand side of the equation is $0.5$. The left-hand side $| |x-1|-2|$ equals $0.5$ when $|x-1|=2.5$, which gives us two solutions $x=3.5$ and $x=0.5$.

When $m = 0$, the right-hand side of the equation is $0$. The left-hand side $| |x-1|-2|$ equals $0$ when $|x-1|=2$, which gives us two solutions $x=3$ and $x=-1$. Again, we discard the negative solution.

So, the only value of $m$ for which the equation has four distinct solutions is $m=100$. Therefore, the number of positive integers $m$ is $1$. The answer is: $1$

Approach:

 The given equation has four distinct solutions if and only if $\frac{m}{100}$ is strictly between $1$ and $2$. This is because the expression on the left-hand side, $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert$, can take on any value from $0$ to $3$ (inclusive), and it equals $\frac{m}{100}$ when it has four distinct solutions. If $\frac{m}{100}$ is less than $1$, then the expression can only take on the values $0$ and $1$. If $\frac{m}{100}$ is greater than $2$, then the expression can only take on the values $2$ and $3$. Therefore, $\frac{m}{100}$ must be strictly between $1$ and $2$.

To find the values of $m$ that satisfy this condition, we multiply the inequalities $1 < \frac{m}{100} < 2$ by $100$ to get $100 < m < 200$. The positive integers that satisfy this inequality are the integers from $101$ to $199$, inclusive. To find the number of these integers, we subtract the smallest integer in this range from the largest and add $1$. This gives us $199 - 101 + 1 = 99$.
The answer is: $99$.

Approach:


To find the number of positive integers $m$ for which the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has $4$ distinct solutions, we need to analyze the behavior of the function $f(x) = \vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert$.

First, let's consider the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$. This equation has $4$ distinct solutions when the right-hand side $\frac{m}{100}$ falls into a specific range of values. The function $f(x)$ is a piecewise function that consists of four linear segments. It is equal to $x-3$ when $x< -1$, $3-x$ when $-1 \leq x < 3$, $x-1$ when $3 \leq x < 5$, and $1-x$ when $x \geq 5$.

The function $f(x)$ takes on all values in the interval $[0, 2]$ exactly once. Therefore, the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has $4$ distinct solutions when $\frac{m}{100}$ is in the interval $(0, 2]$. This is equivalent to the inequality $0 < \frac{m}{100} \leq 2$.

Solving the inequality $0 < \frac{m}{100} \leq 2$ for $m$ gives $0 < m \leq 200$. Therefore, the positive integers $m$ that satisfy the equation are the integers from $1$ to $200$. The number of such integers is $200$.

However, we must exclude the value $m=0$, because that would lead to the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=0$, which has only two solutions, not four. So the number of positive integers $m$ that satisfy the equation is $200-1=199$.

Therefore, there are 199 positive integers $m$ for which the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has $4$ distinct solutions. The answer is: $\boxed{199}$.

Approach:


1. We know that the function $| |x - 1| - 2|$ can take four distinct values for $x$ if and only if $\frac{m}{100} \in (0, 2)$. Therefore, we have $0 < \frac{m}{100} < 2$, which gives $0 < m < 200$.
2. Now, we need to count the number of positive integers $m$ in the range $(0, 200)$. This is simply $200 - 1 = 199$.
3. However, we are asked for the number of positive integers $m$, not the number of positive real numbers $\frac{m}{100}$. Therefore, we need to consider the multiples of $100$ in the range $(0, 200)$. These are $m = 100$ and $m = 200$, but these are not in the range $0 < m < 200$.
4. So, the number of positive integers $m$ that make the equation have four distinct solutions is the number of multiples of $100$ in the range $(0, 200)$, which is 1.

However, this contradicts with the result from step 2. This means that our approach in step 1 must be wrong. 

After reconsidering, we realize that the equation $| |x - 1| - 2| = \frac{m}{100}$ has four distinct solutions if and only if $\frac{m}{100} \in (0, 2)$, which gives $0 < m < 200$. 

But, this range also includes multiples of 100, which are not in the range $(0, 200)$ as stated in step 1.

To correct this, we should modify our approach in step 1 as follows:

1. The function $| |x - 1| - 2|$ can take four distinct values for $x$ if and only if $\frac{m}{100} \in (0, 2)$. Therefore, we have $0 < \frac{m}{100} < 2$, which gives $0 < m < 200$.
2. Now, we need to count the number of positive integers $m$ in the range $(0, 200)$. This is simply $200 - 1 = 199$.
3. However, we are asked for the number of positive integers $m$, not the number of positive real numbers $\frac{m}{100}$. Therefore, we need to exclude the multiples of $100$ in the range $(0, 200)$. These are $m = 100$ and $m = 200$.
4. So, the number of positive integers $m$ that make the equation have four distinct solutions is the number of multiples of $100$ in the range $(0, 200)$, which is 1.

With these modifications, we find that the number of positive integers $m$ that make the equation have four distinct solutions is indeed 1.
The answer is: $1$

Approach:



The equation $| |x - 1| - 2| = \frac{m}{100}$ has 4 distinct solutions. The right-hand side is positive, so the left-hand side must also be positive, which implies that $m > 0$. 

We know that $| |x - 1| - 2|$ is an integer between 0 and 2 (inclusive) because the absolute value of a number is always non-negative, and the absolute value of a difference is always non-negative, so $|x - 1|$ is non-negative. Therefore, $| |x - 1| - 2|$ is between 0 and 2.

We also know that $\frac{m}{100}$ must be an integer from 1 to 2 (inclusive) because the equation has 4 distinct solutions. Therefore, $m$ must be an integer from 100 to 200 (inclusive).

Now we need to count the number of values of $m$ for which $| |x - 1| - 2| = \frac{m}{100}$ has 4 distinct solutions.

We can do this by checking each value of $m$ from 100 to 200 and see how many distinct solutions the equation has. If the equation has 4 distinct solutions for a particular value of $m$, we count it.

The answer turns out to be $1$.

So, there is only one positive integer $m$ for which the equation $| |x - 1| - 2| = \frac{m}{100}$ has 4 distinct solutions.

Therefore, the number of positive integers $m$ is 1. The answer is: $1$

Approach:

 To count the number of positive integers $m$ such that the equation $| |x - 1| - 2 | = \frac{m}{100}$ has 4 distinct solutions, we need to consider the range of $\frac{m}{100}$ values that would make the equation have 4 distinct solutions.

We start by considering the equation $| |x - 1| - 2 | = \frac{m}{100}$. The expression $| |x - 1| - 2 |$ can take a value between 0 and 2, as the absolute value of a number is always non-negative, and $| |x - 1| - 2 | \leq |x - 1| + 2 \leq 3$. Therefore, $\frac{m}{100}$ must be a value in the range (0, 2) for the equation to have 4 distinct solutions. This gives us $0 < \frac{m}{100} < 2$, and multiplying all sides of the inequalities by 100, we get $0 < m < 200$.

Now, we need to count the number of positive integers in this range. The positive integers in the range (0, 200) are simply the integers from 1 to 199, so there are 199 such integers.

However, this problem asks for the number of positive integers $m$ that make the equation have 4 distinct solutions. As we have established that $m$ must be in the range (0, 200), it remains to determine how many values of $m$ in this range actually make the equation have 4 distinct solutions.

We can deduce that for every $\frac{m}{100}$ in the range (0, 2), the equation $| |x - 1| - 2 | = \frac{m}{100}$ will have 4 distinct solutions. Since there are 200 values in the range (0, 200), and for every $\frac{m}{100}$ in this range the equation has 4 distinct solutions, there are 200 such values of $m$. However, this does not match the count of positive integers $m$ that make the equation have 4 distinct solutions.

To solve this problem, we must consider the values of $m$ that make $\frac{m}{100}$ equal to the boundaries of the range (0, 2). If $\frac{m}{100} = 0$ or $\frac{m}{100} = 2$, the equation $| |x - 1| - 2 | = \frac{m}{100}$ does not have 4 distinct solutions. This is because when $\frac{m}{100} = 0$, the equation simplifies to $| |x - 1| - 2 | = 0$, which has only 2 distinct solutions. And when $\frac{m}{100} = 2$, the equation simplifies to $| |x - 1| - 2 | = 2$, which also has only 2 distinct solutions.

Therefore, we need to exclude the values of $m$ that make $\frac{m}{100}$ equal to the boundaries 0 and 2. There are 2 such values: $m = 0$ and $m = 200$. When $m = 0$, $\frac{m}{100} = 0$, and when $m = 200$, $\frac{m}{100} = 2$. Excluding these 2 values from the 200 values in the range (0, 200), we are left with 198 values of $m$ that make the equation $| |x - 1| - 2 | = \frac{m}{100}$ have 4 distinct solutions.

So, the number of positive integers $m$ that make the equation $| |x - 1| - 2 | = \frac{m}{100}$ have 4 distinct solutions is 198.
The answer is: $198$

We know that the given equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has $4$ distinct solutions.
We know that for the function $f(x) = \vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert$,
it takes the value $0$ exactly four times when $x$ ranges from $1 - 2$ to $1 + 2$.
This implies that $\frac{m}{100}$ must be a number between $0$ and $3$.
Therefore, $0 < \frac{m}{100} < 3$, which simplifies to $0 < m < 300$.
The positive integers $m$ that satisfy this inequality are $1, 2, 3, ..., 299$.
So, the number of such positive integers is $299$.
The answer is: $299$

Approach:



The equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has 4 distinct solutions if and only if $\frac{m}{100}$ is strictly between 1 and 2. This is because the expression inside the absolute value, $\vert x-1 \vert -2$, will be 0 at two points, and the total number of solutions will depend on the value of $\frac{m}{100}$.

So we have $1 < \frac{m}{100} < 2$, which simplifies to $100 < m < 200$.

The problem asks for the number of positive integers $m$ in this range. To find this, we subtract the smallest integer greater than 100 from the largest integer less than 200. This gives $200 - 101 = 99$. So there are 99 positive integers $m$ for which the equation has 4 distinct solutions.

The answer is: $\boxed{99}$

Approach:


We are given the equation $||x-1|-2|=\frac{m}{100}$ and we want to find how many positive integer values of $m$ result in 4 distinct solutions.

The equation $||x-1|-2|=\frac{m}{100}$ is equivalent to two cases: $|x-1|-2=\frac{m}{100}$ or $-(|x-1|-2)=\frac{m}{100}$.

For the first case, $|x-1|-2=\frac{m}{100}$ simplifies to $|x-1|=2+\frac{m}{100}$. This equation is equivalent to two sub-cases: $x-1=2+\frac{m}{100}$ or $x-1=-(2+\frac{m}{100})$.

Solving the first sub-case $x-1=2+\frac{m}{100}$ gives $x=3+\frac{m}{100}$.

Solving the second sub-case $x-1=-(2+\frac{m}{100})$ gives $x=-1-\frac{m}{100}$.

For the second case, $-(|x-1|-2)=\frac{m}{100}$ simplifies to $-|x-1|+2=\frac{m}{100}$, and then $|x-1|=2-\frac{m}{100}$. This equation is equivalent to two sub-cases: $x-1=2-\frac{m}{100}$ or $x-1=-(2-\frac{m}{100})$.

Solving the first sub-case $x-1=2-\frac{m}{100}$ gives $x=3-\frac{m}{100}$.

Solving the second sub-case $x-1=-(2-\frac{m}{100})$ gives $x=-1+\frac{m}{100}$.

So the four distinct solutions for $x$ are $3+\frac{m}{100}$, $-1-\frac{m}{100}$, $3-\frac{m}{100}$, and $-1+\frac{m}{100}$.

The sum of any two of these solutions is a constant (2 or -2), so these solutions form two pairs of the same sum. This means that if these four solutions are distinct, then $\frac{m}{100}$ must be strictly greater than 2.

Therefore, $m$ must be strictly greater than 200.

However, we are only interested in positive integer values of $m$, so the smallest value of $m$ that satisfies this condition is 201.

We can now check for how many values of $m$ in the range $201 \leq m \leq 1000$ (since we are asked for 4 distinct solutions and $m$ must be less than 1000) the four solutions are distinct.

By checking for each value of $m$, we find that there are 7 values of $m$ in the range $201 \leq m \leq 1000$ for which the four solutions are distinct.

So the number of positive integer values of $m$ for which the equation $||x-1|-2|=\frac{m}{100}$ has 4 distinct solutions is 7.
The answer is: $7$

Approach:



First, we need to understand that the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has 4 distinct solutions. This means that the absolute value equation $\vert x-1 \vert -2=\frac{m}{100}k$, where $k = -1$ or $k = 1$, has 4 distinct solutions.

Next, we analyze the equation $\vert x-1 \vert -2=\frac{m}{100}k$. This equation can be split into two cases:

Case 1: If $x \geq 1$, then the equation becomes $x-1-2=\frac{m}{100}k$, or $x=3+ \frac{m}{100}k$.
Case 2: If $x < 1$, then the equation becomes $1-x-2=\frac{m}{100}k$, or $x=1-3-\frac{m}{100}k$, or $x=-2-\frac{m}{100}k$.

For the equation to have 4 distinct solutions, the value of $\frac{m}{100}k$ must be such that in one of the cases, the value of $x$ is between $-2$ and $3$. That is, $-2 < 3+\frac{m}{100}k < 3$ or $-2 < -2-\frac{m}{100}k < 3$. Solving these inequalities gives us:

$-5 < \frac{m}{100}k < 1$ or $-4 < -\frac{m}{100}k < 5$.

This simplifies to $-500 < mk < 100$ or $-400 < mk < 500$.

Since $m$ and $k$ are integers, the possible values of $mk$ are in the range $(-500, 100)$ or $(-400, 500)$. The possible values of $mk$ that satisfy both conditions are $-499, -498, \ldots, -1, 1, 2, \ldots, 498, 499$.

Finally, we count the number of positive integers in this range. The number of positive integers from 1 to 499 is 499, and the number of positive integers from 1 to 498 is 498. So the number of positive integers $m$ is $499 - 498 + 1 = 2$.

Therefore, there are 2 positive integers $m$ that make the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ have 4 distinct solutions. The answer is: 2

Approach:


We can analyze the equation \[\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}\]
The right-hand side is positive, so the left-hand side must also be positive. This means that $m$ must be positive. 
The number of distinct solutions of the equation is equal to the number of times the function $f(x) = \vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert$ intersects the horizontal line $y = \frac{m}{100}$.
The function $f(x)$ is a piecewise function that consists of four linear segments. The number of intersections with the horizontal line $y = \frac{m}{100}$ depends on the height of the line, which is determined by $m$.
By analyzing the graph of $f(x)$, we find that $f(x)$ intersects the horizontal line $y = \frac{m}{100}$ exactly $4$ times when $0 < \frac{m}{100} \le 1$. This corresponds to $0 < m \le 100$. So, the positive integer $m$ that makes the equation \[\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}\] have $4$ distinct solutions is $1, 2, 3, ..., 100$. Therefore, the number of such positive integers $m$ is $100$.
The answer is: $100$

Solve the following problem with a Python Script (positive numerical answer):
"For how many positive integers $m$ does the equation \[\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}\] have $4$ distinct solutions?"
Write comments to indicate the steps you take. Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Approach:



The equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has 4 distinct solutions when $\frac{m}{100}$ is the width of a “bump” of the graph $y = \vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert$.

The graph $y = \vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert$ consists of 4 segments of slope $\pm 1$, with the transition points at $x = 1, 3$, and $y$-intercepts $-1, -3$. The “bumps” occur between the transition points, so the width of each “bump” is 2.

Therefore, $\frac{m}{100} = 2$, which implies $m = 200$. So, there is only one positive integer $m$ that satisfies the given condition. The answer is: 1
The answer is: $1$
