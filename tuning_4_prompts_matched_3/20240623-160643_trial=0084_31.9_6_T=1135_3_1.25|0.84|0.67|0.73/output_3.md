Solve the following problem with a Python Script (positive numerical answer):
"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"

Approach:



The expression $AB = 0$ is equivalent to $A = 0$ or $B = 0$. Therefore, the given equation is equivalent to one of the following:

1. $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$
2. $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$

For the first equation to be zero, it must be that $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. This gives us the lines $x + y = 10$, $x + y = -10$, $x - y = 10$, and $x - y = -10$. These lines form a square with side length $10\sqrt{2}$. The area of this square is $(10\sqrt{2})^2 = 200$.

For the second equation to be zero, it must be that $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$. This gives us the lines $x = 8$, $x = -8$, $y = 8$, and $y = -8$. These lines form a square with side length $16$. The area of this square is $16^2 = 256$.

However, the first case includes all the points of the second case, so the second case is entirely contained within the first case. Therefore, the area of the convex polygon is the area of the square formed by the first case, which is $200$ square units. The answer is: $200$

Approach:



The expression $AB = 0$ is true when either $A = 0$ or $B = 0$. So, we can split the given equation into two cases:

Case 1: $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$
This means that both $\vert x + y \vert - 10 = 0$ and $\vert x - y \vert - 10 = 0$, or $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$.
This results in a square with side length 10 units, with vertices at $(5,5)$, $(5,-5)$, $(-5,-5)$, and $(-5,5)$.

Case 2: $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$
This means that both $\vert x \vert - 8 = 0$ and $\vert y \vert - 8 = 0$, or $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$.
This results in a square with side length 16 units, with vertices at $(8,8)$, $(8,-8)$, $(-8,-8)$, and $(-8,8)$.

To find the area of the convex polygon enclosed by the intersection of the two cases, we need to find the intersection of the two squares. The intersection of the two squares is a square with side length 10 units (since the side length of the smaller square is less than the distance between the midpoints of the larger square). The area of this square is $10^2 = 100$ square units. So the area of the convex polygon is $100$ square units.
The answer is: $100$

Solve the following problem with a Python Script (positive numerical answer):
"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"

Assistant:

Approach:

 The equation $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + (\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + (\vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ equals to zero if and only if at least one of the terms inside the product is zero. This implies that either $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + (\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + (\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$.

If $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + (\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$, then $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. This implies that $x + y = \pm 10$ and $x - y = \pm 10$. Solving these four equations, we get the vertices of the square as $(0, 10), (0, -10), (10, 0), (-10, 0)$.

If $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + (\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$, then $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$. This implies that $x = \pm 8$ and $y = \pm 8$. Solving these four equations, we get the vertices of the square as $(8, 0), (-8, 0), (0, 8), (0, -8)$.

The vertices of the polygon are the intersection points of these two squares. By drawing these squares, we can see that the intersection points are the vertices of a 8x8 square.

The area of a square with side length a is $a^2$. So, the area of this 8x8 square is $8^2 = 64$. The answer is: $64$.

Solve the following problem with a Python Script (positive numerical answer):
"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"

Assistant:

Approach:

 The expression $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ implies that $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. These are the conditions for a square with side length $10$ centered at the origin. The other condition, $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$, implies that $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$, which is the condition for a square with side length $16$ also centered at the origin. The intersection of these two squares is the convex polygon we are looking for.

To find its area, we simply calculate the area of the smaller square and subtract the area of the intersection (which is a square with side length $10$) from it. The area of a square with side length $a$ is $a^2$, so the area of the larger square is $8^2 = 64$ and the area of the smaller square is $10^2 = 100$. The area of the intersection is $10^2 = 100$.

So, the area of the convex polygon is $64 - 100 + 100 = 64$. The answer is: $64$.

Approach:


This problem involves absolute value functions, which can make it seem complicated. However, the key to solving it is to recognize that the product of two expressions equals zero if and only if at least one of the expressions is zero. Therefore, we can solve the equation by setting each factor equal to zero and analyzing the solutions.

Step 1: Set each factor equal to zero and solve for $x$ and $y$.
For the first factor, we have two cases:
Case 1: $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$. This implies that $\vert x + y \vert = 10$. The solutions to this equation are $x + y = 10$ and $x + y = -10$.
Case 2: $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$. This implies that $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. The solutions to this equation are $x - y = 10$ and $x - y = -10$.

For the second factor, we have two cases:
Case 1: $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$. This implies that $\vert x \vert = 8$. The solutions to this equation are $x = 8$ and $x = -8$.
Case 2: $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$. This implies that $\vert y \vert = 8$. The solutions to this equation are $y = 8$ and $y = -8$.

Step 2: Analyze the solutions and identify the vertices of the polygon.
By analyzing the solutions, we find that the vertices of the polygon are the points $(8, 8)$, $(8, -8)$, $(-8, 8)$, and $(-8, -8)$.

Step 3: Calculate the area of the polygon.
The polygon is a square with side length 16. The area of a square is given by the square of the side length, so the area of this square is $16^2 = 256$.

So the area of the convex polygon is 256. The answer is: 256

Approach:


The given equation is $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + (\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + (\vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$.
This equation equals to zero if and only if both factors equal to zero.
Let's first solve the equation $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + (\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$.
For the sum of two squares to be zero, both terms must be zero, so we have $\vert x + y \vert - 10 = 0$ and $\vert x - y \vert - 10 = 0$.
This implies that $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$.
For the second factor, $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + (\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$.
Again, for the sum of two squares to be zero, both terms must be zero, so we have $\vert x \vert - 8 = 0$ and $\vert y \vert - 8 = 0$.
This implies that $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$, which means $x = \pm 8$ and $y = \pm 8$.
The four points that satisfy the equation are $(8,8)$, $(-8,8)$, $(8,-8)$, and $(-8,-8)$.
These points form a square with side length $16$. The area of the square is $16^2 = 256$.
The answer is: $256$

Solve the following problem with a Python Script (positive numerical answer):
"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"

Approach:

 The given equation is a product of two terms, and it equals zero if and only if at least one of the terms equals zero. Therefore, we can solve the equations separately.

1. $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$
2. $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$

For the first equation, both terms must be zero, which implies that $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. The solutions to these equations are the points $(x, y)$ that lie on the lines $x + y = 10$ and $x - y = 10$, or their symmetric counterparts with respect to the x- and y-axes. This forms a square with side length 10, so its area is $10^2 = 100$.

For the second equation, both terms must be zero, which implies that $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$. The solutions to these equations are the points $(x, y)$ that lie on the lines $x = 8$ and $y = 8$, or their symmetric counterparts with respect to the x- and y-axes. This forms a square with side length 16, so its area is $16^2 = 256$.

However, the region of interest is the intersection of the two regions defined by the equations, which is the square with side length 10. Therefore, the area of the convex polygon is 100. The answer is: $100$

Solve the following problem with a Python Script (positive numerical answer):
"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"

Approach:


The equation $f(x, y) = 0$ defines a set of points that satisfy the equation. This set of points encloses a region in the plane. In this case, the region is a convex polygon because the equation is a product of two terms, each of which is a sum of squared absolute values. The absolute value function $|x|$ is a piecewise linear function, and when squared, it becomes a convex function. When we sum or multiply convex functions, the result is also convex. Therefore, the region defined by the equation is convex.

To find the area of this convex polygon, we need to analyze the equation $f(x, y) = 0$. The equation $f(x, y) = 0$ is equivalent to the following system of equations:

1. $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$, which implies $\vert x + y \vert = 10$.
2. $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$, which implies $\vert x - y \vert = 10$.
3. $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$, which implies $\vert x \vert = 8$.
4. $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$, which implies $\vert y \vert = 8$.

From equations 3 and 4, we get that the polygon is a square with side length 16 (since $|x| = 8$ and $|y| = 8$ implies $-8 \le x, y \le 8$).

The area of a square with side length $s$ is $s^2$, so the area of the polygon is $16^2 = 256$.
The answer is: $256$

"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"

Approach:

 The equation $A \cdot B = 0$ implies that either $A = 0$ or $B = 0$. Therefore, the given equation implies that either $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$.

For the first equation to equal zero, we need both $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. This gives us a square with side length 10, centered at the origin.

For the second equation to equal zero, we need both $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$, which gives us a square with side length 16, centered at the origin.

Therefore, the region enclosed by the points satisfying the equation is the intersection of these two squares. The convex polygon formed by the intersection of the two squares is another square with side length 10 (the smaller square). 

To find the area of this square, we simply square the side length, which gives us $10^2 = 100$.
The answer is: $100$

Approach:

 The given equation is equal to zero, which means that at least one of the terms must be zero. This implies that either $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$, $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$, $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$, or $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$.
Solving each of these equations gives:
1. $\vert x + y \vert = 10$, $\vert x - y \vert = 10$, $\vert x \vert = 8$, or $\vert y \vert = 8$.
2. $x + y = \pm 10$, $x - y = \pm 10$, $x = \pm 8$, or $y = \pm 8$.
From these equations, we can find the vertices of the polygon:
1. If $x + y = 10$ and $x - y = 10$, we can solve these equations to get $x = 10$ and $y = 0$.
2. If $x + y = 10$ and $x - y = -10$, we can solve these equations to get $x = 0$ and $y = 10$.
3. If $x + y = -10$ and $x - y = 10$, we can solve these equations to get $x = -10$ and $y = 0$.
4. If $x + y = -10$ and $x - y = -10$, we can solve these equations to get $x = 0$ and $y = -10$.
5. If $x = 8$ and $y = 8$, we get the point $(8, 8)$.
6. If $x = -8$ and $y = 8$, we get the point $(-8, 8)$.
7. If $x = 8$ and $y = -8$, we get the point $(8, -8)$.
8. If $x = -8$ and $y = -8$, we get the point $(-8, -8)$.
So, the vertices of the polygon are $(10, 0)$, $(0, 10)$, $(-10, 0)$, $(0, -10)$, $(8, 8)$, $(-8, 8)$, $(8, -8)$, and $(-8, -8)$.
The polygon is a square with side length 20. The area of a square is given by side length squared, so the area of the square is $20^2 = 400$. The answer is: $400$

The given equation is a product of two expressions equal to zero, which means either the first expression is zero or the second expression is zero. Let's analyze these two cases separately.

Case 1: $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$
This equation can only be true if both $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ and $( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$. 
For a square to be zero, the expression inside the square must be zero, so we have $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$.
This implies that the points lie on a square with side length 10 units.

Case 2: $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$
This equation can only be true if both $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ and $( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$. 
For a square to be zero, the expression inside the square must be zero, so we have $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$.
This implies that the points lie on a square with side length 16 units (from -8 to 8 on both axes).

Comparing the two cases, we see that the convex polygon formed by the intersection of the two cases is a square with side length 10 units (from -10 to 10 on both axes).
The area of this square is side length squared, so the area is $10^2 = 100$. The answer is: $100$
