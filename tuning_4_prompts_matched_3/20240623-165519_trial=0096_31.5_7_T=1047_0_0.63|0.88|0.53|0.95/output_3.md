Below is a math problem you are to solve (positive numerical answer!):
"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"
Analyze this problem and think step by step to come to a solution with programs. After solving the problem, output the final numerical answer within \boxed{}.

The given equation is a product of two expressions equal to zero. This means that either the first expression is zero or the second expression is zero. 

The first expression is $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)$ and the second expression is $((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2)$.

For the first expression to be zero, both $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ and $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$. This implies that $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$.

For the second expression to be zero, both $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ and $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$. This implies that $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$.

The solutions to the first set of equations are all points $(x, y)$ such that the distance from the origin to $(x, y)$ is 10. This is a circle with radius 10 centered at the origin.

The solutions to the second set of equations are all points $(x, y)$ such that both $x$ and $y$ are between $-8$ and $8$. This is a square with side length 16.

The intersection of these two sets of points is a square with side length 10 (the side length of the smaller square that can fit inside the larger circle). The area of this square is $10^2 = 100$.

So the area of the convex polygon is 100 square units.

    # The side length of the square is 10
    side_length = 10

    # The area of the square is side_length^2

    return area

 The equation $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + (\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ implies that $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. These two equations are satisfied only when $x = \pm 10$ and $y = \pm 10$. Similarly, the equation $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + (\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ implies that $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$, which are satisfied only when $x = \pm 8$ and $y = \pm 8$.
The points that satisfy both equations are the vertices of a square with side length 16. Therefore, the area of the square is $16^2 = 256$. The answer is: $256$

Analyze this problem and think step by step to come to a solution with programs. After solving the problem, output the final numerical answer within \boxed{}.

Assistant:


The given equation is a product of two terms equal to zero, so either the first term is zero or the second term is zero.

If $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$, then $\vert x + y \vert = 10$, which implies $x + y = \pm 10$.
If $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$, then $\vert x - y \vert = 10$, which implies $x - y = \pm 10$.
If $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$, then $\vert x \vert = 8$, which implies $x = \pm 8$.
If $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$, then $\vert y \vert = 8$, which implies $y = \pm 8$.

The solutions to these equations are the vertices of the convex polygon.

The lines $x + y = \pm 10$, $x - y = \pm 10$, $x = \pm 8$, and $y = \pm 8$ form a square with side length 10.

The area of this square is $10^2 = 100$.

So, the area of the convex polygon is 100. The answer is: $100$

The equation $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + (\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + (\vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ is satisfied if and only if at least one of the factors is zero. This happens if and only if $\vert x + y \vert = 10$, $\vert x - y \vert = 10$, $\vert x \vert = 8$, or $\vert y \vert = 8$.

The lines $\vert x + y \vert = 10$, $\vert x - y \vert = 10$, $\vert x \vert = 8$, and $\vert y \vert = 8$ form a square with side length 16. Therefore, the area of the convex polygon is $16^2 = 256$.

The equation $AB=0$ is satisfied if and only if $A=0$ or $B=0$. Therefore, the given equation is equivalent to either $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$.

For the first equation, $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$, it implies that $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. This means that $x + y = \pm 10$ and $x - y = \pm 10$. Solving these equations gives us the vertices of the square: $(8, 2)$, $(8, -2)$, $(-8, -2)$, and $(-8, 2)$.

For the second equation, $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$, it implies that $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$. This means that $x = \pm 8$ and $y = \pm 8$. So we get the vertices of the square: $(8, 8)$, $(8, -8)$, $(-8, -8)$, and $(-8, 8)$.

Therefore, the convex polygon is a rectangle with side lengths $16$ and $16$. The area of the rectangle is $16 \times 16 = 256$. So the area of the convex polygon is $256$. The answer is: $256$
