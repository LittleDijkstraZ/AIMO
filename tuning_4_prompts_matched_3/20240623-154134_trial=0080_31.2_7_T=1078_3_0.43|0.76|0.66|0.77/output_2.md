The equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has $4$ distinct solutions, we need to find the number of positive integers $m$ for which this is true.

We can start by analyzing the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$.

This equation has $4$ distinct solutions when $\frac{m}{100}$ is between $1$ and $2$, inclusive. This is because the expression inside the absolute value, $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert$, can take on values between $1$ and $2$ exactly when the equation has $4$ distinct solutions.

So, we need to find the number of positive integers $m$ such that $1 \leq \frac{m}{100} \leq 2$.

Multiplying all sides of the inequalities by $100$ gives $100 \leq m \leq 200$.

The positive integers $m$ that satisfy this inequality are the integers from $100$ to $200$, inclusive. To find the number of these integers, we subtract the smallest integer from the largest and add $1$. So, the number of positive integers $m$ is $200 - 100 + 1 = 101$.

Therefore, the number of positive integers $m$ for which the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has $4$ distinct solutions is $101$. The answer is: $101$

The equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has 4 distinct solutions if and only if $\frac{m}{100}$ is strictly between 1 and 2. This is because the function $f(x) = \vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert$ has a graph that is a series of "steps" of height 1, so for $f(x)$ to have 4 distinct solutions, the right hand side of the equation, $\frac{m}{100}$, must be strictly between 1 and 2.

So we have $1 < \frac{m}{100} < 2$. Multiplying all sides of the inequalities by 100 gives $100 < m < 200$. The positive integers $m$ that satisfy this inequality are the integers from 101 to 199, inclusive. To find the number of these integers, we subtract the smallest integer from the largest and add 1. So the number of such integers is $199 - 101 + 1 = 99$.

So the number of positive integers $m$ for which the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has 4 distinct solutions is 99. The answer is: $99$

The equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has 4 distinct solutions if and only if $\frac{m}{100}$ is strictly between 1 and 2. This is because the function $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert$ has a graph that is a series of V-shapes, with the $i$-th V-shape corresponding to the value of $i$ for $i=1,2,3,4$. Therefore, the number of distinct solutions is equal to the number of V-shapes that $\frac{m}{100}$ falls into.

If $\frac{m}{100}$ is strictly between 1 and 2, then $1 < \frac{m}{100} < 2$, which implies $100 < m < 200$. The positive integers $m$ that satisfy this inequality are exactly the integers from 101 to 199, inclusive. To find the number of these integers, we subtract the smallest integer from the largest and add 1: $199 - 101 + 1 = 99$.

Therefore, the number of positive integers $m$ for which the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has 4 distinct solutions is 99. The answer is: $99$

Approach:



The equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has 4 distinct solutions if and only if $\frac{m}{100}$ is strictly between 1 and 2. This is because the function $f(x) = \vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert$ has a graph that is a "V" shape with the "valleys" at $x=1$ and $x=3$, and the distance between the valleys is 2. If $\frac{m}{100}$ is less than or equal to 1, there will be at most 2 distinct solutions. If $\frac{m}{100}$ is greater than or equal to 2, there will be at least 4 distinct solutions. So, we need to find the number of positive integers $m$ such that $1 < \frac{m}{100} < 2$.

Multiplying all parts of the inequality by 100 gives $100 < m < 200$. The number of positive integers in this range is $200 - 100 - 1 = 99$.

So, the number of positive integers $m$ for which the equation has 4 distinct solutions is 99.
The answer is: $99$

The equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has 4 distinct solutions, which means that the right side of the equation, $\frac{m}{100}$, must be equal to 2. This is because the absolute value function $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert$ takes on the value of 2 four times.

So, we have $\frac{m}{100}=2$, which gives $m=200$.

Therefore, there is only one positive integer $m$ that satisfies the condition, namely $m=200$.
The answer is: $1$

Approach:


We know that the equation $| |x-1|-2|=\frac{m}{100}$ has 4 distinct solutions.
This equation is equivalent to two cases:
Case 1: $|x-1|-2=\frac{m}{100}$
Case 2: $-(|x-1|-2)=\frac{m}{100}$

For Case 1, we have $|x-1|=2+\frac{m}{100}$. This gives us two sub-cases:
Sub-case 1.1: $x-1=2+\frac{m}{100}$, which gives $x=3+\frac{m}{100}$.
Sub-case 1.2: $x-1=-2-\frac{m}{100}$, which gives $x=-1-\frac{m}{100}$.

For Case 2, we have $|x-1|=2-\frac{m}{100}$. This gives us two sub-cases:
Sub-case 2.1: $x-1=2-\frac{m}{100}$, which gives $x=3-\frac{m}{100}$.
Sub-case 2.2: $x-1=-2+\frac{m}{100}$, which gives $x=-1+\frac{m}{100}$.

For the equation to have 4 distinct solutions, the four expressions for $x$ must be distinct. This means that the four values of $x$ must be different.

Comparing the four expressions for $x$, we see that:
- $3+\frac{m}{100}$ is different from $-1-\frac{m}{100}$ if and only if $\frac{m}{100} > 4$, or $m > 400$.
- $3+\frac{m}{100}$ is different from $3-\frac{m}{100}$ if and only if $\frac{m}{100} \neq 0$, or $m \neq 0$.
- $3-\frac{m}{100}$ is different from $-1-\frac{m}{100}$ if and only if $4 < \frac{m}{100} < 4$, which is impossible.
- $3-\frac{m}{100}$ is different from $-1+\frac{m}{100}$ if and only if $\frac{m}{100} > 2$, or $m > 200$.
- $-1+\frac{m}{100}$ is different from $-1-\frac{m}{100}$ if and only if $\frac{m}{100} > 0$, or $m > 0$.
- $-1+\frac{m}{100}$ is different from $3-\frac{m}{100}$ if and only if $\frac{m}{100} > 2$, or $m > 200$.

Therefore, for the equation to have 4 distinct solutions, we must have $0 < m \leq 200$.

The positive integers $m$ that satisfy this condition are the integers from 1 to 200.

To count the number of these integers, we simply count the number of positive integers less than or equal to 200. This is 200.

So, the number of positive integers $m$ for which the equation has 4 distinct solutions is 200. The answer is: $200$

Approach:



The equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has 4 distinct solutions if and only if $\frac{m}{100}$ is strictly between 1 and 2. This is because the expression on the left side of the equation, $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert$, can take on any value from 0 to 3, and it takes on the value of $\frac{m}{100}$ exactly when $\frac{m}{100}$ is in this range.

So we need to find the number of positive integers $m$ such that $1 < \frac{m}{100} < 2$. Multiplying all sides of the inequalities by 100 gives $100 < m < 200$. The number of positive integers in this range is $200 - 100 - 1 = 99$.

So the number of positive integers $m$ for which the equation has 4 distinct solutions is 99. The answer is: $99$
