Question (hint: positive numerical answer):
"What is the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ when $x$ and $y$ range over all real numbers such that $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$?"
Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:



First, we note that the equation $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$ is equivalent to $|x-2y| = 40 - |y-2x|$.
Squaring both sides, we get $(x-2y)^2 = (40 - |y-2x|)^2$.
Expanding, we have $x^2 - 4xy + 4y^2 = 1600 - 80|y-2x| + (y-2x)^2$.
Rearranging, we get $5x^2 + 5y^2 - 8xy = 1600 + (y-2x)^2 - 80|y-2x|$.
Since $(y-2x)^2 \geq 0$ and $|y-2x| \leq (y-2x)^2$, we have
$1600 + (y-2x)^2 - 80|y-2x| \geq 1600 - 80(y-2x)^2$.
By the AM-GM inequality, we know that for any non-negative real numbers $a$ and $b$,
$ab \leq \left(\frac{a+b}{2}\right)^2$.
Setting $a = y-2x$ and $b = 1$, we have $(y-2x) \leq \left(\frac{y-2x+1}{2}\right)^2$.
Therefore,
$1600 - 80(y-2x)^2 \geq 1600 - 80\left(\frac{y-2x+1}{2}\right)^2 = 1600 - 20(y-2x+1)^2$.
Thus, the minimum value of $5x^2 + 5y^2 - 8xy$ is achieved when $(y-2x)^2 = 0$,
which means $y = 2x$.
Substituting this into the original equation, we have $|x-4x| + |2x-4x| = 40$,
which simplifies to $3|x| = 40$.
So, $|x| = \frac{40}{3}$, and thus $x = \pm \frac{40}{3}$.
For $x = \frac{40}{3}$, we have $y = 2x = \frac{80}{3}$, and the minimum value is
$5\left(\frac{40}{3}\right)^2 + 5\left(\frac{80}{3}\right)^2 - 8\left(\frac{40}{3}\right)\left(\frac{80}{3}\right) = 0$.
For $x = -\frac{40}{3}$, we have $y = 2x = -\frac{80}{3}$, and the minimum value is also 0.
Therefore, the minimum value of $5x^2 + 5y^2 - 8xy$ is 0.
The answer is: $0$

Question (hint: positive numerical answer):
"What is the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ when $x$ and $y$ range over all real numbers such that $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$?"
Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:


To find the minimum value of the expression $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ subject to the condition $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$, we first need to find a relationship between $x$ and $y$ from the condition.

We can rewrite the condition as $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$. By the triangle inequality, we know that $|a| + |b| \geq |a+b|$ for all real numbers $a$ and $b$. Therefore, we have
\[|x-2y| + |y-2x| \geq |(x-2y) + (y-2x)| = |-x - y| = |-(x+y)| = |x+y|.\]
So we have $|x+y| = 40$.

Now, let's express the given expression $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ in terms of $x+y$ and $x-2y$. We have
\begin{align*}
5x^2+5y^2-8xy &= 5(x^2+y^2) - 8xy \\

Question (hint: positive numerical answer):
"What is the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ when $x$ and $y$ range over all real numbers such that $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$?"
Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:


The given equation is $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$. We can rewrite this as $|2y-x| + |2x-y| = 40$.

By the triangle inequality, we know that $|a| + |b| \geq |a+b|$, so $|2y-x| + |2x-y| \geq |(2y-x) + (2x-y)| = |y| = |y-0|$.

Therefore, $|x-2y| + |y-2x| \geq |y|$. Since we are given that $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$, we must have $|y| = 40$.

This means $y = 20$ or $y = -20$.

Now we substitute $y = 20$ into the equation $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$, we get $5x^2+5(20)^2-8x(20) = 5x^2+2000-160x$.

To find the minimum value of this expression, we can take the derivative with respect to $x$ and set it equal to zero: $10x-160 = 0$, which gives $x = 16$.

Substituting $x = 16$ and $y = 20$ into the expression $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$, we get $5(16)^2+5(20)^2-8(16)(20) = 1280$.

Similarly, when we substitute $y = -20$, we get $5x^2+5(-20)^2-8x(-20) = 5x^2+2000+160x$.

Taking the derivative with respect to $x$ and setting it equal to zero, we get $10x+160 = 0$, which gives $x = -16$.

Substituting $x = -16$ and $y = -20$ into the expression $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$, we also get $1280$.

Therefore, the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ is $1280$. The answer is: $1280$

Question (hint: positive numerical answer):
"What is the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ when $x$ and $y$ range over all real numbers such that $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$?"
Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:


We know that $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$.
By the triangle inequality, we have $|x-2y| + |y-2x| \ge |(x-2y) + (y-2x)| = |x-2y+y-2x| = |-x-y| = |-(x+y)| = |x+y|$.
So, $|x+y| = 40$.
Now, let's find the value of the expression $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$.
We can rewrite this expression as $(5x^2 - 8xy + 5y^2)$.
This can be factored as $(5x^2 - 10xy + 5y^2) + (-2xy) = (5(x-y)^2) - 2xy$.
We want to minimize $(5(x-y)^2) - 2xy$ subject to the constraint $|x+y| = 40$.
By the Cauchy-Schwarz inequality, we have $(x+y)^2 \ge 4(xy)$, so $1600 \ge 4(xy)$, which implies $xy \le 400$.
Therefore, $(5(x-y)^2) - 2xy \ge 5(x-y)^2 - 800$.
To minimize this expression, we need to minimize $5(x-y)^2$ subject to the constraint $xy \le 400$.
Since $(x-y)^2 \ge 0$, the minimum value of $5(x-y)^2$ is $0$.
So, the minimum value of $(5(x-y)^2) - 2xy$ is $-800$.
Therefore, the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ is $-800$.
The answer is: $-800$

Question (hint: positive numerical answer):
"What is the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ when $x$ and $y$ range over all real numbers such that $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$?"
Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:


To solve this problem, we first need to find a relationship between $x$ and $y$ from the equation $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$.

Without loss of generality, let's assume that $x \geq 2y$. Then, $|x-2y| = x-2y$ and $|y-2x| = 2x-y$. So the equation becomes:
$$(x-2y) + (2x-y) = 40 \implies 3x-3y = 40 \implies x-y = \frac{40}{3}.$$

Similarly, if $y \geq 2x$, we have $|x-2y| = 2y-x$ and $|y-2x| = y-2x$. So the equation becomes:
$$(2y-x) + (y-2x) = 40 \implies 3y-3x = 40 \implies y-x = \frac{40}{3}.$$

From the above, we see that $x-y = y-x = \frac{40}{3}$, which implies $x = y$.

Now, we substitute $x = y$ into the expression $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$:
$$5x^2+5x^2-8x^2 = 2x^2 = 2(\frac{20}{3})^2 = \frac{400}{9}.$$
The minimum value of the expression $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ under the given condition is thus $\frac{400}{9}$. The answer is:
$\boxed{\frac{400}{9}}$.

"What is the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ when $x$ and $y$ range over all real numbers such that $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$?"
Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:


First, let's rewrite the expression $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ as $(5x^2-8xy+5y^2)$. We can complete the square inside the parentheses to get: $(5x^2-8xy+5y^2) = (x^2-2xy+y^2) + 4(x^2-2xy+y^2) = (x-y)^2 + 4(x-y)^2 = 5(x-y)^2$.
Now, let's solve the equation $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$. We know that $|a-b| = |b-a|$, so we can rewrite the equation as $|x-2y| + |2x-y| = 40$.
By the triangle inequality, $|x-2y| + |2x-y| \geq |x-2y + (2x-y)| = |3x-3y| = 3|x-y|$.
So, we have $3|x-y| = 40$, which implies $|x-y| = \frac{40}{3}$.
Since the minimum value of $5(x-y)^2$ occurs when $(x-y)^2$ is minimized, and $(x-y)^2$ is minimized when $|x-y|$ is minimized, we have $(x-y)^2 = \left(\frac{40}{3}\right)^2 = \frac{1600}{9}$.
Therefore, the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ is $5 \cdot \frac{1600}{9} = \frac{8000}{9}$.
The answer is: $\boxed{\frac{8000}{9}}$

Question (hint: positive numerical answer):
"What is the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ when $x$ and $y$ range over all real numbers such that $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$?"
Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:


We start by noting that the expression $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ can be rewritten as $5(x^2-y^2)-8xy = 5(x-y)(x+y)-8xy$.
Let's define $a = x - y$ and $b = x + y$. Then, we can rewrite the expression as $5ab - 8xy$.
The condition $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$ can be rewritten as $|a| + |-2a| = 40$, which simplifies to $|a| + |2a| = 40$.
This can further be simplified to $3|a| = 40$, so $|a| = \frac{40}{3}$.
Since $a = x - y$, this means that $x - y = \pm \frac{40}{3}$.
Now, we can rewrite the expression $5ab - 8xy$ as $5(x-y)(x+y) - 8xy = 5a*b - 8xy$.
We want to minimize this expression, so we need to find the minimum value of $5ab - 8xy$.
By the AM-GM inequality, we know that $5ab - 8xy \geq 2\sqrt{5ab \cdot -8xy} = 2\sqrt{-40abxy}$.
Since $|a| = \frac{40}{3}$, we have $ab = \frac{40}{3}(x^2 - y^2) = \frac{40}{3}(x+y)(x-y) = \frac{40}{3} \cdot b \cdot \frac{40}{3} = \frac{1600b}{9}$.
So, $-40abxy = -\frac{6400bxy}{9}$.
Applying the AM-GM inequality again, we have $-40abxy \geq -2\sqrt{-\frac{6400bxy}{9}} = -\frac{80b\sqrt{9xy}}{3} = -\frac{80b^2\sqrt{xy}}{3}$.
Therefore, $5ab - 8xy \geq 2\sqrt{-40abxy} \geq -\frac{80b^2\sqrt{xy}}{3}$.
To minimize this expression, we need to minimize $-\frac{80b^2\sqrt{xy}}{3}$.
By the AM-GM inequality, we have $-\frac{80b^2\sqrt{xy}}{3} \geq -2\sqrt{-\frac{80^2 \cdot b^4 \cdot xy}{9}} = -\frac{80b^2}{3}$.
So, the minimum value of $5ab - 8xy$ is $-\frac{80b^2}{3}$.
Since $b = x + y$, we have $b^2 = (x + y)^2 = x^2 + 2xy + y^2 = (x^2 - y^2) + 2xy = a^2 + 2xy$.
Substituting this into the expression $-\frac{80b^2}{3}$, we get $-\frac{80(a^2 + 2xy)}{3}$.
We know that $a = x - y$, so $a^2 = (x - y)^2 = x^2 - 2xy + y^2 = (x^2 - y^2) - 2xy = b^2 - 2xy$.
Substituting this into the expression $-\frac{80(a^2 + 2xy)}{3}$, we get $-\frac{80(b^2 - 2xy + 2xy)}{3} = -\frac{80b^2}{3}$.
So, the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ is $-\frac{80b^2}{3}$.
Since $b = x + y$, we can substitute the value of $b$ back into the expression to find the minimum value.
We have $b = x + y = 2(x - y) = 2a$, so $b = 2a = 2\frac{40}{3} = \frac{80}{3}$.
Substituting this into the expression $-\frac{80b^2}{3}$, we get $-\frac{80(\frac{80}{3})^2}{3} = -\frac{80 \cdot 6400}{9 \cdot 9} = -\frac{512000}{81}$.
Therefore, the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ is $-\frac{512000}{81}$.
However, this is not a positive numerical answer.
Let's retrace our steps and check our work.
We found that $x - y = \pm \frac{40}{3}$.
If we substitute $x - y = \frac{40}{3}$ into the expression $5ab - 8xy$, we get $5(x-y)(x+y) - 8xy = 5(\frac{40}{3})(x+y) - 8xy = \frac{200}{3}(x+y) - 8xy$.
Similarly, if we substitute $x - y = -\frac{40}{3}$ into the expression, we get $5(-\frac{40}{3})(x+y) - 8xy = -\frac{200}{3}(x+y) - 8xy$.
We can see that both expressions are of the form $A(x+y) - 8xy$, where $A$ is a constant.
By the AM-GM inequality, we have $A(x+y) - 8xy \geq 2\sqrt{A(x+y) \cdot -8xy} = 2\sqrt{-8Axy} = -4\sqrt{2Axy}$.
Since $x+y = 2(x - y) = 2\frac{40}{3} = \frac{80}{3}$, we have $A = \frac{200}{3}$.
So, $-4\sqrt{2Axy} = -4\sqrt{2 \cdot \frac{200}{3} \cdot xy} = -\frac{160\sqrt{xy}}{3}$.
Therefore, the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ is $-\frac{160\sqrt{xy}}{3}$.
By the AM-GM inequality, we have $-\frac{160\sqrt{xy}}{3} \geq -2\sqrt{-\frac{160^2 \cdot xy}{9}} = -\frac{160}{3}$.
However, this is still not a positive numerical answer.
It seems that we made a mistake in our calculations.
Let's retrace our steps and reexamine our work.
We found that $x - y = \pm \frac{40}{3}$.
If we substitute $x - y = \frac{40}{3}$ into the expression $5

Question (hint: positive numerical answer):
"What is the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ when $x$ and $y$ range over all real numbers such that $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$?"
Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:


First, let's simplify the equation $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$.
We can rewrite this as $|x-2y| + |2y-x| = 40$.
Using the property $|a| = |-a|$, we can further simplify this to $|x-2y| + |- (x-2y)| = 40$.
This simplifies to $|x-2y| + |x-2y| = 40$, or $2|x-2y| = 40$.
Dividing both sides by 2, we get $|x-2y| = 20$.
Now let's consider the expression $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$.
We can rewrite this as $5(x^2+y^2) - 8xy$.
Now, let's use the fact that $(x-2y)^2 = x^2 - 4xy + 4y^2$.
Expanding, we get $x^2 - 4xy + 4y^2 = 400$.
Rearranging, we have $x^2 + y^2 - 4xy = 400$.
Now, let's add 4xy to both sides, we get $x^2 + y^2 = 400 + 4xy$.
Now, we substitute this into our expression $5(x^2+y^2) - 8xy = 5(400 + 4xy) - 8xy = 2000 + 20xy - 8xy = 2000 + 12xy$.
To minimize this expression, we need to minimize $12xy$.
Since $x$ and $y$ range over all real numbers, the minimum value of $12xy$ occurs when $x = y$.
In this case, $12xy = 12x^2$, and the minimum value of $x^2$ is 0 (when $x=0$), so the minimum value of $12xy$ is 0.
Therefore, the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ is $2000 + 0 = 2000$.
The answer is: $2000$

Question (hint: positive numerical answer):
"What is the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ when $x$ and $y$ range over all real numbers such that $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$?"
Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:



Let $A = x - 2y$ and $B = y - 2x$. We are given that $|A| + |B| = 40$. By the triangle inequality, $|A| + |B| \geq |A + B|$. So we have $|A + B| \leq 40$. We know that $A + B = x - 2y + y - 2x = -x - y$. So we have $|-x - y| \leq 40$, or $|x + y| \leq 40$.
Now, let's consider the expression $5x^2 + 5y^2 - 8xy$. We can rewrite this as $(5x^2 + 5y^2 - 8xy) = \frac{1}{2}((5x - 4y)^2 + (4x - 5y)^2)$.
Let $C = 5x - 4y$ and $D = 4x - 5y$. Then we have $(5x^2 + 5y^2 - 8xy) = \frac{1}{2}(C^2 + D^2)$.
By the Cauchy-Schwarz inequality, we have $(C^2 + D^2)(1^2 + 1^2) \geq (C + D)^2$, or $(C^2 + D^2) \geq \frac{1}{2}(C + D)^2$.
Since $|x + y| \leq 40$, we have $|C + D| = |5x - 4y + 4x - 5y| = |9x - 9y| = 9|x - y| \leq 360$.
So we have $(C^2 + D^2) \geq \frac{1}{2}(360)^2 = 6480$.
Therefore, the minimum value of $5x^2 + 5y^2 - 8xy$ is $\frac{1}{2}(6480) = 3240$. The answer is: $3240$

Question (hint: positive numerical answer):
"What is the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ when $x$ and $y$ range over all real numbers such that $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$?"
Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:


First, let's simplify the expression $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$.
This can be written as $(5x^2 - 8xy + 5y^2)$.
Now, let's factor this expression:
\[(5x^2 - 8xy + 5y^2) = (5x^2 - 10xy + 5y^2) + 2xy = (5(x - y)^2) + 2xy.\]
Now, let's use the given equation $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$.
By the triangle inequality, we know that $|a| + |b| \geq |a + b|$, so $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = |x-2y| + |2x-y| \geq |(x-2y) + (2x-y)| = |3x-3y| = 3|x-y|$.
Given that $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$, we can conclude that $3|x-y| = 40$, so $|x-y| = \frac{40}{3}$.
Now, let's substitute this into our expression $(5(x - y)^2) + 2xy$:
\[(5(\frac{40}{3})^2) + 2xy = \frac{8000}{9} + 2xy.\]
Since we want to minimize this expression, we need to minimize $2xy$. By the AM-GM inequality, we know that $2xy \geq -(\frac{2}{2})^2 = -1$. Therefore, the minimum value of the expression is $\frac{8000}{9} + (-1) = \frac{7999}{9}$.
The minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ is $\frac{7999}{9}$.
The answer is: $\frac{7999}{9}$

Question (hint: positive numerical answer):
"What is the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ when $x$ and $y$ range over all real numbers such that $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$?"
Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:



First, we simplify the equation $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$.

By the property of absolute value, $|a-b| = |-(a-b)| = |b-a|$, so we can rewrite the equation as $|x-2y| + |2y-x| = 40$.

Then, we apply the property $|a| + |b| = |a+b|$ if $ab \geq 0$, so the equation becomes $|(x-2y) + (2y-x)| = 40$.

Simplifying the expression inside the absolute value gives $|0| = 40$, which is a contradiction.

So, we must have considered the case where $ab < 0$. In this case, $|a| + |b| = |-a-b|$, so the equation becomes $|-(x-2y) - (2y-x)| = 40$.

Simplifying the expression inside the absolute value gives $|-2(x-2y)| = 40$, or $2|x-2y| = 40$, or $|x-2y| = 20$.

Now, let $u = x-2y$ and $v = 2y-x$. Then, $|u| = 20$ and $|v| = 20$. Since $u = -(v)$, we have $|u| = |v|$. So, we can say that $u = 20$ and $v = -20$ or $u = -20$ and $v = 20$.

If $u = 20$ and $v = -20$, then $x-2y = 20$ and $2y-x = -20$. Adding these two equations gives $0 = 0$, which doesn't give us any new information.

If $u = -20$ and $v = 20$, then $x-2y = -20$ and $2y-x = 20$. Adding these two equations gives $0 = 0$ again, which is no help.

So, we must have made a mistake somewhere. Let's go back and check our steps.

When we applied the property $|a| + |b| = |a+b|$ if $ab \geq 0$, we assumed that $(x-2y)(2y-x) \geq 0$. This is not necessarily true, so we cannot use this property here.

Instead, let's use the fact that $|a| + |b| \geq |a+b|$ for all real numbers $a$ and $b$. Applying this to our equation gives:

$$|(x-2y) + (2y-x)| \geq |(x-2y) + (2y-x)| = 0.$$

So, we have $|x-2y| + |2y-x| \geq 0$, and since we know that $|x-2y| + |2y-x| = 40$, we must have $|x-2y| = 20$ and $|2y-x| = 20$.

Now, let's go back to our original expression $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$. We can rewrite this as:

$$5x^2+5y^2-8xy = \frac{1}{2}((5x-4y)^2 + (4y-5x)^2).$$

Now, let $a = 5x-4y$ and $b = 4y-5x$. Then, we have $|a| = 20$ and $|b| = 20$.

So, the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ is achieved when $a = b = 0$, or when $5x-4y = 0$ and $4y-5x = 0$. Solving this system of equations gives $x = \frac{4}{3}y$.

Substituting this into the equation $|x-2y| = 20$ gives $|\frac{4}{3}y - 2y| = 20$, or $|\frac{-2}{3}y| = 20$, or $\frac{2}{3}|y| = 20$, or $|y| = 30$.

Taking $y = 30$, we find that $x = \frac{4}{3}y = 40$.

So, the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ is achieved when $x = 40$ and $y = 30$. Substituting these values gives:

$$5x^2+5y^2-8xy = 5(40)^2 + 5(30)^2 - 8(40)(30) = 8000 + 4500 - 9600 = 2900.$$

Therefore, the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ is 2900. The answer is: $2900$.

Question (hint: positive numerical answer):
"What is the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ when $x$ and $y$ range over all real numbers such that $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$?"
Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:


First, let's simplify the given equation $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$.
We know that $|a-b| = |-(b-a)|$, so we can rewrite the equation as $|x-2y| + |-(y-2x)| = 40$, which simplifies to $|x-2y| + |2x-y| = 40$.

Now, let's consider the expression $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$. We can rewrite it as $\frac{1}{2}((x-2y)^2 + (2x-y)^2)$.

Using the property $|a+b|^2 = |a|^2 + 2ab + |b|^2$, we can expand the left-hand side of the equation $|x-2y| + |2x-y| = 40$:
\[(|x-2y| + |2x-y|)^2 = |x-2y|^2 + 2|x-2y||2x-y| + |2x-y|^2 = 40^2 = 1600.\]
Expanding the right-hand side of the equation $\frac{1}{2}((x-2y)^2 + (2x-y)^2)$, we get:
\[\frac{1}{2}((x-2y)^2 + (2x-y)^2) = \frac{1}{2}(x^2 - 4xy + 4y^2 + 4x^2 - 4xy + y^2) = \frac{1}{2}(5x^2 - 8xy + 5y^2).\]
Comparing the two equations, we have:
\[1600 = 2(5x^2 - 8xy + 5y^2).\]
Simplifying, we get:
\[5x^2 - 8xy + 5y^2 = 800.\]
So, the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ is 800. The answer is: $800$.

Question (hint: positive numerical answer):
"What is the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ when $x$ and $y$ range over all real numbers such that $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$?"
Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:


We start by noting that $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$ is equivalent to $|2y-x| + |2x-y| = 40$.
By the triangle inequality, $|a| + |b| \geq |a+b|$, so we have $|2y-x| + |2x-y| \geq |(2y-x) + (2x-y)| = |y| = y$.
Therefore, $y = 40$.

Now, substituting $y = 40$ into $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$, we get $|x-80| + |40-2x| = 40$.
Again, by the triangle inequality, we have $|x-80| + |40-2x| \geq |(x-80) + (40-2x)| = |-40| = 40$.
So the equality holds when $x-80 = 0$ and $40-2x = 0$, which gives $x = 80$.

Now we can substitute $x = 80$ and $y = 40$ into the expression $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$, we get $5(80)^2 + 5(40)^2 - 8(80)(40) = 32000 + 8000 - 25600 = 8400$.

Therefore, the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ when $x$ and $y$ range over all real numbers such that $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$ is $8400$. The answer is: $\boxed{8400}$.

Question (hint: positive numerical answer):
"What is the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ when $x$ and $y$ range over all real numbers such that $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$?"
Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:


To solve this problem, we first need to simplify the given expression $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$. We can rewrite it as follows:
\[5x^2+5y^2-8xy = \frac{1}{2}((5x^2-8xy+8y^2) + (5y^2-8xy+8x^2))\]
\[ = \frac{1}{2}((5x-4y)^2 + (4x-5y)^2).\]
Now, let's look at the condition $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$. We can rewrite it as $|2y-x| + |2x-y| = 40$. Using the property $|a| + |b| = |a+b| + |a-b|$, we can simplify this to $|2y-x+2x-y| + |2y-x- (2x-y)| = 40$, which further simplifies to $|y+x| + |-x-y| = 40$, and then to $|x+y| + |x+y| = 40$, which is equivalent to $2|x+y| = 40$. Therefore, $|x+y| = 20$.

Now, we know that $(5x-4y)^2 + (4x-5y)^2 \geq 0$ because it's a sum of squares. The minimum value of the left-hand side occurs when $(5x-4y)^2 = (4x-5y)^2 = 0$, which means $5x-4y = 0$ and $4x-5y = 0$. Solving this system of equations, we find $x = \frac{20}{9}$ and $y = \frac{20}{9}$.

Substituting these values into the simplified expression, we get
\[\frac{1}{2}((5\cdot \frac{20}{9}-4\cdot \frac{20}{9})^2 + (4\cdot \frac{20}{9}-5\cdot \frac{20}{9})^2) = \frac{1}{2}(0+0) = 0.\]

Therefore, the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ under the condition $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$ is $0$. The answer is: $0$

Question (hint: positive numerical answer):
"What is the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ when $x$ and $y$ range over all real numbers such that $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$?"
Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:


To find the minimum value of the expression $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ under the condition $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$, we can use the inequality $|a| + |b| \geq |a+b|$. Applying this inequality to the given condition, we have:
\[|x-2y| + |y-2x| \geq |(x-2y) + (y-2x)| = |-x - y| = |-(x+y)| = |x+y|.\]
Given that $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$, we have $|x+y| = 40$.

Now, let's consider the expression $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$. We can rewrite it as $(5x^2-8xy+5y^2) = (5x^2-10xy+5y^2) + 2xy = (5(x-y)^2) + 2xy$.

By the Trivial Inequality, $(x-y)^2 \geq 0$, so $5(x-y)^2 \geq 0$. Therefore, the minimum value of the expression $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ is achieved when $(x-y)^2 = 0$, or $x=y$.

When $x=y$, the equation $|x+y| = 40$ becomes $|2x| = 40$, so $2x = \pm 40$. This gives us $x = \pm 20$.

When $x=y=20$, the expression $5x^2+5y^2-8xy = 5(20)^2 + 5(20)^2 - 8(20)(20) = 2000$.

When $x=y=-20$, the expression $5x^2+5y^2-8xy = 5(-20)^2 + 5(-20)^2 - 8(-20)(-20) = 2000$.

So the minimum value of the expression $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ under the given condition is $2000$. The answer is: $2000$
