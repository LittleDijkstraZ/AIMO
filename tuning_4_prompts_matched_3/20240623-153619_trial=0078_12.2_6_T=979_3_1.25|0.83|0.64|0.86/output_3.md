Solve the following problem with a Python Script (positive numerical answer):
"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"

Approach:

 The equation in the problem is satisfied if either of the following two conditions are true:
1. $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2) = 0$
2. $((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$

For the first condition to be true, we need both $\vert x + y \vert - 10 = 0$ and $\vert x - y \vert - 10 = 0$. This implies that both $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. This means that $x + y = \pm 10$ and $x - y = \pm 10$. Solving these four equations gives us the vertices of the square: $(5, 5)$, $(5, -5)$, $(-5, 5)$, and $(-5, -5)$.

For the second condition to be true, we need both $\vert x \vert - 8 = 0$ and $\vert y \vert - 8 = 0$. This implies that both $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$. This means that $x = \pm 8$ and $y = \pm 8$. Solving these four equations gives us the vertices of the square: $(8, 8)$, $(8, -8)$, $(-8, 8)$, and $(-8, -8)$.

So the points $\left(x, y\right)$ that satisfy the equation form the union of two squares: one with side length 10 (the square with vertices $(5, 5)$, $(5, -5)$, $(-5, 5)$, and $(-5, -5)$) and another with side length 16 (the square with vertices $(8, 8)$, $(8, -8)$, $(-8, 8)$, and $(-8, -8)$).

The area of a square is given by side length squared, so the area of the first square is $10^2 = 100$ and the area of the second square is $16^2 = 256$.

To find the total area of the convex polygon, we simply add the areas of the two squares: $100 + 256 = 356$.

So the area of the convex polygon is 356 square units. The answer is: $356$

Solve the following problem with a Python Script (positive numerical answer):
"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"

Approach:


The expression $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2)$ is equal to zero if and only if at least one of the factors is zero. This means that either $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$.

If $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$, then $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$, which means $x + y = \pm 10$ and $x - y = \pm 10$. Solving these equations gives us the vertices of the square: $(0, 10)$, $(10, 0)$, $(0, -10)$, and $(-10, 0)$.

If $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$, then $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$, which means $x = \pm 8$ and $y = \pm 8$. Solving these equations gives us the vertices of the square: $(8, 8)$, $(8, -8)$, $(-8, 8)$, and $(-8, -8)$.

Combining the two sets of vertices, we find that the points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying the original equation enclose a 8x8 square. The area of this square is $8 \times 8 = 64$.

The answer is: $64$

Solve the following problem with a Python Script (positive numerical answer):
"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"

Approach:


The equation $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ is true if and only if either $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$. 

If $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$, then both $\vert x + y \vert - 10 = 0$ and $\vert x - y \vert - 10 = 0$, which means $x + y = 10$ and $x - y = 10$ or $x + y = 10$ and $x - y = -10$. Solving these systems of equations, we find that the points that satisfy this condition are $(5,5)$ and $(0,0)$.

If $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$, then both $\vert x \vert - 8 = 0$ and $\vert y \vert - 8 = 0$, which means $x = 8$ and $y = 8$.

So, the convex polygon is a square with vertices at $(0,0)$, $(5,5)$, $(8,8)$, and $(3,3)$. The length of each side is the distance between $(0,0)$ and $(5,5)$, which is $\sqrt{(5-0)^2 + (5-0)^2} = \sqrt{50} = 5\sqrt{2}$. Therefore, the area of the square is $(5\sqrt{2})^2 = 50$.
The answer is: $50$

"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"

Approach:



The equation given in the problem, $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$, is equivalent to either $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$.

If the first equation holds, then $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. These equations describe two lines in the plane, and the intersection of these lines form a square with side length 10. The area of this square is $10^2 = 100$.

If the second equation holds, then $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$. These equations describe two circles in the plane, centered at the origin with radius 8. The intersection of these circles form a square with side length 16. The area of this square is $16^2 = 256$.

However, the area of the polygon enclosed by the points satisfying the original equation is the intersection of the areas of the two squares. Therefore, the area of the convex polygon is the minimum of the two areas, which is 100.

So the area of the convex polygon is 100. The answer is: $100$

Solve the following problem with a Python Script (positive numerical answer):
"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"

Assistant:

Approach:



The equation given is:

$$((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$$

This equation is satisfied if either of the two factors is zero. Therefore, we have two sets of conditions:

1. $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ and $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ and $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$
2. $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ and $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ and $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$

From the first set of conditions, we get $x = y = \pm 8$. Similarly, from the second set of conditions, we get $x = -y = \pm 8$. This gives us a square with side length 16.

To find the area of this square, we use the formula for the area of a square which is side length squared. So the area of the square is $16^2 = 256$.

```python


INTERMEDIATE OUT :

def area_of_square():
    side_length = 16
    area = side_length ** 2
    return area

result = area_of_square()
print(result)

The area of the convex polygon is 256 square units. The answer is: $256$

Approach:

 The equation implies that either $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$. These correspond to the following lines/rays in the coordinate plane:

1. $x + y = \pm 10$
2. $x - y = \pm 10$
3. $x = \pm 8$
4. $y = \pm 8$

Plotting these on the coordinate plane, we find that they form a square with side length $20$. The area of this square is $20^2 = 400$.
The answer is: $\boxed{400}$.

Solve the following problem with a Python Script (positive numerical answer):
"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"
Write comments to indicate the steps you take. Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Assistant:

Approach:



The equation is given as $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$. The product of two terms is zero if and only if one of the terms is zero. So we have two separate cases to consider:

1. $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$
2. $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$

For the first case, we have that both $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2$ and $( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2$ are zero. This implies that $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. This is a square with side length 10, and the vertices of the square are $(5,5), (5,-5), (-5,-5), (-5,5)$.

For the second case, we have that both $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2$ and $( \vert y \vert - 8)^2$ are zero. This implies that $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$. This is a square with side length 16, and the vertices of the square are $(8,8), (8,-8), (-8,-8), (-8,8)$.

The intersection of these two squares is the convex polygon we are looking for. The area of this polygon is the sum of the areas of the two squares minus the area of their intersection. The area of a square is given by the square of its side length, so the area of the smaller square is $10^2 = 100$ and the area of the larger square is $16^2 = 256$. The intersection of the two squares is another square with side length 8, so its area is $8^2 = 64$. Therefore, the area of the convex polygon is $100 + 256 - 64 = 292$. The answer is: $292$.

Approach:

 The equation $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + (\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + (\vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ is satisfied only if both of the factors are equal to zero.

For the first factor, either $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$. Both of these equations imply that $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$.

For the second factor, either $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$. Both of these equations imply that $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$.

These conditions can be further simplified to $-10 \leq x + y \leq 10$, $-10 \leq x - y \leq 10$, $-8 \leq x \leq 8$, and $-8 \leq y \leq 8$. These inequalities represent the vertices of a square with side length $16$.

To find the area of this square, we can simply square the length of one of its sides. The length of a side of the square is $16$, so the area of the square is $16^2 = 256$.

The answer is: $\boxed{256}$

Write comments to indicate the steps you take. Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Assistant:

Approach:

 The equation is in the form of product of two terms equaling zero, so either $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$.

For each of these equations to be true, $\vert x + y \vert = 10$, $\vert x - y \vert = 10$, $\vert x \vert = 8$, or $\vert y \vert = 8$.

The solutions to these equations are:

1. $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ gives the lines $x + y = 10$ and $x + y = -10$.
2. $\vert x - y \vert = 10$ gives the lines $x - y = 10$ and $x - y = -10$.
3. $\vert x \vert = 8$ gives the lines $x = 8$ and $x = -8$.
4. $\vert y \vert = 8$ gives the lines $y = 8$ and $y = -8$.

These lines form a rectangle with sides of length 16 and 20, so the area of the rectangle is $16 \times 20 = 320$. The answer is: $320$

The equation $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + (\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ implies that $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. This gives us four lines: $x + y = 10$, $x + y = -10$, $x - y = 10$, and $x - y = -10$. These lines form a square with side length $10\sqrt{2}$.
Similarly, the equation $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + (\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ implies that $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$, which gives us four lines: $x = 8$, $x = -8$, $y = 8$, and $y = -8$. These lines form a square with side length $16$.
The intersection of these two squares is a smaller square with side length $10$ (formed by the intersections of the lines $x = \pm 8$ and $y = \pm 8$ with the lines $x + y = \pm 10$ and $x - y = \pm 10$).
The area of this square is $10^2 = 100$.

Write comments to indicate the steps you take. Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Assistant:

Approach:


The given equation is a product of two expressions equal to zero, so either one of the expressions must be zero. This gives us two sets of equations to solve.

Step 1: Solve $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ and $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$.
From the first equation, we have $\vert x + y \vert = 10$. This means $x + y = 10$ or $x + y = -10$.
From the second equation, we have $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. This means $x - y = 10$ or $x - y = -10$.

Step 2: Solve $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ and $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$.
From the first equation, we have $\vert x \vert = 8$. This means $x = 8$ or $x = -8$.
From the second equation, we have $\vert y \vert = 8$. This means $y = 8$ or $y = -8$.

Step 3: Combine the solutions from Step 1 and Step 2 to find the vertices of the polygon.
The vertices are the intersections of the lines $x + y = 10$, $x + y = -10$, $x - y = 10$, $x - y = -10$, $x = 8$, $x = -8$, $y = 8$, and $y = -8$.
By solving these equations, we find the vertices of the polygon to be $(8,2)$, $(-8, 18)$, $(8, -6)$, $(-8, -2)$, $(10, 0)$, $(-10, 0)$, $(0, 10)$, and $(0, -10)$.

Step 4: Determine the shape of the polygon.
The polygon formed by these vertices is a square with side length 10.

Step 5: Calculate the area of the square.
The area of a square with side length $s$ is given by $s^2$. So, the area of this square is $10^2 = 100$.
The answer is: 100

Approach:


The given equation is $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$. For the product of two numbers to be zero, either one of the numbers must be zero. Therefore, we have two cases:

1. $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$: This implies that both $\vert x + y \vert - 10 = 0$ and $\vert x - y \vert - 10 = 0$. So, $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. This gives us the vertices of the rhombus as $(0,10)$, $(0,-10)$, $(10,0)$, and $(-10,0)$.

2. $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$: This implies that both $\vert x \vert - 8 = 0$ and $\vert y \vert - 8 = 0$. So, $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$. This gives us the vertices of the square as $(8,8)$, $(8,-8)$, $(-8,8)$, and $(-8,-8)$.

The intersection of the two sets of vertices gives us the convex polygon, which is a square with side length 10. To find the area of the square, we use the formula $Area = side^2$. So, the area of the convex polygon is $10^2 = 100$.

```python


INTERMEDIATE OUT :

def area_of_polygon():

The area of the convex polygon is 100 square units. The answer is: $100$
