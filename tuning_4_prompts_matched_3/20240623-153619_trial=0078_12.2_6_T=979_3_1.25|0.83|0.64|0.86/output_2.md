Approach:



To solve the equation $| |x-1| - 2| = \frac{m}{100}$ with $4$ distinct solutions,
we can analyze the graph of the function $| |x-1| - 2|$ and determine the values of $m$ for which it intersects the line $y = \frac{m}{100}$ at $4$ distinct points.

The function $| |x-1| - 2|$ is a piecewise function with four parts:

1. If $x < 1$, then $| |x-1| - 2| = | -x + 1 - 2| = |-x-1| = x+1-2 = x-1$.
2. If $1 \leq x < 3$, then $| |x-1| - 2| = | x-1 - 2| = |x-3| = 3-x$.
3. If $x = 3$, then $| |x-1| - 2| = | x-1 - 2| = |x-3| = 0$.
4. If $x > 3$, then $| |x-1| - 2| = | x-1 - 2| = |x-3| = x-3+2 = x-1$.

Therefore, the function $| |x-1| - 2|$ is a triangular wave with a maximum value of $2$ and a minimum value of $0$.

For the equation $| |x-1| - 2| = \frac{m}{100}$ to have $4$ distinct solutions,
the line $y = \frac{m}{100}$ must intersect the triangular wave at $4$ distinct points.

This occurs when $\frac{m}{100}$ is between $0$ and $2$, so $0 < \frac{m}{100} < 2$.
Multiplying all sides by $100$ gives $0 < m < 200$.

The number of positive integers $m$ that satisfy this inequality is the number of integers from $1$ to $199$, inclusive.

To find this, we subtract the smallest integer from the largest integer and then add $1$: $199 - 1 + 1 = 199$.

So, the number of positive integers $m$ for which the equation $| |x-1| - 2| = \frac{m}{100}$ has $4$ distinct solutions is $199$.
The answer is: 199

Approach:


The given equation is $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ and we want to find the values of $m$ for which this equation has $4$ distinct solutions. 

We know that the absolute value function $\vert \cdot \vert$ makes a value positive. So, the expression $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ will have $4$ distinct solutions when the right side, $\frac{m}{100}$, crosses the "valleys" of the graph of the function $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert$.

The graph of $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert$ has two "valleys" at $y=0$ and $y=4$, corresponding to the cases when the inner absolute value is equal to $2$ and when it is equal to $-2$, respectively.

So, for $\frac{m}{100}$ to cross these valleys and have $4$ distinct solutions, $\frac{m}{100}$ must be equal to either $0$ or $4$. This gives us the two equations $m=0$ and $m=400$.

However, the problem asks for positive integer values of $m$. So, we discard the solution $m=0$ because it is not a positive integer.

The only positive integer value of $m$ for which the given equation has $4$ distinct solutions is $m=400$.

So, the number of positive integers $m$ for which the equation has $4$ distinct solutions is $1$.

To count the number of positive integers $m$ such that the equation $| |x - 1| - 2| = \frac{m}{100}$ has exactly four distinct solutions, we can first rewrite the equation as $| |x - 1| - 2| = \frac{m}{100}$. The left-hand side of the equation is an absolute value, and the right-hand side is a positive fraction. The absolute value equation has four distinct solutions if and only if the right-hand side equals to the difference of two positive numbers and one of the numbers is $2$. This is because the graph of $| |x - 1| - 2|$ has a shape of a "V" with the vertex at $(1, 2)$, and we want the right-hand side to equal to the distance from the vertex to one of the "knees" of the "V". 

The distance from the vertex to one of the "knees" is $2$, so we have $\frac{m}{100} = 2$, which gives $m = 200$. Therefore, there is only one positive integer $m$ that satisfies the condition, and the answer is $\boxed{1}$. The answer is $1$.

However, I want to clarify that in the problem, the term "the equation has four distinct solutions" refers to the solutions of the equation $| |x - 1| - 2| = \frac{m}{100}$, not the solutions of the original equation $| |x - 1| - 2| = \frac{m}{100}$. So the approach above is not correct.

The correct approach should be to analyze the equation $| |x - 1| - 2| = \frac{m}{100}$ for different values of $m$. Since $\frac{m}{100}$ is positive, $| |x - 1| - 2|$ must be positive as well. This means that $|x - 1| - 2$ must be either positive or zero. Therefore, we have two cases:

Case 1: $|x - 1| - 2 = k$, where $k \geq 0$ is a real number.

Case 2: $|x - 1| - 2 = -k$, where $k \geq 0$ is a real number.

Now we analyze each case:

Case 1: $|x - 1| - 2 = k$. 

Rearranging the equation gives $|x - 1| = k + 2$. This equation has two sub-cases:

Sub-case 1.1: $x - 1 = k + 2$. Solving for $x$ gives $x = k + 3$.

Sub-case 1.2: $x - 1 = -(k + 2)$. Solving for $x$ gives $x = -k + 1$.

Case 2: $|x - 1| - 2 = -k$. 

Rearranging the equation gives $|x - 1| = 2 - k$. This equation also has two sub-cases:

Sub-case 2.1: $x - 1 = 2 - k$. Solving for $x$ gives $x = k + 3$.

Sub-case 2.2: $x - 1 = -(2 - k)$. Solving for $x$ gives $x = -k + 1$.

Comparing the solutions from both cases, we can see that they are all the same. This means that each solution $x$ will satisfy either $x = k + 3$ or $x = -k + 1$ for some real number $k \geq 0$. The equation $| |x - 1| - 2| = \frac{m}{100}$ has four distinct solutions if and only if there exist two distinct real numbers $k_1$ and $k_2$ such that $k_1 + 3$, $-k_1 + 1$, $k_2 + 3$, and $-k_2 + 1$ are all distinct. 

It turns out that this is possible if and only if $k_1 = k_2 = 1$. Therefore, the only value of $m$ that satisfies the condition is $m = 200$, and the answer is $\boxed{1}$. Again, the answer is $1$.

However, I want to emphasize that this approach is highly technical and requires a deep understanding of absolute value equations and their solutions. It is not a straightforward approach that can be applied easily to similar problems. A better approach would be to use the graphical method to solve the problem. The graph of $| |x - 1| - 2|$ has a shape of a "V" with the vertex at $(1, 2)$. The right-hand side of the equation $| |x - 1| - 2| = \frac{m}{100}$ is a set of horizontal lines with $y$-intercept $\frac{m}{100}$. The number of distinct solutions is equal to the number of times these horizontal lines intersect the graph of $| |x - 1| - 2|$. By analyzing the graph, we can find that there are four distinct solutions if and only if $\frac{m}{100} = 2$, which gives $m = 200$. Therefore, the answer is $\boxed{1}$.

Let's break down this problem into several steps:

Step 1: Understand the problem.
We are given an equation with absolute value and we need to find out how many values of m will result in 4 distinct solutions.

Step 2: Analyze the equation.
The equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has four distinct solutions if and only if $\frac{m}{100}$ is strictly between $0$ and $3$.
This means that $0<\frac{m}{100}<3$.

Step 3: Solve the inequalities.
Multiplying all sides of the inequalities by $100$, we get $0<m<300$.

Step 4: Count the number of positive integers in the range.
The positive integers $m$ in the range $(0,300)$ are the integers from $1$ to $299$.

Step 5: Count the number of integers in the range.
To find the number of integers in the range, we subtract the smallest integer from the largest integer and add $1$. So, the number of integers in the range is $299-1+1=299$.

Therefore, there are 299 positive integers $m$ for which the equation has 4 distinct solutions. The answer is: $299$

To find the number of positive integers $m$ for which the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has $4$ distinct solutions, we need to understand the properties of the absolute value function and how it interacts with the equation.

First, let's analyze the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$.
The equation inside the absolute value, $\vert x-1 \vert -2$, can be positive or negative. This gives us two cases to consider:

Case 1: $\vert x-1 \vert -2 = \frac{m}{100}$
In this case, $\vert x-1 \vert = \frac{m}{100} + 2$. This equation has two subcases:

Subcase 1.1: $x-1 = \frac{m}{100} + 2$ or $x-1 = -(\frac{m}{100} + 2)$. Solving these two equations gives us two solutions for $x$.

Subcase 1.2: $x-1 = \frac{m}{100} + 2$ or $x-1 = -(\frac{m}{100} + 2)$. Solving these two equations gives us two more solutions for $x$.

Case 2: $\vert x-1 \vert -2 = -\frac{m}{100}$
In this case, $\vert x-1 \vert = 2 - \frac{m}{100}$. This equation also has two subcases:

Subcase 2.1: $x-1 = 2 - \frac{m}{100}$ or $x-1 = -(2 - \frac{m}{100})$. Solving these two equations gives us two more solutions for $x$.

Subcase 2.2: $x-1 = 2 - \frac{m}{100}$ or $x-1 = -(2 - \frac{m}{100})$. Solving these two equations gives us two more solutions for $x$.

In total, we have obtained 8 solutions for $x$ for each value of $m$. For the equation to have 4 distinct solutions, we need to find the values of $m$ for which exactly 4 of these 8 solutions are distinct.

This can be done by considering the properties of the absolute value function and the equation. By analyzing the equations obtained in the subcases, we can determine the range of values of $m$ for which exactly 4 distinct solutions exist.

By doing this analysis, we find that the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has 4 distinct solutions when $m=200$. Therefore, the only positive integer $m$ for which the equation has 4 distinct solutions is $m=200$. So, the number of positive integers $m$ for which the equation has 4 distinct solutions is 1.

The answer is: $1$.
