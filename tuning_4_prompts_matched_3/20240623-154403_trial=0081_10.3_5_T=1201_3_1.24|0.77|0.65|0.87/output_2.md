Approach:


The equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has 4 distinct solutions if and only if $\frac{m}{100}$ is strictly between 1 and 2.

We have $1 < \frac{m}{100} < 2$, which gives us $100 < m < 200$. The positive integers $m$ that satisfy this inequality are the integers from 101 to 199, inclusive. To find the number of these integers, we subtract the smallest integer from the largest and add 1.

Solution:
The number of positive integers $m$ that satisfy $100 < m < 200$ is $200 - 101 + 1 = 99 + 1 = 100$. However, this includes both 100 and 200, which do not correspond to any valid $m$ values. So, we need to subtract 2 from the total. Therefore, the number of positive integers $m$ for which the equation has 4 distinct solutions is $100 - 2 = 98$.

The answer is: $98$.

Approach:


We know that the equation $| |x - 1| - 2| = \frac{m}{100}$ has 4 distinct solutions. The expression $| |x - 1| - 2|$ is a piecewise function that can take on values from 0 to 3. This means that $\frac{m}{100}$ must be in the interval $(0, 3)$. So we have $0 < \frac{m}{100} < 3$, which gives $0 < m < 300$.

Since $m$ is a positive integer, the possible values of $m$ are the integers from 1 to 299. We need to count the number of these values that give 4 distinct solutions to the equation.

From the equation $| |x - 1| - 2| = \frac{m}{100}$, we can deduce that for each fixed $\frac{m}{100}$, there are exactly 4 distinct solutions. Therefore, we just need to count the number of positive integers $m$ such that $0 < m < 300$.

This is simply the number of integers from 1 to 299. To find this, we can subtract the smallest integer (1) from the largest integer (299) and then add 1. So the number of positive integers $m$ is $299 - 1 + 1 = 299$.

So the number of positive integers $m$ for which the equation $| |x - 1| - 2| = \frac{m}{100}$ has 4 distinct solutions is 299.
The answer is: $299$

 The problem asks for the number of positive integers $m$ such that the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has 4 distinct solutions. We know that $\frac{m}{100}$ must be positive, so $m$ must be a positive integer. 

First, let's consider the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$. 

For this equation to have 4 distinct solutions, the right-hand side $\frac{m}{100}$ must be between $1$ and $2$. This is because the function $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert$ takes on all values between $1$ and $2$ exactly once as $x$ varies over the real numbers. 

So, we have $1 < \frac{m}{100} < 2$. Multiplying all sides by $100$ gives $100 < m < 200$. The positive integers $m$ that satisfy this inequality are the integers from $101$ to $199$, inclusive. 

The number of such integers is $199 - 101 + 1 = 99$. So, there are $99$ positive integers $m$ for which the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has 4 distinct solutions. The answer is: $99$

We will find the values of $m$ for which the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has 4 distinct solutions. 
The right-hand side of the equation, $\frac{m}{100}$, represents a positive constant. 
The number of distinct solutions of the equation depends on the value of the constant.
The equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ is equivalent to the system of equations:
\[\vert x-1 \vert -2 = \frac{m}{100} \quad \text{or} \quad \vert x-1 \vert -2 = -\frac{m}{100}.\]
Let's solve each case separately:
1. For $\vert x-1 \vert -2 = \frac{m}{100}$:
\[\vert x-1 \vert = 2 + \frac{m}{100}.\]
This equation has 2 solutions if $2 + \frac{m}{100} > 0$, which gives $m > -200$.
And it has 0 solutions if $2 + \frac{m}{100} < 0$, which gives $m < -200$.
2. For $\vert x-1 \vert -2 = -\frac{m}{100}$:
\[\vert x-1 \vert = 2 - \frac{m}{100}.\]
This equation has 2 solutions if $2 - \frac{m}{100} > 0$, which gives $m < 200$.
And it has 0 solutions if $2 - \frac{m}{100} < 0$, which gives $m > 200$.
Combining these cases, we see that the equation has 4 distinct solutions when $-200 < m < 200$.
The number of positive integers $m$ in this range is equal to $200 - 1 = 199$.
Therefore, the number of positive integers $m$ for which the equation has 4 distinct solutions is 199. The answer is: $199$

Approach:


We know that the function $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert$ has a graph that consists of a sequence of "V" shapes, each with width 1 and height 2. The number of "V" shapes in the graph is equal to the number of solutions to the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$. Since we want the equation to have 4 distinct solutions, the graph of $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert$ must be stretched vertically by a factor of $\frac{100}{2}=50$ so that it touches the line $y=\frac{m}{100}$ at exactly 4 points.

The graph of $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert$ is a sequence of "V" shapes, each with height 2 and width 1. When we stretch it vertically by a factor of 50, the height of each "V" shape becomes $2 \cdot 50 = 100$. This means that $m$ must be equal to 100.

So, the number of positive integers $m$ for which the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has 4 distinct solutions is 1. The answer is: $1$

Assistant:

Approach:


The equation $| |x-1| - 2 | = \frac{m}{100}$ has 4 distinct solutions if and only if $\frac{m}{100} = 2$. Thus, we need to solve the equation $| |x-1| - 2 | = 2$.

This equation breaks down into two cases:

1. $|x-1| - 2 = 2$, which gives $|x-1| = 4$. This further breaks down into two sub-cases: $x-1 = 4$ or $x-1 = -4$. Solving these gives $x = 5$ or $x = -3$.

2. $|x-1| - 2 = -2$, which gives $|x-1| = 0$. This gives $x-1 = 0$, so $x = 1$.

So, the 4 distinct solutions of the equation are $x = -3, 1, 5$. Therefore, $m = 2 \times 100 = 200$.

So, the number of positive integers $m$ for which the equation has 4 distinct solutions is 1. The answer is: $1$

 The equation $| |x-1|-2|=\frac{m}{100}$ has 4 distinct solutions if and only if $\frac{m}{100}$ is strictly between 0 and 2. Therefore, $0<\frac{m}{100}<2$, which simplifies to $0<m<200$. The positive integers $m$ that satisfy this inequality are the integers from 1 to 199. To count these integers, we subtract the smallest integer from the largest and add 1. This gives the number of integers in the range as $199-1+1=199$. Therefore, there are 199 positive integers $m$ for which the equation has 4 distinct solutions.

Approach:


The given equation is a piecewise function. For each value of $m$, we need to find the number of distinct solutions to the equation. We can start by solving the equation for different values of $m$ and then count the number of distinct solutions.

Step 1: For each value of $m$, we need to solve the equation \[\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}\]
Step 2: We know that the absolute value function is always nonnegative, so \[\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100} \ge 0\]
This means $m \ge 0$. Also, we know that \[\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert \le \vert x-1 \vert + 2 \le x + 1\]
So, we have \[\frac{m}{100} \le x + 1 \implies m \le 100(x+1)\]
Combining the two inequalities, we have \[0 \le m \le 100(x+1)\]
Step 3: Now, we need to solve the equation \[\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}\]
This equation can have 4 distinct solutions when the right-hand side is between 1 and 2. That is, when $1 \le \frac{m}{100} < 2$, we have $100 \le m < 200$.
Step 4: Therefore, the number of positive integer values of $m$ that satisfy $100 \le m < 200$ is $100$.
The answer is: $100$

Assistant:

Approach:

 The equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has 4 distinct solutions means that the expression inside the absolute value, $\vert x-1 \vert -2$, changes its sign exactly twice as $x$ varies over the real numbers. This happens when the value inside the absolute value is 0, which gives us the equations $\vert x-1 \vert = 2$ and $\vert x-1 \vert = 2-\frac{m}{100}$. The solutions to $\vert x-1 \vert = 2$ are $x=3$ and $x=-1$, and the solutions to $\vert x-1 \vert = 2-\frac{m}{100}$ are $x=1+\frac{m}{100}$ and $x=1-\frac{m}{100}$. 

The four solutions are distinct if and only if $-1<1-\frac{m}{100}<1+\frac{m}{100}<3$, which simplifies to $0<m<100$. Therefore, the number of possible values for $m$ is the number of positive integers in the open interval $(0, 100)$, which is 99.

However, we need to exclude the values of $m$ that make the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ have less than 4 distinct solutions. This happens when $\frac{m}{100} \geq 2$, which gives $m \geq 200$. Since $m$ must be positive and less than 100, there are no such values of $m$.

Therefore, the number of positive integers $m$ for which the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has 4 distinct solutions is 99.
The answer is: 99

Approach:


The absolute value equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has 4 distinct solutions if and only if $\frac{m}{100}$ is strictly between 1 and 2. This is because the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=k$ has 4 distinct solutions for any positive $k$ in the interval $(1,2)$. So we need to find the number of positive integers $m$ such that $\frac{m}{100}$ is in the interval $(1,2)$.

Solving the inequality $1 < \frac{m}{100} < 2$:
Multiply all sides by 100 to get rid of the fraction: $100 < m < 200$.
The positive integers $m$ that satisfy this inequality are the integers from 101 to 199, inclusive.

Counting the number of these integers:
The smallest integer in this range is 101 and the largest is 199. To find the number of integers in this range, we can subtract the smallest integer from the largest and then add 1 (because both endpoints are included): $199 - 101 + 1 = 99$.

So there are 99 positive integers $m$ for which the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has 4 distinct solutions.
The answer is: 99

Approach:


The equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has 4 distinct solutions, it implies that the value of $\frac{m}{100}$ is a value which splits the graph of $f(x) = \vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert$ into 4 parts. 

First, let's plot the graph of $f(x) = \vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert$.

We can see that $f(x)$ is a V-shape graph, and the maximum value of $f(x)$ is 2, which is achieved at $x=1$. The minimum value of $f(x)$ is 0, which is achieved at $x=3$ and $x=-1$.

So the value of $\frac{m}{100}$ should be in the interval $(0, 2)$, i.e., $0 < \frac{m}{100} < 2$.

This gives us $0 < m < 200$.

Also, the number of parts created by a value of $\frac{m}{100}$ on the graph of $f(x)$ is one more than the number of local maximum or minimum points. In other words, if a value of $\frac{m}{100}$ splits the graph into 4 parts, it must be a value which passes through exactly 3 local maximum or minimum points.

Looking at the graph of $f(x)$, we can see that the value of $f(x)$ equals to $\frac{m}{100}$ at exactly 3 points when $\frac{m}{100}$ is 1.

So we have $\frac{m}{100} = 1$, which gives $m = 100$.

Therefore, there is only one positive integer $m$ that makes the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ have 4 distinct solutions. The answer is: $1$

However, this contradicts with the condition $0 < m < 200$. The error comes from the fact that we have overlooked a possible situation where the value of $\frac{m}{100}$ splits the graph into 4 parts without passing through a local maximum or minimum point.

Let's reconsider the situation. If a value of $\frac{m}{100}$ splits the graph into 4 parts, it must be a value which passes through exactly 3 local maximum or minimum points. However, if the value of $\frac{m}{100}$ is 0 or 2, it will only split the graph into 2 parts. So we should consider the values of $\frac{m}{100}$ between 0 and 2.

Looking at the graph of $f(x)$, we can see that the value of $f(x)$ equals to $\frac{m}{100}$ at exactly 3 points when $\frac{m}{100}$ is 1.

So we have $\frac{m}{100} = 1$, which gives $m = 100$.

However, we need to check if $m = 100$ is the only solution. Let's consider the values of $\frac{m}{100}$ between 0 and 1. When $\frac{m}{100}$ is 0.5, the value of $f(x)$ equals to $\frac{m}{100}$ at exactly 3 points. So we have $\frac{m}{100} = 0.5$, which gives $m = 50$.

Therefore, the positive integer $m$ that makes the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ have 4 distinct solutions are 50 and 100.

However, both 50 and 100 are within the interval $(0, 200)$.

So the number of positive integer $m$ that makes the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ have 4 distinct solutions is 2.
The answer is: $2$

We are given the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$, and we want to find the number of positive integers $m$ for which the equation has $4$ distinct solutions.

First, let's consider the right-hand side of the equation. Since $\frac{m}{100}$ is a positive fraction, the value of $m$ must be a positive integer. The possible values of $\frac{m}{100}$ are all the positive fractions between $0$ and $2$, i.e., $\frac{m}{100} \in (0, 2)$. Thus, the possible values of $m$ are the positive integers from $1$ to $200$.

Next, let's consider the number of solutions of the equation. The equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ can be thought of as the difference between two absolute values equaling a positive fraction. This equation will have $4$ distinct solutions when the fraction $\frac{m}{100}$ is between $1$ and $2$. This is because the graph of $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert$ will intersect the line $y=\frac{m}{100}$ at $4$ points when $\frac{m}{100}$ is between $1$ and $2$.

So, the number of positive integers $m$ for which the equation has $4$ distinct solutions is the number of positive integers from $100$ to $200$, which is $100$.

Therefore, the number of positive integers $m$ for which the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has $4$ distinct solutions is $100$. The answer is: $100$

We know that the absolute value function $\vert x-1 \vert -2$ will have a V-shape graph. The number of distinct solutions of the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ will be the number of times the line $y = \frac{m}{100}$ intersects the V-shape graph of $y = \vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert$. 

The graph of $y = \vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert$ will intersect the line $y = \frac{m}{100}$ exactly four times when $\frac{1}{2} < \frac{m}{100} < 3$. Solving these inequalities gives us $50 < m < 300$. The positive integers $m$ in this range are exactly the integers from 51 to 299, inclusive. To find the number of these integers, we subtract the smallest value from the largest value and add 1. This gives us $299 - 51 + 1 = 249$. So there are 249 positive integers $m$ for which the equation has 4 distinct solutions. The answer is: 249

Approach:



1. We start by considering the equation $| |x - 1| - 2 | = \frac{m}{100}$.
2. This equation has four distinct solutions if and only if the right-hand side, $\frac{m}{100}$, is equal to $1$ (which gives two solutions), and the equation $| |x - 1| - 2 | = 1$ has two distinct solutions.
3. Solving $| |x - 1| - 2 | = 1$ gives us two cases:
   - $|x - 1| - 2 = 1$ or $|x - 1| - 2 = -1$.
   - Solving these gives us two more equations: $|x - 1| = 3$ and $|x - 1| = 1$.
4. Solving $|x - 1| = 3$ gives $x = 4$ and $x = -2$, and solving $|x - 1| = 1$ gives $x = 2$ and $x = 0$.
5. Therefore, the equation $| |x - 1| - 2 | = 1$ has four distinct solutions.
6. So, the equation $| |x - 1| - 2 | = \frac{m}{100}$ has four distinct solutions if and only if $\frac{m}{100} = 1$, which gives $m = 100$.

So, the positive integer $m$ that satisfies the condition is $100$.
The answer is: $1$
