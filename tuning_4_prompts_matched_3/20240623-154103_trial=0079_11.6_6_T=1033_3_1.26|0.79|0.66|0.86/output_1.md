Approach:


We can use the Cauchy-Schwarz inequality to solve this problem. First, let's rewrite the given equation as:
\[|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40 \implies |x-2y| + 2|x-y| = 40.\]
By the triangle inequality, $|a| + |b| \geq |a+b|$, so we have:
\[|x-2y| + 2|x-y| \geq |x-2y+2(x-y)| = |3x-4y| = 40.\]
This inequality is always true for any real numbers $x$ and $y$.
Now, let's consider the expression $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$. We can rewrite it as:
\[5(x^2+y^2) - 8xy = 5[(x-y)^2 + 2xy] - 8xy = 5(x-y)^2 + 3xy.\]
By the Cauchy-Schwarz inequality, we have:
\[(1^2 + 2^2)(x-y)^2 \geq (1 \cdot x + 2 \cdot y)^2 \implies 5(x-y)^2 \geq (x+2y)^2.\]
And also:
\[(3^2 + 1^2)(xy)^2 \geq (3 \cdot x - 1 \cdot y)^2 \implies 10xy^2 \geq (3x - y)^2.\]
Adding these two inequalities, we get:
\[5(x-y)^2 + 10xy^2 \geq (x+2y)^2 + (3x - y)^2.\]
This simplifies to:
\[5x^2+5y^2-8xy \geq (x+2y)^2 + (3x - y)^2 - (x+2y)^2 - (3x - y)^2 = 0.\]
Equality occurs when $x = 2y$ and $3x = y$, which gives $x = \frac{2}{3}y$. Substituting $x = \frac{2}{3}y$ into the equation $|3x-4y| = 40$, we get:
\[|3(\frac{2}{3}y) - 4y| = |2y - 4y| = |-2y| = 40 \implies y = -20.\]
Then, $x = \frac{2}{3}(-20) = -\frac{40}{3}$.
Substituting $x = -\frac{40}{3}$ and $y = -20$ into the expression $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$, we get:
\[5(-\frac{40}{3})^2 + 5(-20)^2 - 8(-\frac{40}{3})(-20) = 0.\]
Therefore, the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ when $x$ and $y$ range over all real numbers such that $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$ is 0. The answer is: $0$

We are given the equation $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$. Let's rewrite this equation as $|2y-x| + |2x-y| = 40$.

Now, let's consider the expression $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$. We can rewrite this as $(5x^2-8xy+4y^2) + (y^2) = (5x^2-8xy+4y^2) + (y^2 - 4xy + 4xy) = (5x-4y)^2 + (y-4x)^2$.

Notice that $(5x-4y)^2$ and $(y-4x)^2$ are both non-negative. Therefore, the minimum value of $(5x-4y)^2 + (y-4x)^2$ is 0, which occurs when both $(5x-4y)^2$ and $(y-4x)^2$ are equal to 0. This happens when $5x-4y = 0$ and $y-4x = 0$, which gives us $x = y$.

Substituting $x = y$ into the equation $|2y-x| + |2x-y| = 40$, we get $|y-y| + |2y-y| = 40$, which simplifies to $0 + |y| = 40$. Thus, $|y| = 40$, which implies $y = \pm 40$. Since $x = y$, we have $x = \pm 40$.

Now, let's substitute $x = y = 40$ into the expression $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$, we get $5(40)^2+5(40)^2-8(40)(40) = 20(40)^2 - 3200 = 32000$.

Similarly, if we substitute $x = y = -40$ into the expression $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$, we also get $32000$.

Therefore, the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ when $x$ and $y$ range over all real numbers such that $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$ is $32000$.

The answer is: $32000$

Approach:



The given equation $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$ can be rewritten as $|x-2y| + |2y-x| = 40$ using the property $|a| = |-a|$. Now we can use the property $|a+b| \leq |a| + |b|$ to get $|x-2y + 2y-x| \leq |x-2y| + |2y-x|$, which simplifies to $0 \leq 40$. This is true, but doesn't give us much information.

However, we can observe that the given equation is equivalent to $|x-2y| = |2y-x|$ because $|a| = |b|$ is equivalent to $|a| = |b|$ or $|a| = -|b|$. And $|a| = |b|$ is equivalent to $a = b$ or $a = -b$. So, we have $x - 2y = 2y - x$ or $x - 2y = -(2y - x)$. Solving these equations gives $x = 2y$ or $x = y$.

Now, let's substitute $x = 2y$ into the expression $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$:
$$5(2y)^2+5y^2-8(2y)(y) = 20y^2+5y^2-16y^2 = 9y^2.$$
And let's substitute $x = y$ into the expression $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$:
$$5y^2+5y^2-8y^2 = 2y^2.$$

So we need to find the minimum value of $9y^2$ and $2y^2$. The minimum value of $9y^2$ is 0 when $y = 0$, and the minimum value of $2y^2$ is also 0 when $y = 0$. Therefore, the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ when $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$ is 0.

Python Script:

Since we have already solved the problem mathematically, there is no Python script required.

The minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ when $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$ is 0. The answer is: $0$

Assistant:

Approach:


The given equation $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$ represents the perimeter of a parallelogram with vertices at $(0,0)$, $(x,y)$, $(2x-y, 2y-x)$, and $(2y-x, 2x-y)$.
The sides of this parallelogram are of length $|x-2y|$ and $|y-2x|$.
By the triangle inequality, the sum of the lengths of any two sides of a triangle is greater than the length of the third side.
Therefore, $|x-2y| + |y-2x| \geq |(x-2y) - (y-2x)| = |x-2y - y + 2x| = |3x-3y| = 3|x-y|$.
We are given that $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$, so $3|x-y| = 40$, which implies $|x-y| = \frac{40}{3}$.
Now, let's consider the expression $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$.
We can rewrite this as $(5x^2 - 8xy + 5y^2) = (5x^2 - 10xy + 5y^2) + 2xy = (5(x-y)^2) + 2xy$.
Substituting $|x-y| = \frac{40}{3}$, we get $(5(\frac{40}{3})^2) + 2xy$.
We want to minimize this expression.
By the Trivial Inequality, $2xy \geq -(\frac{2xy}{2})^2 = -(\frac{xy}{1})^2 = -x^2y^2$.
Therefore, the minimum value of $(5(\frac{40}{3})^2) + 2xy$ is achieved when $2xy$ is minimized.
Since $2xy \geq -x^2y^2$, the minimum value of $2xy$ is achieved when $x=0$ or $y=0$.
But if $x=0$ or $y=0$, then $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 0 \neq 40$, so we must have $x=y$.
When $x=y$, we have $|x-2x| + |x-2x| = | -x| + |-x| = 2|x| = 40$, which implies $|x| = 20$.
So, the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ is achieved when $x=y=\pm 20$.
Substituting $x=y=20$ into the expression $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$, we get $5(20^2) + 5(20^2) - 8(20)(20) = 2000 + 2000 - 3200 = 800$.
Therefore, the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ is 800.
The answer is: $800$

Approach:


This problem is an application of the Cauchy-Schwarz inequality. We can rewrite the expression $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ as $(x-2y)^2 + (y-2x)^2$ and then use the given condition $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$ to relate the expression to the minimum value of $(x-2y)^2 + (y-2x)^2$.

Solution:

Firstly, let's rewrite the expression $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ as $(x-2y)^2 + (y-2x)^2$. This can be done as follows:

\begin{align*}
5x^2+5y^2-8xy &= 5x^2 + 5y^2 - 4xy - 4xy \\
&= (x^2 - 4xy + 4y^2) + (y^2 - 4xy + 4x^2) \\
&= (x-2y)^2 + (y-2x)^2.
\end{align*}

Now, we know that by the Cauchy-Schwarz inequality, we have
\[(|x-2y| + |y-2x|)^2 \ge 4(x-2y)^2 + 4(y-2x)^2.\]
From the given condition, we know that $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$, so we can substitute this into the inequality:
\[(40)^2 \ge 4(x-2y)^2 + 4(y-2x)^2.\]
Simplifying, we get:
\[1600 \ge 4(x-2y)^2 + 4(y-2x)^2.\]
Dividing both sides by 4, we get:
\[400 \ge (x-2y)^2 + (y-2x)^2.\]
So we have:
\[(x-2y)^2 + (y-2x)^2 \le 400.\]
This means that the minimum value of $(x-2y)^2 + (y-2x)^2$ is 0, and therefore the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ is 0.

Therefore, the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ when $x$ and $y$ range over all real numbers such that $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$ is 0. The answer is: $\boxed{0}$
