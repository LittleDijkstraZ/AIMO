Approach:


The equation is in the form of a product of two expressions equal to zero. This means that either the first expression is zero or the second expression is zero. 

Let's set each expression equal to zero and solve for the variables $x$ and $y$:

1) For the first expression:
$$(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + (\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$$

This expression is only zero if $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$.

The solutions for these two equations are:
- $x + y = 10$ and $x - y = 10$, which gives $x = 10$ and $y = 0$.
- $x + y = -10$ and $x - y = -10$, which gives $x = -10$ and $y = 0$.
- $x + y = 10$ and $x - y = -10$, which gives $x = 0$ and $y = 10$.
- $x + y = -10$ and $x - y = 10$, which gives $x = 0$ and $y = -10$.

2) For the second expression:
$$(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + (\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$$

This expression is only zero if $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$.

The solutions for these two equations are:
- $x = 8$ and $y = 8$.
- $x = 8$ and $y = -8$.
- $x = -8$ and $y = 8$.
- $x = -8$ and $y = -8$.

Plotting these points on a coordinate plane, we find that they form a square with side length $16$. The area of this square is $16^2 = 256$.

Therefore, the area of the convex polygon is $256$. The answer is: $256$.

The given equation is a product of two terms equal to zero. This means that either the first term is zero or the second term is zero. Let's analyze each term separately.

1. $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ implies that $\vert x + y \vert = 10$. This means $x + y = 10$ or $x + y = -10$. These are two lines in the coordinate plane.

2. $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ implies that $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. This means $x - y = 10$ or $x - y = -10$. These are also two lines in the coordinate plane.

3. $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ implies that $\vert x \vert = 8$. This means $x = 8$ or $x = -8$. These are two vertical lines in the coordinate plane.

4. $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ implies that $\vert y \vert = 8$. This means $y = 8$ or $y = -8$. These are two horizontal lines in the coordinate plane.

Combining all these lines, we find that the points that satisfy the given equation form a square with side length 20 (the distance between the lines $x + y = 10$ and $x + y = -10$ is 20, or the distance between the lines $x - y = 10$ and $x - y = -10$ is 20). The area of this square is $20 \times 20 = 400$. So, the area of the convex polygon is 400 square units. The answer is: $400$

Solve the following problem with a Python Script (positive numerical answer):
"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"

Approach:

 The equation given is a product of two expressions, and the product equals to zero if and only if at least one of the expressions equals to zero. Therefore, we need to solve the equations $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$, $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$, $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$, and $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$. The solutions to these equations give the vertices of the polygon.

After finding the vertices, we can calculate the area of the polygon.

Below is a Python code to calculate the area:

```python


INTERMEDIATE OUT :

from sympy import symbols, Abs, solve

def calculate_area():
    x, y = symbols('x y')

    # Solve the equations
    vertices_1 = solve([Abs(x + y) - 10, Abs(x) - 8, Abs(y) - 8])
    vertices_2 = solve([Abs(x - y) - 10, Abs(x) - 8, Abs(y) - 8])

    # Combine all vertices
    vertices = vertices_1 + vertices_2

    # Calculate the area
    area = 0
    for i in range(len(vertices)):
        for j in range(i + 1, len(vertices)):
            area += abs(vertices[i][0]*vertices[j][1] - vertices[j][0]*vertices[i][1]) / 2

    return area

area = calculate_area()
print(area)
```

This seems to be a mistake because the area should not be zero. Let's reexamine the equations.

We notice that the absolute value expressions can be zero only when the expressions inside the absolute value are zero. Therefore, the solutions to the equations $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$, $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$, $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$, and $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ are $x + y = 10$, $x - y = 10$, $x = 8$, and $y = 8$, respectively.

Solving these equations, we get the vertices of the polygon:

For $x + y = 10$, $x = 8$, we get $y = 2$.
For $x - y = 10$, $x = 8$, we get $y = -2$.
For $x + y = 10$, $y = 8$, we get $x = 2$.
For $x - y = 10$, $y = 8$, we get $x = 18$.

So the vertices of the polygon are $(8, 2)$, $(8, -2)$, $(2, 8)$, and $(18, 8)$.

Now, we can calculate the area of the polygon. The polygon is a square with side length 16 (the difference between the x-coordinates or y-coordinates of any two opposite vertices). Therefore, the area of the square is $16^2 = 256$.

The area of the convex polygon is 256. The answer is: $\boxed{256}$

Solve the following problem with a Python Script (positive numerical answer):
"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"

Approach:

 The equation $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ implies that $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. These two equations represent two lines in the plane: $x + y = 10$ and $x - y = 10$ (or $x + y = -10$ and $x - y = -10$), which intersect at points $(5,5)$ and $(-5,-5)$. Similarly, the equation $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ implies that $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$, which represent two lines in the plane: $x = 8$ and $x = -8$ (or $y = 8$ and $y = -8$), which intersect at points $(8,0)$, $(-8,0)$, $(0,8)$, and $(0,-8)$.

Therefore, the four points $(5,5)$, $(-5,-5)$, $(8,0)$, $(-8,0)$, $(0,8)$, and $(0,-8)$ are the vertices of the convex polygon.

The polygon is a square with side length $10$, so its area is $10^2 = 100$.

So, the area of the convex polygon is $100$. The answer is: $100$

Write comments to indicate the steps you take. Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Assistant:

Approach:

 The equation is satisfied if either $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$. Each of these equations is satisfied if the absolute value expression is equal to zero, which means the value inside the absolute value is zero. This gives us the following four equations:

1. $x + y = 0$,
2. $x - y = 0$,
3. $x = 0$,
4. $y = 0$.

Solving these equations gives us the vertices of the polygon:

1. For $x + y = 0$, we get $y = -x$.
2. For $x - y = 0$, we get $y = x$.
3. For $x = 0$, we get $y = 0$.
4. For $y = 0$, we get $x = 0$.

The vertices of the polygon are therefore $(0, 0)$, $(8, 0)$, $(0, 8)$, and $(8, -8)$. These points form a square with side length $8$. The area of the square is $8^2 = 64$.

The answer is: $\boxed{64}$

For the product of two expressions to be zero, one of the expressions must be zero. So we have two cases to consider:

1. $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$.
2. $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$.

From case 1, we have $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$, which implies that $x + y = \pm 10$ and $x - y = \pm 10$. Solving these equations gives us the vertices of the square: $(8, 2)$, $(8, -2)$, $(-8, -2)$, and $(-8, 2)$.

From case 2, we have $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$, which implies that $x = \pm 8$ and $y = \pm 8$. This gives us the vertices of the square: $(8, 8)$, $(8, -8)$, $(-8, -8)$, and $(-8, 8)$.

By analyzing both cases, we find that the convex polygon is a square with side length 16. The area of a square is given by the square of the length of its side, so the area of the square is $16^2 = 256$.
The answer is: $256$

This problem involves the absolute value function, which can be tricky to work with. However, we can simplify the given equation by observing that the product of two numbers is zero if and only if at least one of the numbers is zero. Therefore, we can set each factor equal to zero and solve for the corresponding $(x, y)$ pairs.

For the first factor:

$(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0 \Rightarrow \vert x + y \vert = 10$.
This gives us two equations: $x + y = 10$ and $x + y = -10$.

For the second factor:

$(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0 \Rightarrow \vert x - y \vert = 10$.
This gives us two more equations: $x - y = 10$ and $x - y = -10$.

For the third factor:

$(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0 \Rightarrow \vert x \vert = 8$.
This gives us two more equations: $x = 8$ and $x = -8$.

For the fourth factor:

$(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0 \Rightarrow \vert y \vert = 8$.
This gives us two more equations: $y = 8$ and $y = -8$.

Now, we can find the intersection points of these lines:

- For $x + y = 10$ and $x - y = 10$, we get $x = 10$ and $y = 0$.
- For $x + y = 10$ and $x - y = -10$, we get $x = 0$ and $y = 10$.
- For $x + y = -10$ and $x - y = 10$, we get $x = 0$ and $y = -10$.
- For $x + y = -10$ and $x - y = -10$, we get $x = -10$ and $y = 0$.
- For $x = 8$ and $y = 8$, we get the point $(8, 8)$.
- For $x = 8$ and $y = -8$, we get the point $(8, -8)$.
- For $x = -8$ and $y = 8$, we get the point $(-8, 8)$.
- For $x = -8$ and $y = -8$, we get the point $(-8, -8)$.

These eight points are the vertices of the polygon:

$(0, 10)$, $(10, 0)$, $(0, -10)$, $(-10, 0)$, $(8, 8)$, $(8, -8)$, $(-8, 8)$, and $(-8, -8)$.

Now, we can calculate the area of this polygon. It's a square with side length 16, so its area is $16^2 = 256$.
The answer is: $256$
