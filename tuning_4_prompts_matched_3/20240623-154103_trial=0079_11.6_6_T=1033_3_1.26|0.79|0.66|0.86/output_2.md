Approach:


The equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has 4 distinct solutions when $\frac{m}{100}$ is equal to the positive difference between the values inside the absolute value signs in the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=k$ (where $k$ is a positive real number), which is $k=3$ and $k=1$.
So we have $\frac{m}{100}=3$ or $\frac{m}{100}=1$.
Solving these two equations gives $m=300$ or $m=100$.
Therefore, there are $2$ possible values of $m$.


```python

Approach:


To find the number of positive integers $m$ for which the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has four distinct solutions, we need to consider the number of "jumps" in the absolute value function.
The graph of $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert$ consists of a series of "jumps" up and down.
Each "jump" represents a change in the slope of the graph.
If the right side of the equation, $\frac{m}{100}$, is equal to the height of one of these jumps, then the equation will have four distinct solutions.
To find the heights of these jumps, we need to consider the possible transformations of the absolute value function.

First, we can shift the graph of $\vert x \vert$ one unit to the right to get the graph of $\vert x-1 \vert$.
Then, we can shift this graph two units down to get the graph of $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert$.
The graph of $\vert x \vert$ has a "jump" at $x=0$.
After shifting and stretching, this "jump" becomes a "jump" at $x=1$ with height 2 in the graph of $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert$.
The graph of $\frac{m}{100}$ will have four distinct solutions when $\frac{m}{100}=2$.
So, $m=200$.

Since there are no other "jumps" in the graph of $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert$, the only value of $m$ that works is $m=200$.
Therefore, there is only one positive integer $m$ for which the equation has four distinct solutions. The answer is: 1

Approach:



The equation $| |x-1|-2|=\frac{m}{100}$ has 4 distinct solutions if and only if $\frac{m}{100}$ is strictly between $0$ and $2$. This is because $| |x-1|-2|$ is always less than or equal to $2$, and it equals $2$ exactly when $|x-1|-2=0$ or $|x-1|-2=4$. In the first case, $|x-1|=2$, which implies $x-1=2$ or $x-1=-2$, giving us two solutions. In the second case, $|x-1|=6$, which has no solutions because $x-1$ is always between $- \infty$ and $+\infty$. Thus, $| |x-1|-2|$ has exactly two solutions when $| |x-1|-2|=2$.

So we need to find the number of positive integers $m$ such that $0 < \frac{m}{100} < 2$. This is equivalent to finding the number of positive integers $m$ such that $0 < m < 200$. The number of such integers is $200 - 1 = 199$. Therefore, there are $199$ positive integers $m$ for which the equation has 4 distinct solutions.

The answer is: $199$

Solve the following problem with a Python Script (positive numerical answer):
"For how many positive integers $m$ does the equation \[\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}\] have $4$ distinct solutions?"
Write comments to indicate the steps you take. Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Approach:


The equation \[\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}\] has 4 distinct solutions means that the expression inside the absolute value, i.e., $\vert x-1 \vert -2$, changes its sign twice when $x$ varies from $-\infty$ to $\infty$. This happens when the expression inside the absolute value equals $0$ twice.

Let's solve the equation $\vert x-1 \vert -2 = 0$.

1. If $x-1 \geq 0$, then $x-1 -2 = 0$, which gives $x = 3$.
2. If $x-1 < 0$, then $-(x-1) -2 = 0$, which gives $x = -1$.

So, the equation $\vert x-1 \vert -2 = 0$ has two solutions, $x = 3$ and $x = -1$. This means that the expression inside the absolute value of the original equation changes its sign at $x = 3$ and $x = -1$.

Now we need to find for how many positive integers $m$ the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has 4 distinct solutions. This happens when $\frac{m}{100}$ is strictly between the absolute values of the differences of the two roots from $0$, i.e., $\frac{m}{100}$ is strictly between $3 - 1 = 2$ and $1 - (-1) = 2$. This is only possible when $\frac{m}{100} = 2$, so $m = 200$.

So, the only positive integer $m$ for which the equation has 4 distinct solutions is $m = 200$. The answer is: $\boxed{1}$.

Solve the following problem with a Python Script (positive numerical answer):
"For how many positive integers $m$ does the equation \[\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}\] have $4$ distinct solutions?"
Write comments to indicate the steps you take. Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Assistant:

Approach:


We start by simplifying the equation \[\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}.\]
Since the absolute value function $\vert \cdot \vert$ is always non-negative, we can split the equation into two cases:
Case 1: $\vert x-1 \vert -2 = \frac{m}{100}$.
Case 2: $-\vert x-1 \vert +2 = \frac{m}{100}$.

Now we solve these two cases separately:

Case 1: $\vert x-1 \vert -2 = \frac{m}{100}$.
Adding 2 to both sides, we get $\vert x-1 \vert = 2 + \frac{m}{100}$.
This implies two sub-cases:
Sub-case 1.1: $x-1 = 2 + \frac{m}{100}$.
Solving for $x$, we get $x = 3 + \frac{m}{100}$.
Sub-case 1.2: $-(x-1) = 2 + \frac{m}{100}$.
Solving for $x$, we get $x = -1 + \frac{m}{100}$.

Case 2: $-\vert x-1 \vert +2 = \frac{m}{100}$.
Adding $\vert x-1 \vert$ to both sides and subtracting 2 from both sides, we get $-\frac{m}{100} = -2$.
Multiplying both sides by -1, we get $\frac{m}{100} = 2$.
Multiplying both sides by 100, we get $m = 200$.
However, this value of $m$ does not give us 4 distinct solutions.

Now we check for how many values of $m$ (between 0 and 200) the equation $\vert x-1 \vert = 2 + \frac{m}{100}$ has 4 distinct solutions.
The graph of $y = \vert x-1 \vert$ is a V-shape with the vertex at $(1, 0)$. The graph of $y = 2 + \frac{m}{100}$ is a horizontal line. The equation $\vert x-1 \vert = 2 + \frac{m}{100}$ has 4 distinct solutions when the line $y = 2 + \frac{m}{100}$ intersects the graph of $y = \vert x-1 \vert$ at four points. This happens when $0 < 2 + \frac{m}{100} < 2$, or $-200 < m < 0$.

Since $m$ must be a positive integer, the number of such $m$ is 0.
Therefore, there are no values of $m$ such that the equation \[\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}\] has 4 distinct solutions.
However, we have made a mistake in our reasoning.
Let's reconsider the equation \[\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}.\]
The correct approach is to split the equation into two cases as before:
Case 1: $\vert x-1 \vert -2 = \frac{m}{100}$.
Case 2: $-\vert x-1 \vert +2 = \frac{m}{100}$.

Case 1: $\vert x-1 \vert -2 = \frac{m}{100}$.
Adding 2 to both sides, we get $\vert x-1 \vert = 2 + \frac{m}{100}$.
This implies two sub-cases:
Sub-case 1.1: $x-1 = 2 + \frac{m}{100}$.
Solving for $x$, we get $x = 3 + \frac{m}{100}$.
Sub-case 1.2: $-(x-1) = 2 + \frac{m}{100}$.
Solving for $x$, we get $x = -1 + \frac{m}{100}$.

Case 2: $-\vert x-1 \vert +2 = \frac{m}{100}$.
Adding $\vert x-1 \vert$ to both sides and subtracting 2 from both sides, we get $2 - \frac{m}{100} = 0$.
Simplifying, we get $\frac{m}{100} = 2$.
Multiplying both sides by 100, we get $m = 200$.
However, this value of $m$ does not give us 4 distinct solutions.

Now we check for how many values of $m$ (between 0 and 200) the equation $\vert x-1 \vert = 2 + \frac{m}{100}$ has 4 distinct solutions.
The graph of $y = \vert x-1 \vert$ is a V-shape with the vertex at $(1, 0)$. The graph of $y = 2 + \frac{m}{100}$ is a horizontal line. The equation $\vert x-1 \vert = 2 + \frac{m}{100}$ has 4 distinct solutions when the line $y = 2 + \frac{m}{100}$ intersects the graph of $y = \vert x-1 \vert$ at four points. This happens when $0 < 2 + \frac{m}{100} < 2$, or $-200 < m < 0$.
However, $m$ cannot be negative in this case.
So, we need to check the other case.

Case 2: $-\vert x-1 \vert +2 = \frac{m}{100}$.
Rearranging the equation, we get $-\vert x-1 \vert = -2 + \frac{m}{100}$.
Multiplying both sides by -1, we get $\vert x-1 \vert = 2 - \frac{m}{100}$.
This implies two sub-cases:
Sub-case 2.1: $x-1 = 2 - \frac{m}{100}$.
Solving for $x$, we get $x = 3 - \frac{m}{100}$.
Sub-case 2.2: $-(x-1) = 2 - \frac{m}{100}$.
Solving for $x$, we get $x = -1 - \frac{m}{100}$.

Now we check for how many values of $m$ (between 0 and 200) the equation $\vert x-1 \vert = 2 - \frac{m}{100}$ has 4 distinct solutions.
The graph of $y = \vert x-1 \vert$ is a V-shape with the vertex at $(1, 0)$. The graph of $y = 2 - \frac{m}{100}$ is a horizontal line. The equation $\vert x-1 \vert = 2 - \

Approach:



The equation \[\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}\] can have 4 distinct solutions if and only if $\frac{m}{100}$ is equal to either $1$ or $3$. This is because the expression inside the absolute value, $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert$, takes on the value of $1$ or $3$ exactly $4$ times for the given equation to have $4$ distinct solutions.

We consider each case:

Case 1: $\frac{m}{100} = 1$.

In this case, $m = 100$.

Case 2: $\frac{m}{100} = 3$.

In this case, $m = 300$.

Therefore, there are $2$ positive integers $m$ for which the equation has $4$ distinct solutions. The answer is: $2$

Approach:



For the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ to have $4$ distinct solutions, the value of $\frac{m}{100}$ must be equal to $2$. 

Because if $\frac{m}{100} = 2$, we have $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert = 2$.
This equation can be solved by breaking it down into two cases:

1. If $\vert x-1 \vert -2 = 2$, then $\vert x-1 \vert = 4$. This gives us two sub-cases:
   a) If $x-1 = 4$, then $x = 5$.
   b) If $x-1 = -4$, then $x = -3$.

2. If $\vert x-1 \vert -2 = -2$, then $\vert x-1 \vert = 0$. This gives us only one sub-case:
   a) If $x-1 = 0$, then $x = 1$.

So, the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert = 2$ has $3$ distinct solutions ($x = -3, 1, 5$). However, we want $4$ distinct solutions.

Now, if $\frac{m}{100} > 2$, the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ will have no solutions.

If $\frac{m}{100} < 2$, the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ will have less than $4$ distinct solutions.

Therefore, the only value of $m$ that works is $m = 200$. The answer is: $1$

1. We first need to understand the structure of the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$. This equation is a combination of two absolute value functions, and it can have different forms depending on the value of $\frac{m}{100}$.

2. The equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ will have 4 distinct solutions when $\frac{m}{100}$ falls within a specific range. We need to find this range.

3. We then count the number of positive integer values of $m$ that make $\frac{m}{100}$ fall within this range.

Python Implementation:

The specific range for $\frac{m}{100}$ can be found by analyzing the properties of the absolute value function and the equation. After a detailed analysis, we find that $0 < \frac{m}{100} < 2$ will give 4 distinct solutions to the equation.

We need to find the number of positive integer values of $m$ in this range:

```python

    return count

count = count_positive_integers()

Approach:


We first note that the function $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert$ is a piecewise linear function with vertices at $x=1 \pm 2$, i.e., at $x=-1$, $x=3$. It takes the value $0$ at $x=1 \pm 2$, i.e., at $x=-1$ and $x=3$, and takes the value $\vert x-1 \vert -2$ for $x \in (- \infty, -1) \cup (3, \infty)$, and $-( \vert x-1 \vert -2)$ for $x \in (-1,3)$. Therefore, the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has 4 distinct solutions if and only if $0 < \frac{m}{100} < 2$. This is equivalent to $0 < m < 200$. The number of positive integers $m$ in this interval is $199$. The answer is: 199

Assistant:

Approach:



The equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has 4 distinct solutions if and only if $\frac{m}{100}$ is a positive number less than 2 but greater than 0. This is because the expression inside the absolute value, $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert$, oscillates between 0 and 4, so the right hand side $\frac{m}{100}$ must be within this range for there to be 4 distinct solutions.

So we have $0 < \frac{m}{100} < 2$. Multiplying all sides by 100 gives $0 < m < 200$. The number of positive integers $m$ in this range is 199.

But we must also remember that $m$ must be such that $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has 4 distinct solutions. To determine the values of $m$ for which this is true, we can analyze the behavior of the expression $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert$. This expression is equal to $\frac{m}{100}$ at 4 distinct values of $x$ if and only if the graph of the function $y=\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert$ intersects the horizontal line $y=\frac{m}{100}$ at 4 distinct points.

We find that this happens exactly when $\frac{m}{100}=1$, or $m=100$.

Therefore, the only value of $m$ for which the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has 4 distinct solutions is $m=100$.

However, we have already counted all positive integers less than 200 in our initial range of $0 < m < 200$. So we must exclude $m=100$ from our count, because we have found that this particular value of $m$ does not yield 4 distinct solutions.

So the number of positive integers $m$ for which the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has 4 distinct solutions is one less than the total number of positive integers in the range $0 < m < 200$. That is, the number of such $m$ is $199-1=198$.

So the answer is $\boxed{198}$.
The value of $m$ that we have to exclude from our count is $m=100$.

The number of positive integers $m$ in the range $0 < m < 200$ is 199. However, we have found that only one value of $m$, namely $m=100$, yields 4 distinct solutions to the equation. Therefore, the number of positive integers $m$ for which the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has 4 distinct solutions is 199 - 1 = 198. The answer is: $198$

Write comments to indicate the steps you take. Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Assistant:

Approach:


We will find out how many values of $m$ make the equation have $4$ distinct solutions by analyzing the equation step by step.

First, let's look at the equation \[\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}\]

The equation is equal to $\frac{m}{100}$, which means the left side of the equation is always nonnegative. This implies that $\frac{m}{100}$ must also be nonnegative, so $m$ must be nonnegative.

Next, we know that $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert$ can take on values from $0$ to $2$, inclusive. This is because the inner absolute value $\vert x-1 \vert$ is always nonnegative, so $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert$ can be at most $2$. It can be $0$ when $\vert x-1 \vert = 2$, which gives $x=3$ or $x=-1$.

Now, we want the equation to have $4$ distinct solutions. This means that $\frac{m}{100}$ must be a value that the left side of the equation can take on exactly once when it goes from $0$ to $2$.

This can happen only when $\frac{m}{100}=1$. This is because if $\frac{m}{100}=0$ or $\frac{m}{100}=2$, the left side of the equation will not be able to take on that value exactly once.

So, we have $\frac{m}{100}=1$, which gives $m=100$.

So, there is only one positive integer $m$ that makes the equation have $4$ distinct solutions, which is $100$. The answer is: $1$
