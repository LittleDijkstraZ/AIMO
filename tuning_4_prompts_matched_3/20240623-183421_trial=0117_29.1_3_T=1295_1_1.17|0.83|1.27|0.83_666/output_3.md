Interesting, let's analyze step by step:



If a product of two numbers equals zero, one or both of them must be zero. This gives us the following two equations:
1) $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$, which implies $\vert x + y \vert = 10$.
2) $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$, which implies $\vert x - y \vert = 10$.
3) $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$, which implies $\vert x \vert = 8$.
4) $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$, which implies $\vert y \vert = 8$.

From 3) and 4) we know that $-8 \le x \le 8$ and $-8 \le y \le 8$.

From 1) and 2) we know that $x + y = \pm 10$ and $x - y = \pm 10$.
Solving these equations, we get the following points: $(5,5), (5,-5), (-5,5), (-5,-5), (8,0), (-8,0), (0,8), (0,-8)$.

These points form a square with side length $10$, so its area is $10^2 = 100$.

The answer is: $100$

Interesting, let's analyze step by step:



The expression $A = ((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ can be true only if either of the following two conditions is met:

1. Either $ (\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ or
2. Either $ (\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$

In the first case, either $|x+y| = 10$ and $|x-y| = 10$ or $|x+y| = 0$ and $|x-y| = 0$. The only way both can be true is if $x=y=0$ or $x=y=10$. So, the points satisfying this equation are $(0,0)$ and $(10,10)$ and $(10,-10)$.

In the second case, either $|x|=8$ and $|y|=8$. This gives us a square with side length 16. The points satisfying this equation are those where the distance from the origin is 8.

Now, we can draw these points on a graph to visualize the polygon:

[asy]
unitsize(0.5 cm);

pair A, B, C, D, E, F, G, H;

A = (0,0);
B = (10,10);
C = (10,-10);
D = (16,0);
E = (8*sqrt(2),8*sqrt(2));
F = (-8*sqrt(2),8*sqrt(2));
G = (-16,0);
H = (-8*sqrt(2),-8*sqrt(2));

draw(A--B--C--cycle);
draw(D--E--F--G--cycle);

dot("$A(0,0)$", A, SW);
dot("$B(10,10)$", B, N);
dot("$C(10,-10)$", C, S);
dot("$D(16,0)$", D, E);
dot("$E(8\sqrt{2},8\sqrt{2})$", E, NE);
dot("$F(-8\sqrt{2},8\sqrt{2})$", F, NE);
dot("$G(-16,0)$", G, W);
dot("$H(-8\sqrt{2},-8\sqrt{2})$", H, SW);
[/asy]

The polygon is a rhombus with vertices at $(0,0)$, $(10,10)$, $(10,-10)$ and $(-10,10)$ and a square with side length 16. The area of the rhombus is given by the product of its diagonals divided by 2, which are 20 and $20\sqrt{2}$. The area of the square is $16^2 = 256$. Therefore, the total area of the polygon is:

$$A = \frac{1}{2} \cdot 20 \cdot 20\sqrt{2} + 256 = 200\sqrt{2} + 256.$$

However, the area should be a positive integer. It seems we made a mistake. Let's go back and reevaluate the problem.

The expression $A = ((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ can be true only if either of the following two conditions is met:

1. Either $ (\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ or
2. Either $ (\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$

In the first case, either $|x+y| = 10$ and $|x-y| = 10$ or $|x+y| = 0$ and $|x-y| = 0$. The only way both can be true is if $x=y=0$ or $x=y=10$. So, the points satisfying this equation are $(0,0)$ and $(10,10)$ and $(10,-10)$.

In the second case, either $|x|=8$ and $|y|=8$. This gives us a square with side length 16. The points satisfying this equation are those where the distance from the origin is 8.

D = (16,0);
E = (8*sqrt(2),8*sqrt(2));
F = (-8*sqrt(2),8*sqrt(2));
G = (-16,0);
H = (-8*sqrt(2),-8*sqrt(2));

draw(A--B--C--cycle);
draw(D--E--F--G--cycle);

dot("$A(0,0)$", A, SW);
dot("$B(10,10)$", B, N);
dot("$C(10,-10)$", C, S);
dot("$D(16,0)$", D, E);
dot("$E(8\sqrt{2},8\sqrt{2})$", E, NE);
dot("$F(-8\sqrt{2},8\sqrt{2})$", F, NE);
dot("$G(-16,0)$", G, W);
dot("$H(-8\sqrt{2},-8\sqrt{2})$", H, SW);

"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"

Interesting, let's analyze step by step:



Since the product of two numbers is zero if and only if at least one of the numbers is zero, the given equation is equivalent to the system of equations:

$$((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2) = 0$$
$$((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$$

For the first equation, we have:
$$(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0 \Rightarrow \vert x + y \vert = 10$$
$$(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0 \Rightarrow \vert x - y \vert = 10$$

This implies that the points $(x, y)$ lie on the square with vertices at $(5, 5)$, $(-5, 5)$, $(-5, -5)$, and $(5, -5)$.

For the second equation, we have:
$$(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0 \Rightarrow \vert x \vert = 8 \Rightarrow -8 \leq x \leq 8$$
$$(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0 \Rightarrow \vert y \vert = 8 \Rightarrow -8 \leq y \leq 8$$

This implies that the points $(x, y)$ lie on a square with side length 16.

The intersection of the two regions is the square with vertices at $(5, 5)$, $(-5, 5)$, $(-5, -5)$, and $(5, -5)$, which is the convex polygon.

The area of this square is side length squared, so the area is $10^2 = 100$. The answer is: $100$

Interesting, let's analyze step by step:



The equation $f(x,y) = 0$ implies that either $f_1(x,y) = (\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ or $f_2(x,y) = (\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$.

From $f_1(x,y) = 0$, we have $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. This implies that $x + y = \pm 10$ and $x - y = \pm 10$, which means $x = \pm 5$ and $y = \pm 5$. So, we have four vertices of the polygon: $(5,5)$, $(5,-5)$, $(-5,5)$, and $(-5,-5)$.

From $f_2(x,y) = 0$, we have $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$, which implies $x = \pm 8$ and $y = \pm 8$. So, we have four more vertices of the polygon: $(8,8)$, $(8,-8)$, $(-8,8)$, and $(-8,-8)$.

Now we can calculate the area of the polygon: it's a square with side length $10$, so the area is $10^2 = 100$. 

So, the area of the convex polygon is $100$. The answer is: $100$

Assistant:

Interesting, let's analyze step by step:



Step 1: We have two equations here: $|x+y|-10=0$ and $|x-y|-10=0$ and $|x|-8=0$ and $|y|-8=0$.

Step 2: Solving these four equations, we get:
1. For $|x+y|-10=0$, $|x+y|=10$, so $x+y=10$ or $x+y=-10$.
2. For $|x-y|-10=0$, $|x-y|=10$, so $x-y=10$ or $x-y=-10$.
3. For $|x|-8=0$, $|x|=8$, so $x=8$ or $x=-8$.
4. For $|y|-8=0$, $|y|=8$, so $y=8$ or $y=-8$.

Step 3: We can get the vertices of the polygon by solving these equations:
1. $(x, y) = (8, 2)$
2. $(x, y) = (8, -2)$
3. $(x, y) = (-8, 2)$
4. $(x, y) = (-8, -2)$
5. $(x, y) = (2, 8)$
6. $(x, y) = (2, -8)$
7. $(x, y) = (-2, 8)$
8. $(x, y) = (-2, -8)$

Step 4: To find the area of the polygon, we can use the Shoelace formula:
The Shoelace formula takes the coordinates of the vertices of a polygon and calculates its area. If the vertices of the polygon are $(x_1, y_1), (x_2, y_2), ..., (x_n, y_n)$, then the area of the polygon is given by:

$$\frac{1}{2} |(x_1y_2 + x_2y_3 + ... + x_ny_1) - (y_1x_2 + y_2x_3 + ... + y_nx_1)|.$$

Step 5: Applying the Shoelace formula to our polygon with vertices $(8, 2), (8, -2), (-8, 2), (-8, -2), (2, 8), (2, -8), (-2, 8), (-2, -8)$, we get:

$$A = \frac{1}{2} |(8 \cdot 2 + 8 \cdot (-2) + (-8) \cdot 2 + (-8) \cdot (-2) + 2 \cdot 8 + 2 \cdot (-8) + (-2) \cdot 8 + (-2) \cdot (-8)) - (2 \cdot 8 + (-2) \cdot 8 + 8 \cdot 2 + (-8) \cdot 2 + 8 \cdot (-2) + 2 \cdot (-8) + (-8) \cdot (-2) + (-2) \cdot 8)|.$$

Step 6: Simplifying the expression, we get:

$$A = \frac{1}{2} |(16 - 16 - 16 + 16 + 16 - 16 - 16 + 16) - (16 - 16 + 16 - 16 + 16 - 16 + 16 - 16)| = 0.$$

However, we have made a mistake in our calculations. Let's go back and correct the steps.

Step 1: The correct equations are:
1. $|x+y|-10=0$ and $|x+y|=10$.
2. $|x-y|-10=0$ and $|x-y|=10$.
3. $|x|-8=0$ and $|x|=8$.
4. $|y|-8=0$ and $|y|=8$.

Step 2: Solving these equations:
1. For $|x+y|=10$, $x+y=10$ or $x+y=-10$.
2. For $|x-y|=10$, $x-y=10$ or $x-y=-10$.
3. For $|x|=8$, $x=8$ or $x=-8$.
4. For $|y|=8$, $y=8$ or $y=-8$.

Step 3: Solving these equations, we get the same vertices as before:
1. $(x, y) = (8, 2)$
2. $(x, y) = (8, -2)$
3. $(x, y) = (-8, 2)$
4. $(x, y) = (-8, -2)$
5. $(x, y) = (2, 8)$
6. $(x, y) = (2, -8)$
7. $(x, y) = (-2, 8)$
8. $(x, y) = (-2, -8)$

Step 4: Now, we can apply the Shoelace formula to our polygon. But the Shoelace formula is not suitable for this problem. Instead, we can use the fact that the polygon is a square with side length $16$. The area of the square is $16^2 = 256$.

So, the area of the polygon is $256$.

Step 5: To verify that the area is positive, we can simply look at the area of the square, which is clearly positive. So the area of the polygon is indeed positive and equals $256$.

The answer is: $256$

Assistant:

Interesting, let's analyze step by step:



1. The problem gives us the equation $f(x, y) = ((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$. 
2. For the product of two numbers to be zero, either one of the numbers must be zero. Therefore, either $g(x, y) = (\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ or $h(x, y) = (\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$.
3. From $g(x, y) = 0$, we get $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. Solving these absolute value equations, we get four lines: $x + y = 10$, $x + y = -10$, $x - y = 10$, and $x - y = -10$. These lines form a square with side length 10.
4. From $h(x, y) = 0$, we get $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$. Solving these absolute value equations, we get four lines: $x = 8$, $x = -8$, $y = 8$, and $y = -8$. These lines form a square with side length 16.
5. The intersection of the two squares is a smaller square with side length 8.
6. The area of the convex polygon is the area of the larger square minus the area of the smaller square. The area of a square is side length squared, so the area of the larger square is $16^2 = 256$ and the area of the smaller square is $8^2 = 64$.
7. The area of the convex polygon is $256 - 64 = 192$.

So, the area of the convex polygon is $192$. The answer is: $\boxed{192}$.

Interesting, let's analyze step by step:



1. The given equation is a product of two terms, and it equals to zero. This means either the first term equals zero, or the second term equals zero.
2. The first term is $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)$, and it equals to zero if both $(\vert x + y \vert - 10) = 0$ and $(\vert x - y \vert - 10) = 0$. This implies that $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$, which means $x + y = \pm10$ and $x - y = \pm10$. Solving these equations, we get the vertices of the polygon as $(0, 10), (0, -10), (10, 0), (-10, 0)$.
3. The second term is $((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2)$, and it equals to zero if both $(\vert x \vert - 8) = 0$ and $(\vert y \vert - 8) = 0$. This implies that $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$, which means $x = \pm8$ and $y = \pm8$. Solving these equations, we get the vertices of the polygon as $(8, 8), (8, -8), (-8, 8), (-8, -8)$.
4. Now, we plot these points on a coordinate plane and connect them with line segments to form a square. The side length of the square is the distance between any two adjacent vertices, which can be found using the distance formula. For example, the distance between $(0, 10)$ and $(0, -10)$ is $20$, and the distance between $(0, 10)$ and $(10, 0)$ is $10\sqrt{2}$, which simplifies to $10\sqrt{2}/ \sqrt{2} = 10$. So, the side length of the square is $10$.
5. The area of the square is the side length squared, so the area is $10^2 = 100$. Since the area is a positive integer, we have found the area of the convex polygon.

```python


INTERMEDIATE OUT :

from sympy import symbols, sqrt, Rational

def area_of_polygon():
    # The side length of the square
    side_length = 10

    # The area of the square

    return area

result = area_of_polygon()

The area of the convex polygon is $100$.
