Interesting, let's analyze step by step:



The equation has four distinct solutions, which means that the right side $\frac{m}{100}$ must equal to $2$ (in this case we will get three solutions). So we have $m=200$. Now let's check if it's correct.

Let's start with $m = 200$. The equation becomes $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{200}{100}=2$. Simplifying this gives $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert = 2$.

Let's solve this step by step:

Step 1: Isolate the absolute value: $\vert x-1 \vert - 2 = \pm 2$.

Step 2: Split the absolute value equation into two separate equations: $\vert x-1 \vert - 2 = 2$ and $\vert x-1 \vert - 2 = -2$.

Step 3: Solve the two equations:

For the first equation: $\vert x-1 \vert - 2 = 2$ becomes $\vert x-1 \vert = 4$, which gives us two more equations: $x - 1 = 4$ and $x - 1 = -4$.

For the second equation: $\vert x-1 \vert - 2 = -2$ becomes $\vert x-1 \vert = 0$, which gives us one equation: $x - 1 = 0$.

Step 4: Solve the resulting equations:

For $x - 1 = 4$, we get $x = 5$.
For $x - 1 = -4$, we get $x = -3$.
For $x - 1 = 0$, we get $x = 1$.

So we have found three solutions: $x = -3$, $x = 1$, and $x = 5$. 

Now let's check if this is correct: $\vert \vert -3 - 1 \vert - 2 \vert = \vert 4 - 2 \vert = 2$, $\vert \vert 1 - 1 \vert - 2 \vert = \vert 0 - 2 \vert = 2$, and $\vert \vert 5 - 1 \vert - 2 \vert = \vert 4 - 2 \vert = 2$. All of them equal to 2, which is what we wanted.

So the value of $m$ that makes the equation have four distinct solutions is indeed $200$. Since $200$ is a positive integer, the solution is valid.

Therefore, the answer is $\boxed{1}$.

Interesting, let's analyze step by step:



Given the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ and it has 4 distinct solutions, we need to find for how many positive integers $m$ this is true.

First, we know that the right side of the equation $\frac{m}{100}$ must be positive, so $m$ must be positive.

Second, since the equation has 4 distinct solutions, the right side of the equation $\frac{m}{100}$ must be in the range (0, 3).

To find the possible values of $m$, we can multiply the inequality $0 < \frac{m}{100} < 3$ by 100, which gives $0 < m < 300$.

Now, we need to find the number of positive integers $m$ in this range. This is simply the number of integers from 1 to 299. To find this, we can subtract the smallest possible value of $m$ from the largest possible value of $m$ and then add 1. This gives $299 - 1 + 1 = 299$.

However, this number includes the value $m = 0$ and $m = 300$, which are not in the range (0, 300). So we need to subtract these two values from the total. This gives $299 - 2 = 297$.

Therefore, there are 297 positive integers $m$ for which the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has 4 distinct solutions. But we need to check if this number is a positive integer. Since 297 is a positive integer, our calculation is correct.

The value of $m$ for which the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has 4 distinct solutions is 297. Therefore, the answer is: 297. However, this is not a valid positive integer as it is greater than 100. 

We must have made a mistake in our calculation. Let's retrace our steps and find the error.

Upon reexamination, we realize that our error occurred in the last step when we subtracted the values of m = 0 and m = 300. These values are not outside the range (0, 300), but are simply not in the range (0, 3).

To correct this, we need to consider the different cases for the value of $\frac{m}{100}$:

- Case 1: $0 < \frac{m}{100} < 1$. This gives $0 < m < 100$, so there are 99 positive integers in this range.
- Case 2: $1 \leq \frac{m}{100} < 2$. This gives $100 \leq m < 200$, so there are 99 positive integers in this range.
- Case 3: $2 \leq \frac{m}{100} < 3$. This gives $200 \leq m < 300$, so there are 99 positive integers in this range.

Adding up the number of positive integers in each case gives $99 + 99 + 99 = 297$.

However, we have already established that there should be only one value of $m$ for which the equation has 4 distinct solutions. We must have made a mistake in our calculation.

Upon reexamination, we realize that our error occurred in the last step when we added up the number of positive integers in each case. We should not add these numbers together. Instead, we should simply count the number of positive integers in the range (1, 299). This is simply 298.

Therefore, the number of positive integers $m$ for which the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has 4 distinct solutions is 298. But we need to check if this number is a positive integer. Since 298 is a positive integer, our calculation is correct.

The value of $m$ for which the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has 4 distinct solutions is 298.

Therefore, the number of positive integers $m$ for which the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has 4 distinct solutions is 298.
The answer is: $298$.

Interesting, let's analyze step by step:



For how many positive integers $m$ does the equation \[\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}\] have $4$ distinct solutions?

Step 1: Let's first consider the expression inside the absolute value, which is $|x-1| - 2$. This expression is equal to either $\frac{m}{100}$, or $-\frac{m}{100}$. So we have two equations to solve:

\[|x - 1| - 2 = \frac{m}{100} \tag{1}\]
\[|x - 1| - 2 = -\frac{m}{100} \tag{2}\]

Step 2: Now, let's solve each equation:

For equation (1), we add 2 to both sides to get $|x - 1| = \frac{m}{100} + 2$. This gives us two separate equations:

\[x - 1 = \frac{m}{100} + 2 \quad \text{and} \quad x - 1 = -(\frac{m}{100} + 2)\]

Simplify these to:

\[x = \frac{m}{100} + 3 \quad \text{and} \quad x = 1 - \frac{m}{100} - 2 = 1 - \frac{m}{100} - 2 = -1 - \frac{m}{100}\]

Similarly, for equation (2), we add 2 to both sides to get $|x - 1| = 2 - \frac{m}{100}$. This gives us two separate equations:

\[x - 1 = 2 - \frac{m}{100} \quad \text{and} \quad x - 1 = - (2 - \frac{m}{100}) = -\frac{m}{100} + 2\]

Simplify these to:

\[x = 3 - \frac{m}{100} \quad \text{and} \quad x = \frac{m}{100} + 1\]

Step 3: Now, we have four possible solutions for $x$. The solutions are distinct if and only if the four expressions for $x$ are different. Comparing them, we see that:

\[x = \frac{m}{100} + 3 \quad \text{and} \quad x = -1 - \frac{m}{100}\]

are different from:

\[x = 3 - \frac{m}{100} \quad \text{and} \quad x = \frac{m}{100} + 1\]

So, we need to find for which values of $m$ these four expressions are all different. This happens when:

\[\frac{m}{100} + 3 \neq -1 - \frac{m}{100} \quad \text{and} \quad \frac{m}{100} + 3 \neq 3 - \frac{m}{100} \quad \text{and} \quad -1 - \frac{m}{100} \neq 3 - \frac{m}{100} \quad \text{and} \quad -1 - \frac{m}{100} \neq \frac{m}{100} + 1\]

After solving these inequalities, we find that the only values of $m$ for which the four expressions are all different are $1 \leq m \leq 99$. There are 99 possible values of $m$ in this range.

So, the number of positive integers $m$ for which the equation has 4 distinct solutions is 99.
The answer is: $99$

Interesting, let's analyze step by step:



The equation is given by $ | | x - 1 | - 2 | = \frac{m}{100} $.
We want to find the values of $m$ such that the equation has 4 distinct solutions.

First, let's understand the structure of the equation. It is a composition of absolute values, which makes it a piecewise function. The innermost absolute value $|x - 1|$ makes the function piecewise for $x$ in the intervals $(-\infty, 1)$ and $(1, \infty)$. Then, $| | x - 1 | - 2 |$ makes the function piecewise for $x$ in the intervals $(-\infty, 1-2) = (-\infty, -1)$, $(-1, 1+2) = (3, \infty)$, and $(1-2, 1+2) = (-1, 3)$.

The right side of the equation, $\frac{m}{100}$, is a constant.

Therefore, the equation has 4 distinct solutions when the constant $\frac{m}{100}$ equals to the absolute difference between two of the segments of the piecewise function. The segments are $[-3, -1)$, $[1, 3)$, and $(1, 3]$.

By inspection, we see that the absolute difference between the segments $[-3, -1)$ and $[1, 3)$ is 2. Therefore, we have $\frac{m}{100} = 2$, which gives $m = 200$.

So the only positive integer value of $m$ that makes the equation have 4 distinct solutions is $m = 200$. The answer is: $1$

Interesting, let's analyze step by step:



First, we know that for a absolute value equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ to have $4$ distinct solutions, $\frac{m}{100}$ must be set to a value in the range of $1$ to $2$ (since $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert$ can only be in the range of $0$ to $2$). 

This implies $1 \leq \frac{m}{100} \leq 2$, and therefore $100 \leq m \leq 200$.

The possible integer values of $m$ that satisfy the inequality are $100, 101, 102, ..., 200$. To find out how many such values there are, we can calculate the number of integers from $100$ to $200$ inclusive.

We can use the formula for the number of integers from $a$ to $b$, which is $b - a + 1$. So the number of integers from $100$ to $200$ is $200 - 100 + 1 = 101$.

So, the number of positive integers $m$ for which the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has $4$ distinct solutions is $101$.

The number of positive integers $m$ for which the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has $4$ distinct solutions is $101$. However, $101$ is not a positive integer. This is a common mistake, the problem was asking for the number of positive integers $m$, not the number of integers in the range from $100$ to $200$. Therefore, the result should be $1$.

However, we made a mistake in our calculation. The range of $m$ is from $100$ to $200$ inclusive, so the number of positive integers $m$ in this range is $101$. But the problem is asking for the number of positive integers $m$, not the number of integers in the range from $100$ to $200$. So we need to count the positive integers in the range from $1$ to $200$.

The number of positive integers from $1$ to $200$ is $200$. But we need to subtract $1$ to exclude the value $0$. So the number of positive integers $m$ is $200 - 1 = 199$.

However, $199$ is still not a positive integer. This is another mistake, we should not subtract $1$ from $200$. The number of positive integers from $1$ to $200$ is $200$.

To find out how many such values there are, we can calculate the number of integers from $100$ to $200$ inclusive.

We can use the formula for the number of integers from $a$ to $b$, which is $b - a + 1$. So the number of integers from $100$ to $200$ is $200 - 100 + 1 = 101$.

Assistant:

Interesting, let's analyze step by step:



The equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has 4 distinct solutions. The right hand side, $\frac{m}{100}$, is a positive number and approaches 0 as $m$ approaches 0, and approaches infinity as $m$ approaches infinity. The left hand side, $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert$, is a positive number and achieves its minimum value of 1 when $x = 3$ or $x = -1$. Thus, there must be a positive integer $m$ such that $\frac{m}{100} = 1$, i.e., $m = 100$.

Now, let's use sympy to verify this:

```python


INTERMEDIATE OUT :

from sympy import symbols, Eq, solve

def find_m():
    m = symbols('m')
    equation = Eq(m/100, 1)

The value of $m$ that makes the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ have 4 distinct solutions is 100. This is a positive integer, so we have found the correct value of $m$.

Interesting, let's analyze step by step:



In order to have four distinct solutions, the right-hand side of the equation must be strictly between 0 and 2. That is, $0<\frac{m}{100}<2$, which implies $0<m<200$. Also, $m$ must be an integer, so the possible values of $m$ are $1, 2, ..., 199$.

Now, we need to check how many of these values make the equation have four distinct solutions. This is a time-consuming process, but we can use sympy to speed things up. Here's a step-by-step solution:

```python


INTERMEDIATE OUT :

from sympy import symbols, solve, Eq

def count_solutions():
    x, m = symbols('x m')
    count = 0

    for m_value in range(1, 200):

        solutions = solve(equation, x)

            count += 1

    return count

result = count_solutions()
print(result)
```

The correct output should be $100$. Let's retrace the steps and correct the mistakes.

The mistake was in the code. We are iterating over the range $1$ to $199$ but then dividing by $100$ in the equation. Let's correct this.

```python

Interesting, let's analyze step by step:



1. We are given the equation $| |x - 1| - 2 | = \frac{m}{100}$ and we want to find how many positive integer values of $m$ make this equation have 4 distinct solutions.

2. To solve this, we first note that the right-hand side of the equation, $\frac{m}{100}$, must be a positive number since $m$ is a positive integer. This implies that $m$ must be a positive integer.

3. Now, let's analyze the left-hand side of the equation, $| |x - 1| - 2 |$. This expression is equal to a positive number, say $\frac{m}{100}$. This means that $|x - 1| - 2 = \pm\frac{m}{100}$.

4. We can break this down into two cases: $|x - 1| - 2 = \frac{m}{100}$ and $|x - 1| - 2 = -\frac{m}{100}$.

5. For the first case, $|x - 1| - 2 = \frac{m}{100}$, we can rewrite this as $|x - 1| = 2 + \frac{m}{100}$. The absolute value equation can be split into two separate equations: $x - 1 = 2 + \frac{m}{100}$ and $x - 1 = -(2 + \frac{m}{100})$.

6. Solving the first equation $x - 1 = 2 + \frac{m}{100}$, we get $x = 3 + \frac{m}{100}$.

7. Solving the second equation $x - 1 = -(2 + \frac{m}{100})$, we get $x = -1 - \frac{m}{100}$.

8. For the second case, $|x - 1| - 2 = -\frac{m}{100}$, we can rewrite this as $|x - 1| = 2 - \frac{m}{100}$. The absolute value equation can be split into two separate equations: $x - 1 = 2 - \frac{m}{100}$ and $x - 1 = -(2 - \frac{m}{100})$.

9. Solving the first equation $x - 1 = 2 - \frac{m}{100}$, we get $x = 3 - \frac{m}{100}$.

10. Solving the second equation $x - 1 = -(2 - \frac{m}{100})$, we get $x = -1 + \frac{m}{100}$.

11. Now, to have 4 distinct solutions, the expressions $3 + \frac{m}{100}$, $-1 - \frac{m}{100}$, $3 - \frac{m}{100}$, and $-1 + \frac{m}{100}$ must be distinct.

12. Comparing the expressions, we can see that $3 + \frac{m}{100}$ and $3 - \frac{m}{100}$ cannot be equal, and $-1 - \frac{m}{100}$ and $-1 + \frac{m}{100}$ cannot be equal. The only way for these four expressions to be distinct is if $\frac{m}{100} > 2$.

13. This implies that $m > 200$. The smallest value of $m$ that satisfies this condition is $m = 201$.

14. To find out how many positive integer values of $m$ satisfy this condition, we simply need to find how many positive integers are greater than 200. The number of such integers is infinite.

However, we are asked to find the number of positive integer values of $m$ that make the equation have exactly 4 distinct solutions. This means we need to find the specific positive integer value of $m$ that makes the equation have exactly 4 distinct solutions.

15. By trying different values of $m$ greater than 200, we can see that $m = 201$ is the value that makes the equation have exactly 4 distinct solutions.

16. Therefore, the number of positive integer values of $m$ that make the equation have 4 distinct solutions is 1. This is a positive integer.

The answer is: 1.
The value of $m$ that makes the equation have exactly 4 distinct solutions is 201.
However, as per the problem statement, we are asked to find the number of positive integer values of $m$ that make the equation have 4 distinct solutions. We have found that there is only one such value, namely $m = 201$. Therefore, the number of positive integer values of $m$ that make the equation have 4 distinct solutions is 1. This is a positive integer, as required.
The value of the positive integer is 1.
The answer is: 1
