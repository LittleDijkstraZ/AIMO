"For how many positive integers $m$ does the equation \[\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}\] have $4$ distinct solutions?"
Write comments to indicate the steps you take. Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Approach:


We know that the equation $|\vert x-1 \vert -2|=\frac{m}{100}$ has $4$ distinct solutions,
so the right side of the equation must be a positive number.
Thus, we have $\frac{m}{100} > 0$, which implies $m > 0$.

Now, we consider the equation $|\vert x-1 \vert -2|=\frac{m}{100}$.

When $\vert x-1 \vert -2 > 0$, we have $\vert x-1 \vert -2 = \frac{m}{100}$.
Solving this equation gives $\vert x-1 \vert = 2 + \frac{m}{100}$.
Taking the absolute value inside the left side gives two separate equations:

1) $x - 1 = 2 + \frac{m}{100}$ and 
2) $-(x - 1) = 2 + \frac{m}{100}$.

Solving these equations gives the solutions:

1) $x = 3 + \frac{m}{100}$ and 
2) $x = -1 + \frac{m}{100}$.

Now, we need these two solutions to be distinct. This means $3 + \frac{m}{100} \neq -1 + \frac{m}{100}$,
which simplifies to $4 \neq 0$. This is always true, so these two solutions are distinct.

Similarly, when $\vert x-1 \vert -2 < 0$, we have $-( \vert x-1 \vert -2) = \frac{m}{100}$,
which simplifies to $\vert x-1 \vert -2 = -\frac{m}{100}$.

Solving this equation gives $\vert x-1 \vert = 2 - \frac{m}{100}$.
Taking the absolute value inside the left side gives two separate equations:

3) $x - 1 = 2 - \frac{m}{100}$ and 
4) $-(x - 1) = 2 - \frac{m}{100}$.

Solving these equations gives the solutions:

3) $x = 3 - \frac{m}{100}$ and 
4) $x = -1 + \frac{m}{100}$.

Again, we need these two solutions to be distinct. This means $3 - \frac{m}{100} \neq -1 + \frac{m}{100}$,
which simplifies to $4 \neq 0$. This is always true, so these two solutions are also distinct.

In conclusion, the equation $|\vert x-1 \vert -2|=\frac{m}{100}$ has four distinct solutions for all positive integers $m$.

However, we need to find the number of such positive integers $m$ that make the right side of the equation positive and equal to a positive number.
This means $0 < \frac{m}{100} < 2$, or equivalently, $0 < m < 200$.

The positive integers $m$ that satisfy this condition are $1, 2, 3, \ldots, 199$.

So, the number of such positive integers $m$ is $199$.
The answer is: $199$

Approach:


The equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has $4$ distinct solutions, which means that the right side $\frac{m}{100}$ must be in the range $(0,2)$.
The range of $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert$ is $[0,2]$.
Therefore, we must have $0 < \frac{m}{100} < 2$, which implies $0 < m < 200$.

The positive integers $m$ that satisfy this inequality are $1, 2, \ldots, 199$.

Counting the number of these positive integers, we find that there are $199$ values of $m$.

So the number of positive integers $m$ that satisfy the condition is $199$. The answer is: $199$

Approach:


To find the number of positive integers $m$ for which the equation $| |x-1| -2| = \frac{m}{100}$ has four distinct solutions, we need to analyze the properties of the equation.

The right side of the equation, $\frac{m}{100}$, is a positive number since $m$ is a positive integer. The left side, $| |x-1| -2|$, is a piecewise function with four cases to consider based on the value of $|x-1|$.

1. If $|x-1| \leq 2$, then $| |x-1| -2| = 2 - |x-1|$.
2. If $2 < |x-1| < 3$, then $| |x-1| -2| = |x-1| - 2$.
3. If $|x-1| \geq 3$, then $| |x-1| -2| = |x-1| - 2$.

For the equation $| |x-1| -2| = \frac{m}{100}$ to have four distinct solutions, we need to find the values of $m$ for which the right side, $\frac{m}{100}$, falls into the ranges where the left side has four distinct solutions.

From the piecewise function analysis, we find that the left side has four distinct solutions when:

1. $\frac{m}{100} \in (0, 2)$,
2. $\frac{m}{100} \in (2, 3)$, or
3. $\frac{m}{100} \in (3, +\infty)$.

For the first case, $\frac{m}{100} \in (0, 2)$, we have $0 < m < 200$.
For the second case, $\frac{m}{100} \in (2, 3)$, we have $200 < m < 300$.
For the third case, $\frac{m}{100} \in (3, +\infty)$, we have $300 < m$.

Combining these ranges, we find that the positive integers $m$ for which the equation has four distinct solutions are $m \in \{1, 2, \dots, 199, 201, 202, \dots, 299, 301, 302, \dots \}$.

To find the number of such positive integers $m$, we can find the number of positive integers in each range and sum them up. The number of positive integers in the range $1 \leq m \leq 199$ is $199$, the number of positive integers in the range $201 \leq m \leq 299$ is $99$, and there are no positive integers in the range $m \geq 300$.

Therefore, the total number of positive integers $m$ for which the equation has four distinct solutions is $199 + 99 = 298$.
The answer is: $298$

Approach:


The equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has 4 distinct solutions if and only if $\frac{m}{100}$ is strictly between 1 and 2. This is because the expression inside the absolute value, $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert$, takes on the values of 0, 1, 2, and 3 for 4 distinct values of $x$, and these values correspond to the values of $\frac{m}{100}$ strictly between 1 and 2.

Therefore, we want to find the number of positive integers $m$ such that $1 < \frac{m}{100} < 2$. Multiplying all sides of the inequalities by 100 gives $100 < m < 200$. The number of positive integers in this range is $200 - 100 - 1 = 99$.

```python

def count_m():
    return 200 - 100 - 1

result = count_m()

The number of positive integers $m$ for which the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has 4 distinct solutions is 99.

Assistant:

Approach:


We want the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ to have $4$ distinct solutions.
This equation is equivalent to a piecewise function with four cases:
1. If $\vert x-1 \vert -2 \geq 0$, then the equation becomes $\vert x-1 \vert -2 = \frac{m}{100}$.
2. If $\vert x-1 \vert -2 < 0$, then the equation becomes $-( \vert x-1 \vert -2) = \frac{m}{100}$.

Now, we need to solve these two equations and find the number of integer values of $m$ for which there are $4$ distinct solutions.

For the first equation $\vert x-1 \vert -2 = \frac{m}{100}$, we can rewrite it as $\vert x-1 \vert = 2 + \frac{m}{100}$.
This implies two sub-cases:

a. If $x-1 \geq 0$, then $x-1 = 2 + \frac{m}{100}$, which gives $x = 3 + \frac{m}{100}$.
b. If $x-1 < 0$, then $-(x-1) = 2 + \frac{m}{100}$, which gives $x = -1 + \frac{m}{100}$.

Similarly, for the second equation $-( \vert x-1 \vert -2) = \frac{m}{100}$, we can rewrite it as $\vert x-1 \vert = 2 - \frac{m}{100}$.
This implies two sub-cases:

c. If $x-1 \geq 0$, then $x-1 = 2 - \frac{m}{100}$, which gives $x = 3 - \frac{m}{100}$.
d. If $x-1 < 0$, then $-(x-1) = 2 - \frac{m}{100}$, which gives $x = -1 - \frac{m}{100}$.

Now we need to find the number of integer values of $m$ for which the equations a, b, c, and d have 4 distinct solutions.

For each of the four equations, we need to find the range of $m$ for which there are 4 distinct solutions.

After analyzing the solutions for each equation, we find that the only value of $m$ for which all four equations have 4 distinct solutions is $m = 100$.
Therefore, there is only one value of $m$ for which the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has 4 distinct solutions, and that value is $m = 100$.
The answer is: $1$

Approach:



The equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has 4 distinct solutions if and only if $\frac{m}{100}$ is a positive number less than 2 but greater than or equal to 0. This is because the expression inside the absolute value, $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert$, oscillates between 0 and 4, and we want $\frac{m}{100}$ to be a part of this range.

We can write this as the inequality $0 \leq \frac{m}{100} < 2$.

To find the values of $m$ that satisfy this inequality, we can multiply all parts of the inequality by 100: $0 \leq m < 200$.

So, the possible values of $m$ are the integers from 0 to 199, inclusive.

But we need to find the number of these integers that divide 100 evenly. This is equivalent to finding the number of divisors of 200.

The prime factorization of 200 is $2^3 \cdot 5^2$. The number of divisors is then $(3+1)(2+1) = 4 \cdot 3 = 12$.

So, there are 12 positive integers $m$ for which the equation has 4 distinct solutions.
The answer is: $12$

Approach:



The equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has 4 distinct solutions if and only if $\frac{m}{100}$ is strictly between 1 and 2. This is because the expression inside the absolute value, $\vert x-1 \vert -2$, can take on any value in the range $(-2, 1)$, and thus $\frac{m}{100}$ must be in the range $(1, 2)$.

To find the number of such positive integers $m$, we can multiply the inequality $1 < \frac{m}{100} < 2$ by 100 to get $100 < m < 200$. The positive integers $m$ in this range are the integers from 101 to 199, inclusive. To find the number of such integers, we can subtract the smallest integer in the range from the largest integer in the range and add 1. This gives us $199 - 101 + 1 = 99$.
The answer is: $99$

Approach:


The equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has $4$ distinct solutions, it means that $\frac{m}{100}$ is the distance between two branches of the graph $y = \vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert$. The graph $y = \vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert$ has two branches which are parallel to x-axis and are distance $1$ apart from each other. Therefore, the value of $\frac{m}{100}$ should be $1$ for the equation to have $4$ distinct solutions. So we get $\frac{m}{100} = 1$, and solving for $m$ gives $m = 100$.

Checking:
Substitute $m = 100$ into the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ to get $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=1$. This equation has $4$ distinct solutions: $x = -1, 3, 5, 7$.

Therefore, the number of positive integer $m$ for which the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has $4$ distinct solutions is $1$. So the answer is $1$. The answer is: $1$

The equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has 4 distinct solutions, it means that the expression inside the absolute value, $\vert x-1 \vert -2$, crosses the x-axis 4 times. This occurs when $\vert x-1 \vert -2 = 0$, $\vert x-1 \vert -2 = \frac{m}{100}$, $\vert x-1 \vert -2 = - \frac{m}{100}$, and $\vert x-1 \vert -2 = 2 - \frac{m}{100}$. 

For $\vert x-1 \vert -2 = 0$, we get $\vert x-1 \vert = 2$, which implies $x-1 = 2$ or $x-1 = -2$. So, $x = 3$ or $x = -1$.

For $\vert x-1 \vert -2 = \frac{m}{100}$, we get $\vert x-1 \vert = 2 + \frac{m}{100}$, which implies $x-1 = 2 + \frac{m}{100}$ or $x-1 = -2 - \frac{m}{100}$. So, $x = 3 + \frac{m}{100}$ or $x = -1 - \frac{m}{100}$.

For $\vert x-1 \vert -2 = - \frac{m}{100}$, we get $\vert x-1 \vert = 2 - \frac{m}{100}$, which implies $x-1 = 2 - \frac{m}{100}$ or $x-1 = -2 + \frac{m}{100}$. So, $x = 3 - \frac{m}{100}$ or $x = -1 + \frac{m}{100}$.

For $\vert x-1 \vert -2 = 2 - \frac{m}{100}$, we get $\vert x-1 \vert = 4 - \frac{m}{100}$, which implies $x-1 = 4 - \frac{m}{100}$ or $x-1 = -4 + \frac{m}{100}$. So, $x = 5 - \frac{m}{100}$ or $x = -3 + \frac{m}{100}$.

The 4 distinct solutions are: $x = 3$, $x = -1$, $x = 3 + \frac{m}{100}$, $x = -1 - \frac{m}{100}$, $x = 3 - \frac{m}{100}$, $x = -1 + \frac{m}{100}$, $x = 5 - \frac{m}{100}$, and $x = -3 + \frac{m}{100}$.

To have 4 distinct solutions, we need to ensure that none of the solutions overlap. This happens when the expressions inside the absolute values are equal to each other at specific values of $x$. 

Setting $3 + \frac{m}{100} = -1 - \frac{m}{100}$, we get $\frac{m}{100} = -2$, which implies $m = -200$. But $m$ must be positive, so this is not a valid solution.

Setting $3 + \frac{m}{100} = 3 - \frac{m}{100}$, we get $\frac{m}{100} = 0$, which implies $m = 0$. But $m$ must be positive, so this is not a valid solution.

Setting $-1 - \frac{m}{100} = -1 + \frac{m}{100}$, we get $\frac{m}{100} = 0$, which implies $m = 0$. But $m$ must be positive, so this is not a valid solution.

Setting $3 - \frac{m}{100} = -1 + \frac{m}{100}$, we get $\frac{m}{100} = 2$, which implies $m = 200$.

Setting $5 - \frac{m}{100} = -3 + \frac{m}{100}$, we get $\frac{m}{100} = 4$, which implies $m = 400$.

So, the only positive integer $m$ for which the equation has 4 distinct solutions is $m = 200$ or $m = 400$. However, since the question asks for the number of such $m$, the answer is 2. The value of $m$ for which the equation has 4 distinct solutions is 2. The answer is: $2$

1. First, we need to understand that the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has four distinct solutions if and only if $\frac{m}{100} = 2$.

2. This is because the expression $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert$ oscillates between 0 and 4, and it is equal to 2 exactly twice.

3. To find the value of $m$, we multiply both sides of the equation $\frac{m}{100} = 2$ by 100 to get $m = 200$.

4. Thus, there is only one positive integer $m$ for which the equation has four distinct solutions, and that value is 200.

We need to find the number of positive integers $m$ for which the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has 4 distinct solutions.
Let's start by analyzing the equation.
The expression $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has 4 distinct solutions if and only if $\frac{m}{100}$ is strictly between 0 and 2. This is because the function $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert$ oscillates between 0 and 2.
So we have $0 < \frac{m}{100} < 2$.
Multiplying through by 100 gives $0 < m < 200$.
The positive integers $m$ that satisfy this inequality are 1, 2, ..., 199.
So there are 199 positive integers $m$ for which the equation has 4 distinct solutions. The answer is: $199$

Assistant:

Approach:

 The equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has 4 distinct solutions if and only if $\frac{m}{100}$ is in the interval $(0, 2)$. Therefore, we want to find the number of positive integers $m$ such that $\frac{m}{100} \in (0, 2)$. This is equivalent to finding the number of positive integers $m$ in the interval $(0, 200)$. 

The number of positive integers in the interval $(0, 200)$ is $200$. However, we must subtract 1 because $m$ cannot be 0 (since it's in the denominator of $\frac{m}{100}$). So the number of positive integers $m$ such that the equation has 4 distinct solutions is $200 - 1 = 199$.

So, the number of positive integers $m$ such that the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has 4 distinct solutions is 199. The answer is: $199$
