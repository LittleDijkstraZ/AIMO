Approach:


The equation $f(x,y) = 0$ implies that either $f(x,y) = 0$ or $g(x,y) = 0$, where $f(x,y) = ((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)$ and $g(x,y) = ((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2)$.
If $f(x,y) = 0$, then $|x+y| = 10$ and $|x-y| = 10$. This implies that $x+y = \pm 10$ and $x-y = \pm 10$. Solving these equations gives us the vertices of the polygon as $(0,10)$, $(0,-10)$, $(10,0)$, $(-10,0)$, $(8,8)$, $(8,-8)$, $(-8,8)$, and $(-8,-8)$.
If $g(x,y) = 0$, then $|x| = 8$ and $|y| = 8$. This implies that $x = \pm 8$ and $y = \pm 8$. Solving these equations gives us the vertices of the polygon as $(8,8)$, $(8,-8)$, $(-8,8)$, and $(-8,-8)$.

Therefore, the vertices of the polygon are $(0,10)$, $(0,-10)$, $(10,0)$, $(-10,0)$, $(8,8)$, $(8,-8)$, $(-8,8)$, and $(-8,-8)$.
The polygon is a square with side length 10. The area of a square is given by the square of the length of its side. So, the area of this square is $10^2 = 100$. The answer is: $100$

"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"

Approach:

 The given equation is equal to zero, which means that at least one of the factors must be zero. Let's analyze the two factors separately.

1. The first factor is: $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)$. This factor equals to zero if and only if both $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ and $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$, which implies $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. The absolute value equations can be written as two separate equations: $x + y = \pm10$ and $x - y = \pm10$.

2. The second factor is: $((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2)$. This factor equals to zero if and only if both $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ and $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$, which implies $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$. The absolute value equations can be written as two separate equations: $x = \pm8$ and $y = \pm8$.

Now, let's find the intersection points of these equations. The intersections of $x + y = \pm10$ and $x = \pm8$ give us four points: $(8,2)$, $(8,-2)$, $(-8,2)$, and $(-8,-2)$. The intersections of $x - y = \pm10$ and $y = \pm8$ give us four more points: $(2,8)$, $(-2,8)$, $(2,-8)$, and $(-2,-8)$.

The eight points form a square with side length of $10$. The area of the square is side length squared, which is $10^2 = 100$.

Therefore, the area of the convex polygon is $100$.

The answer is: $100$

Solve the following problem with a Python Script (positive numerical answer):
"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"

Approach:


The given equation is $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + (\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + (\vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$.
For the product of two numbers to be zero, one or both of the numbers must be zero. Therefore, we have two cases:
1) $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + (\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2) = 0$
2) $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + (\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$

For the first case, we have $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + (\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$.
This implies that $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$.
This forms a square with side length 10. The area of this square is $10^2 = 100$.

For the second case, we have $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + (\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$.
This implies that $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$.
This forms a square with side length 8. The area of this square is $8^2 = 64$.

Therefore, the area of the convex polygon is the sum of the areas of the two squares, which is $100 + 64 = 164$.

The answer is: $\boxed{164}$

Solve the following problem with a Python Script (positive numerical answer):
"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"

Approach:


The expression $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2)$ equals to zero if and only if at least one of the factors equals to zero. This gives us two cases:
1. $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$.
2. Both factors are zero.

In the first case, it's easy to see that both factors can only be zero if $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$, which means $x$ and $y$ are in the interval $[-8, 8]$.

In the second case, we have $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ and $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$. This implies that $\vert x + y \vert = 10$, $\vert x - y \vert = 10$, $\vert x \vert = 8$, and $\vert y \vert = 8$. Solving these equations gives us $x = \pm 8$ and $y = \pm 8$, which corresponds to the vertices of a square with side length 16.

Therefore, the points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying the equation form a square with side length 16. The area of this square is $16^2 = 256$. The answer is: $\boxed{256}$

Approach:


The given equation is a product of two expressions, and it equals to zero. This means that either of the expressions has to be zero for the equation to hold. 
So we have two sets of equations to solve:
1. $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ and $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ and $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$
2. $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ and $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ and $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$

For the first set of equations, we have:
1. $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$
2. $\vert x - y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$

From these equations, we can deduce the coordinates of the vertices of the polygon:
1. For the first set of equations, the vertices are $(8, 2)$, $(8, -2)$, $(6, 8)$, $(-6, 8)$.
2. For the second set of equations, the vertices are $(8, 2)$, $(8, -2)$, $(-6, 8)$, $(6, -8)$.

Now we can calculate the area of the polygon using the Shoelace formula:
If the vertices of a polygon are $(x_1, y_1), (x_2, y_2), ..., (x_n, y_n)$, then the area of the polygon is given by:
$$\frac{1}{2} \vert (x_1y_2 + x_2y_3 + ... + x_ny_1) - (y_1x_2 + y_2x_3 + ... + y_nx_1) \vert$$

By calculating the area of the polygon with vertices $(8, 2)$, $(8, -2)$, $(6, 8)$, $(-6, 8)$, we get:
$$\frac{1}{2} \vert (8 \cdot -2 + 8 \cdot 8 + 6 \cdot 2 + -6 \cdot 8) - (2 \cdot 8 + -2 \cdot 8 + 8 \cdot 6 + -8 \cdot -6) \vert = 96 - 96 = 0$$

And by calculating the area of the polygon with vertices $(8, 2)$, $(8, -2)$, $(-6, 8)$, $(6, -8)$, we get:
$$\frac{1}{2} \vert (8 \cdot -2 + 8 \cdot -8 + -6 \cdot 2 + 6 \cdot 8) - (2 \cdot 8 + -2 \cdot 8 + -8 \cdot -6 + 8 \cdot 6) \vert = 0$$

So the area of the polygon is 0. However, this doesn't make sense in the context of the problem. The area of a polygon cannot be 0.

Upon further inspection, we realize that the vertices obtained from the second set of equations do not form a valid polygon. The vertices obtained from the first set of equations form a square with side length 10. The area of this square is indeed 100.

So the area of the convex polygon is 100. The answer is: 100

Approach:


The equation $A \cdot B = 0$ is satisfied if and only if $A = 0$ or $B = 0$. So, the given equation is equivalent to either $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$.
The first equation is satisfied if and only if $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. This is the set of points that form a square with side length $20$.
The second equation is satisfied if and only if $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$. This is the set of points that form a square with side length $16$.
Combining the two cases, the points that satisfy the given equation are those that lie either inside the $20 \times 20$ square or inside the $16 \times 16$ square.
However, since the intersection of these two squares is non-empty, we must take the union of the two squares to obtain the convex polygon.
The area of the convex polygon is the sum of the areas of the two squares, which is $20^2 + 16^2 = 400 + 256 = 656$. The answer is: $656$

Approach:

 The given equation is a product of two expressions equal to zero, which means that either one of the expressions is zero or both are zero. We can analyze each expression separately.

1. $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ implies $\vert x + y \vert = 10$. This gives us the lines $x + y = 10$ and $x + y = -10$.

2. $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ implies $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. This gives us the lines $x - y = 10$ and $x - y = -10$.

3. $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ implies $\vert x \vert = 8$, which gives us the lines $x = 8$ and $x = -8$.

4. $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ implies $\vert y \vert = 8$, which gives us the lines $y = 8$ and $y = -8$.

These lines form a rectangle with vertices at $(8,8)$, $(8,-8)$, $(-8,8)$, and $(-8,-8)$. The length of the rectangle is $16$ and the width is $16$, so the area of the rectangle is $16 \times 16 = 256$. The answer is: $256$

Approach:


The given equation is a product of two expressions equal to zero, so either the first expression is zero or the second expression is zero. This means that either of the two sets of absolute value equations must be true for the equation to hold true.

Let's solve each set of absolute value equations separately:

1. For the first set:
$$(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$$
Since both squares are nonnegative, their sum can only be zero if both squares are zero. That means:
$$\vert x + y \vert = 10$$
$$\vert x - y \vert = 10$$
These equations represent a square with side length 10. The vertices of the square are $(0, 10), (0, -10), (10, 0),$ and $(-10, 0)$.

2. For the second set:
$$(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$$
Using the same reasoning as above, we find:
$$\vert x \vert = 8$$
$$\vert y \vert = 8$$
These equations represent a square with side length 16 centered at the origin. The vertices of this square are $(8, 0), (-8, 0), (0, 8),$ and $(0, -8)$.

The intersection of these two squares is the convex polygon we are looking for. The area of the intersection of two squares is the area of the smaller square, which has side length 10 (the side length of the smaller square is the minimum of the side lengths of the two squares). Therefore, the area of the convex polygon is:
$$\text{Area} = \text{side length}^2 = 10^2 = 100.$$

The answer is: $\boxed{100}$
