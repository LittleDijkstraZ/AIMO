Below is a math problem you are to solve (positive numerical answer):
"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"

To accomplish this:
- List the variables and known values from the problem.
- Outline the steps using sympy to solve the problem:
  * Identify the sympy functions required for each step.
  * Implement these functions step-by-step, commenting each line for clarity.
- Calculate the final answer and verify it's a positive integer.
- Output the result within \boxed{}.

Interesting, let's analyze step by step:



The equation $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + (\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + (\vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ is satisfied only when both $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ and $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ and $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ and $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$.

This implies that $\vert x + y \vert = 10$, $\vert x - y \vert = 10$, $\vert x \vert = 8$, and $\vert y \vert = 8$.

Solving these equations, we get the four vertices of the square as $(8, 8)$, $(8, -8)$, $(-8, 8)$, and $(-8, -8)$.

The side length of the square is 16, so the area is $16^2 = 256$.

The answer is: $256$

The equation $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + (\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + (\vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ is satisfied only when both $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ and $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ and $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ and $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$. This implies that $\vert x + y \vert = 10$, $\vert x - y \vert = 10$, $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$.

The solutions to $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ are $x + y = 10$ and $x + y = -10$. The solutions to $\vert x - y \vert = 10$ are $x - y = 10$ and $x - y = -10$. The solutions to $\vert x \vert = 8$ are $x = 8$ and $x = -8$. The solutions to $\vert y \vert = 8$ are $y = 8$ and $y = -8$.

The intersection of all these solutions gives us the vertices of the polygon: $(8, 2)$, $(8, -2)$, $(-8, 2)$, $(-8, -2)$, $(2, 8)$, $(-2, 8)$, $(2, -8)$, and $(-2, -8)$.

Now we can plot these points on a graph and observe that they form a square with side length $16$. The area of this square is $16^2 = 256$.

Therefore, the area of the convex polygon is $256$. The answer is: $256$

Interesting, let's analyze step by step:



The equation $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + (\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + (\vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ is satisfied if and only if at least one of the factors is zero. This happens if and only if at least one of the following conditions is met:

1. $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$, which implies $\vert x + y \vert = 10$.
2. $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$, which implies $\vert x - y \vert = 10$.
3. $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$, which implies $\vert x \vert = 8$.
4. $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$, which implies $\vert y \vert = 8$.

The solutions to these equations are the vertices of the polygon. The polygon is a square with side length 16 (since the absolute values of x and y are both 8). The area of the square is $16^2 = 256$.

So, the area of the convex polygon is 256. The answer is: $256$

Interesting, let's analyze step by step:



The equation given is a product of two terms equal to zero. This means that either the first term is zero or the second term is zero. So, we have two cases to consider:

1. $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ and $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$.
2. $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ and $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$.

For the first case, we have $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. This means that the points $(x, y)$ lie on the lines $x + y = 10$ and $x - y = 10$.

For the second case, we have $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$. This means that the points $(x, y)$ lie on the lines $x = 8$ and $y = 8$.

The intersection of these lines form a square with side length 10 (from the first case) and vertices at $(8, 8), (8, -8), (-8, 8),$ and $(-8, -8)$.

The area of this square is $10^2 = 100$.

So, the area of the convex polygon is 100.
The answer is: $100$

Interesting, let's analyze step by step:



The equation is given as:
$$((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0.$$

This equation equals to zero if either of the two factors equals to zero. Hence, we have two sets of equations:

1. $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ and $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$.
2. $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ and $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$.

From the first set of equations, we have $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x \vert = 8$, $\vert y \vert = 8$. This gives us a square with side length 16.

From the second set of equations, we have $\vert x - y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x \vert = 8$, $\vert y \vert = 8$. This also gives us a square with side length 16.

The union of these two squares forms a larger square with side length 20 (the maximum of 16 and 10). The area of this square is $20^2 = 400$.

So, the area of the convex polygon is 400. The answer is: $400$

Interesting, let's analyze step by step:



The equation is $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + (\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + (\vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$.

This equation equals zero if either of the two terms equals zero. So we have two cases:

1. $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + (\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2) = 0$. This implies $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$.
2. $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + (\vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$. This implies $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$.

From the first case, we have $x + y = \pm 10$ and $x - y = \pm 10$. Solving these equations gives us the vertices of the polygon: $(5,5)$, $(5,-5)$, $(-5,5)$, and $(-5,-5)$.

From the second case, we have $x = \pm 8$ and $y = \pm 8$. Solving these equations gives us the vertices of the polygon: $(8,0)$, $(0,8)$, $(-8,0)$, and $(0,-8)$.

The polygon is a square with side length 10. To find its area, we simply square the length of its side: $10^2 = 100$.

So the area of the convex polygon is 100.
The answer is: $100$

Interesting, let's analyze step by step:



The equation given is a product of two terms equal to zero, which means either of the terms must be zero. This gives us two separate cases to consider:

1. $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$.
2. $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$.

For the first case, we have $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ or $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. This gives us four lines in the coordinate plane: $x + y = 10$, $x + y = -10$, $x - y = 10$, and $x - y = -10$.

For the second case, we have $\vert x \vert = 8$ or $\vert y \vert = 8$. This gives us four lines in the coordinate plane: $x = 8$, $x = -8$, $y = 8$, and $y = -8$.

The intersection of these lines form a square with side length 10 (from $x + y = \pm 10$ and $x = \pm 8$) and vertices at $(8, 2)$, $(8, -2)$, $(-8, -2)$, and $(-8, 2)$.

The area of this square is $10^2 = 100$. Since the area is a positive integer, we can conclude that the area of the convex polygon is 100. The answer is: $100$

Interesting, let's analyze step by step:



The equation is given as:
$$((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$$

This equation equals to zero if and only if either of the two factors equals to zero. Therefore, we have two sets of equations:

1. $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ and $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ and $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$.
2. $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ and $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ and $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$.

From the first set of equations, we have $\vert x + y \vert = 10$, $\vert x \vert = 8$, and $\vert y \vert = 8$. This implies $-8 \leq x, y \leq 8$.

From the second set of equations, we have $\vert x - y \vert = 10$, $\vert x \vert = 8$, and $\vert y \vert = 8$. This implies that one of $x$ and $y$ is $8$ and the other is $-8$.

Therefore, the points $(x, y)$ that satisfy the equation are the vertices of a square with side length $16$. The area of this square is $16^2 = 256$.

So the area of the convex polygon is $256$. The answer is: $256$
