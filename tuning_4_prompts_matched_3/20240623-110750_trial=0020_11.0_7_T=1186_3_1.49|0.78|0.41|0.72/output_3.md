Solve the following problem with a Python Script (positive numerical answer):
"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"

Approach:

 The equation $A \cdot B = 0$ implies that $A = 0$ or $B = 0$. Thus the problem can be simplified to finding the points where each of the factors is zero separately.

The factors are:
1. $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2) = 0$
2. $((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$

For the first factor to be zero, we need both $\vert x + y \vert - 10 = 0$ and $\vert x - y \vert - 10 = 0$. Solving these gives $x + y = 10$ and $x - y = 10$ or $x + y = 10$ and $x - y = -10$. Simplifying the equations gives $y = 0$ and $x = 10$ or $y = -x$ and $x = 0$. Thus the points satisfying the first factor are (10, 0) and (0, 0).

For the second factor to be zero, we need both $\vert x \vert - 8 = 0$ and $\vert y \vert - 8 = 0$. This gives $x = \pm 8$ and $y = \pm 8$. So the points satisfying the second factor are (8, 8), (8, -8), (-8, 8), and (-8, -8).

Now we plot these points on the coordinate plane and connect them to form a square with side length 10. The area of this square is $10^2 = 100$. So the area of the convex polygon is 100. The answer is: $100$

Solve the following problem with a Python Script (positive numerical answer):
"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"

Approach:


The equation $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ is satisfied when either of the factors is zero.

1. If $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$, then both $\vert x + y \vert - 10 = 0$ and $\vert x - y \vert - 10 = 0$, which implies $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. This forms a square with side length 10.

2. If $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$, then both $\vert x \vert - 8 = 0$ and $\vert y \vert - 8 = 0$, which implies $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$. This forms a square with side length 16.

The area of the polygon is the area of the square with side length 10. The area of a square is given by side length squared, so the area of this square is $10^2 = 100$.

So, the area of the convex polygon is 100 square units. The answer is: $100$

Solve the following problem with a Python Script (positive numerical answer):
"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"
Write comments to indicate the steps you take. Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Assistant:

Approach:



The given equation is a product of two terms being equal to zero. Therefore, either $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$, $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$, $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$, or $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$.

This implies that $\vert x + y \vert = 10$, $\vert x - y \vert = 10$, $\vert x \vert = 8$, or $\vert y \vert = 8$.

The absolute value equations translate to the following four sets of equations:

1) $x + y = 10$ and $x - y = 10$,
2) $x + y = -10$ and $x - y = 10$,
3) $x + y = 10$ and $x - y = -10$,
4) $x + y = -10$ and $x - y = -10$,
5) $x = 8$ and $y = 8$,
6) $x = -8$ and $y = 8$,
7) $x = 8$ and $y = -8$,
8) $x = -8$ and $y = -8$.

Solving these systems of equations, we get the following vertices of the polygon:

1) (10, 0),
2) (-10, 0),
3) (0, 10),
4) (0, -10),
5) (8, 8),
6) (-8, 8),
7) (8, -8),
8) (-8, -8).

Plotting these points on a coordinate plane, we recognize that the points form a square with side length $20$.

The area of a square is given by the square of its side length, so the area of this square is $20^2 = 400$. The answer is: $400$.

Approach:


The equation involves absolute values, which can be tricky to work with. Instead of directly solving for the area of the polygon, let's first consider the conditions under which the equation would be satisfied. The equation $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ must be satisfied for the equation to be true. The first equation is satisfied only when $|x+y|=10$ and $|x-y|=10$. The second equation is satisfied only when $|x|=8$ and $|y|=8$. 
These conditions imply that the points lie on the lines $x+y=10$, $x+y=-10$, $x-y=10$, $x-y=-10$, $x=8$, $x=-8$, $y=8$, and $y=-8$. These lines form a square with side length 10. The area of this square is simply side length squared, so the area is $10^2 = 100$.

Therefore, the area of the convex polygon is 100 square units. The answer is: $100$

Solve the following problem with a Python Script (positive numerical answer):
"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"

Approach:



This problem is a system of equations that consists of two products equal to zero. We know that if a product of factors is zero, then at least one of the factors must be zero. So we have two cases to consider.

Case 1: $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$
Case 2: $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$

For Case 1, both terms must be zero. This implies that $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. Solving these equations gives us the lines $x + y = 10$, $x + y = -10$, $x - y = 10$, and $x - y = -10$. These lines form a rectangle with sides of length 10 and 20.

For Case 2, both terms must be zero. This implies that $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$. Solving these equations gives us the lines $x = 8$, $x = -8$, $y = 8$, and $y = -8$. These lines form a square with side length 16.

The area of the rectangle is $10 \times 20 = 200$ square units, and the area of the square is $16 \times 16 = 256$ square units.

To find the area of the convex polygon enclosed by both figures, we need to subtract the overlapping area of the square inside the rectangle. The overlapping area is a smaller square with side length 8, so its area is $8 \times 8 = 64$ square units.

Therefore, the area of the convex polygon is the sum of the areas of the rectangle and the square, minus the overlapping area: $200 + 256 - 64 = 442$ square units. The answer is: $442$

Approach:


The given equation is a product of two expressions equal to zero, so we have two separate cases to consider:
1. $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$.
2. $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$.
For the first case, we have:
$\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$.
This gives us the lines $x + y = 10$ and $x - y = 10$, as well as the lines $x + y = -10$ and $x - y = -10$.
For the second case, we have:
$\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$.
This gives us the lines $x = 8$ and $x = -8$, as well as the lines $y = 8$ and $y = -8$.
The resulting shape is a square with side length 16. To find the area, we simply calculate $16 \times 16 = 256$. So the area of the convex polygon is 256.
The answer is: $256$.

Assistant:

Approach:

 The equation given in the problem is of the form $A \cdot B = 0$, which means that either $A = 0$ or $B = 0$. Therefore, the solutions to the equation are the union of the solutions to $A = 0$ and $B = 0$.

1. For $A = 0$, we have $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$. This implies that $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. These two equations represent two straight lines forming a cross, which enclose a square with side length 20. The area of this square is $20^2 = 400$.

2. For $B = 0$, we have $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$. This implies that $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$. These two equations represent a square with side length 16. The area of this square is $16^2 = 256$.

Since the solutions to the equation given in the problem are the union of the solutions to $A = 0$ and $B = 0$, the points satisfying the equation enclose a convex polygon which is the union of the two squares. Therefore, the area of this convex polygon is the sum of the areas of the two squares, which is $400 + 256 = 656$.

So the area of the convex polygon is 656. The answer is: $656$

Solve the following problem with a Python Script (positive numerical answer):

Approach:


The given equation is of the form $(A)(B) = 0$, which implies that either $A = 0$ or $B = 0$. 
So, we have two cases to consider:
Case 1: $A = (|x+y| - 10)^2 + (|x-y| - 10)^2 = 0$
Case 2: $B = (|x| - 8)^2 + (|y| - 8)^2 = 0$

In Case 1, if $A = 0$, then both $|x+y| - 10 = 0$ and $|x-y| - 10 = 0$.
This implies $|x+y| = 10$ and $|x-y| = 10$.
These conditions imply that the points $(x, y)$ lie on the lines $x + y = 10$, $x + y = -10$, $x - y = 10$, and $x - y = -10$.
These lines form a square with side length 10.

In Case 2, if $B = 0$, then both $|x| - 8 = 0$ and $|y| - 8 = 0$.
This implies $|x| = 8$ and $|y| = 8$.
These conditions imply that the points $(x, y)$ lie on the lines $x = 8$, $x = -8$, $y = 8$, and $y = -8$.
These lines form a square with side length 16.

Comparing the two cases, we see that the square formed by Case 1 has a smaller side length (10) than the square formed by Case 2 (side length 16). Therefore, the convex polygon enclosed by the points $(x, y)$ is the square from Case 1.

The area of a square with side length $s$ is $s^2$. So, the area of the convex polygon is $10^2 = 100$.
The answer is: $100$
