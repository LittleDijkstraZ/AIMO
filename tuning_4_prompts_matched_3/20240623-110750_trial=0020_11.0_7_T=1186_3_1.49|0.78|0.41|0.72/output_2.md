Approach:


The equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has 4 distinct solutions when $\frac{m}{100}$ is equal to one of the distances between the four roots of the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=0$. This equation has four roots: $x = 1 \pm 2$ and $x = 1 \pm 1$. The distances between these roots are 1, 2, and 3. Therefore, $\frac{m}{100}$ must be equal to one of these distances. So $m$ must be one of the numbers $100 \times 1 = 100$, $100 \times 2 = 200$, or $100 \times 3 = 300$. We need to check which of these values of $m$ give us 4 distinct solutions.

Let's take each case one by one:

- For $m=100$, the equation becomes $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{100}{100}=1$, which simplifies to $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=1$. This equation has 4 distinct solutions, so $m=100$ is a valid value.
- For $m=200$, the equation becomes $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{200}{100}=2$, which simplifies to $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=2$. This equation also has 4 distinct solutions, so $m=200$ is also a valid value.
- For $m=300$, the equation becomes $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{300}{100}=3$, which simplifies to $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=3$. However, this equation only has 2 distinct solutions (the two roots $x = 1 \pm 2$), so $m=300$ is not a valid value.

Therefore, the only values of $m$ that give the equation 4 distinct solutions are $m=100$ and $m=200$. The number of positive integers $m$ for which the equation has 4 distinct solutions is 2.

Approach:


We want the equation $| |x-1|-2 | = \frac{m}{100}$ to have $4$ distinct solutions. 
We know that the expression inside the absolute value $| |x-1|-2|$ can be positive or negative, so we consider these two cases separately.

Case 1: $|x-1|-2 = \frac{m}{100}$
This implies $|x-1| = 2 + \frac{m}{100}$.
The absolute value $|x-1|$ can be positive or negative, so we consider these two cases separately.

Subcase 1.1: $x-1 = 2 + \frac{m}{100}$ or $x-1 = -2 - \frac{m}{100}$.
Solving the first equation gives $x = 3 + \frac{m}{100}$, and solving the second equation gives $x = -1 - \frac{m}{100}$.
So the solutions for this case are $x = 3 + \frac{m}{100}$ and $x = -1 - \frac{m}{100}$.

Case 2: $-(|x-1|-2) = \frac{m}{100}$
This implies $|x-1|-2 = - \frac{m}{100}$.
This simplifies to $|x-1| = 2 - \frac{m}{100}$.
Similarly to the first case, we consider these two subcases.

Subcase 2.1: $x-1 = 2 - \frac{m}{100}$ or $x-1 = -2 + \frac{m}{100}$.
Solving the first equation gives $x = 3 - \frac{m}{100}$, and solving the second equation gives $x = -1 + \frac{m}{100}$.
So the solutions for this case are $x = 3 - \frac{m}{100}$ and $x = -1 + \frac{m}{100}$.

For the equation $| |x-1|-2 | = \frac{m}{100}$ to have 4 distinct solutions, we need the following conditions:

1. $3 + \frac{m}{100} \neq -1 - \frac{m}{100}$. This implies $m \neq -50$.
2. $3 + \frac{m}{100} \neq 3 - \frac{m}{100}$. This is always true, since the LHS is always greater than 3.
3. $3 + \frac{m}{100} \neq -1 + \frac{m}{100}$. This implies $m \neq 400$.
4. $-1 - \frac{m}{100} \neq -1 + \frac{m}{100}$. This is always true, since the LHS is always less than -1.
5. $3 - \frac{m}{100} \neq -1 + \frac{m}{100}$. This implies $m \neq 200$.
6. $-1 - \frac{m}{100} \neq 3 - \frac{m}{100}$. This is always true, since the LHS is always less than -1 and the RHS is always greater than 3.

So the only conditions that need to be satisfied are $m \neq -50$ and $m \neq 200$.
Therefore, for how many positive integers $m$ does the equation $| |x-1|-2 | = \frac{m}{100}$ have 4 distinct solutions? The answer is $\boxed{95}$, since there are 95 positive integers $m$ that satisfy $m \neq -50$ and $m \neq 200$. The answer is $\boxed{95}$.

The equation \[\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}\] has 4 distinct solutions when \[\frac{m}{100}=1\]. This is because the expression inside the absolute value function, \[\vert x-1 \vert -2\], changes its behavior when \[\vert x-1 \vert = 2\], and we want 4 distinct solutions, so we need one value of $m$ for which \[\frac{m}{100} = 1\].

Therefore, \[m = 100\].

So, the number of positive integers $m$ for which the equation has 4 distinct solutions is 1.
The answer is: $1$

Assistant:

Approach:



1. Consider the function $f(x) = \vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert$. This function has 4 piecewise forms:
   - For $x<1$, $f(x) = \vert -(x-1) - 2 \vert = \vert 3 - x \vert$.
   - For $1 \le x \le 3$, $f(x) = \vert x-1 - 2 \vert = \vert x-3 \vert$.
   - For $x>3$, $f(x) = \vert x-1 - 2 \vert = \vert x-3 \vert$.

2. Now, we want to find for how many positive integers $m$ the equation $f(x) = \frac{m}{100}$ has 4 distinct solutions.
3. We can plot the function $f(x)$ and see where it intersects with the line $y = \frac{m}{100}$. The intersections will give us the values of $m$ that make the equation $f(x) = \frac{m}{100}$ have 4 distinct solutions.

4. By doing so, we find that $f(x)$ intersects with $y = \frac{m}{100}$ at $m=1,3,59,61$.
5. Therefore, there are $3$ positive integers $m$ for which the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has $4$ distinct solutions.
The answer is: $3$

Approach:


To start with, we need to find the number of values of $m$ such that the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has $4$ distinct solutions.
The expression $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ is a piecewise function, which means it changes its form based on the value of $x$. The piecewise function is:
- $\vert x - 1 - 2 \vert = \frac{m}{100}$ when $x \geq 3$,
- $\vert x - 1 + 2 \vert = \frac{m}{100}$ when $1 \leq x < 3$,
- $\vert x - 1 - 2 \vert = \frac{m}{100}$ when $x < 1$.

Now, for each case, we need to solve the absolute value equation and find the number of distinct solutions.

For $x \geq 3$, the equation becomes $\vert x - 3 \vert = \frac{m}{100}$. This equation has two solutions $x = 3 + \frac{m}{100}$ and $x = 3 - \frac{m}{100}$. If $0 \leq \frac{m}{100} \leq 2$, there are two distinct solutions. This gives us the condition $0 \leq m \leq 200$.

For $1 \leq x < 3$, the equation becomes $\vert x - 1 \vert = \frac{m}{100}$. This equation has two solutions $x = 1 + \frac{m}{100}$ and $x = 1 - \frac{m}{100}$. If $-1 \leq -\frac{m}{100} < 1$, there are two distinct solutions. This gives us the condition $-100 \leq m < 0$.

For $x < 1$, the equation becomes $\vert x + 1 \vert = \frac{m}{100}$. This equation has two solutions $x = -1 + \frac{m}{100}$ and $x = -1 - \frac{m}{100}$. If $-3 \leq -\frac{m}{100} < -1$, there are two distinct solutions. This gives us the condition $-300 \leq m < -100$.

Adding up the ranges of $m$, we have $-300 \leq m < -100$ or $0 \leq m \leq 200$. There are $201$ positive integers $m$ in this range.
The value of $m$ should be between $0$ and $200$ inclusive. Therefore, there are $201$ possible values of $m$ such that the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has $4$ distinct solutions. The answer is: $\boxed{201}$.

Approach:


The equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has 4 distinct solutions, which implies that the value $\frac{m}{100}$ must be less than 2 and greater than 0. So we have $0 < \frac{m}{100} < 2$, which gives $0 < m < 200$.
The number of positive integers $m$ that satisfy this inequality is the number of integers from 1 to 199.
To find the number of integers in this range, we can subtract the smallest integer from the largest and add 1: $199 - 1 + 1 = 199$.
Therefore, the number of positive integers $m$ for which the equation has 4 distinct solutions is 199.
The answer is: $\boxed{199}$

Approach:

 We first observe that the equation $|\vert x-1 \vert -2|=\frac{m}{100}$ has $4$ distinct solutions if and only if the number $\frac{m}{100}$ is between $1$ and $2$.

So we have $1 < \frac{m}{100} < 2$, which implies $100 < m < 200$.

Then we find the number of positive integers $m$ in the range $(100, 200)$.

This is simply $200 - 100 - 1 = 99$.

But the question asks for the number of positive integers $m$, so we need to consider $0$ as well. The number of positive integers $m$ is then $99 + 1 = 100$.
The answer is: $100$.

Approach:



First, let's consider the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$.

This equation has four distinct solutions if and only if $\frac{m}{100} = 1$. This is because the function $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert$ is a "V" shape with the "vertex" at $\frac{m}{100} = 1$. So, we can set up the equation $\frac{m}{100} = 1$ to find the value of $m$ that makes the equation have 4 distinct solutions.

By solving the equation $\frac{m}{100} = 1$, we get $m = 100$.

So, the only positive integer value of $m$ for which the equation has 4 distinct solutions is $100$. Therefore, the number of positive integers $m$ for which the equation has 4 distinct solutions is $1$.
The answer is: $1$

To determine the value of $m$ for which the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has four distinct solutions, we need to analyze the nature of the equation.

The equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ is a piecewise function with four cases based on the absolute value inside:

1. For $x-1 \geq 2$, the equation becomes $\vert x-1 -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$, or $\vert x-3 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$.
2. For $1 < x-1 < 2$, the equation becomes $\vert -(x-1) -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$, or $\vert -x+1-2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$, or $\vert -x-1 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$.
3. For $x-1 \leq 1$, the equation becomes $\vert -(x-1) -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$, or $\vert -x+1-2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$, or $\vert -x-1 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$.
4. For $x-1 < 1$, the equation becomes $\vert x-1 -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$, or $\vert x-3 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$.

Each of these cases represents a line segment of length $\frac{m}{100}$ in the number line. In order for the equation to have four distinct solutions, the sum of the lengths of the line segments should be equal to 4.

From cases 1 and 4, we have two line segments of length 3 (for $\vert x-3 \vert$), and from cases 2 and 3, we have two line segments of length 1 (for $\vert -x-1 \vert$). The sum of the lengths of these line segments is indeed 4. Therefore, the equation has four distinct solutions when $\frac{m}{100}=1$. This gives $m=100$.

So the value of $m$ that satisfies the condition is $m=100$. The number of positive integers $m$ that satisfy this condition is 1. The answer is: $1$

Approach:


To find out the number of positive integers $m$ such that the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has $4$ distinct solutions, we need to understand the behavior of the left side of the equation.

The left side of the equation, $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert$, is a function that has four distinct linear segments. For each $m$, the right side of the equation, $\frac{m}{100}$, defines a horizontal line. We want to find out how many of these lines intersect the four-segment function at exactly four points.

When $\frac{m}{100} < 2$, there are no intersections.
When $\frac{m}{100} = 2$, there are two intersections.
When $2 < \frac{m}{100} < 4$, there are four intersections.
When $\frac{m}{100} = 4$, there are two intersections again.
When $\frac{m}{100} > 4$, there are no intersections.

Therefore, the equation has $4$ distinct solutions when $\frac{m}{100}$ is strictly between $2$ and $4$, inclusive. This means that $2 \leq \frac{m}{100} < 4$. Multiplying through by $100$ gives $200 \leq m < 400$. The positive integers in this range are exactly the integers from $200$ to $399$, inclusive. To find the number of these integers, we subtract the smallest one from the largest one and add $1$:
\[399 - 200 + 1 = 199 + 1 = 200.\]
Therefore, there are $200$ positive integers $m$ such that the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has $4$ distinct solutions. The answer is: $200$

Approach:


The equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has 4 distinct solutions if and only if the value of $\frac{m}{100}$ is strictly between 1 and 2. This is because the expression on the left hand side, $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert$, will be a number between 1 and 2 for 4 distinct solutions, because it starts from 0 at $x=1$, reaches 2 at $x=3$, and goes back to 0 at $x=5$.
So we need to find the number of positive integers $m$ such that $1 < \frac{m}{100} < 2$.
Multiplying all sides of the inequalities by 100 gives $100 < m < 200$.
The number of positive integers $m$ in this range is $200 - 100 - 1 = 99$.
Therefore, there are 99 positive integers $m$ for which the equation has 4 distinct solutions. The answer is: $99$.

Approach:

 The function $f(x) = \vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert$ is a piecewise linear function with a "V" shape, that reaches a minimum value of 1 at $x=1$ and a maximum value of 3 at $x=3$. The equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ then represents a set of horizontal lines, with y-intercepts $\frac{m}{100}$, between the lines $y=1$ and $y=3$. The number of solutions to this equation will be 4 for those values of $\frac{m}{100}$ that fall strictly between 1 and 3. So we want to count the number of such fractions $\frac{m}{100}$ between 1 and 3.

Calculate: To find out how many such fractions exist, we need to count the number of integers $m$ such that $1 < \frac{m}{100} < 3$. We can rewrite this as $100 < m < 300$, and then count the number of integers in this range. This gives us $300 - 100 - 1 = 199$.

Therefore, there are 199 positive integers $m$ for which the equation has 4 distinct solutions. The answer is: 199

Approach:

 The equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has $4$ distinct solutions when the right-hand side $\frac{m}{100}$ is a number between $1$ and $2$ (inclusive). This is because the left-hand side, $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert$, can take on values only in the interval $[1, 2]$ when it has $4$ distinct solutions. Thus, $\frac{m}{100}$ should be in the interval $(1, 2]$ so that we get four distinct solutions.

Now, we can find the corresponding values of $m$. We need $1 \leq \frac{m}{100} \leq 2$.

Multiplying all sides by $100$ gives $100 \leq m \leq 200$.

So, the positive integers $m$ for which the equation has four distinct solutions are those in the set $\{100, 101, ..., 200\}$. To find the total number of such integers, we subtract the smallest value from the largest value and add $1$:

$200 - 100 + 1 = 101$.

So, there are $101$ positive integers $m$ for which the equation has four distinct solutions.
The answer is: $101$.

We know that the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has $4$ distinct solutions, so we need to find for how many positive integers $m$ this is true.

The equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ is equivalent to a chain of four absolute value equations. The number of solutions will depend on the value of $m/100$.

When $m/100 < 2$, the equation has no solutions. When $m/100 = 2$, the equation has two solutions. When $2 < m/100 < 4$, the equation has four solutions. When $m/100 = 4$ or $m/100 > 4$, the equation has two solutions again.

So, the only case where the equation has four solutions is when $2 < m/100 < 4$. This means $200 < m < 400$. The positive integers in this range are from $201$ to $399$, so there are $199$ such integers. Therefore, the number of positive integers $m$ for which the equation has four distinct solutions is $199$. The answer is: $\boxed{199}$

 The given equation has four distinct solutions, which means that there must be a value of $m$ such that the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has exactly four distinct solutions. 

The equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ can be solved graphically by drawing the graph of $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert$ and then looking for the value of $m$ that gives four distinct solutions. 

The graph of $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert$ consists of two V-shaped graphs with their minima at $x=1\pm2$, i.e., at $x=3$ and $x=-1$. The height of the V-shaped graphs is determined by the value of $\frac{m}{100}$.

To have four distinct solutions, we need the height of the V-shaped graphs to be such that they intersect the x-axis in exactly four points. This happens when the height is $2$, because the two V-shaped graphs are then $2$ units apart from the x-axis at their minima. This means that $m=200$.

So, the only positive integer $m$ for which the equation has four distinct solutions is $200$.

Therefore, the answer is $1$. The value of $m$ is $200$. The answer is: $200$

 We need to find out how many positive integer values of $m$ will result in the equation $| |x-1|-2|=\frac{m}{100}$ having $4$ distinct solutions.
To start, we can multiply both sides of the equation by $100$ to get rid of the fraction: $| |x-1|-2|=m$.
Next, we'll analyze the absolute value expression $| |x-1|-2|$.
When $|x-1|-2$ is greater than or equal to $0$, $| |x-1|-2|=|x-1|-2$. So the equation becomes $|x-1|-2=m$.
When $|x-1|-2$ is less than $0$, $| |x-1|-2|=-(|x-1|-2)=2-|x-1|$. So the equation becomes $2-|x-1|=m$.
Let's solve these two equations separately.
For the first equation, $|x-1|-2=m$, we add $2$ to both sides to get $|x-1|=m+2$. This equation gives two solutions: $x-1=m+2$ and $x-1=-(m+2)$. The first one gives $x=m+3$, and the second one gives $x=-m+1$. 
For the second equation, $2-|x-1|=m$, we add $|x-1|$ to both sides and subtract $m$ from both sides to get $2-m=|x-1|$. This equation also gives two solutions: $x-1=2-m$ and $x-1=m-2$. The first one gives $x=m+1$, and the second one gives $x=3-m$.
To have $4$ distinct solutions, we need the four solutions to be different. 
We can analyze these solutions:
- For $x=m+3$, this solution is positive for $m \geq -3$.
- For $x=-m+1$, this solution is positive for $m \leq 1$.
- For $x=m+1$, this solution is positive for $m \geq -1$.
- For $x=3-m$, this solution is positive for $m \leq 3$.
To satisfy all these conditions, $m$ must be in the range $-3 \leq m \leq 1$. The only positive integer value of $m$ that satisfies this condition is $m=1$. Therefore, there is only one positive integer $m$ that makes the equation have $4$ distinct solutions. The answer is: $1$
