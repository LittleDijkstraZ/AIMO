 The given equation is equal to zero if and only if both of the factors are equal to zero.
The first factor is equal to zero if $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ or $\vert x - y \vert = 10$.
The second factor is equal to zero if $\vert x \vert = 8$ or $\vert y \vert = 8$.

The lines $\vert x + y \vert = 10$, $\vert x - y \vert = 10$, $\vert x \vert = 8$, and $\vert y \vert = 8$ form a square with side length 16.

The area of this square is $16^2 = 256$.

Therefore, the area of the convex polygon is 256. The answer is: $256$

Below is a math problem you are to solve (positive numerical answer!):
"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"

Assistant:


The given equation is a product of two expressions equal to zero. Therefore, either the first expression is zero or the second expression is zero. 

The first expression is $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)$ and the second expression is $((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2)$.

For the first expression to be zero, both $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2$ and $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2$ must be zero. This means that $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. The solutions to these equations are the lines $x + y = 10$, $x + y = -10$, $x - y = 10$, and $x - y = -10$. These lines form a rectangle.

For the second expression to be zero, both $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2$ and $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2$ must be zero. This means that $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$. The solutions to these equations are the lines $x = 8$, $x = -8$, $y = 8$, and $y = -8$. These lines also form a rectangle.

The two rectangles overlap to form a larger rectangle. The dimensions of the larger rectangle are $20 \times 16$, so its area is $20 \times 16 = 320$. Therefore, the area of the convex polygon is 320 square units.

```python


INTERMEDIATE OUT :

def area_of_polygon():
    """The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"""
    # Dimensions of the rectangle
    length = 20
    width = 16

    # Calculate the area
    area = length * width

    return area

result = area_of_polygon()
print(result)
```

CODE RESULTS 320

INTERMEDIATE OUT :
```output
320
```
The area of the convex polygon is $320$ square units. The answer is $\boxed{320}$.

The equation given is a product of two expressions equal to zero, which means that either of the expressions must be zero.

The first expression is $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)$. This expression equals zero if and only if both $\vert x + y \vert - 10 = 0$ and $\vert x - y \vert - 10 = 0$, which implies $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. This means that $x + y = \pm 10$ and $x - y = \pm 10$. Solving these equations gives us the vertices of the square as $(0, 10), (0, -10), (10, 0), (-10, 0)$.

The second expression is $((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2)$. This expression equals zero if and only if both $\vert x \vert - 8 = 0$ and $\vert y \vert - 8 = 0$, which implies $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$. This means that $x = \pm 8$ and $y = \pm 8$. Solving these equations gives us the vertices of the square as $(8, 0), (-8, 0), (0, 8), (0, -8)$.

The intersection of these two squares is a square with side length 8. The area of this square is $8^2 = 64$. So the area of the convex polygon is 64 square units.

Here is a Python function that calculates the area of the polygon:
```python


INTERMEDIATE OUT :

def polygon_area():
    """The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"""
    side_length = 8
    area = side_length ** 2
    return area

result = polygon_area()
print(result)
```

CODE RESULTS 64

INTERMEDIATE OUT :
```output
64
```
The area of the convex polygon is 64 square units. The answer is: $64$

Assistant:

 The equation given in the problem is a product of two terms equal to zero. This means that either the first term is zero, or the second term is zero, or both are zero.

The first term is $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)$, and this equals zero if and only if $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. These two equations represent a square with side length 20 centered at the origin.

The second term is $((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2)$, and this equals zero if and only if $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$. These two equations represent a square with side length 16 centered at the origin.

The intersection of these two squares is the convex polygon we are looking for. The side length of this square is the smaller of the two side lengths, which is 16. Therefore, the area of the convex polygon is $16^2 = 256$. The answer is: $256$

 The expression $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ is true if and only if at least one of the factors is zero.
The first factor is zero if and only if $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ or $\vert x - y \vert = 10$.
These are the equations of two squares with side length 10.
The second factor is zero if and only if $\vert x \vert = 8$ or $\vert y \vert = 8$.
These are the equations of two squares with side length 8.
The intersection of these two squares is a square with side length 6.
The area of this square is $6^2 = 36$.
Therefore, the area of the convex polygon is 36. The answer is: $36$

 The expression $AB = 0$ is true if and only if either $A = 0$ or $B = 0$. Therefore, the given equation is satisfied if either $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2) = 0$ or $((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$.
The first equation is satisfied if and only if $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$, which means $x + y = \pm 10$ and $x - y = \pm 10$. Solving these equations gives us the vertices of the square with side length 10: $(5,5), (5,-5), (-5,5), (-5,-5)$.
The second equation is satisfied if and only if $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$, which means $x = \pm 8$ and $y = \pm 8$. Solving these equations gives us the vertices of the square with side length 16: $(8,8), (8,-8), (-8,8), (-8,-8)$.
The points that satisfy the given equation are the intersection of these two squares, which is a square with side length 10. The area of this square is $10^2 = 100$. The answer is: $100$

The equation given is a product of two expressions equal to zero. This means that either the first expression is zero or the second expression is zero.

The first expression is $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)$, and it equals zero if and only if $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. This implies that $x + y = \pm 10$ and $x - y = \pm 10$. Solving these equations, we get the vertices of the polygon as $(0, 10)$, $(0, -10)$, $(10, 0)$, and $(-10, 0)$.

The second expression is $((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2)$, and it equals zero if and only if $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$. This implies that $x = \pm 8$ and $y = \pm 8$. Solving these equations, we get the vertices of the polygon as $(8, 8)$, $(8, -8)$, $(-8, 8)$, and $(-8, -8)$.

So, the polygon is a square with side length 10. The area of the square is $10^2 = 100$.

Therefore, the area of the convex polygon is 100. The answer is: $100$

 The equation $A \cdot B = 0$ is true if and only if $A = 0$ or $B = 0$. So, the given equation is equivalent to either $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$.

The first equation is true if and only if $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. These are the equations of two lines in the plane, so the set of points satisfying this equation form a square with side length 20.

The second equation is true if and only if $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$. These are the equations of two circles in the plane, centered at the origin with radius 8. The intersection of these two circles form a square with side length 16.

The convex polygon formed by the intersection of these two sets of points is the smaller square. The area of this square is $16^2 = 256$. So, the area of the convex polygon is 256. The answer is: $256$

The given equation is a product of two terms equal to zero. This means that either the first term is zero or the second term is zero.

The first term is $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)$. This term equals zero when both $\vert x + y \vert - 10 = 0$ and $\vert x - y \vert - 10 = 0$, which implies $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. This gives us four lines: $x + y = \pm10$ and $x - y = \pm10$. These lines form a square with side length 20.

The second term is $((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2)$. This term equals zero when both $\vert x \vert - 8 = 0$ and $\vert y \vert - 8 = 0$, which implies $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$. This gives us four lines: $x = \pm8$ and $y = \pm8$. These lines form a square with side length 16.

The convex polygon formed by the intersection of these two squares is a smaller square with side length 16. Therefore, the area of this convex polygon is $16^2 = 256$.
The answer is: $256$
