 This problem is a challenging problem that involves understanding the properties of absolute value functions and their graphs. To solve this problem, we need to analyze the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ and find the values of $m$ for which it has $4$ distinct solutions.

Let's first consider the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=0$. This equation has four solutions: $x=3, x=1, x=-1, x=-3$. The graph of $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert$ is a V-shape with vertices at $x=1 \pm 2$ and $x=-(1 \pm 2)$, which are $x=3, x=-1, x=1, x=-3$.

Now, we want to find the values of $m$ for which the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has four distinct solutions. This equation is equivalent to shifting the graph of $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert$ vertically by $\frac{m}{100}$. The equation has four distinct solutions when the vertical shift is such that the new V-shape intersects the x-axis at four points. This happens when the distance between the vertices of the V-shape is equal to $\frac{m}{100}$.

The distance between the vertices of the V-shape is $3 - (-3) = 6$. So, we want $\frac{m}{100} = 6$, which gives $m = 600$.

Therefore, the only positive integer $m$ for which the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has four distinct solutions is $m = 600$. The answer is: $1$

 The problem asks for the number of positive integers $m$ such that the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has exactly four distinct solutions.

This equation is a piecewise function with four cases to consider:
1. If $x \ge 3$, then $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert = x - 3$.
2. If $1 \le x < 3$, then $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert = 3 - x$.
3. If $x < 1$, then $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert = x + 1$.

The equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has exactly four distinct solutions if and only if $\frac{m}{100}$ is equal to either $1$ or $3$. This is because the function $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert$ takes on the values $1$ and $3$ exactly four times.

Therefore, we need to find the number of positive integers $m$ such that $\frac{m}{100}$ is equal to either $1$ or $3$. This means $m$ must be either $100$ or $300$.

So, there is only one positive integer $m$ that satisfies the condition, namely $m = 100$.
The answer is: $1$

Assistant:

 The equation $| |x - 1| - 2 | = \frac{m}{100}$ has 4 distinct solutions if and only if $\frac{m}{100} = 1$. This is because the expression on the left, $| |x - 1| - 2 |$, takes on the value of 1 exactly four times.

Therefore, we have $\frac{m}{100} = 1$, which implies $m = 100$.
The value of $m$ that makes the equation have 4 distinct solutions is 100. The answer is: $100$

"For how many positive integers $m$ does the equation \[\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}\] have $4$ distinct solutions?"

Assistant:

 The number of distinct solutions of the equation $| |x - 1| - 2| = \frac{m}{100}$ is equal to 4 if and only if $\frac{m}{100}$ is in the interval $(1, 2)$. This is because the function $| |x - 1| - 2|$ has a graph with a "V" shape, with the value 2 being attained at two points, and the value 1 being attained at four points. Thus, the value $\frac{m}{100}$ must be in the interval $(1, 2)$ in order for the equation to have 4 distinct solutions.

Therefore, we want to find the number of positive integers $m$ such that $1 < \frac{m}{100} < 2$. Multiplying all sides of the inequalities by 100 gives $100 < m < 200$. The number of positive integers in this interval is $200 - 100 - 1 = 99$.

```python


INTERMEDIATE OUT :

def count_m():
    """For how many positive integers $m$ does the equation \[\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}\] have $4$ distinct solutions?"""
    lower_bound = 100
    upper_bound = 200
    count = upper_bound - lower_bound - 1
    return count

result = count_m()
print(result)
```

Assistant:

 The number of distinct solutions to the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ is equal to $4$ if and only if $\frac{m}{100} = 2$.

This is because the expression $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert$ is a piecewise linear function that oscillates between $0$ and $4$. It equals $0$ at $x = 3$ and $x = -1$, it equals $2$ at $x = 1$ and $x = 5$, and it equals $4$ at $x = -3$ and $x = 7$.

Therefore, we set $\frac{m}{100} = 2$ and solve for $m$:

```python


INTERMEDIATE OUT :

from sympy import symbols, Eq, solve

def find_m():
    m = symbols('m')
    equation = Eq(m / 100, 2)
    solution = solve(equation, m)
    return solution[0]

result = find_m()
print(result)
```

INTERMEDIATE OUT :
```output

```
The value of $m$ that makes the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ have $4$ distinct solutions is $200$.

Therefore, the number of positive integers $m$ that satisfy this condition is $1$, the number $200$. The answer is: $1$

Below is a math problem you are to solve (positive numerical answer!):
"For how many positive integers $m$ does the equation \[\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}\] have $4$ distinct solutions?"
Analyze this problem and think step by step to come to a solution with programs. After solving the problem, output the final numerical answer within \boxed{}.

Assistant:

 This problem is a bit tricky to solve directly using Python, but we can use our knowledge of the number of solutions of absolute value equations to solve it.

First, we need to understand that the equation $| |x - 1| - 2 | = \frac{m}{100}$ has 4 distinct solutions if and only if $\frac{m}{100} = 2$. This is because the expression on the left side of the equation, $| |x - 1| - 2 |$, can only be equal to 2 in exactly 4 distinct ways.

So we can set up the equation $\frac{m}{100} = 2$ and solve for $m$.

```python


INTERMEDIATE OUT :

from sympy import symbols, Eq, solve

def find_m():
    m = symbols('m')
    equation = Eq(m / 100, 2)
    solution = solve(equation, m)
    return solution[0]

result = find_m()
print(result)
```

CODE RESULTS 200

INTERMEDIATE OUT :
```output
200
```
The value of $m$ that makes the equation $| |x - 1| - 2 | = \frac{m}{100}$ have 4 distinct solutions is $200$. Therefore, the number of positive integers $m$ for which the equation has 4 distinct solutions is 1. The answer is: $1$
