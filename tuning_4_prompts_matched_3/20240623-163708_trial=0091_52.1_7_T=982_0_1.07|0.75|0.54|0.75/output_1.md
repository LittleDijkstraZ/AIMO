 This problem requires the use of the inequality of arithmetic and geometric means (AM-GM), which states that for any non-negative real numbers $a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n$, we have
\[ \frac{a_1 + a_2 + \dots + a_n}{n} \geq \sqrt[n]{a_1 a_2 \dots a_n}.\]

Setting $a = |x - 2y|$ and $b = |y - 2x|$, we have $a + b = 40$. By AM-GM, we have
\[\frac{a + b}{2} \geq \sqrt{ab},\]
which simplifies to $ab \leq 100$.

Now, we want to minimize the value of $5x^2 + 5y^2 - 8xy$. We can rewrite this as
\[5(x^2 + y^2) - 8xy = 5[(x - y)^2 + 2xy] - 8xy = 5(x - y)^2 + 3xy.\]
Since $ab \leq 100$, we have $xy \leq 100$. Therefore, the minimum value of $5(x - y)^2 + 3xy$ is achieved when $xy$ is as small as possible, which is when $xy = 0$. In this case, the minimum value is $5(x - y)^2$.

Now, we need to find the minimum value of $5(x - y)^2$. Since $a + b = 40$, we have
\[|x - 2y| + |y - 2x| = 40,\]
which simplifies to $|x - 2y| = 20 - |y - 2x|$.

If $|x - 2y| = 20$, then $x - 2y = \pm 20$. If $x - 2y = 20$, we have $y = 0$ and $x = 20$. If $x - 2y = -20$, we have $y = 10$ and $x = -10$. Similarly, if $|y - 2x| = 20$, we get the same two solutions.

Now, we can calculate the minimum value of $5(x - y)^2$. If $x = 20$ and $y = 0$, we have $5(20 - 0)^2 = 2000$. If $x = -10$ and $y = 10$, we have $5(-10 - 10)^2 = 2000$. Therefore, the minimum value of $5x^2 + 5y^2 - 8xy$ is $2000$. The answer is: $2000$

 To solve this problem, we first need to express the given equation $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$ in a more convenient form. We can do this by using the property $|a| + |b| = |a+b| + |a-b|$ for all real numbers $a$ and $b$. Applying this property to the given equation, we get:

$$|x-2y| + |y-2x| = |(x-2y) + (y-2x)| + |(x-2y) - (y-2x)| = |x-2y+y-2x| + |x-2y-y+2x| = |-x-y| + |-x-3y| = 40.$$

Now, let's denote $u = x + y$ and $v = x - 3y$. Then we have $|u| + |v| = 40$. We can express $x$ and $y$ in terms of $u$ and $v$:

$$x = \frac{u+v}{4}, \quad y = \frac{3u-v}{4}.$$

Now, substitute $x$ and $y$ into the expression $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$:

$$5\left(\frac{u+v}{4}\right)^2 + 5\left(\frac{3u-v}{4}\right)^2 - 8\left(\frac{u+v}{4}\right)\left(\frac{3u-v}{4}\right) = \frac{5}{16}(u^2 + 2uv + v^2) + \frac{5}{16}(9u^2 - 6uv + v^2) - \frac{2}{4}(3u^2 - uv + 3uv - v^2) = \frac{1}{4}(u^2 + v^2).$$

Now, we need to minimize $\frac{1}{4}(u^2 + v^2)$ subject to the constraint $|u| + |v| = 40$. By the Cauchy-Schwarz inequality, we have $(u^2 + v^2) \geq \frac{(u+v)^2}{2} = \frac{40^2}{2} = 800$. Therefore, the minimum value of $\frac{1}{4}(u^2 + v^2)$ is $\frac{1}{4} \cdot 800 = 200$. So, the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ is 200.

 To solve this problem, we can use the method of completing the square and the AM-GM inequality. First, let's rewrite the given expression as follows:

$$5x^2+5y^2-8xy = 5(x^2 - \frac{8}{5}xy + y^2) = 5[(x - \frac{4}{5}y)^2 + \frac{1}{5}y^2].$$

Now, let's consider the constraint equation:

$$|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40.$$

We can rewrite this as:

$$|x-2y| + |2y-x| = 40.$$

Using the property $|a| + |b| = |a+b| + |a-b|$, we can simplify the left-hand side to:

$$|x-2y + 2y-x| + |x-2y - (2y-x)| = |0| + |x-2y - 2y + x| = 2|x-2y| = 40.$$

So, we have $|x-2y| = 20$. Squaring both sides, we get $(x-2y)^2 = 400$. Expanding, we have $x^2 - 4xy + 4y^2 = 400$.

Now, let's substitute this into our expression for $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$:

$$5x^2+5y^2-8xy = 5[(x - \frac{4}{5}y)^2 + \frac{1}{5}y^2] = 5[(x^2 - 4xy + 4y^2) + \frac{1}{5}y^2] = 5[400 + \frac{1}{5}y^2] = 2000 + y^2.$$

By the AM-GM inequality, we know that for any nonnegative numbers $a$ and $b$, we have $ab \leq \frac{(a+b)^2}{4}$. Applying this to $a = y^2$ and $b = 2000$, we get:

$$y^2 \cdot 2000 \leq \left(\frac{y^2 + 2000}{2}\right)^2.$$

Rearranging and simplifying, we get:

$$y^2 \leq \frac{(y^2 + 2000)^2}{4 \cdot 2000}.$$

Taking the square root of both sides and simplifying, we get:

$$y^2 \leq \frac{y^2 + 2000}{2}.$$

Multiplying both sides by 2 and rearranging, we get:

$$0 \leq y^2 - \frac{y^2 + 2000}{2} = \frac{y^2 - 2000}{2}.$$

So, we have $y^2 \geq 2000$. Substituting this back into our expression for $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$, we get:

$$5x^2+5y^2-8xy \geq 2000 + 2000 = 4000.$$

Equality occurs when $y^2 = 2000$, and substituting this back into the constraint equation $|x-2y| = 20$, we get:

$$|x-2\sqrt{2000}| = 20.$$

Solving this equation, we find two possible solutions for $x$: $x = 2\sqrt{2000} \pm 20$. For each of these solutions, we can calculate the value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$, and we find that the minimum value is indeed 4000.

Therefore, the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ is 4000. The answer is: $4000$

This problem is a bit challenging to solve directly with Python, but we can use some mathematical insights to simplify it.

First, let's rewrite the given equation $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$ as $|2y-x| + |2x-y| = 40$. Now, by the triangle inequality, we know that $|a| + |b| \geq |a+b|$, so $|2y-x| + |2x-y| \geq |(2y-x) + (2x-y)| = |y| = y$ if $y \geq 0$ and $-y$ if $y < 0$.

For $y \geq 0$, we have $y = 40$, and for $y < 0$, we have $-y = 40$, so $y = -40$.

Now, let's substitute these values of $y$ into the expression $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$:

For $y = 40$, we have $5x^2 + 5(40)^2 - 8x(40) = 5x^2 + 8000 - 320x$.
For $y = -40$, we have $5x^2 + 5(-40)^2 - 8x(-40) = 5x^2 + 8000 + 320x$.

Now, let's find the derivative of each of these expressions with respect to $x$ and set it equal to zero to find the minimum value:

For $y = 40$, the expression is $5x^2 + 8000 - 320x$, and its derivative is $10x - 320$. Setting this equal to zero gives $x = \frac{320}{10} = 32$.
For $y = -40$, the expression is $5x^2 + 8000 + 320x$, and its derivative is $10x + 320$. Setting this equal to zero gives $x = -\frac{320}{10} = -32$.

Now, let's substitute these values of $x$ back into the expressions for $y = 40$ and $y = -40$:

For $x = 32$ and $y = 40$, the expression is $5(32)^2 + 5(40)^2 - 8(32)(40) = 5120$.
For $x = -32$ and $y = -40$, the expression is $5(-32)^2 + 5(-40)^2 - 8(-32)(-40) = 5120$.

So, the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ is 5120. The answer is: $5120$

To solve this problem, we first need to analyze the given equation $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$.

This equation can be rewritten as $|x-2y| + |2y-x| = 40$. The absolute value function $|a-b|$ is always non-negative, and it equals to $0$ if and only if $a=b$. Therefore, the only way for the sum of two absolute values to equal to a constant is that $x-2y = 0$ and $2y-x = 0$ at the same time. Solving these two equations gives $x=2y$.

Substitute $x=2y$ into the given equation $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$, we get $|2y-2y| + |y-4y| = 40$, which simplifies to $|0| + |-3y| = 40$, or $3|y| = 40$. Therefore, $|y| = \frac{40}{3}$. Since $y$ can be positive or negative, we have $y = \pm \frac{40}{3}$.

Substitute $y = \frac{40}{3}$ into $x=2y$, we get $x = \frac{80}{3}$. Similarly, when $y = -\frac{40}{3}$, we get $x = -\frac{80}{3}$.

Now we substitute $x = \frac{80}{3}$ and $y = \frac{40}{3}$ into the expression $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$, we get $5(\frac{80}{3})^2+5(\frac{40}{3})^2-8*\frac{80}{3}*\frac{40}{3} = \frac{6400}{9}$.

Similarly, when we substitute $x = -\frac{80}{3}$ and $y = -\frac{40}{3}$ into the expression $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$, we get the same value $\frac{6400}{9}$.

Therefore, the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ when $x$ and $y$ range over all real numbers such that $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$ is $\frac{6400}{9}$. The answer is: $\boxed{\frac{6400}{9}}$

 To solve this problem, we can use the Cauchy-Schwarz inequality. The given condition $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$ can be rewritten as $|x-2y| + |2y-x| = 40$, which is equivalent to $|x-2y| + |2y-x| = 2|x-2y| = 40$. Therefore, we have $|x-2y| = 20$.

Now, let's analyze the expression $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$. We can rewrite it as $5(x^2+y^2) - 8xy = 5[(x-2y)^2 + 4xy] - 8xy = 5(x-2y)^2 + 12xy$.

Since $|x-2y| = 20$, we have $5(x-2y)^2 = 5 \cdot 20^2 = 2000$.

Now, we need to find the minimum value of $12xy$. By the Cauchy-Schwarz inequality, we have $(1+4)(x^2+y^2) \geq (x+2y)^2$, which implies $5(x^2+y^2) \geq (x+2y)^2$. Therefore, $5(x^2+y^2) \geq (x+2y)^2 \geq (x+2y)(x-2y) = 0$, which implies $5(x^2+y^2) \geq 0$. Hence, $5(x^2+y^2) \geq 0$.

Therefore, the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ is $2000 + 12xy$ where $12xy$ is minimized. When $x=y$, we have $12xy = 12x^2 \geq 0$, so the minimum value of $12xy$ is 0.

Therefore, the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ is $2000 + 0 = 2000$.
The answer is: $2000$

The given equation $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$ is a bit complicated to handle directly. Instead, let's try to simplify it.

First, notice that $|x-2y| = |-(2x-y)| = |2x-y|$ and $|y-2x| = |-(2y-x)| = |2y-x|$. So the equation becomes $|2x-y| + |2y-x| = 40$.

Now, let's introduce a new variable $t = x - 2y$. Then $x = 2y + t$ and $y = \frac{x - t}{2}$. Substitute these into the equation $|2x-y| + |2y-x| = 40$:

$$|2(2y+t) - (\frac{x - t}{2})| + |2(\frac{x - t}{2}) - (2y+t)| = 40.$$

Simplify this to get:

$$|4y+2t - \frac{x - t}{2}| + |x - t - 2y - t| = 40.$$

Then simplify further to get:

$$|\frac{9t}{2} + \frac{x}{2}| + |-3t + x| = 40.$$

Now, let's look at the expression $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$. Substitute $x = 2y + t$ into this to get:

$$5(2y+t)^2 + 5y^2 - 8(2y+t)y = 20y^2 + 20yt + 5t^2 + 5y^2 - 16y^2 - 8yt = 5t^2 + 2yt.$$

We want to minimize this expression under the condition $|9t/2 + x/2| + |-3t + x| = 40$. 

However, this is a difficult problem to solve directly. Instead, we can use the Cauchy-Schwarz inequality to provide an upper bound for the expression $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$.

By Cauchy-Schwarz,

$$(5 + 5)(x^2 + y^2) \geq ( \sqrt{5}x + \sqrt{5}y)^2.$$

And

$$(9/4 + 1)(t^2 + x^2) \geq ( \sqrt{\frac{9}{4}}t + \sqrt{1}x)^2.$$

Adding these two inequalities gives

$$10(x^2 + y^2) + \frac{25}{4}t^2 + 2xt \geq ( \sqrt{10}x + \sqrt{10}y + \frac{5}{2}t)^2.$$

Now, we know that $|9t/2 + x/2| + |-3t + x| = 40$, which implies that $x^2 + t^2 = 1600$. Therefore,

$$5x^2 + 5y^2 - 8xy \geq -200.$$

Equality occurs when $x = 2y$ and $t = 0$, which satisfy the condition $|9t/2 + x/2| + |-3t + x| = 40$. Therefore, the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ is $-200$.
The answer is: $-200$

This problem involves the use of calculus to find the minimum value of a function subject to a constraint.

First, let's define the function $f(x, y) = 5x^2 + 5y^2 - 8xy$ and the constraint function $g(x, y) = |x - 2y| + |y - 2x| - 40$. We want to find the minimum value of $f(x, y)$ subject to the constraint $g(x, y) = 0$.

To solve this problem, we can use the method of Lagrange multipliers. First, we form the Lagrangian function $L(x, y, \lambda) = f(x, y) - \lambda g(x, y)$. Then, we find the partial derivatives of $L$ with respect to $x$, $y$, and $\lambda$ and set them equal to zero:

$\frac{\partial L}{\partial x} = 10x - 8y + 2\lambda(1 - 2) = 0$

$\frac{\partial L}{\partial y} = 10y - 8x + 2\lambda(2 - 1) = 0$

$\frac{\partial L}{\partial \lambda} = |x - 2y| + |y - 2x| - 40 = 0$

Solving these equations simultaneously is quite challenging. However, we can simplify the problem by noting that the constraint equation $|x - 2y| + |y - 2x| = 40$ implies that $x = 2y$ or $y = 2x$. Substituting these into the function $f(x, y)$ gives two new functions to minimize:

1. $f(x, 2x) = 5x^2 + 5(2x)^2 - 8x(2x) = 15x^2 - 16x^2 = -x^2$.
2. $f(2y, y) = 5(2y)^2 + 5y^2 - 8(2y)y = 20y^2 + 5y^2 - 16y^2 = 9y^2$.

Both of these functions are decreasing for negative values of $x$ or $y$ and increasing for positive values of $x$ or $y$. Therefore, the minimum value must occur at the boundary of the region where $x$ and $y$ are non-negative. Since the constraint equation is symmetric with respect to $x$ and $y$, we can assume without loss of generality that $x \geq 0$ and $y \geq 0$.

For $f(x, 2x)$, the minimum value occurs at $x = 0$, where $f(0, 0) = 0$. For $f(2y, y)$, the minimum value occurs at $y = 0$, where $f(0, 0) = 0$. Therefore, the minimum value of $f(x, y)$ subject to the constraint is 0. The value of the Lagrange multiplier $\lambda$ at this point is 0, so the constraint equation is satisfied.

Therefore, the minimum value of $5x^2 + 5y^2 - 8xy$ when $x$ and $y$ range over all real numbers such that $|x - 2y| + |y - 2x| = 40$ is 0. The answer is: $0$
