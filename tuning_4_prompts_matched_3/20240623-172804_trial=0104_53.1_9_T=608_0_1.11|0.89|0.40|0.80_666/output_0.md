Below is a math problem you are to solve (positive numerical answer!):
"Let $k, l > 0$ be parameters. The parabola $y = kx^2 - 2kx + l$ intersects the line $y = 4$ at two points $A$ and $B$. These points are distance 6 apart. What is the sum of the squares of the distances from $A$ and $B$ to the origin?"

 This problem requires a bit of analytical geometry and algebra. First, we find the points of intersection by setting $y = kx^2 - 2kx + l$ equal to $y = 4$:
\[kx^2 - 2kx + l - 4 = 0.\]
Let $x_1$ and $x_2$ be the x-coordinates of points $A$ and $B$, respectively. Since the distance between $A$ and $B$ is 6, we have $(x_2 - x_1)^2 = 36$. By Vieta's formulas, we know that $x_1 + x_2 = \frac{2k}{k} = 2$ and $x_1x_2 = \frac{l - 4}{k}$. Therefore, we have:
\[(x_1 + x_2)^2 - 4x_1x_2 = 36.\]
Substituting the values we know, we get:
\[4 - 4\left(\frac{l - 4}{k}\right) = 36.\]
Simplifying, we get:
\[4 - \frac{4l - 16}{k} = 36.\]
Multiplying both sides by $k$, we get:
\[4k - 4l + 16 = 36k.\]
Rearranging, we get:
\[36k - 4k = 4l - 16,\]
\[32k = 4l - 16.\]
Dividing both sides by 4, we get:
\[8k = l - 4.\]
Adding 4 to both sides, we get:
\[l = 8k + 4.\]
Now we substitute this value of $l$ into the equation $kx^2 - 2kx + l - 4 = 0$ to get:
\[kx^2 - 2kx + 8k = 0.\]
The distance from a point $(x, y)$ to the origin is given by $\sqrt{x^2 + y^2}$. For point $A$, this is $\sqrt{x_1^2 + (4 - kx_1^2 + 2kx_1 - l)^2}$.
Similarly, for point $B$, this is $\sqrt{x_2^2 + (4 - kx_2^2 + 2kx_2 - l)^2}$.
We want to find the sum of the squares of these distances:
\[(x_1^2 + (4 - kx_1^2 + 2kx_1 - l)^2) + (x_2^2 + (4 - kx_2^2 + 2kx_2 - l)^2).\]
Substituting the values of $l$, this becomes:
\[(x_1^2 + (4 - kx_1^2 + 2kx_1 - 8k - 4)^2) + (x_2^2 + (4 - kx_2^2 + 2kx_2 - 8k - 4)^2).\]
Simplifying, we get:
\[(x_1^2 + (8k - 2kx_1)^2) + (x_2^2 + (8k - 2kx_2)^2).\]
Substituting $x_1 + x_2 = 2$ and $x_1x_2 = \frac{l - 4}{k} = \frac{8k + 4 - 4}{k} = 8$, we get:
\[((1)^2 + (8k - 2(1))^2) + ((1)^2 + (8k - 2(1))^2).\]
Simplifying, we get:
\[(1 + (8k - 2)^2) + (1 + (8k - 2)^2).\]
This simplifies to:
\[2(1 + (8k - 2)^2).\]
To find the numerical value of this expression, we can substitute a value for $k$. For example, if we let $k = 1$, we get:
\[2(1 + (8 - 2)^2) = 2(1 + 36) = 2(37) = 74.\]
Therefore, the sum of the squares of the distances from $A$ and $B$ to the origin is 74.
The answer is: $74$
