"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"

Assistant:

 The equation $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + (\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ and $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + (\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ both hold if and only if $\vert x + y \vert = 10$, $\vert x - y \vert = 10$, $\vert x \vert = 8$, and $\vert y \vert = 8$.
The first two equations imply that $x + y = \pm 10$ and $x - y = \pm 10$. Adding these equations gives $2x = \pm 20$, so $x = \pm 10$. Subtracting these equations gives $2y = \pm 20$, so $y = \pm 10$.
The second two equations imply that $x = \pm 8$ and $y = \pm 8$.
So the points satisfying the equations are $(\pm 10, \pm 10)$ and $(\pm 8, \pm 8)$. These points form a square with side length 20.
The area of this square is $20^2 = 400$. The answer is: 400
The area of the convex polygon is 400. The answer is: $400$.

The given equation is a product of two terms equal to zero, so either the first term is zero or the second term is zero.

The first term is zero when either $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ or $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. These are the equations of two squares in the coordinate plane.

The second term is zero when either $\vert x \vert = 8$ or $\vert y \vert = 8$. These are the equations of two squares in the coordinate plane.

The intersection of these squares form a convex polygon, which is a square with side length 8.

The area of a square is given by the square of its side length. So the area of the square is $8^2 = 64$. The answer is: $64$

 The equation is satisfied if and only if either $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$.
This happens if and only if either $\vert x + y \vert = 10$, $\vert x - y \vert = 10$, $\vert x \vert = 8$, or $\vert y \vert = 8$.
These conditions define a square with side length 16 centered at the origin.

Below is a math problem you are to solve (positive numerical answer!):
"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"

Assistant:

 The given equation is $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$. For the product of two factors to be zero, either one of the factors must be zero. Therefore, either $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$.
If the first factor is zero, then $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$, which implies $x + y = \pm 10$ and $x - y = \pm 10$. Solving these equations gives us the vertices of the square $(0, 10)$, $(0, -10)$, $(10, 0)$, and $(-10, 0)$.
If the second factor is zero, then $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$, which implies $x = \pm 8$ and $y = \pm 8$. Solving these equations gives us the vertices of the square $(8, 0)$, $(-8, 0)$, $(0, 8)$, and $(0, -8)$.
The combined solution is the union of these two squares, which forms a larger square with side length $10 + 8 = 18$. The area of this square is $18^2 = 324$. Therefore, the area of the convex polygon is $324$.
The answer is: $324$

 The given equation is a product of two terms equals to zero. This means that either the first term equals to zero or the second term equals to zero. 

If we set each term equals to zero and solve for $x$ and $y$, we will find the coordinates of the vertices of the polygon.

The first term is $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2) = 0$. This term equals to zero when $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. These two equations represent two lines: $x + y = 10$ and $x - y = 10$ or $x + y = -10$ and $x - y = -10$.

The second term is $((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$. This term equals to zero when $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$. These two equations represent four lines: $x = 8$ and $x = -8$ or $y = 8$ and $y = -8$.

The intersection points of these lines are the vertices of the polygon. We can find the coordinates of these points by solving the system of equations. 

There are 4 vertices in the first quadrant: $(8, 2)$, $(8, -2)$, $(-2, 8)$, and $(-2, -8)$. The area of the polygon is the sum of the areas of the four right triangles formed by these vertices and the origin. 

The area of each triangle is $\frac{1}{2} \times base \times height$. The base and height of each triangle are 8 and 2, so the area of each triangle is $\frac{1}{2} \times 8 \times 2 = 8$. Therefore, the total area of the polygon is $4 \times 8 = 32$.

So, the area of the convex polygon is 32 square units. The answer is: 32.

 The equation $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ is satisfied if and only if either $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$, $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$, $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$, or $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$.
These conditions are equivalent to $\vert x + y \vert = 10$, $\vert x - y \vert = 10$, $\vert x \vert = 8$, or $\vert y \vert = 8$.
The first two conditions give us the equations $x + y = \pm 10$ and $x - y = \pm 10$, which represent the lines $y = -x \pm 10$ and $y = x \pm 10$.
The last two conditions give us the equations $x = \pm 8$ and $y = \pm 8$, which represent the lines $x = \pm 8$ and $y = \pm 8$.
These lines enclose a square with side length 16.
The area of this square is $16^2 = 256$. The answer is: 256

Below is a math problem you are to solve (positive numerical answer!):
"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"
Analyze this problem and think step by step to come to a solution with programs. After solving the problem, output the final numerical answer within \boxed{}.

Assistant:


The expression $A \cdot B = 0$ is equivalent to $A = 0$ or $B = 0$. So the given equation is equivalent to
\[((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2) = 0\] or
\[((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0.\]

For the first equation to hold, we need both $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. This gives us four equations:
\begin{align*}
x + y &= 10, \\
x + y &= -10, \\
x - y &= 10, \\
x - y &= -10.
\end{align*}
Solving these equations gives us the vertices of the square:
\[(5,5), (5,-5), (-5,5), (-5,-5).\]

For the second equation to hold, we need both $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$. This gives us four more vertices:
\[(8,0), (-8,0), (0,8), (0,-8).\]

To find the area of the convex polygon, we can draw a picture. The vertices $(5,5), (5,-5), (-5,5), (-5,-5), (8,0), (-8,0), (0,8), (0,-8)$ form a square with side length $10$. The area of this square is $10^2 = 100$. So the area of the convex polygon is $100$. The answer is: $100$

Assistant:

 The given equation is equal to zero if and only if both factors are equal to zero.
The first factor is zero if and only if $\vert x + y \vert - 10 = 0$ or $\vert x - y \vert - 10 = 0$, which means $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ or $\vert x - y \vert = 10$.
The second factor is zero if and only if $\vert x \vert - 8 = 0$ or $\vert y \vert - 8 = 0$, which means $\vert x \vert = 8$ or $\vert y \vert = 8$.
Combining these conditions, we have four cases:
1. $x + y = \pm 10$ and $x = \pm 8$.
2. $x + y = \pm 10$ and $y = \pm 8$.
3. $x - y = \pm 10$ and $x = \pm 8$.
4. $x - y = \pm 10$ and $y = \pm 8$.
By graphing these equations, we find that they form a square with side length 16. Therefore, the area of the square is $16^2 = 256$. The answer is: $256$

 The given equation is $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$.
This equation is equivalent to the product of two equations being equal to zero:
$(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$.
For the first equation, $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$, the only way this equation can be true is if both $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ and $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$, which means $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$.

These are the equations of two circles: $x^2 + y^2 = 64$.
The intersection of these lines and circles forms a square with side length 10. The area of this square is $10^2 = 100$. Therefore, the area of the convex polygon is 100.

"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"

The problem states that the points $\left(x, y\right)$ that satisfy the equation $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ encloses a convex polygon.
The first equation implies that $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$, which means $x + y = \pm 10$ and $x - y = \pm 10$. Solving these equations gives us the vertices of a square with side length 10 and centered at the origin.
The second equation implies that $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$, which means $x = \pm 8$ and $y = \pm 8$. This gives us a square with side length 16 and centered at the origin.
Combining these two squares, we obtain a larger square with side length 16 that contains the smaller square with side length 10. The area of the convex polygon is the difference between the areas of these two squares.
The area of the larger square is $16^2 = 256$ square units, and the area of the smaller square is $10^2 = 100$ square units. Therefore, the area of the convex polygon is $256 - 100 = 156$ square units.
The answer is: $156$

This problem requires a deep understanding of absolute value functions and the properties of multiplication and equality. The equation involves absolute value functions, which can make it look complex. However, we can simplify it by considering the properties of absolute value.

The equation is:
$$((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0.$$

The product of two factors equals zero if and only if at least one of the factors is zero. Therefore, we have two cases to consider:

1. $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$.
2. $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$.

From the first case, we get $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. This implies that $x + y = \pm 10$ and $x - y = \pm 10$. Solving these equations, we get four lines: $x + y = 10$, $x + y = -10$, $x - y = 10$, and $x - y = -10$.

From the second case, we get $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$, which implies that $x = \pm 8$ and $y = \pm 8$. This gives us four more lines: $x = 8$, $x = -8$, $y = 8$, and $y = -8$.

These eight lines form a square with side length 16. To find the area of this square, we use the formula $A = \text{side}^2$, so the area is $A = 16^2 = 256$.

So, the area of the convex polygon formed by the points $\left(x, y\right)$ is 256 square units.

The answer is: $256$
