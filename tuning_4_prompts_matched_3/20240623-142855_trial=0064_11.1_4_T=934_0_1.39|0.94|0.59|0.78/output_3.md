Below is a math problem you are to solve (positive numerical answer!):
"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"
Analyze this problem and think step by step to come to a solution with programs. After solving the problem, output the final numerical answer within \boxed{}.

Assistant:

 The given equation is equal to zero if either of the factors is zero.
For the first factor to be zero, we have $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + (\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$, which implies that both $\vert x + y \vert - 10 = 0$ and $\vert x - y \vert - 10 = 0$, so $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$.
This can only happen if $x = 0$ and $y = 0$. So the point $(0,0)$ satisfies the equation.
For the second factor to be zero, we have $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + (\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$, which implies that both $\vert x \vert - 8 = 0$ and $\vert y \vert - 8 = 0$, so $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$.
This can only happen if $-8 \leq x \leq 8$ and $-8 \leq y \leq 8$. So all points $(x,y)$ such that $-8 \leq x \leq 8$ and $-8 \leq y \leq 8$ satisfy the equation.
In conclusion, the set of points satisfying the equation forms a square with side length $16$, and its area is $16^2 = 256$.
So the area of the convex polygon is $256$. The answer is: $256$

 The given equation is equal to zero if and only if either of the factors is equal to zero.
The first factor is equal to zero if and only if $|x+y| = 10$ or $|x-y| = 10$.
These are the equations of two sets of parallel lines, so they enclose a rectangle with side lengths of $20$ and $20$ respectively.
The second factor is equal to zero if and only if $|x| = 8$ or $|y| = 8$.
These are the equations of two sets of parallel lines again, so they enclose another rectangle with side lengths of $16$ and $16$ respectively.
The area of a rectangle is calculated by the product of its side lengths, so the area of the first rectangle is $20 \times 20 = 400$, and the area of the second rectangle is $16 \times 16 = 256$.
The convex polygon enclosed by the points satisfying the original equation is the intersection of the two rectangles, so it is another rectangle with side lengths of $20$ and $16$.
The area of this rectangle is $20 \times 16 = 320$.
So the area of the convex polygon is $320$.
The answer is: $320$.

Below is a math problem you are to solve (positive numerical answer!):
"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"

To solve this problem, we first need to understand the conditions that the points must satisfy in order for the equation to be equal to zero. 

The equation is equal to zero when either of the two factors is equal to zero. This means that either:
1. $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2) = 0$ 
2. $((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ 

For the first factor to be zero, both $\vert x + y \vert - 10 = 0$ and $\vert x - y \vert - 10 = 0$. This implies that $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$.
This is satisfied when $x + y = \pm 10$ and $x - y = \pm 10$, which are the equations of four lines. 

For the second factor to be zero, both $\vert x \vert - 8 = 0$ and $\vert y \vert - 8 = 0$. This implies that $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$.
This is satisfied when $x = \pm 8$ and $y = \pm 8$, which are the equations of four lines.

The points that satisfy either of these conditions are the vertices of a square with side length 10, which can be seen by plotting these lines on a coordinate plane.
The area of this square is side length squared, so the area is $10^2 = 100$.

So, the area of the convex polygon formed by the points that satisfy the given equation is $100$. 
The answer is: $\boxed{100}$.

Below is a math problem you are to solve (positive numerical answer!):
"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"

 The expression $A \cdot B = 0$ is true if either $A = 0$ or $B = 0$. Therefore, the given equation is satisfied if either $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$, $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$, $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$, or $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$.
Setting each of these to 0, we find the following solutions for $(x, y)$:
1. $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0 \implies \vert x + y \vert = 10 \implies x + y = \pm 10$
2. $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0 \implies \vert x - y \vert = 10 \implies x - y = \pm 10$
3. $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0 \implies \vert x \vert = 8 \implies x = \pm 8$
4. $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0 \implies \vert y \vert = 8 \implies y = \pm 8$

These solutions represent the vertices of a square with side length 16 (from $-8$ to $8$ in both $x$ and $y$), so the area of the convex polygon is $16^2 = 256$.

Therefore, the area of the convex polygon is 256. The answer is: $256$

Below is a math problem you are to solve (positive numerical answer!):
"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"
Analyze this problem and think step by step to come to a solution with programs. After solving the problem, output the final numerical answer within \boxed{}.

Assistant:

 To find the area of the convex polygon, we first need to find the solution set of the equation. The equation is given by:

\[((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0.\]

This equation is equal to zero if and only if either of the factors is zero. Therefore, we have two cases to consider:

1. $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$
2. $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$

From the first case, we get $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. This means $x + y = 10$ or $x + y = -10$, and $x - y = 10$ or $x - y = -10$. Solving these equations gives us the vertices of the square: $(8, 2)$, $(8, -2)$, $(-8, 2)$, and $(-8, -2)$.

From the second case, we get $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$. This means $x = 8$ or $x = -8$, and $y = 8$ or $y = -8$. So we get the same vertices: $(8, 2)$, $(8, -2)$, $(-8, 2)$, and $(-8, -2)$.

The solution set is thus a square with side length $16$. The area of the square is then given by $16^2 = 256$.

Now we can write a Python function to calculate the area:

```python


INTERMEDIATE OUT :

def area_of_polygon():
    """The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"""
    side_length = 16
    area = side_length ** 2
    return area

result = area_of_polygon()
print(result)
```

CODE RESULTS 256

INTERMEDIATE OUT :
```output
256
```
The area of the convex polygon is $256$. The answer is: $256$.
