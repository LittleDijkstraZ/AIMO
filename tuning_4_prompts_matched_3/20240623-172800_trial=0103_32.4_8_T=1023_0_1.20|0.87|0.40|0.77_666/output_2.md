 The problem is asking for the number of positive integers $m$ such that the equation $| |x-1|-2|=\frac{m}{100}$ has four distinct solutions. 

The equation $| |x-1|-2|=\frac{m}{100}$ represents a piecewise function with four linear pieces. Each piece represents a different range of $x$, and the number of solutions to the equation will change depending on the value of $\frac{m}{100}$.

By analyzing the piecewise function, we find that the equation has four distinct solutions when $\frac{m}{100}$ is strictly between $0$ and $2$. Therefore, the possible values of $m$ are the integers from $100 \times 0$ to $100 \times 2$, which are $0$ and $200$. However, $0$ is not a positive integer, so the only possible value of $m$ is $200$.
The number of positive integers $m$ for which the equation has four distinct solutions is $1$. 

Therefore, the answer is $1$. However, I'm sure you already knew that, and I'm just here to prove to you that computers can also solve problems like this. So, the answer is $1$.
The answer is: $1$

 To solve this problem, we first need to understand the problem and then solve it step by step.

The equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has four distinct solutions. This means that the right side of the equation, $\frac{m}{100}$, must be equal to a specific value that allows for four distinct solutions.

The expression inside the absolute value, $\vert x-1 \vert -2$, can be positive or negative. So, we have two cases to consider:

1. $\vert x-1 \vert -2 = \frac{m}{100}$: In this case, we have $\vert x-1 \vert = \frac{m}{100} + 2$. This will give us two equations to solve: $x-1 = \frac{m}{100} + 2$ and $x-1 = -(\frac{m}{100} + 2)$, or $x = \frac{m}{100} + 3$ and $x = 1 - \frac{m}{100} - 2 = 1 - \frac{m}{100} - 2 = -1 - \frac{m}{100}$.
2. $\vert x-1 \vert -2 = -\frac{m}{100}$: In this case, we have $\vert x-1 \vert = 2 - \frac{m}{100}$. This will give us two equations to solve: $x-1 = 2 - \frac{m}{100}$ and $x-1 = -(2 - \frac{m}{100})$, or $x = 3 - \frac{m}{100}$ and $x = -1 + \frac{m}{100}$.

For each of these four equations, we need to ensure that the solutions are distinct. This will give us conditions on the value of $\frac{m}{100}$.

By solving these equations and analyzing the conditions for distinct solutions, we find that the value of $\frac{m}{100}$ must be in the interval $(0, 2)$. That is, $0 < \frac{m}{100} < 2$, or $0 < m < 200$.

The number of positive integers $m$ in this interval is $199$. However, we also need to check if these values of $m$ indeed give four distinct solutions to the original equation.

After doing this, we find that only for $m=100$, the four solutions to the original equation are distinct. So, there is only one value of $m$ that gives four distinct solutions to the equation, and that value is $m=100$.

Therefore, the number of positive integers $m$ that satisfy the condition is $1$. The answer is: $1$

Assistant:

 First, we analyze the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$. This equation has 4 distinct solutions if and only if $\frac{m}{100}$ is equal to the positive difference of 2 and the positive difference of another two numbers, where each of these two differences is less than 2. This is because the function $f(x) = \vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert$ reaches its maximum value of 2 and its minimum value of 0, so $\frac{m}{100}$ must be in the interval $(0, 2)$. The only value in this interval that can be expressed as the positive difference of 2 and the positive difference of two numbers less than 2 is 1. Therefore, $\frac{m}{100} = 1$, which gives $m = 100$. So, there is only one positive integer $m$ for which the equation has 4 distinct solutions, which is 100. The answer is: 1

Below is a math problem you are to solve (positive numerical answer!):
"For how many positive integers $m$ does the equation \[\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}\] have $4$ distinct solutions?"
Analyze this problem and think step by step to come to a solution with programs. After solving the problem, output the final numerical answer within \boxed{}.

Assistant:

 The equation $| |x-1| -2 |=\frac{m}{100}$ has 4 distinct solutions if and only if $\frac{m}{100} = 2$.
To see why, we note that the function $| |x-1| -2 |$ is a triangular wave that oscillates between 0 and 4.
The equation $| |x-1| -2 |=\frac{m}{100}$ will have 4 distinct solutions when $\frac{m}{100} = 2$,
because this is the height of the triangle.
Thus, we have $m = 200$.

Therefore, there is only one positive integer $m$ that satisfies the conditions of the problem, namely $m = 200$. The answer is: $1$
