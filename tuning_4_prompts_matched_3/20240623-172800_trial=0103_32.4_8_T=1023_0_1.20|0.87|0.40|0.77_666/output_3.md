Below is a math problem you are to solve (positive numerical answer!):
"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"
Analyze this problem and think step by step to come to a solution with programs. After solving the problem, output the final numerical answer within \boxed{}.

Assistant:


The equation given, $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$, will be true if either of the two factors is zero.

The first factor will be zero if either $\vert x + y \vert - 10 = 0$ or $\vert x - y \vert - 10 = 0$, which simplifies to $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ or $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. These equations represent a square with side length 20, centered at the origin.

The second factor will be zero if either $\vert x \vert - 8 = 0$ or $\vert y \vert - 8 = 0$, which simplifies to $\vert x \vert = 8$ or $\vert y \vert = 8$. These equations represent a square with side length 16, centered at the origin.

The intersection of these two squares forms a smaller square with side length 8, centered at the origin. The area of this square is $8^2 = 64$. Therefore, the area of the convex polygon is 64 square units.

Here is the python code to calculate the area of the convex polygon:
```python

This problem can be solved using mathematical analysis. The equation given is a product of two terms equal to zero. This means that either one of the terms is zero, or both are zero.

The term $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2$ is zero when $\vert x + y \vert = 10$, which represents a square with side length 20. The term $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2$ is zero when $\vert x - y \vert = 10$, which also represents a square with side length 20. The term $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2$ is zero when $\vert x \vert = 8$, which represents a square with side length 16 in the x-direction. The term $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2$ is zero when $\vert y \vert = 8$, which represents a square with side length 16 in the y-direction.

The intersection of these four squares forms a square with side length 16, and four smaller squares with side length 8 each. The total area of the convex polygon is the sum of the areas of these five squares.

The area of the square with side length 16 is $16^2 = 256$. Each of the four smaller squares has an area of $8^2 = 64$, so the total area of the four smaller squares is $4 \times 64 = 256$. Therefore, the area of the convex polygon is $256 + 256 = 512$. The answer is: $\boxed{512}$

 The given equation is equal to zero if either of the two factors is equal to zero. The factors are:
1. $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)$
2. $((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2)$
For the first factor to be zero, both $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)$ and $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)$ must be zero. This implies $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. The only way this can be true is if $x = y = 5$ or $x = -y = -5$.
For the second factor to be zero, both $(\vert x \vert - 8)$ and $(\vert y \vert - 8)$ must be zero. This implies $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$. The only way this can be true is if $x = 8$ or $x = -8$ and $y = 8$ or $y = -8$.
Combining these results, we find that the points that satisfy the equation are $(5,5)$, $(-5,-5)$, $(8,8)$, $(-8,8)$, $(8,-8)$, and $(-8,-8)$. These points form a square with side length 10. The area of this square is $10^2 = 100$. Therefore, the area of the convex polygon is 100. The answer is: $100$

"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"

Assistant:

 The given equation is $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$. 

For the product of two numbers to be zero, either one of them must be zero. Therefore, we have two separate cases:

1. $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$.
2. $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$.

From the first case, we get $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. This gives us the lines $x + y = 10$, $x + y = -10$, $x - y = 10$, and $x - y = -10$. These lines form a rectangle with sides of length 20 units (along the x and y axes).

From the second case, we get $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$. This gives us the lines $x = 8$, $x = -8$, $y = 8$, and $y = -8$. These lines form a square with side length 16 units.

The intersection of these two regions is a square with side length 16 units. The area of this square is $16^2 = 256$ square units. Therefore, the area of the convex polygon is 256 square units. The answer is: $256$

Below is a math problem you are to solve (positive numerical answer!):
"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"

Assistant:


The given equation is $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$. The product of two factors equals zero if and only if one or both of the factors are zero. So we have two cases to consider:

1. $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ and $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$.
2. $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ and $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$.

For the first case, we have $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x \vert = 8$. The solutions are:
- For $\vert x + y \vert = 10$: $x + y = 10$ or $x + y = -10$.
- For $\vert x \vert = 8$: $x = 8$ or $x = -8$.

By considering all possible combinations, we get four lines: $x + y = 10$, $x + y = -10$, $x = 8$, and $x = -8$. These lines form a rectangle.

For the second case, we have $\vert x - y \vert = 10$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$. The solutions are:
- For $\vert x - y \vert = 10$: $x - y = 10$ or $x - y = -10$.
- For $\vert y \vert = 8$: $y = 8$ or $y = -8$.

By considering all possible combinations, we get four more lines: $x - y = 10$, $x - y = -10$, $y = 8$, and $y = -8$. These lines also form a rectangle.

The two rectangles overlap, forming a single larger rectangle. The length of the rectangle is $20$ (from $-8$ to $12$ on the x-axis) and the width is $16$ (from $-8$ to $8$ on the y-axis). So the area of the convex polygon is $20 \times 16 = 320$. The answer is: $320$

Assistant:

 This problem can be solved through analyzing the properties of absolute values and square functions. The equation $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ implies that one of the following conditions must be true:

1. $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0 \Rightarrow \vert x + y \vert = 10$.
2. $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0 \Rightarrow \vert x - y \vert = 10$.
3. $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0 \Rightarrow \vert x \vert = 8$.
4. $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0 \Rightarrow \vert y \vert = 8$.

The conditions 3 and 4 give us the ranges for $x$ and $y$ as $-8 \leq x \leq 8$ and $-8 \leq y \leq 8$.

The conditions 1 and 2 give us the ranges for $x$ and $y$ as either $x + y = \pm 10$ or $x - y = \pm 10$. Solving these equations, we get the four lines: $y = -x + 10$, $y = -x - 10$, $y = x + 10$, and $y = x - 10$.

These lines form a square with side length $20$, so the area of the polygon is $20^2 = 400$.

Therefore, the area of the convex polygon is $400$. The answer is: $400$

 To solve this problem, we need to understand the properties of absolute values and how they relate to the given equation. The equation
$$((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$$
is true if and only if either of the two factors is equal to zero. This means that one of the following two conditions must hold:
1. $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$
2. $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$
For the first condition to be true, we must have $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. This means that $x + y = \pm 10$ and $x - y = \pm 10$. Solving these equations, we find that the possible pairs of $(x, y)$ are $(5, 5)$, $(-5, -5)$, $(5, -5)$, and $(-5, 5)$.
For the second condition to be true, we must have $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$. This means that $x = \pm 8$ and $y = \pm 8$. The possible pairs of $(x, y)$ are $(8, 8)$, $(-8, -8)$, $(8, -8)$, and $(-8, 8)$.
The points that satisfy either condition form a square with side length 10, and the area of this square is $10^2 = 100$.

To summarize, the area of the convex polygon formed by the points that satisfy the given equation is 100 square units.

The given equation is a product of two terms equal to zero, which means either of the terms must be zero.
The terms $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2$ and $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2$ being zero implies that $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$.
This means that the points must lie on the lines $x + y = 10$ and $x - y = 10$.
Similarly, the terms $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2$ and $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2$ being zero implies that $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$.
This means that the points must lie on the lines $x = 8$ and $y = 8$.
The intersection of these lines forms a square with side length 10 (the distance between the lines $x + y = 10$ and $x - y = 10$).
The area of this square is $10 \times 10 = 100$.
So, the area of the convex polygon is $100$. The answer is: $100$

Assistant:

 The given equation is equal to zero if and only if at least one of the factors is zero. Therefore, the points that satisfy the equation are the points that satisfy either of the following two conditions:

1. $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0 \Rightarrow \vert x + y \vert = 10$, or
2. $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0 \Rightarrow \vert x - y \vert = 10$, or
3. $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0 \Rightarrow \vert x \vert = 8$, or
4. $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0 \Rightarrow \vert y \vert = 8$.

The conditions 1 and 2 define two lines parallel to the line $y = -x$ and $y = x$ with a distance of 10 units from them. The conditions 3 and 4 define two lines parallel to the x and y axes at a distance of 8 units from them. These lines form a rectangle with side lengths of 16 units and 20 units. The area of this rectangle is $16 \times 20 = 320$ square units. Therefore, the area of the convex polygon is 320 square units.

Here is a Python code to compute the area of the polygon:

"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"
Analyze this problem and think step by step to come to a solution with programs. After solving the problem, output the final numerical answer within \boxed{}.

Assistant:

 The equation is equal to zero if either $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$, or if either $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$.
If $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$, then $\vert x + y \vert = 10$, which means $x + y = \pm 10$.
If $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$, then $\vert x - y \vert = 10$, which means $x - y = \pm 10$.
If $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$, then $\vert x \vert = 8$, which means $x = \pm 8$.
If $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$, then $\vert y \vert = 8$, which means $y = \pm 8$.

Putting these conditions together, we get that the points that satisfy the equation are those that are on the lines $x + y = \pm 10$, $x - y = \pm 10$, $x = \pm 8$, and $y = \pm 8$.
These lines form a square with side length 16 (since the square is determined by the intersections of the lines $x + y = \pm 10$, $x - y = \pm 10$, $x = \pm 8$, and $y = \pm 8$).

The area of a square with side length $s$ is $s^2$, so the area of this square is $16^2 = 256$.
Therefore, the area of the convex polygon is 256.

Analyze this problem and think step by step to come to a solution with programs. After solving the problem, output the final numerical answer within \boxed{}.

Assistant:

 The problem statement simplifies to finding the area of the points $(x, y)$ that satisfy either $(\vert x + y \vert - 10) = 0$ or $(\vert x - y \vert - 10) = 0$ or $(\vert x \vert - 8) = 0$ or $(\vert y \vert - 8) = 0$.
These conditions can be further simplified to:
- For the first condition: $\vert x + y \vert = 10$, which represents a square with side length 20 centered at the origin.
- For the second condition: $\vert x - y \vert = 10$, which also represents a square with side length 20 centered at the origin.
- For the third condition: $\vert x \vert = 8$, which represents a rectangle with side lengths 16 and 8 centered at the origin.
- For the fourth condition: $\vert y \vert = 8$, which represents another rectangle with side lengths 16 and 8 centered at the origin.

The points that satisfy any of these conditions form a shape that is the intersection of four squares and two rectangles. This shape is a square with side length 16, so its area is $16^2 = 256$. The answer is: $256$
