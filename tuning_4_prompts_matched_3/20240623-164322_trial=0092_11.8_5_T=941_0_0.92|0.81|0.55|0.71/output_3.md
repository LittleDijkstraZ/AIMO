"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"

The given equation is a product of two expressions equal to zero. Therefore, either the first expression is zero or the second expression is zero.

The first expression is $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)$, which equals zero if and only if $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. These conditions define a square with side length 20.

The second expression is $((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2)$, which equals zero if and only if $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$. These conditions define a square with side length 16.

The intersection of these two squares is the convex polygon we are interested in. This intersection is another square with side length 8.

The area of this square is $8^2 = 64$.

Therefore, the area of the convex polygon is 64.

Here is a Python code to calculate the area of the convex polygon:
```python

    side_length = 8
    area = side_length ** 2
    return area

result = polygon_area()
print(result)
```

The area of the convex polygon is 64. The answer is $\boxed{64}$.

Below is a math problem you are to solve (positive numerical answer!):
"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"
Analyze this problem and think step by step to come to a solution with programs. After solving the problem, output the final numerical answer within \boxed{}.

Assistant:

 The given equation is a product of two terms, and for this product to be zero, one of the terms must be zero. Therefore, we have two sets of equations to solve:

1. $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ and $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$.
2. $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ and $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$.

For the first set of equations, we have:
- $\vert x + y \vert = 10$, so $x + y = 10$ or $x + y = -10$.
- $\vert x \vert = 8$, so $x = 8$ or $x = -8$.

Similarly, for the second set of equations, we have:
- $\vert x - y \vert = 10$, so $x - y = 10$ or $x - y = -10$.
- $\vert y \vert = 8$, so $y = 8$ or $y = -8$.

Now, we can find the vertices of the polygon by solving these equations:

1. $x + y = 10$ and $x = 8$ gives $y = 2$.
2. $x + y = 10$ and $x = -8$ gives $y = 18$.
3. $x + y = 10$ and $y = 8$ gives $x = 2$.
4. $x + y = 10$ and $y = -8$ gives $x = 18$.
5. $x + y = -10$ and $x = 8$ gives $y = -18$.
6. $x + y = -10$ and $x = -8$ gives $y = -2$.
7. $x + y = -10$ and $y = 8$ gives $x = -18$.
8. $x + y = -10$ and $y = -8$ gives $x = -2$.

The vertices of the polygon are: $(8,2)$, $(8,18)$, $(2,8)$, $(18,8)$, $(-8,-2)$, $(-8,-18)$, $(-2,-8)$, and $(-18,-8)$.

The polygon is a square with side length $16$. The area of a square is the side length squared, so the area of this square is $16^2 = 256$. The answer is: $256$

The given equation is a product of two expressions equal to zero. Therefore, either the first expression is zero or the second expression is zero.

The first expression is $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)$. This expression is zero if and only if both $\vert x + y \vert - 10 = 0$ and $\vert x - y \vert - 10 = 0$, which implies $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. These equations represent a square with side length 20.

The second expression is $((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2)$. This expression is zero if and only if both $\vert x \vert - 8 = 0$ and $\vert y \vert - 8 = 0$, which implies $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$. These equations represent a square with side length 16.

The first square has side length 20, and the second square has side length 16. The intersection of these two squares is a smaller square that is also a subset of both the first and second squares. The side length of this smaller square is the difference of the side lengths of the first and second squares, which is $20 - 16 = 4$. Therefore, the area of the convex polygon is the area of the smaller square, which is $4^2 = 16$. The answer is: $16$

The first expression is $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)$. This expression is zero if and only if $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. These are the conditions for a square with side length 10.

The second expression is $((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2)$. This expression is zero if and only if $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$. These are the conditions for a square with side length 8.

Therefore, the points satisfying the given equation are the points that lie either in the square with side length 10 or in the square with side length 8. The convex polygon that they enclose is the union of these two squares.

The area of a square with side length $s$ is $s^2$. So, the area of the square with side length 10 is $10^2 = 100$, and the area of the square with side length 8 is $8^2 = 64$. Therefore, the area of the convex polygon is $100 + 64 = 164$.

"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"
Analyze this problem and think step by step to come to a solution with programs. After solving the problem, output the final numerical answer within \boxed{}.

Assistant:

 The equation is satisfied if either $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$.
The first two equations imply $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$, which are the equations of two lines parallel to the coordinate axes at a distance of 10 units from the origin.
The last two equations imply $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$, which are the equations of two squares centered at the origin with side length 16.
The intersection of these lines and squares form a convex polygon, which is a square with side length 16.
The area of this square is $16^2 = 256$. The answer is: $256$

 The given equation is a product of two expressions equal to zero, which means that either the first expression is zero or the second expression is zero. 

The first expression is $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)$. This expression is zero if and only if both $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. This implies that the points $(x, y)$ lie on a square with side length 20.

The second expression is $((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2)$. This expression is zero if and only if both $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$, which implies that the points $(x, y)$ lie on a square with side length 16.

The intersection of these two regions is a square with side length 8. The area of this square is $8^2 = 64$. Therefore, the area of the convex polygon is 64.

The Python code to compute this area is as follows:
