Question (hint: positive numerical answer):
"What is the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ when $x$ and $y$ range over all real numbers such that $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$?"
Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:


We first notice that the equation $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$ can be rewritten as $|2y-x| + |2x-y| = 40$.
By the triangle inequality, $|a| + |b| \ge |a+b|$, so we have $|2y-x| + |2x-y| \ge |(2y-x) + (2x-y)| = |y| = 40$.
Therefore, $|y| = 20$.
Since $|y| = 20$, we have $y = 20$ or $y = -20$.
If $y = 20$, then $|x-40| + |2x-20| = 40$.
By the triangle inequality, $|x-40| + |2x-20| \ge |(x-40) + (2x-20)| = |3x-60|$.
So we have $|3x-60| = 40$, which gives $3x-60 = 40$ or $3x-60 = -40$.
Solving these equations, we find $x = 40$ or $x = 20$.
If $y = -20$, then $|x+40| + |2x+20| = 40$.
By the triangle inequality, $|x+40| + |2x+20| \ge |(x+40) + (2x+20)| = |3x+60|$.
So we have $|3x+60| = 40$, which gives $3x+60 = 40$ or $3x+60 = -40$.
Solving these equations, we find $x = -20$ or $x = -40$.
Now we substitute these values of $x$ and $y$ into the expression $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$:
- For $x = 40$ and $y = 20$, we get $5(40)^2 + 5(20)^2 - 8(40)(20) = 8000$.
- For $x = 20$ and $y = 20$, we get $5(20)^2 + 5(20)^2 - 8(20)(20) = 2000$.
- For $x = -20$ and $y = 20$, we get $5(-20)^2 + 5(20)^2 - 8(-20)(20) = 2000$.
- For $x = -40$ and $y = 20$, we get $5(-40)^2 + 5(20)^2 - 8(-40)(20) = 8000$.
Therefore, the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ is 2000. The answer is: $2000$.

Question (hint: positive numerical answer):
"What is the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ when $x$ and $y$ range over all real numbers such that $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$?"
Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:


First, let's simplify the given equation $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$.
Using the property $|a-b| = |b-a|$, we can rewrite the equation as $|x-2y| + |2y-x| = 40$.
Then, we can use the property $|a+b| = |a| + |b|$ to simplify further: $|x-2y| + |- (x-2y)| = 40$.
This simplifies to $2|x-2y| = 40$, so $|x-2y| = 20$.
This equation represents a set of points in the plane where the distance between the point $(x, y)$ and the line $x = 2y$ is 20.
Now, let's substitute $x = 2y + k$ into the expression $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ to find its minimum value.
We get $5(2y+k)^2+5y^2-8(2y+k)y = 5(4y^2+4ky+k^2) + 5y^2 - 16y^2 - 8ky = 20y^2 + 20ky + 5k^2 - 16y^2 - 8ky = 4y^2 + 12ky + 5k^2$.
To find the minimum value of this expression, we can take the derivative with respect to $y$ and set it equal to zero.
The derivative is $8y + 12k = 0$, so $y = -\frac{3}{2}k$.
Substituting this value of $y$ back into the equation $|x-2y| = 20$, we get $|2y+k - 2(-\frac{3}{2}k)| = 20$, or $|2(-\frac{3}{2}k) + k + 3k| = 20$.
Simplifying, we get $|-3k + 4k| = 20$, or $|k| = 20$.
So $k = \pm 20$.
Substituting $k = 20$ into the expression $4y^2 + 12ky + 5k^2$, we get $4(-\frac{3}{2}k)^2 + 12k(-\frac{3}{2}k) + 5k^2 = 4(-\frac{3}{2} \cdot 20)^2 + 12 \cdot 20(-\frac{3}{2} \cdot 20) + 5 \cdot 20^2 = 4 \cdot 900 - 12 \cdot 20^2 + 20^2 = 3600 - 2400 + 400 = 2000$.
Substituting $k = -20$ into the expression $4y^2 + 12ky + 5k^2$, we get the same result: $4(-\frac{3}{2}(-20))^2 + 12(-20)(-\frac{3}{2}(-20)) + 5(-20)^2 = 3600 - 2400 + 400 = 2000$.
So the minimum value of the expression $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ is 2000. The answer is: $2000$.

Question (hint: positive numerical answer):
"What is the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ when $x$ and $y$ range over all real numbers such that $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$?"
Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:



First, we observe that $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$ can be rewritten as $|x-2y| + |2y-x| = 40$, which is equivalent to $|x-2y| - |2y-x| = 0$.

By the property of absolute value, we have $|a| - |b| = 0$ if and only if $a = b$ or $a = -b$. Therefore, we have $x-2y = 2y-x$, which simplifies to $x = 2y$.

Substituting $x = 2y$ into the given expression $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$, we get
\[5(2y)^2 + 5y^2 - 8(2y)(y) = 20y^2 + 5y^2 - 16y^2 = 9y^2.\]

To find the minimum value of $9y^2$, we need to consider the constraint $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$. Substituting $x = 2y$ into this constraint gives $|2y-2y| + |y-4y| = 40$, which simplifies to $|0| + |-3y| = 40$, or $3|y| = 40$. Thus, $|y| = \frac{40}{3}$.

The minimum value of $9y^2$ occurs when $y$ takes its minimum absolute value, which is $-\frac{40}{3}$. Thus, the minimum value of $9y^2$ is $9 \left(-\frac{40}{3}\right)^2 = 9 \cdot \frac{1600}{9} = 1600$.

Therefore, the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ when $x$ and $y$ range over all real numbers such that $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$ is $1600$. The answer is: $1600$

"What is the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ when $x$ and $y$ range over all real numbers such that $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$?"
Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:


First, we can rewrite the equation $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$ as $|x-2y| + |2y-x| = 40$.
This equation is equivalent to $|x-2y| - |2y-x| = 0$, which means $|x-2y| = |2y-x|$.
This is only possible if $x-2y = 2y-x$, or $x-2y = -(2y-x)$.
The first case gives $x-2y = 2y-x$, which simplifies to $x = 2y$.
The second case gives $x-2y = -(2y-x)$, which simplifies to $x = -2y$.
So we have two cases to consider: $x = 2y$ and $x = -2y$.
For the case $x = 2y$, we substitute into the expression $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ to get $5(2y)^2 + 5y^2 - 8(2y)(y) = 20y^2 + 5y^2 - 16y^2 = 9y^2$.
For the case $x = -2y$, we substitute into the expression $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ to get $5(-2y)^2 + 5y^2 - 8(-2y)(y) = 20y^2 + 5y^2 + 16y^2 = 41y^2$.
Since $y$ can be any real number, the minimum value of $9y^2$ and $41y^2$ is achieved when $y=0$.
When $y=0$, $x=0$ for the case $x = 2y$, and $x=0$ for the case $x = -2y$.
So in both cases, we have $x=0$ and $y=0$.
Substituting these values into the expression $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ gives $5(0)^2 + 5(0)^2 - 8(0)(0) = 0$.
Therefore, the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ is 0. The answer is: $0$

Question (hint: positive numerical answer):
"What is the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ when $x$ and $y$ range over all real numbers such that $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$?"
Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:


First, let's rewrite the equation $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$ as $|2y-x| + |2x-y| = 40$.
By the triangle inequality, we know that $|a| + |b| \geq |a+b|$, so $|2y-x| + |2x-y| \geq |(2y-x) + (2x-y)| = |y| = |2y/2| \geq 2|y|/2 = |y|$.
Therefore, we have $|x-2y| + |y-2x| \geq |y|$.
Since $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$, we have $|y| \leq 40$.
So $-40 \leq y \leq 40$.
Now, let's consider the expression $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$.
We can rewrite it as $5(x^2+y^2) - 8xy = 5[(x-y)^2 + 2xy] - 8xy = 5(x-y)^2 + 3xy$.
By the AM-GM inequality, we have $2xy \leq (x-y)^2 + 4xy$, so $3xy \leq (x-y)^2$.
Therefore, $5(x-y)^2 + 3xy \leq 5(x-y)^2 + (x-y)^2 = 6(x-y)^2$.
Since $-40 \leq y \leq 40$, we know that $x-2y$ is bounded, so $x-y$ is also bounded.
Let's say the maximum value of $|x-y|$ is $M$.
Then, the maximum value of $6(x-y)^2$ is $6M^2$.
To minimize $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$, we need to minimize $6(x-y)^2$.
Since $6(x-y)^2$ is always nonnegative, the minimum value is $0$.
Therefore, the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ is achieved when $x=y$.
When $x=y$, the equation $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$ becomes $|x-2x| + |x-2x| = 40$, which simplifies to $2|x-2x| = 40$.
This gives us $2|0| = 40$, which is a contradiction.
So we must have made a mistake somewhere.
Let's go back and check our work.
We found that $5x^2+5y^2-8xy \leq 6(x-y)^2$.
But we also know that $3xy \leq (x-y)^2$.
Adding these two inequalities, we get $5x^2+5y^2-8xy \leq 6(x-y)^2 + (x-y)^2 = 7(x-y)^2$.
Now, since $-40 \leq y \leq 40$, we know that $x-2y$ is bounded, so $x-y$ is also bounded.
Let's say the maximum value of $|x-y|$ is $M$.
Then, the maximum value of $7(x-y)^2$ is $7M^2$.
To minimize $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$, we need to minimize $7(x-y)^2$.
Since $7(x-y)^2$ is always nonnegative, the minimum value is $0$.
Therefore, the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ is achieved when $x=y$.
When $x=y$, the equation $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$ becomes $|x-2x| + |x-2x| = 40$, which simplifies to $2|x-2x| = 40$.
This gives us $2|0| = 40$, which is a contradiction.
So we must have made a mistake somewhere.

Question (hint: positive numerical answer):
"What is the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ when $x$ and $y$ range over all real numbers such that $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$?"
Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:


We are given the equation $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$.
First, let's simplify the equation. Using the property $|a| + |b| = |a+b|$ if $a$ and $b$ have the same sign, we can rewrite the equation as $|x-2y - (y-2x)| = 40$, which simplifies to $|x-2y - y+2x| = 40$, or $|3x - 3y| = 40$.
This further simplifies to $|3(x-y)| = 40$, and since the absolute value of a number is always non-negative, we can remove the absolute value signs to get $3(x-y) = 40$ or $3(x-y) = -40$.
Now, let's consider the two cases separately.
Case 1: $3(x-y) = 40$. Dividing both sides by 3 gives $x-y = \frac{40}{3}$. Rearranging the equation gives $x = y + \frac{40}{3}$.
Case 2: $3(x-y) = -40$. Dividing both sides by 3 gives $x-y = -\frac{40}{3}$. Rearranging the equation gives $x = y - \frac{40}{3}$.
Now, let's substitute these expressions for $x$ into the expression we want to minimize, $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$.
For Case 1, we have $x = y + \frac{40}{3}$, so substituting into the expression gives $5(y + \frac{40}{3})^2 + 5y^2 - 8y(y + \frac{40}{3})$.
Expanding and simplifying, we get $5y^2 + 400y/3 + 8000/9 + 5y^2 - 8y^2 - 320y/3$.
Combining like terms, we get $-3y^2 + \frac{40y^2}{3} - \frac{320y}{3} + \frac{8000}{9}$.
For Case 2, we have $x = y - \frac{40}{3}$, so substituting into the expression gives $5(y - \frac{40}{3})^2 + 5y^2 - 8y(y - \frac{40}{3})$.
Expanding and simplifying, we get $5y^2 - 400y/3 + 8000/9 + 5y^2 - 8y^2 + 320y/3$.
Combining like terms, we get $-3y^2 - \frac{40y^2}{3} + \frac{320y}{3} + \frac{8000}{9}$.
Since the expression we want to minimize is the same in both cases, we can just consider the simpler case, say Case 1.
The expression we have now is $-3y^2 + \frac{40y^2}{3} - \frac{320y}{3} + \frac{8000}{9}$.
To minimize this expression, we can take the derivative with respect to $y$ and set it equal to zero.
The derivative is $-6y + \frac{80y}{3} - \frac{320}{3}$, and setting this equal to zero gives $-6y + \frac{80y}{3} - \frac{320}{3} = 0$.
Multiplying through by 3 to clear the fraction gives $-18y + 80y - 320 = 0$, or $62y = 320$, so $y = \frac{320}{62} = \frac{160}{31}$.
Substituting this value of $y$ back into the equation $x = y + \frac{40}{3}$ gives $x = \frac{160}{31} + \frac{40}{3} = \frac{480 + 1240}{93} = \frac{1720}{93}$.
Now, substituting the values of $x$ and $y$ back into the expression $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$, we get $5\left(\frac{1720}{93}\right)^2 + 5\left(\frac{160}{31}\right)^2 - 8\left(\frac{1720}{93}\right)\left(\frac{160}{31}\right)$.
After simplifying, we find that this expression equals $\boxed{-400}$.
So the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ is -400.
The answer is: -400

Question (hint: positive numerical answer):
"What is the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ when $x$ and $y$ range over all real numbers such that $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$?"
Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:


We can rewrite the equation $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$ as $|2y-x| + |2x-y| = 40$.
By the triangle inequality, we know that $|a| + |b| \geq |a+b|$, so we have $|2y-x| + |2x-y| \geq |(2y-x) + (2x-y)| = |y| = 40$.
Thus, $|y| = 20$.
Without loss of generality, let $y = 20$. Then, the equation $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$ becomes $|x-40| + |20-x| = 40$.
By the triangle inequality again, we have $|x-40| + |20-x| \geq |(x-40) + (20-x)| = 20$.
Thus, $|x-40| + |20-x| = 20$.
Without loss of generality, let $x-40 = 0$, so $x = 40$.
Now we substitute $x = 40$ and $y = 20$ into the expression $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$, we get
\[5(40)^2 + 5(20)^2 - 8(40)(20) = 8000 + 2000 - 6400 = 3600.\]
Therefore, the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ is $3600$. The answer is: $3600$

Step-by-step Solution:


First, we rewrite the given equation $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$ as $|2y-x| + |2x-y| = 40$.
By the triangle inequality, we have $|2y-x| + |2x-y| \ge |(2y-x) + (2x-y)| = |y| = y$ (since $y$ is real).
So, $y = 40$.
Then, we substitute $y = 40$ into the equation $|x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40$, we get $|x-80| + |40-2x| = 40$.
By the triangle inequality again, we have $|x-80| + |40-2x| \ge |(x-80) + (40-2x)| = |-40| = 40$.
So, the equation $|x-80| + |40-2x| = 40$ is actually an equality.
This means that the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ occurs when $(x, y) = (40, 40)$.
Now, we substitute $x = 40$ and $y = 40$ into the expression $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$, we get $5(40)^2+5(40)^2-8(40)(40) = 4000$.
So, the minimum value of $5x^2+5y^2-8xy$ is $4000$. The answer is: $4000$.
