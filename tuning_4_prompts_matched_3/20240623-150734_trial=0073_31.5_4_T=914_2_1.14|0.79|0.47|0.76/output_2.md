Question (hint: positive numerical answer):
"For how many positive integers $m$ does the equation \[\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}\] have $4$ distinct solutions?"
Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:


The equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has 4 distinct solutions if and only if $\frac{m}{100}$ is equal to the positive difference between 2 and the positive difference between $x$ and 1. This means that we are looking for the number of positive integers $m$ such that the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has 4 distinct solutions.

To find the number of possible values of $m$, we need to consider the possible values of the expression on the right side of the equation, $\frac{m}{100}$.

Since the absolute value function is always non-negative, we know that the right side of the equation, $\frac{m}{100}$, must be positive. Therefore, $m$ must be a positive integer.

Also, since the equation has 4 distinct solutions, the value of $\frac{m}{100}$ must be such that the expression on the left side of the equation can be broken down into two absolute value expressions that result in 4 distinct solutions.

The expression $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert$ is equal to 0 when $\vert x-1 \vert -2 = 0$, which implies $\vert x-1 \vert = 2$. This gives us two possibilities: $x-1 = 2$ or $x-1 = -2$, which results in $x = 3$ or $x = -1$. Thus, the expression $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert$ is equal to 0 when $x = 3$ or $x = -1$.

Similarly, the expression $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert$ is equal to 1 when $\vert x-1 \vert -2 = \pm 1$, which implies $\vert x-1 \vert = 3$ or $\vert x-1 \vert = 1$. This gives us three possibilities: $x-1 = 3$ or $x-1 = -3$ or $x-1 = 1$ or $x-1 = -1$, which results in $x = 4$ or $x = -2$ or $x = 2$ or $x = 0$. Thus, the expression $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert$ is equal to 1 when $x = 4$, $x = -2$, $x = 2$ or $x = 0$.

Therefore, the value of $\frac{m}{100}$ must be 1 for the equation to have 4 distinct solutions. This implies that $m = 100$.

So, there is only one positive integer $m$ such that the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has 4 distinct solutions, and that is $m = 100$. The answer is: $1$

Question (hint: positive numerical answer):
"For how many positive integers $m$ does the equation \[\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}\] have $4$ distinct solutions?"
Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:


The equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has 4 distinct solutions if and only if $\frac{m}{100}=2$. This is because the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=a$ has 4 distinct solutions when $a=2$.

If we set $\frac{m}{100}=2$, we can solve for $m$ by multiplying both sides by $100$ to get $m=200$.

So, there is only one positive integer $m$ that makes the equation have 4 distinct solutions, and that is $m=200$. The answer is: $1$

Step-by-step Solution:


The equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has 4 distinct solutions if and only if $\frac{m}{100}=2$.
So, $m=200$.
Therefore, the only positive integer $m$ for which the equation has 4 distinct solutions is $200$.
The answer is: $1$

Question (hint: positive numerical answer):
"For how many positive integers $m$ does the equation \[\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}\] have $4$ distinct solutions?"
Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:


The equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has 4 distinct solutions if and only if $\frac{m}{100}$ is strictly between 1 and 2. This is because the function $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert$ oscillates between 1 and 2 as $x$ varies over the real numbers.

If $\frac{m}{100} < 1$, then the equation has less than 4 solutions. If $\frac{m}{100} > 2$, then the equation has more than 4 solutions. Therefore, we must have $1 < \frac{m}{100} < 2$.

Multiplying all parts of the inequality by 100 gives $100 < m < 200$. The positive integers $m$ that satisfy this inequality are the integers from 101 to 199, inclusive. To find the number of these integers, we subtract the smallest integer from the largest and add 1.

So the number of positive integers $m$ is $199 - 101 + 1 = 99$.
The value of $m$ is 99. The answer is: $99$

"For how many positive integers $m$ does the equation \[\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}\] have $4$ distinct solutions?"
Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:


The equation $||x-1|-2|=\frac{m}{100}$ has 4 distinct solutions if and only if $\frac{m}{100}=2$.
So we have $m=200$. Therefore, there is only one positive integer $m$ that satisfies the condition, and that is $m=200$. The answer is: $1$
