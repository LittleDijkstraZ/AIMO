Question (hint: positive numerical answer):
"Let $k, l > 0$ be parameters. The parabola $y = kx^2 - 2kx + l$ intersects the line $y = 4$ at two points $A$ and $B$. These points are distance 6 apart. What is the sum of the squares of the distances from $A$ and $B$ to the origin?"
Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:


To solve this problem, we first need to find the $x$-coordinates of points $A$ and $B$.
The parabola $y = kx^2 - 2kx + l$ intersects the line $y = 4$ at two points, so we set $kx^2 - 2kx + l = 4$.
Rearranging the equation gives $kx^2 - 2kx + l - 4 = 0$.
Let $x_1$ and $x_2$ be the $x$-coordinates of points $A$ and $B$, respectively.
By the distance formula, the distance between $A$ and $B$ is $|x_2 - x_1| = 6$.
By Vieta's formulas, we have $x_1 + x_2 = \frac{2k}{k} = 2$ and $x_1x_2 = \frac{l - 4}{k}$.
Since $(x_2 - x_1)^2 = (x_1 + x_2)^2 - 4x_1x_2$, we have $36 = 4 - 4\left(\frac{l - 4}{k}\right)$.
Simplifying gives $9 = 1 - \frac{l - 4}{k}$, or $\frac{l - 4}{k} = -8$.
Multiplying both sides by $k$ gives $l - 4 = -8k$.
We want to find the sum of the squares of the distances from $A$ and $B$ to the origin.
The distance from a point $(x, y)$ to the origin is $\sqrt{x^2 + y^2}$.
For point $A$, this is $\sqrt{x_1^2 + (kx_1^2 - 2kx_1 + l)^2}$.
For point $B$, this is $\sqrt{x_2^2 + (kx_2^2 - 2kx_2 + l)^2}$.
We can simplify this to $\sqrt{(1 + k^2)x_1^2 + (l - 2k)^2}$ and $\sqrt{(1 + k^2)x_2^2 + (l - 2k)^2}$, respectively.
The sum of the squares of the distances is then $(1 + k^2)(x_1^2 + x_2^2) + 2(l - 2k)^2$.
By Vieta's formulas, $x_1^2 + x_2^2 = (x_1 + x_2)^2 - 2x_1x_2 = 4 - 2\left(\frac{l - 4}{k}\right) = 4 + 16 = 20$.
Also, $l - 2k = -8k + 2k = -6k$.
So the sum of the squares of the distances is $(1 + k^2)(20) + 2(-6k)^2 = 20 + 20k^2 + 72k^2 = 20 + 92k^2$.
However, we still need to find the value of $k$.
Using the equation $l - 4 = -8k$, we can substitute $l - 4 = -8k$ into the equation $l - 2k = -6k$ to get $-8k - 2k = -6k$, or $-10k = -6k$.
This gives $k = 0$, but we know that $k > 0$, so this is not possible.
Instead, we can substitute $l - 4 = -8k$ into the equation $kx^2 - 2kx + l = 4$ to get $kx^2 - 2kx - 8k + 4 = 0$.
Using the quadratic formula, we find that $x = \frac{2k \pm \sqrt{(2k)^2 - 4k(-8k + 4)}}{2k} = 1 \pm \sqrt{1 + 8k - 4}$.
Since the distance between $A$ and $B$ is 6, we have $|(1 + \sqrt{1 + 8k - 4}) - (1 - \sqrt{1 + 8k - 4})| = 6$,
or $2\sqrt{1 + 8k - 4} = 6$.
Simplifying gives $\sqrt{1 + 8k - 4} = 3$, or $1 + 8k - 4 = 9$.
This gives $8k = 12$, or $k = \frac{3}{2}$.
Substituting $k = \frac{3}{2}$ into $l - 4 = -8k$ gives $l - 4 = -12$, or $l = -8$.
Finally, substituting $k = \frac{3}{2}$ and $l = -8$ into the sum of the squares of the distances gives $20 + 92\left(\frac{3}{2}\right)^2 = 20 + 92\left(\frac{9}{4}\right) = 20 + 228 = 248$.
The answer is: $\boxed{248}$.

Question (hint: positive numerical answer):
"Let $k, l > 0$ be parameters. The parabola $y = kx^2 - 2kx + l$ intersects the line $y = 4$ at two points $A$ and $B$. These points are distance 6 apart. What is the sum of the squares of the distances from $A$ and $B$ to the origin?"
Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:



First, we need to find the $x$-coordinates of points $A$ and $B$. To do this, we set $y = 4$ in the equation of the parabola and solve for $x$. So we have:
\[4 = kx^2 - 2kx + l.\]
Rearranging the terms, we get:
\[kx^2 - 2kx + l - 4 = 0.\]
This is a quadratic equation in $x$, and we know that it has two roots (the $x$-coordinates of points $A$ and $B$) that are distance 6 apart. Let's call these roots $x_1$ and $x_2$. Then by the properties of quadratic equations, we have:
\[x_1 + x_2 = \frac{2k}{k} = 2,\]
\[x_1x_2 = \frac{l - 4}{k}.\]
Also, we know that $|x_1 - x_2| = 6$, and by the difference of squares, we have:
\[(x_1 - x_2)^2 = (x_1 + x_2)^2 - 4x_1x_2 = 36.\]
Substituting the values of $x_1 + x_2$ and $x_1x_2$ from above, we get:
\[36 = 4 - 4\cdot\frac{l - 4}{k}.\]
Simplifying this equation gives:
\[36 = 4 - \frac{4l - 16}{k}.\]
Multiplying through by $k$ gives:
\[36k = 4k - 4l + 16.\]
Rearranging terms gives:
\[4l = 32 + 2k.\]
So, $l = 8 + 0.5k$.

Now we need to find the sum of the squares of the distances from $A$ and $B$ to the origin. The distance from a point $(x, y)$ to the origin is $\sqrt{x^2 + y^2}$. For point $A$ (with $x$-coordinate $x_1$), the $y$-coordinate is given by the equation of the parabola:
\[y_1 = kx_1^2 - 2kx_1 + l.\]
So the distance from $A$ to the origin is:
\[d_1 = \sqrt{x_1^2 + y_1^2} = \sqrt{x_1^2 + (kx_1^2 - 2kx_1 + l)^2}.\]
Similarly, the distance from $B$ to the origin is:
\[d_2 = \sqrt{x_2^2 + y_2^2} = \sqrt{x_2^2 + (kx_2^2 - 2kx_2 + l)^2}.\]
The sum of the squares of these distances is:
\[(d_1^2 + d_2^2) = x_1^2 + (kx_1^2 - 2kx_1 + l)^2 + x_2^2 + (kx_2^2 - 2kx_2 + l)^2.\]
Using the fact that $x_1^2 + x_2^2 = (x_1 + x_2)^2 - 2x_1x_2 = 4 - 2\cdot\frac{l - 4}{k} = 4 - 2\cdot\frac{8 + 0.5k - 4}{k} = 4 - 2\cdot\frac{4 + 0.5k}{k} = 4 - 8/k - 1 = 3 - 8/k$, and $(kx_1^2 - 2kx_1 + l)(kx_2^2 - 2kx_2 + l) = (k(x_1x_2)^2 - 2k(x_1 + x_2)x_1x_2 + k(x_1^2 + x_2^2) + l^2 - 4l) = (k\left(\frac{l - 4}{k}\right)^2 - 2k\cdot 2\cdot\frac{l - 4}{k} + k(3 - 8/k) + (8 + 0.5k)^2 - 4(8 + 0.5k)) = (l - 4)^2 - 4(l - 4) + 3k - 8 + (8 + 0.5k)^2 - 32 - 2k = (l - 4)^2 - 4(l - 4) + 3k - 8 + 64 + 8k + 0.25k^2 - 32 - 2k = (l - 4)^2 + 8k + 0.25k^2 - 4(l - 4) - 8 = (l - 4)^2 + 8k + 0.25k^2 - 4l + 16 - 8 = (l - 4)^2 + 8k + 0.25k^2 - 4l + 8 = l^2 - 8l + 16 + 8k + 0.25k^2 - 4l + 8 = l^2 - 12l + 24 + 8k + 0.25k^2 = (8 + 0.5k)^2 - 12(8 + 0.5k) + 24 + 8k + 0.25k^2 = 64 + k^2 + 8k - 96 - 6k + 24 + 8k + 0.25k^2 = k^2 + 6.25k^2 = 7.25k^2$, we get:
\[(d_1^2 + d_2^2) = 3 - 8/k + 7.25k^2.\]
Now we need to substitute the value of $l = 8 + 0.5k$ into this expression. We get:
\[(d_1^2 + d_2^2) = 3 - 8/k + 7.25k^2 = 3 - 8/k + 7.25k^2.\]
This is a complicated expression, but we can simplify it further by noting that it does not depend on $k$. Therefore, the sum of the squares of the distances from $A$ and $B$ to the origin is a constant, and we can evaluate it at any value of $k$. Let's choose $k = 1$ for simplicity. Then $l = 8 + 0.5 = 8.5$. Substituting these values into the equation of the parabola, we find that the $x$-coordinates of $A$ and $B$ are the solutions to:
\[4 = x^2 - 2x + 8.5.\]
Rearranging terms gives:
\[x^2 - 2

Question (hint: positive numerical answer):
"Let $k, l > 0$ be parameters. The parabola $y = kx^2 - 2kx + l$ intersects the line $y = 4$ at two points $A$ and $B$. These points are distance 6 apart. What is the sum of the squares of the distances from $A$ and $B$ to the origin?"
Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:



The parabola $y = kx^2 - 2kx + l$ intersects the line $y = 4$ at two points $A$ and $B$. This means that when we substitute $y = 4$ into the equation of the parabola, we get a quadratic equation. So we have:
$$4 = kx^2 - 2kx + l.$$
Rearranging terms gives:
$$kx^2 - 2kx + l - 4 = 0.$$
Let's denote this equation as (1).

The points $A$ and $B$ are distance 6 apart. The distance between two points $(x_1, y_1)$ and $(x_2, y_2)$ is given by $\sqrt{(x_2 - x_1)^2 + (y_2 - y_1)^2}$. In this case, we know that $y_1 = y_2 = 4$, so the distance between $A$ and $B$ simplifies to $\sqrt{(x_2 - x_1)^2} = |x_2 - x_1| = 6$.

The sum of the squares of the distances from $A$ and $B$ to the origin is $x_1^2 + y_1^2 + x_2^2 + y_2^2 = x_1^2 + 16 + x_2^2 + 16 = x_1^2 + x_2^2 + 32$.

We know that $x_1$ and $x_2$ are the roots of equation (1), so by Vieta's formulas, we have $x_1 + x_2 = \frac{2k}{k} = 2$ and $x_1x_2 = \frac{l - 4}{k}$.

Now we can express $x_1^2 + x_2^2$ in terms of $x_1 + x_2$ and $x_1x_2$:
$$x_1^2 + x_2^2 = (x_1 + x_2)^2 - 2x_1x_2 = 2^2 - 2\cdot\frac{l - 4}{k} = 4 - \frac{2l - 8}{k} = \frac{4k - 2l + 8}{k}.$$

Therefore, the sum of the squares of the distances from $A$ and $B$ to the origin is
$$x_1^2 + x_2^2 + 32 = \frac{4k - 2l + 8}{k} + 32 = \frac{4k - 2l + 8 + 32k}{k} = \frac{36k - 2l + 8}{k}.$$

We still need to find the values of $k$ and $l$. From the condition that the line $y = 4$ intersects the parabola at two points, the discriminant of the quadratic equation (1) must be positive. The discriminant is $(-2k)^2 - 4k(l - 4) = 4k^2 - 4kl + 16k$. So we have
$$4k^2 - 4kl + 16k > 0.$$
Dividing by 4 gives
$$k^2 - kl + 4k > 0.$$
This equation must hold for any $k$ and $l$ that satisfy the problem conditions. So we can choose specific values of $k$ and $l$ to find the sum of the squares of the distances.

Let's choose $k = 1$ and $l = 5$. Then the quadratic equation (1) becomes
$$x^2 - 2x + 1 = 0,$$
which has a double root $x = 1$. This means that the line $y = 4$ is tangent to the parabola $y = x^2 - 2x + 5$ at the point $(1, 4)$. This choice of $k$ and $l$ satisfies the problem conditions.

With $k = 1$ and $l = 5$, we have
$$x_1^2 + x_2^2 + 32 = \frac{36 - 2\cdot5 + 8}{1} = 34.$$

So the sum of the squares of the distances from $A$ and $B$ to the origin is 34. The answer is: $34$

Question (hint: positive numerical answer):
"Let $k, l > 0$ be parameters. The parabola $y = kx^2 - 2kx + l$ intersects the line $y = 4$ at two points $A$ and $B$. These points are distance 6 apart. What is the sum of the squares of the distances from $A$ and $B$ to the origin?"
Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:



To find the points of intersection, we set $kx^2 - 2kx + l = 4$, which simplifies to $kx^2 - 2kx + l - 4 = 0$. Let's call this equation (1).

The distance between $A$ and $B$ is given as 6. By the distance formula, we have $\sqrt{(x_2 - x_1)^2 + (y_2 - y_1)^2} = 6$. Since the points lie on the line $y = 4$, the $y$-coordinates are the same, so the distance simplifies to $|x_2 - x_1| = 6$.

The quadratic formula gives us the roots of equation (1) as $x = \frac{2k \pm \sqrt{(2k)^2 - 4k(l - 4)}}{2k} = 1 \pm \frac{\sqrt{4k - 4l + 16}}{2k}$.

So, the difference of the roots is $\frac{\sqrt{4k - 4l + 16}}{k}$, which is equal to 6 (since $|x_2 - x_1| = 6$). Thus, we have $\frac{\sqrt{4k - 4l + 16}}{k} = 6$, and squaring both sides gives $4k - 4l + 16 = 36k^2$.

Rearranging terms, we get $36k^2 - 4k + 4l - 16 = 0$.

Now, we want to find the sum of the squares of the distances from $A$ and $B$ to the origin. The distance from a point $(x, y)$ to the origin is $\sqrt{x^2 + y^2}$. Since the points lie on the line $y = 4$, this simplifies to $\sqrt{x^2 + 16}$.

The sum of the squares of the distances from $A$ and $B$ to the origin is therefore $(\sqrt{x_1^2 + 16})^2 + (\sqrt{x_2^2 + 16})^2 = x_1^2 + 16 + x_2^2 + 16 = (x_1^2 + x_2^2) + 32$.

We know that $x_1 + x_2 = \frac{2k}{\sqrt{k^2}} = 2$ and $x_1x_2 = \frac{l - 4}{k}$.

By the identity $(x_1 + x_2)^2 = x_1^2 + x_2^2 + 2x_1x_2$, we can solve for $x_1^2 + x_2^2$ as $(x_1 + x_2)^2 - 2x_1x_2 = 4 - 2\left(\frac{l - 4}{k}\right) = 4 - \frac{2l - 8}{k} = \frac{4k - 2l + 8}{k}$.

Substituting this into the expression for the sum of the squares of the distances, we get $\frac{4k - 2l + 8}{k} + 32 = \frac{4k - 2l + 8 + 32k}{k} = \frac{36k - 2l + 8}{k}$.

We already know that $36k^2 - 4k + 4l - 16 = 0$, which rearranges to $36k - 2l + 8 = 0$. Thus, the sum of the squares of the distances from $A$ and $B$ to the origin is $\frac{36k - 2l + 8}{k} = 0$.

However, this result doesn't make sense in the context of the problem, as the distance cannot be zero. We must have made a mistake in our calculations. Let's retrace our steps and find the mistake.

We correctly found that $\frac{\sqrt{4k - 4l + 16}}{k} = 6$. Squaring both sides gives $4k - 4l + 16 = 36k^2$, which is correct.

However, when we rearranged the terms in the equation $36k^2 - 4k + 4l - 16 = 0$, we should have kept the constant term, resulting in $36k^2 - 4k + 4l - 16 = 0$.

Now, let's correct this and continue with our calculations.

We know that $x_1 + x_2 = 2$ and $x_1x_2 = \frac{l - 4}{k}$. By the identity $(x_1 + x_2)^2 = x_1^2 + x_2^2 + 2x_1x_2$, we can solve for $x_1^2 + x_2^2$ as $(x_1 + x_2)^2 - 2x_1x_2 = 4 - 2\left(\frac{l - 4}{k}\right) = 4 - \frac{2l - 8}{k} = \frac{4k - 2l + 8}{k}$.

Substituting this into the expression for the sum of the squares of the distances, we get $\frac{4k - 2l + 8}{k} + 32$.

We already know that $36k^2 - 4k + 4l - 16 = 0$, which rearranges to $4k - 2l + 8 = -32k$. Thus, the sum of the squares of the distances from $A$ and $B$ to the origin is $\frac{4k - 2l + 8}{k} + 32 = -32 + 32 = 0$.

Again, this result doesn't make sense in the context of the problem, as the distance cannot be zero. We must have made another mistake. Let's retrace our steps and find the mistake.

The mistake was in the rearrangement of the equation $36k^2 - 4k + 4l - 16 = 0$. The correct rearrangement should be $4k - 2l + 8 = -32k$, but this doesn't give us the correct result either.

Let's go back to the equation $36k^2 - 4k + 4l - 16 = 0$. We can rearrange it to $4l = -36k^2 + 4k + 16$.

Now, substitute this into the expression for the sum of the squares of the distances, we get $\frac{4k - (-36k^2 + 4k + 16)}{k} + 32 = \frac{-36k^2 + 16}{k} + 32$.

We know that $36k^2 - 4k + 4l - 1

Question (hint: positive numerical answer):
"Let $k, l > 0$ be parameters. The parabola $y = kx^2 - 2kx + l$ intersects the line $y = 4$ at two points $A$ and $B$. These points are distance 6 apart. What is the sum of the squares of the distances from $A$ and $B$ to the origin?"
Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:



The parabola $y = kx^2 - 2kx + l$ intersects the line $y = 4$ at two points $A$ and $B$. This means that the equation $kx^2 - 2kx + l - 4 = 0$ has two solutions, say $x_1$ and $x_2$, which represent the x-coordinates of points $A$ and $B$. Since the distance between $A$ and $B$ is 6, we have $(x_2 - x_1)^2 = 36$. 

From the quadratic formula, we know that $x_{1,2} = \frac{2k \pm \sqrt{4k^2 - 4k(l - 4)}}{2k} = 1 \pm \sqrt{1 - (l - 4)}$. Thus, $(x_2 - x_1)^2 = (2\sqrt{1 - (l - 4)})^2 = 4(1 - (l - 4)) = 4(5 - l)$. Setting this equal to 36, we have $4(5 - l) = 36$, which implies $5 - l = 9$, so $l = -4$. 

Substituting $l = -4$ into the equation of the parabola, we get $y = kx^2 - 2kx - 4$. The line $y = 4$ is then $kx^2 - 2kx - 8 = 0$. The quadratic formula gives us $x_{1,2} = \frac{2k \pm \sqrt{4k^2 + 32k}}{2k} = 1 \pm \sqrt{1 + 8k}$. 

The distance from each of $A$ and $B$ to the origin is $\sqrt{x_1^2 + y_1^2} = \sqrt{x_1^2 + (kx_1^2 - 2kx_1 + 4)^2}$. We square this distance and sum the squares for $A$ and $B$:
\[(x_1^2 + (kx_1^2 - 2kx_1 + 4)^2) + (x_2^2 + (kx_2^2 - 2kx_2 + 4)^2).\]

Substituting $x_2 = 1 - \sqrt{1 + 8k}$ and $x_1 = 1 + \sqrt{1 + 8k}$, we can simplify this expression to:
\[2[(1 + \sqrt{1 + 8k})^2 + (1 - \sqrt{1 + 8k})^2 + 4(1 + \sqrt{1 + 8k} - 2(1 + \sqrt{1 + 8k}) + 4)^2 + 4(1 - \sqrt{1 + 8k} - 2(1 - \sqrt{1 + 8k}) + 4)^2].\]

After simplifying, we find that this expression equals $100k^2 + 32k + 80$.

Substituting $k = 1$ (which can be derived from the condition that the parabola $y = kx^2 - 2kx + l$ passes through the point $(1, 1)$), we get the final answer: $100 + 32 + 80 = 212$.

So, the sum of the squares of the distances from $A$ and $B$ to the origin is $212$. The answer is: $\boxed{212}$

Question (hint: positive numerical answer):
"Let $k, l > 0$ be parameters. The parabola $y = kx^2 - 2kx + l$ intersects the line $y = 4$ at two points $A$ and $B$. These points are distance 6 apart. What is the sum of the squares of the distances from $A$ and $B$ to the origin?"
Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:


First, we need to find the $x$-coordinates of points $A$ and $B$.
Setting $y = 4$ in the equation of the parabola, we have $4 = kx^2 - 2kx + l$.
Rearranging, we get $kx^2 - 2kx + l - 4 = 0$.
This is a quadratic equation in $x$. The solutions are the $x$-coordinates of $A$ and $B$.
Let's call these solutions $x_1$ and $x_2$. We know that $|x_2 - x_1| = 6$.
By the quadratic formula, we have $x = \frac{2k \pm \sqrt{(2k)^2 - 4k(l - 4)}}{2k}$.
The difference of the roots is given by $\sqrt{(2k)^2 - 4k(l - 4)} = 6$.
Squaring both sides, we get $(2k)^2 - 4k(l - 4) = 36$.
Simplifying, we have $4k^2 - 4kl + 16k = 36$.
Rearranging, we get $4k^2 - 4kl + 16k - 36 = 0$.
Now, we need to find the distances from $A$ and $B$ to the origin.
The distance from a point $(x, y)$ to the origin is given by $\sqrt{x^2 + y^2}$.
For point $A$, the distance is $\sqrt{x_1^2 + (kx_1^2 - 2kx_1 + l)^2}$.
Similarly, for point $B$, the distance is $\sqrt{x_2^2 + (kx_2^2 - 2kx_2 + l)^2}$.
We want to find the sum of the squares of these distances, which is
\[(x_1^2 + (kx_1^2 - 2kx_1 + l)^2) + (x_2^2 + (kx_2^2 - 2kx_2 + l)^2).\]
Using the fact that $x_1 + x_2 = \frac{2k}{k} = 2$ and $x_1x_2 = \frac{l - 4}{k}$, we can simplify the expression above.
After simplification, we find that the sum of the squares of the distances is $4k^2 + (2k)^2 + 4(l - 4)^2$.
We know that $4k^2 - 4kl + 16k - 36 = 0$.
Rearranging, we get $4k^2 + 16k = 4kl - 36$.
Substituting into the expression for the sum of the squares of the distances, we have
\[4kl - 36 + (2k)^2 + 4(l - 4)^2.\]
Now, we can use the equation $4k^2 - 4kl + 16k - 36 = 0$ to eliminate one of the variables.
We can solve for $l$ in terms of $k$:
\[l = \frac{4k^2 + 16k - 36}{4k}.\]
Substituting this into the expression for the sum of the squares of the distances, we get
\[\frac{4k^3 + 16k^2 - 36k}{k} + (2k)^2 + 4\left(\frac{4k^2 + 16k - 36}{4k} - 4\right)^2.\]
Simplifying this expression, we find that it equals $100$.
Therefore, the sum of the squares of the distances from $A$ and $B$ to the origin is 100. The answer is: $100$

Question (hint: positive numerical answer):
"Let $k, l > 0$ be parameters. The parabola $y = kx^2 - 2kx + l$ intersects the line $y = 4$ at two points $A$ and $B$. These points are distance 6 apart. What is the sum of the squares of the distances from $A$ and $B$ to the origin?"
Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:


The points of intersection of the parabola $y = kx^2 - 2kx + l$ and the line $y = 4$ are found by setting the two equations equal to each other:
$$4 = kx^2 - 2kx + l.$$
Rearranging, we have the quadratic equation
$$kx^2 - 2kx + (l - 4) = 0.$$
By the quadratic formula, the solutions (which are the x-coordinates of points $A$ and $B$) are given by
$$x = \frac{2k \pm \sqrt{(-2k)^2 - 4k(l - 4)}}{2k} = 1 \pm \sqrt{1 - \frac{l - 4}{k}}.$$
The distance between $A$ and $B$ is given by the difference of the x-coordinates:
$$|x_2 - x_1| = \left| 1 + \sqrt{1 - \frac{l - 4}{k}} - \left(1 - \sqrt{1 - \frac{l - 4}{k}}\right) \right| = 2\sqrt{1 - \frac{l - 4}{k}}.$$
We are given that this distance is 6, so we have
$$2\sqrt{1 - \frac{l - 4}{k}} = 6 \Rightarrow \sqrt{1 - \frac{l - 4}{k}} = 3 \Rightarrow 1 - \frac{l - 4}{k} = 9 \Rightarrow \frac{l - 4}{k} = -8 \Rightarrow l - 4 = -8k \Rightarrow l = 4 - 8k.$$
The distance from a point $(x, y)$ to the origin is given by $\sqrt{x^2 + y^2}$. The distance from $A$ and $B$ to the origin are respectively $\sqrt{(x_1)^2 + (4)^2}$ and $\sqrt{(x_2)^2 + (4)^2}$, which we want to square and sum.
\begin{align*}
\left(\sqrt{(x_1)^2 + 4^2}\right)^2 + \left(\sqrt{(x_2)^2 + 4^2}\right)^2 &= (x_1)^2 + 16 + (x_2)^2 + 16\\
&= (x_1)^2 + (x_2)^2 + 32\\
&= \left(x_1 + x_2\right)^2 - 2x_1x_2 + 32\\
&= \left(2\right)^2 - 2\left(1\right)\left(1 - \frac{l - 4}{k}\right) + 32\\
&= 4 + 2\left(1 - \frac{4 - 8k}{k}\right) + 32\\
&= 36 + \frac{16k}{k}\\
&= 36 + 16 = 52.
\end{align*}
Therefore, the sum of the squares of the distances from $A$ and $B$ to the origin is 52. The answer is: $52$

Question (hint: positive numerical answer):
"Let $k, l > 0$ be parameters. The parabola $y = kx^2 - 2kx + l$ intersects the line $y = 4$ at two points $A$ and $B$. These points are distance 6 apart. What is the sum of the squares of the distances from $A$ and $B$ to the origin?"
Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:


To find the coordinates of points $A$ and $B$, we need to solve the system of equations $y = kx^2 - 2kx + l$ and $y = 4$. Setting these equal gives us $kx^2 - 2kx + l = 4$.
Rearranging terms, we have $kx^2 - 2kx + l - 4 = 0$. Let's call this equation $(1)$.

The distance between points $A$ and $B$ is given as 6. The distance formula in the coordinate plane is $\sqrt{(x_2 - x_1)^2 + (y_2 - y_1)^2}$. Since the y-coordinates of $A$ and $B$ are the same (both 4), the distance simplifies to $\sqrt{(x_2 - x_1)^2} = |x_2 - x_1|$.

We know that the roots of equation $(1)$ are the x-coordinates of $A$ and $B$, and by Vieta's formulas, the sum of the roots is $\frac{2k}{k} = 2$. The absolute difference of the roots is 6/k (since the distance between the roots is 6 and the leading coefficient of the quadratic is k). By the difference of squares, $(x_2 - x_1)^2 = (x_2 + x_1)^2 - 4x_2x_1 = 4 - \frac{4(l - 4)}{k}$. We know this is equal to $(6/k)^2 = 36/k^2$, so we have the equation $4 - \frac{4(l - 4)}{k} = \frac{36}{k^2}$.

Multiplying through by $k^2$ gives $4k^2 - 4k(l - 4) = 36$. Expanding and rearranging terms, we have $4k^2 - 4kl + 16k - 36 = 0$. This equation represents a relationship between $k$, $l$, and the parameters of the problem.

The sum of the squares of the distances from $A$ and $B$ to the origin is $x_1^2 + y_1^2 + x_2^2 + y_2^2 = x_1^2 + 4 + x_2^2 + 4 = x_1^2 + x_2^2 + 8$. By Vieta's formulas, $x_1^2 + x_2^2 = (x_1 + x_2)^2 - 2x_1x_2 = 2^2 - 2\left(\frac{l - 4}{k}\right) = 4 - \frac{2(l - 4)}{k}$.

Substituting this into the sum of squares of distances gives $4 - \frac{2(l - 4)}{k} + 8 = 12 - \frac{2(l - 4)}{k}$. We already know from the equation above that $4k^2 - 4kl + 16k - 36 = 0$, so we can solve this equation for $l$ in terms of $k$: $l = \frac{k^2 + 4k - 9}{k}$.

Substituting this into the equation for the sum of squares of distances gives $12 - \frac{2\left(\frac{k^2 + 4k - 9}{k} - 4\right)}{k} = 12 - \frac{2(k - 5)}{k} = 12 - \frac{10}{k} - 2 = 10 - \frac{10}{k}$.

We know that $k > 0$, so the expression $10 - \frac{10}{k}$ is always less than 10. Therefore, the sum of the squares of the distances from $A$ and $B$ to the origin is a constant value, which is 10. The answer is: $10$

Question (hint: positive numerical answer):
"Let $k, l > 0$ be parameters. The parabola $y = kx^2 - 2kx + l$ intersects the line $y = 4$ at two points $A$ and $B$. These points are distance 6 apart. What is the sum of the squares of the distances from $A$ and $B$ to the origin?"
Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:



First, let's find the $x$-coordinates of $A$ and $B$ by setting $y = 4$ in the equation of the parabola:
\[4 = kx^2 - 2kx + l.\]
Rearranging terms gives us the quadratic equation:
\[kx^2 - 2kx + (l - 4) = 0.\]
Let $x_1$ and $x_2$ be the roots of this quadratic equation, which represent the $x$-coordinates of $A$ and $B$, respectively. Since the distance between $A$ and $B$ is 6, we have:
\[x_2 - x_1 = 6.\]
From Vieta's formulas, we know that $x_1 + x_2 = \frac{2k}{k} = 2$ and $x_1x_2 = \frac{l - 4}{k}$.

Now, we want to find the sum of the squares of the distances from $A$ and $B$ to the origin. The distance from a point $(x, y)$ to the origin is $\sqrt{x^2 + y^2}$. So the distance from $A$ to the origin is $\sqrt{x_1^2 + 4^2} = \sqrt{x_1^2 + 16}$, and the distance from $B$ to the origin is $\sqrt{x_2^2 + 4^2} = \sqrt{x_2^2 + 16}$.

We want to find $(x_1^2 + 16) + (x_2^2 + 16) = x_1^2 + x_2^2 + 32$.

From the identity $(x_1 + x_2)^2 - 2x_1x_2 = x_1^2 + x_2^2$, we substitute the values we know:
\[2^2 - 2\left(\frac{l - 4}{k}\right) = x_1^2 + x_2^2.\]
This simplifies to $4 - 2\left(\frac{l - 4}{k}\right) = x_1^2 + x_2^2$.

Substituting this into the expression we want to find:
\[x_1^2 + x_2^2 + 32 = 4 - 2\left(\frac{l - 4}{k}\right) + 32 = 36 - 2\left(\frac{l - 4}{k}\right).\]
Now, we need to find the value of $\frac{l - 4}{k}$. Since $x_1$ and $x_2$ are the roots of the quadratic equation, by Vieta's formulas we have:
\[x_1x_2 = \frac{l - 4}{k} = \frac{1}{k} \cdot \frac{2k}{k} \cdot \frac{l - 4}{2} = \frac{l - 4}{2}.\]
But we also know that $x_1x_2 = \frac{l - 4}{k}$, so we have:
\[\frac{l - 4}{2} = \frac{l - 4}{k}.\]
Multiplying both sides by 2k gives:
\[k(l - 4) = 2(l - 4).\]
Simplifying gives:
\[kl - 4k = 2l - 8.\]
Rearranging terms gives:
\[kl - 2l = 4k - 8.\]
Factoring out the common factor l on the left side gives:
\[l(k - 2) = 4k - 8.\]
Dividing both sides by $k - 2$ gives:
\[l = \frac{4k - 8}{k - 2}.\]
Substituting this into the expression we want to find gives:
\[36 - 2\left(\frac{l - 4}{k}\right) = 36 - 2\left(\frac{\frac{4k - 8}{k - 2} - 4}{k}\right) = 36 - 2\left(\frac{4k - 8 - 4k + 8}{k(k - 2)}\right) = 36.\]
So the sum of the squares of the distances from $A$ and $B$ to the origin is 36.
The answer is: $36$

Question (hint: positive numerical answer):
"Let $k, l > 0$ be parameters. The parabola $y = kx^2 - 2kx + l$ intersects the line $y = 4$ at two points $A$ and $B$. These points are distance 6 apart. What is the sum of the squares of the distances from $A$ and $B$ to the origin?"
Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:


First, let's set the equation of the parabola equal to the equation of the line to find the points of intersection.
$$4 = kx^2 - 2kx + l.$$
Rearranging, we have $kx^2 - 2kx + (l - 4) = 0$.
This is a quadratic equation, and we know that it has two solutions corresponding to points $A$ and $B$.
Let $x_1$ and $x_2$ be the x-coordinates of points $A$ and $B$, respectively.
By the distance formula, the distance between $A$ and $B$ is $\sqrt{(x_2 - x_1)^2 + (0 - 0)^2} = |x_2 - x_1|$.
We are given that this distance is 6, so $|x_2 - x_1| = 6$.
By Vieta's formulas, we know that $x_1 + x_2 = \frac{2k}{k} = 2$ and $x_1x_2 = \frac{l - 4}{k}$.
Using the difference of squares, we have $(x_2 - x_1)^2 = (x_2 + x_1)^2 - 4x_1x_2 = 4 - 4\left(\frac{l - 4}{k}\right) = 4 - \frac{4(l - 4)}{k}$.
Since $|x_2 - x_1| = 6$, we have $36 = 4 - \frac{4(l - 4)}{k}$.
Simplifying, we get $\frac{4(l - 4)}{k} = -32$, or $l - 4 = -8k$.
Thus, $l = 4 - 8k$.
Now we want to find the sum of the squares of the distances from $A$ and $B$ to the origin.
The distance from a point $(x, y)$ to the origin is $\sqrt{x^2 + y^2}$.
For point $A$, this is $\sqrt{x_1^2 + (kx_1^2 - 2kx_1 + l)^2}$.
For point $B$, this is $\sqrt{x_2^2 + (kx_2^2 - 2kx_2 + l)^2}$.
We want to find the sum of these two quantities squared:
$$(\sqrt{x_1^2 + (kx_1^2 - 2kx_1 + l)^2})^2 + (\sqrt{x_2^2 + (kx_2^2 - 2kx_2 + l)^2})^2.$$
Expanding, we have
$$x_1^2 + (kx_1^2 - 2kx_1 + l)^2 + x_2^2 + (kx_2^2 - 2kx_2 + l)^2.$$
Substituting $l = 4 - 8k$, we get
$$x_1^2 + (kx_1^2 - 2kx_1 + 4 - 8k)^2 + x_2^2 + (kx_2^2 - 2kx_2 + 4 - 8k)^2.$$
This expression is quite complicated, but we can simplify it by noting that $x_1^2 + x_2^2 = (x_1 + x_2)^2 - 2x_1x_2 = 2^2 - 2\left(\frac{l - 4}{k}\right) = 4 - 2\left(\frac{4 - 8k - 4}{k}\right) = 4 + 16 = 20$.
Also, $(kx_1^2 - 2kx_1 + 4 - 8k)^2 + (kx_2^2 - 2kx_2 + 4 - 8k)^2$ is the sum of the squares of the y-coordinates of points $A$ and $B$.
Since the line $y = 4$ is horizontal, the sum of the squares of the y-coordinates is just $4^2 + 4^2 = 32$.
Therefore, the sum of the squares of the distances from $A$ and $B$ to the origin is $20 + 32 = 52$. The answer is: $52$

Question (hint: positive numerical answer):
"Let $k, l > 0$ be parameters. The parabola $y = kx^2 - 2kx + l$ intersects the line $y = 4$ at two points $A$ and $B$. These points are distance 6 apart. What is the sum of the squares of the distances from $A$ and $B$ to the origin?"
Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:


First, we set $y = 4$ in the equation of the parabola and solve for $x$:
\[4 = kx^2 - 2kx + l.\]
Rearranging terms gives:
\[kx^2 - 2kx + (l - 4) = 0.\]
This is a quadratic equation, and its solutions correspond to the $x$-coordinates of points $A$ and $B$.
Let $x_1$ and $x_2$ be the solutions to this equation. Since the distance between $A$ and $B$ is 6, we have:
\[|x_2 - x_1| = 6.\]
By Vieta's formulas, we know that $x_1 + x_2 = \frac{2k}{k} = 2$ and $x_1x_2 = \frac{l - 4}{k}$.
Now, we want to find the sum of the squares of the distances from $A$ and $B$ to the origin.
The distance from a point $(x, y)$ to the origin is $\sqrt{x^2 + y^2}$.
For point $A$, this is $\sqrt{x_1^2 + (kx_1^2 - 2kx_1 + l)^2}$.
For point $B$, this is $\sqrt{x_2^2 + (kx_2^2 - 2kx_2 + l)^2}$.
We want to find the sum of the squares of these distances, which is:
\[(x_1^2 + (kx_1^2 - 2kx_1 + l)^2) + (x_2^2 + (kx_2^2 - 2kx_2 + l)^2).\]
Using the identity $(a+b)^2 = a^2 + 2ab + b^2$, we can simplify this expression:
\[x_1^2 + k^2x_1^4 - 4kx_1^3 + 4k^2x_1^2 - 2klx_1^2 + 4k^2x_1 - 4klx_1 + l^2 + x_2^2 + k^2x_2^4 - 4kx_2^3 + 4k^2x_2^2 - 2klx_2^2 + 4k^2x_2 - 4klx_2 + l^2.\]
This simplifies to:
\[k^2(x_1^4 + x_2^4) + 4k^2(x_1^2 + x_2^2) - 4k(x_1^3 + x_2^3) - 4kl(x_1^2 + x_2^2) + 2kl(x_1 + x_2) + 2l^2.\]
Using the identities $x_1^2 + x_2^2 = (x_1 + x_2)^2 - 2x_1x_2 = 4 - 2\frac{l - 4}{k} = 4 - 2\frac{l - 4}{k} = 4 - \frac{2(l - 4)}{k}$ and $x_1^3 + x_2^3 = (x_1 + x_2)(x_1^2 - x_1x_2 + x_2^2) = 2(4 - \frac{l - 4}{k}) = 8 - \frac{2(l - 4)}{k}$, we can further simplify:
\[k^2(x_1^4 + x_2^4) + 4k^2(4 - \frac{2(l - 4)}{k}) - 4k(8 - \frac{2(l - 4)}{k}) - 4kl(4 - \frac{2(l - 4)}{k}) + 2kl(2) + 2l^2.\]
This simplifies to:
\[k^2(x_1^4 + x_2^4) + 16k^2 - 8k^2(l - 4)/k - 32k + 8k(l - 4)/k - 16kl + 4kl^2 + 2l^2.\]
Further simplifying, we get:
\[k^2(x_1^4 + x_2^4) + 16k^2 - 8k(l - 4) - 32k + 8(l - 4) - 16kl + 4kl^2 + 2l^2.\]
This simplifies to:
\[k^2(x_1^4 + x_2^4) + 16k^2 - 8kl + 32k - 8l + 32 - 16kl + 4kl^2 + 2l^2.\]
Finally, simplifying further, we get:
\[k^2(x_1^4 + x_2^4) + 16k^2 - 24kl + 32k + 2l^2.\]
Since we don't have enough information to determine $x_1^4 + x_2^4$, we cannot find the exact value of this expression. However, we can simplify it further by using the identity $(x_1^2 + x_2^2)^2 = x_1^4 + x_2^4 + 2x_1^2x_2^2$. We know that $x_1^2 + x_2^2 = 4 - \frac{2(l - 4)}{k}$, and $x_1^2x_2^2 = \left(\frac{2k}{k}\right)^2 - 2\frac{2k}{k}\frac{l - 4}{k} + \left(\frac{l - 4}{k}\right)^2 = 4 - 4\frac{l - 4}{k} + \frac{(l - 4)^2}{k^2}$.
Substituting these values, we get:
\[k^2\left[(4 - \frac{2(l - 4)}{k})^2 - 2(4 - \frac{2(l - 4)}{k})\left(4 - 4\frac{l - 4}{k} + \frac{(l - 4)^2}{k^2}\right)\right] + 16k^2 - 24kl + 32k + 2l^2.\]
Expanding and simplifying, we get:
\[k^2\left[16 - 16\frac{l - 4}{k} + \frac{4(l - 4)^2}{k^2} - 8(4 - \frac{2(l - 4)}{k}) + 8\frac{(l - 4)^2}{k^2} - 2\frac{(l - 4)^3}{k^3}\right] + 16k^2 - 24kl + 32k + 2

Question (hint: positive numerical answer):
"Let $k, l > 0$ be parameters. The parabola $y = kx^2 - 2kx + l$ intersects the line $y = 4$ at two points $A$ and $B$. These points are distance 6 apart. What is the sum of the squares of the distances from $A$ and $B$ to the origin?"
Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:


First, we find the x-coordinates of points $A$ and $B$ by setting $y = 4$ in the equation of the parabola:
\[4 = kx^2 - 2kx + l.\]
Rearranging, we have $kx^2 - 2kx + (l - 4) = 0$.
Let $x_1$ and $x_2$ be the x-coordinates of points $A$ and $B$, respectively.
We are given that $|x_2 - x_1| = 6$, so $(x_2 - x_1)^2 = 36$.
By Vieta's formulas, we know that $x_1 + x_2 = \frac{2k}{k} = 2$ and $x_1x_2 = \frac{l - 4}{k}$.
Using the identity $(x_2 - x_1)^2 = (x_2 + x_1)^2 - 4x_1x_2$, we have
\[36 = 4 - \frac{4(l - 4)}{k}.\]
Simplifying, we get $9k = 4l - 16$.

Next, we find the distances from $A$ and $B$ to the origin. The distance from a point $(x, y)$ to the origin is $\sqrt{x^2 + y^2}$.
For point $A$, the distance is $\sqrt{x_1^2 + 4^2} = \sqrt{x_1^2 + 16}$.
Similarly, the distance from point $B$ to the origin is $\sqrt{x_2^2 + 16}$.

We want to find the sum of the squares of these distances, which is
\[(\sqrt{x_1^2 + 16})^2 + (\sqrt{x_2^2 + 16})^2 = x_1^2 + 16 + x_2^2 + 16 = x_1^2 + x_2^2 + 32.\]

Using the identity $x_1^2 + x_2^2 = (x_1 + x_2)^2 - 2x_1x_2$, we have
\[x_1^2 + x_2^2 = 2^2 - 2\left(\frac{l - 4}{k}\right) = 4 - \frac{2(l - 4)}{k}.\]

Substituting this into the expression for the sum of the squares of the distances, we get
\[x_1^2 + x_2^2 + 32 = 4 - \frac{2(l - 4)}{k} + 32 = 36 - \frac{2(l - 4)}{k}.\]

Finally, substituting the equation $9k = 4l - 16$ into this expression, we get
\[36 - \frac{2(l - 4)}{k} = 36 - \frac{2((9k + 16)/4 - 4)}{k} = 36 - \frac{2(9k/4)}{k} = 36 - \frac{9}{2} = \frac{63}{2}.\]
The sum of the squares of the distances from $A$ and $B$ to the origin is $\frac{63}{2}$.
The answer is: $\frac{63}{2}$

Question (hint: positive numerical answer):
"Let $k, l > 0$ be parameters. The parabola $y = kx^2 - 2kx + l$ intersects the line $y = 4$ at two points $A$ and $B$. These points are distance 6 apart. What is the sum of the squares of the distances from $A$ and $B$ to the origin?"
Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:


To solve this problem, we first need to find the $x$-coordinates of points $A$ and $B$. Since the parabola $y = kx^2 - 2kx + l$ intersects the line $y = 4$, we can set $kx^2 - 2kx + l = 4$. This simplifies to $kx^2 - 2kx + l - 4 = 0$. Let's call this equation (1).

We are given that the points $A$ and $B$ are distance 6 apart. This means that if $x_A$ and $x_B$ are the $x$-coordinates of $A$ and $B$ respectively, then $(x_B - x_A)^2 = 36$.

We also know that the sum of the squares of the distances from $A$ and $B$ to the origin is $(x_A^2 + y_A^2) + (x_B^2 + y_B^2)$. Since $y_A = y_B = 4$, this is equal to $x_A^2 + 16 + x_B^2 + 16 = x_A^2 + x_B^2 + 32$.

We need to find the value of $x_A^2 + x_B^2 + 32$.

By Vieta's formulas, we know that $x_A + x_B = \frac{2k}{k} = 2$ and $x_A x_B = \frac{l - 4}{k}$.

We also know that $(x_B - x_A)^2 = 36$, which can be rewritten as $(x_B + x_A)^2 - 4x_Ax_B = 36$. Substituting the values of $x_A + x_B$ and $x_A x_B$ from above, we get:
\[(2)^2 - 4\left(\frac{l - 4}{k}\right) = 36.\]
Simplifying, we have:
\[4 - \frac{4(l - 4)}{k} = 36.\]
Rearranging terms, we get:
\[\frac{4(l - 4)}{k} = -32.\]
Dividing both sides by 4, we have:
\[\frac{l - 4}{k} = -8.\]
Multiplying both sides by $k$, we get:
\[l - 4 = -8k.\]
Rearranging terms, we have:
\[l = -8k + 4.\]

Now we substitute this into equation (1):
\[kx^2 - 2kx + (-8k + 4) - 4 = 0.\]
Simplifying, we get:
\[kx^2 - 2kx - 8k = 0.\]
This is a quadratic equation in $x$, and we know that the sum of the squares of its roots is given by:
\[x_A^2 + x_B^2 = \left(\frac{2k}{k}\right)^2 - 2\left(\frac{-8k}{k}\right) = 4 + 16 = 20.\]

Finally, we substitute this into $x_A^2 + x_B^2 + 32$:
\[20 + 32 = 52.\]

So the sum of the squares of the distances from $A$ and $B$ to the origin is 52. The answer is: $52$

Question (hint: positive numerical answer):
"Let $k, l > 0$ be parameters. The parabola $y = kx^2 - 2kx + l$ intersects the line $y = 4$ at two points $A$ and $B$. These points are distance 6 apart. What is the sum of the squares of the distances from $A$ and $B$ to the origin?"
Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:


To solve this problem, we first need to find the x-coordinates of points $A$ and $B$.
The parabola $y = kx^2 - 2kx + l$ intersects the line $y = 4$, so we can set these two equations equal to each other:
$$kx^2 - 2kx + l = 4.$$
Rearranging terms, we get:
$$kx^2 - 2kx + l - 4 = 0.$$
This is a quadratic equation in $x$. Let's denote its roots as $x_1$ and $x_2$, which represent the x-coordinates of points $A$ and $B$. According to the problem, $|x_1 - x_2| = 6$.

Now, we want to find the sum of the squares of the distances from $A$ and $B$ to the origin. The distance from a point $(x, y)$ to the origin $(0, 0)$ is given by $\sqrt{x^2 + y^2}$. So for point $A(x_1, 4)$, the distance to the origin is $\sqrt{x_1^2 + 4^2} = \sqrt{x_1^2 + 16}$, and for point $B(x_2, 4)$, the distance to the origin is $\sqrt{x_2^2 + 16}$.

The sum of the squares of the distances from $A$ and $B$ to the origin is then:
$$\left(\sqrt{x_1^2 + 16}\right)^2 + \left(\sqrt{x_2^2 + 16}\right)^2 = x_1^2 + 16 + x_2^2 + 16 = x_1^2 + x_2^2 + 32.$$

We know from the quadratic formula that $x_1 + x_2 = \frac{2k}{k} = 2$ and $x_1x_2 = \frac{l - 4}{k}$.
We also know that $(x_1 - x_2)^2 = (2k)^2 - 4k(l - 4) = 36$, which simplifies to $4k^2 - 4kl + 16k = 36$.
Dividing through by 4 gives $k^2 - kl + 4k = 9$.

Now, we want to find $x_1^2 + x_2^2$. We know that $(x_1 + x_2)^2 - 2x_1x_2 = x_1^2 + x_2^2$, so we can substitute the values we found earlier:
$$(2)^2 - 2\left(\frac{l - 4}{k}\right) = x_1^2 + x_2^2.$$
Simplifying, we get:
$$4 - 2\left(\frac{l - 4}{k}\right) = x_1^2 + x_2^2.$$
We can substitute this into the expression for the sum of the squares of the distances:
$$x_1^2 + x_2^2 + 32 = 4 - 2\left(\frac{l - 4}{k}\right) + 32.$$
Simplifying further, we get:
$$x_1^2 + x_2^2 + 32 = 4 - 2\left(\frac{l - 4}{k}\right) + 32.$$
$$x_1^2 + x_2^2 + 32 = 36 - 2\left(\frac{l - 4}{k}\right).$$
$$x_1^2 + x_2^2 + 32 = 36 - 2\left(\frac{l - 4}{k}\right).$$
$$x_1^2 + x_2^2 = 4 - 2\left(\frac{l - 4}{k}\right).$$

We also know from the equation $k^2 - kl + 4k = 9$ that $l = \frac{k^2 + 4k - 9}{k}$. Substituting this into the equation for $x_1^2 + x_2^2$, we get:
$$x_1^2 + x_2^2 = 4 - 2\left(\frac{\frac{k^2 + 4k - 9}{k} - 4}{k}\right).$$
Simplifying, we get:
$$x_1^2 + x_2^2 = 4 - 2\left(\frac{k^2 + 4k - 9 - 4k}{k^2}\right).$$
$$x_1^2 + x_2^2 = 4 - 2\left(\frac{k^2 - 9}{k^2}\right).$$
$$x_1^2 + x_2^2 = 4 - 2\left(1 - \frac{9}{k^2}\right).$$
$$x_1^2 + x_2^2 = 2 + \frac{18}{k^2}.$$

Finally, we substitute this into the expression for the sum of the squares of the distances:
$$\left(\sqrt{x_1^2 + 16}\right)^2 + \left(\sqrt{x_2^2 + 16}\right)^2 = x_1^2 + x_2^2 + 32.$$
$$= 2 + \frac{18}{k^2} + 32.$$
$$= 34 + \frac{18}{k^2}.$$

So the sum of the squares of the distances from $A$ and $B$ to the origin is $34 + \frac{18}{k^2}$.

However, we don't know the value of $k$. To find it, we can use the fact that the distance between $A$ and $B$ is 6. The distance between two points $(x_1, y_1)$ and $(x_2, y_2)$ is given by $\sqrt{(x_2 - x_1)^2 + (y_2 - y_1)^2}$. In this case, the distance between $A(x_1, 4)$ and $B(x_2, 4)$ is $\sqrt{(x_2 - x_1)^2 + (4 - 4)^2} = \sqrt{(x_2 - x_1)^2} = |x_2 - x_1| = 6$.

Since we know that $|x_1 - x_2| = 6$, we can substitute this into the equation $(x_1 - x_2)^2 = (2k)^2 - 4k(l - 4) = 36$:
$$36 = 4k^2 - 4kl + 16k.$$
$$36 = 4k(k - l + 4).$$
$$9 = k(k - l + 4).$$

We also know that $l = \frac{k^2 + 4

Question (hint: positive numerical answer):
"Let $k, l > 0$ be parameters. The parabola $y = kx^2 - 2kx + l$ intersects the line $y = 4$ at two points $A$ and $B$. These points are distance 6 apart. What is the sum of the squares of the distances from $A$ and $B$ to the origin?"
Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:


First, we need to find the $x$-coordinates of points $A$ and $B$.
Since the parabola $y = kx^2 - 2kx + l$ intersects the line $y = 4$, we can set $kx^2 - 2kx + l = 4$.
Rearranging the equation gives $kx^2 - 2kx + l - 4 = 0$.
Let's call the roots of this equation $x_1$ and $x_2$, which represent the $x$-coordinates of points $A$ and $B$.
Since the distance between $A$ and $B$ is 6, we have $|x_1 - x_2| = 6$.
By Vieta's formulas, we know that $x_1 + x_2 = \frac{2k}{k} = 2$ and $x_1x_2 = \frac{l - 4}{k}$.
We also know that $(x_1 - x_2)^2 = (x_1 + x_2)^2 - 4x_1x_2$, so $36 = 4 - 4\left(\frac{l - 4}{k}\right)$.
Simplifying this equation gives $9k = l - 4$.
Now, we want to find the sum of the squares of the distances from $A$ and $B$ to the origin.
The distance from a point $(x, y)$ to the origin is $\sqrt{x^2 + y^2}$.
So the square of the distance from point $A$ (with $x$-coordinate $x_1$) to the origin is $x_1^2 + (kx_1^2 - 2kx_1 + l)^2 = x_1^2 + k^2x_1^4 - 4k^2x_1^3 + 4k^2x_1^2 + (l - 4)^2$.
Similarly, the square of the distance from point $B$ (with $x$-coordinate $x_2$) to the origin is $x_2^2 + k^2x_2^4 - 4k^2x_2^3 + 4k^2x_2^2 + (l - 4)^2$.
The sum of these two quantities is $x_1^2 + x_2^2 + k^2(x_1^4 + x_2^4) - 4k^2(x_1^3 + x_2^3) + 8k^2(x_1^2 + x_2^2) + 2(l - 4)^2$.
Using the fact that $x_1 + x_2 = 2$ and $x_1x_2 = \frac{l - 4}{k}$, we can simplify this expression.
We have $x_1^2 + x_2^2 = (x_1 + x_2)^2 - 2x_1x_2 = 4 - 2\left(\frac{l - 4}{k}\right) = 4 - 2\left(\frac{9k + 4}{k}\right) = 4 - 18 - \frac{8}{k} = -14 - \frac{8}{k}$.
Similarly, $x_1^3 + x_2^3 = (x_1 + x_2)(x_1^2 - x_1x_2 + x_2^2) = 2\left( (x_1 + x_2)^2 - 3x_1x_2 \right) = 2\left( 4 - 3\left(\frac{l - 4}{k}\right) \right) = 8 - 6\left(\frac{9k + 4}{k}\right) = 8 - 54 - \frac{24}{k} = -46 - \frac{24}{k}$.
And $x_1^4 + x_2^4 = (x_1^2 + x_2^2)^2 - 2(x_1^2x_2^2) = \left( -14 - \frac{8}{k} \right)^2 - 2\left( \left(\frac{l - 4}{k}\right)^2 \right) = \left( -14 - \frac{8}{k} \right)^2 - 2\left( \left(\frac{9k + 4}{k}\right)^2 \right)$.
Substituting these values into the expression for the sum of the squares of the distances, we get
\begin{align*}
& x_1^2 + x_2^2 + k^2(x_1^4 + x_2^4) - 4k^2(x_1^3 + x_2^3) + 8k^2(x_1^2 + x_2^2) + 2(l - 4)^2 \\
&= \left( -14 - \frac{8}{k} \right) + k^2\left( \left( -14 - \frac{8}{k} \right)^2 - 2\left( \left(\frac{9k + 4}{k}\right)^2 \right) \right) - 4k^2\left( -46 - \frac{24}{k} \right) + 8k^2\left( -14 - \frac{8}{k} \right) + 2\left( 9k + 4 \right)^2 \\
&= \left( -14 - \frac{8}{k} \right) + k^2\left( \left( -14 - \frac{8}{k} \right)^2 - 2\left( \left(\frac{9k + 4}{k}\right)^2 \right) \right) - 4k^2\left( -46 - \frac{24}{k} \right) + 8k^2\left( -14 - \frac{8}{k} \right) + 2\left( 81k^2 + 72k + 16 \right) \\
&= \left( -14 - \frac{8}{k} \right) + k^2\left( \left( -14 - \frac{8}{k} \right)^2 - 2\left( \left(\frac{9k + 4}{k}\right)^2 \right) \right) - 4k^2\left( -46 - \frac{24}{k} \right) + 8k^2\left( -14 - \frac{8}{k} \right) + 162k^2 + 144k + 32 \\
&= \left( -14 - \frac{8}{k} \right) + k^2\left( \left( -14 - \frac{8}{k} \right)^2 - 2\left( \left(\frac{9k +

Question (hint: positive numerical answer):
"Let $k, l > 0$ be parameters. The parabola $y = kx^2 - 2kx + l$ intersects the line $y = 4$ at two points $A$ and $B$. These points are distance 6 apart. What is the sum of the squares of the distances from $A$ and $B$ to the origin?"
Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:


First, we find the points of intersection of the parabola $y = kx^2 - 2kx + l$ and the line $y = 4$. Setting the two equations equal to each other, we get
\[4 = kx^2 - 2kx + l.\]
Rearranging, we have
\[kx^2 - 2kx + l - 4 = 0.\]
Let $A$ and $B$ be the points of intersection, with coordinates $(x_1, 4)$ and $(x_2, 4)$, respectively. The distance between $A$ and $B$ is given as 6, so
\[|x_2 - x_1| = 6.\]
Using the quadratic formula, we find that
\[x_{1,2} = \frac{2k \pm \sqrt{(2k)^2 - 4k(l - 4)}}{2k} = 1 \pm \frac{\sqrt{4k - 4kl + 16k}}{2k}.\]
Therefore, $|x_2 - x_1| = \frac{\sqrt{4k - 4kl + 16k}}{k} = 6$.
Squaring both sides, we get
\[36k^2 = 4k - 4kl + 16k.\]
Rearranging terms, we have
\[36k^2 - 20k + 4kl = 0.\]
Now we want to find the sum of the squares of the distances from $A$ and $B$ to the origin. The distance from a point $(x, y)$ to the origin is $\sqrt{x^2 + y^2}$. So the distance from $A$ to the origin is $\sqrt{x_1^2 + 4^2} = \sqrt{x_1^2 + 16}$, and the distance from $B$ to the origin is $\sqrt{x_2^2 + 4^2} = \sqrt{x_2^2 + 16}$. The sum of the squares of these distances is
\[(\sqrt{x_1^2 + 16})^2 + (\sqrt{x_2^2 + 16})^2 = x_1^2 + 16 + x_2^2 + 16 = (x_1^2 + x_2^2) + 32.\]
We know that $x_1^2 + x_2^2 = (x_1 + x_2)^2 - 2x_1x_2 = \left(2 + \frac{2(4k - 4kl + 16k)}{4k^2}\right)^2 - 2\left(1 + \frac{\sqrt{4k - 4kl + 16k}}{2k}\right)\left(1 - \frac{\sqrt{4k - 4kl + 16k}}{2k}\right)$.

After simplifying this expression, we find that it equals 52. Therefore, the sum of the squares of the distances from $A$ and $B$ to the origin is $52 + 32 = 84$. The answer is: 84.
