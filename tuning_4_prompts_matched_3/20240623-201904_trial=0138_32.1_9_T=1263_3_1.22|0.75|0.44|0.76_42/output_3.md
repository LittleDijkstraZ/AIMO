Solve the following problem with a Python Script (positive numerical answer):
"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"

Approach:

 The equation is given as
$$((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0.$$
This equation is satisfied if either of the two factors is zero.
If $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$, then $\vert x + y \vert = 10$, which implies $x + y = \pm 10$.
If $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$, then $\vert x - y \vert = 10$, which implies $x - y = \pm 10$.
If $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$, then $\vert x \vert = 8$, which implies $x = \pm 8$.
If $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$, then $\vert y \vert = 8$, which implies $y = \pm 8$.
These equations describe a square with vertices at $(8, 8)$, $(8, -8)$, $(-8, -8)$, and $(-8, 8)$.
The side length of the square is 16, so the area of the square is $16^2 = 256$.
The answer is: 256

 The equation $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + (\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ and $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + (\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ implies that $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$. These equations form a square with side length 16. The area of this square is $16^2 = 256$. The answer is: $256$

Solve the following problem with a Python Script (positive numerical answer):

The equation given is a product of two terms equals zero, which implies that either of the terms must be zero. So we have two cases to consider:

1. $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$
2. $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$

For the first case, both $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2$ and $( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2$ must be zero. This implies that $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. This gives us four lines: $x + y = 10$, $x + y = -10$, $x - y = 10$, and $x - y = -10$. These lines form a square with side length 10. The area of this square is $10^2 = 100$.

For the second case, both $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2$ and $( \vert y \vert - 8)^2$ must be zero. This implies that $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$. This gives us four lines: $x = 8$, $x = -8$, $y = 8$, and $y = -8$. These lines form a square with side length 16. The area of this square is $16^2 = 256$.

However, the convex polygon formed by the intersection of the points satisfying both cases is a square with side length 10 (the smaller square), because the points satisfying the second case are inside the square formed by the points satisfying the first case.

Therefore, the area of the convex polygon is $10^2 = 100$.
The answer is: $100$

The equation $AB=0$ is equivalent to $A=0$ or $B=0$. So we can break down the given equation into two separate cases and solve them separately.

Case 1: $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$.
This implies that $\vert x + y \vert - 10 = 0$ and $\vert x - y \vert - 10 = 0$, so $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$.
The only way for both these equations to be true is if $x = 0$ and $y = 0$.

Case 2: $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$.
This implies that $\vert x \vert - 8 = 0$ and $\vert y \vert - 8 = 0$, so $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$.
The only way for both these equations to be true is if $x = 8$ or $x = -8$ and $y = 8$ or $y = -8$.

So the points that satisfy the given equation are the four vertices of a square with side length 16. The area of the square is therefore $16^2 = 256$.

Therefore, the area of the convex polygon is 256.

The answer is: $256$

Approach:



The equation given is a product of two expressions equal to zero, so either the first expression is zero or the second expression is zero.

The first expression is $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)$, which equals zero only when both $\vert x + y \vert - 10 = 0$ and $\vert x - y \vert - 10 = 0$, which simplifies to $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. This represents a square with side length 20, and the vertices of the square are $(10, 0), (0, 10), (-10, 0),$ and $(0, -10)$.

The second expression is $((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2)$, which equals zero only when both $\vert x \vert - 8 = 0$ and $\vert y \vert - 8 = 0$, which simplifies to $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$. This represents a square with side length 16, and the vertices of the square are $(8, 0), (0, 8), (-8, 0),$ and $(0, -8)$.

Since the two squares have no common points, the convex polygon formed by their intersection is the union of the two squares, which is a rectangle with length 20 and width 16. The area of this rectangle is $20 \times 16 = 320$.

So, the area of the convex polygon is 320 square units. The answer is: $320$

Solve the following problem with a Python Script (positive numerical answer):
"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"

Assistant:

Approach:

 The equation $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ is satisfied if either of the two factors is zero. This gives us four conditions:

1. $\vert x + y \vert - 10 = 0 \Rightarrow \vert x + y \vert = 10$
2. $\vert x - y \vert - 10 = 0 \Rightarrow \vert x - y \vert = 10$
3. $\vert x \vert - 8 = 0 \Rightarrow \vert x \vert = 8$
4. $\vert y \vert - 8 = 0 \Rightarrow \vert y \vert = 8$

These conditions describe a square with side length 16 (from -8 to 8 in both x and y directions). The area of this square is $16^2 = 256$. So, the area of the convex polygon is 256. The answer is: $256$
