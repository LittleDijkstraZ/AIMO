Approach:


The equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has 4 distinct solutions if and only if $\frac{m}{100} = 1$ or $\frac{m}{100} = 3$. 
If $\frac{m}{100} = 1$, then $m=100$.
If $\frac{m}{100} = 3$, then $m=300$.
So, the positive integers $m$ for which the equation has 4 distinct solutions are $100$ and $300$.

Solution:
There are 2 positive integers $m$ that satisfy the condition. The answer is: 2
The answer is: 2

Approach:


The equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has $4$ distinct solutions means that the value of $\frac{m}{100}$ is equal to $2$ or $1$. We can analyze these two cases separately.

Case 1: $\frac{m}{100} = 2$.
In this case, we have $m = 200$. 

Case 2: $\frac{m}{100} = 1$.
In this case, we have $m = 100$.

Therefore, there are only $2$ positive integer values for $m$ that satisfy the condition. The answer is: $2$

Approach:

 The problem asks for how many positive integers $m$ the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has $4$ distinct solutions. We can start by analyzing the equation.

The equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ can have at most $4$ distinct solutions. The quantity $\frac{m}{100}$ must be less than $2$ for the equation to have $4$ solutions. This is because the absolute value function $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert$ reaches its maximum value of $2$ and decreases as the value inside the absolute value increases or decreases. 

So, we have $\frac{m}{100} < 2$, which simplifies to $m < 200$. 

Now we need to find how many positive integers are less than $200$. This is simply $199$. 

However, we also need to check if each of these values of $m$ indeed gives $4$ distinct solutions to the equation. This can be done by graphing the function $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert$ and checking where it equals $\frac{m}{100}$. 

After checking, we find that only $m=100$ gives $4$ distinct solutions. So the number of positive integers $m$ for which the equation has $4$ distinct solutions is $1$.

The answer is: $1$

Approach:



The equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has $4$ distinct solutions if $\frac{m}{100}$ is the distance between the two inner absolute value terms.

We know that the value inside the absolute value of the left side of the equation can be positive or negative. This means we have two cases to consider:

Case 1: $\vert x-1 \vert -2 = \frac{m}{100}$

Case 2: $\vert x-1 \vert -2 = -\frac{m}{100}$

Solving the equations in each case will give us the values of $x$ which satisfy the equation, and the number of distinct solutions.

For each case, we will solve the equations and find the values of $x$. Then we will count the number of distinct solutions for each case and sum them up to find the total number of distinct solutions.

After that, we will check for which values of $m$ the total number of distinct solutions is equal to $4$.

Solution:

Case 1: $\vert x-1 \vert -2 = \frac{m}{100}$

Adding $2$ to both sides gives $\vert x-1 \vert = 2 + \frac{m}{100}$.

This splits into two sub-cases:

Sub-case 1.1: $x-1 = 2 + \frac{m}{100}$
Solving for $x$ gives $x = 3 + \frac{m}{100}$.

Sub-case 1.2: $x-1 = -(2 + \frac{m}{100})$
Solving for $x$ gives $x = -1 - \frac{m}{100}$.

Now, we need to count the number of distinct solutions for each case.

Case 1 gives two solutions: $x = 3 + \frac{m}{100}$ and $x = -1 - \frac{m}{100}$.

Case 2: $\vert x-1 \vert -2 = -\frac{m}{100}$

Adding $2$ to both sides gives $\vert x-1 \vert = 2 - \frac{m}{100}$.

This splits into two sub-cases:

Sub-case 2.1: $x-1 = 2 - \frac{m}{100}$
Solving for $x$ gives $x = 3 - \frac{m}{100}$.

Sub-case 2.2: $x-1 = -(2 - \frac{m}{100})$
Solving for $x$ gives $x = -1 + \frac{m}{100}$.

Case 2 gives two solutions: $x = 3 - \frac{m}{100}$ and $x = -1 + \frac{m}{100}$.

The total number of distinct solutions is the sum of the number of distinct solutions in each case, which is $4$.

Now, we need to check for which values of $m$ the total number of distinct solutions is equal to $4$.

After solving the equations and counting the number of distinct solutions for each case, we find that the total number of distinct solutions is $4$ when $\frac{m}{100}$ is strictly between $0$ and $2$. This means $0 < \frac{m}{100} < 2$, or $0 < m < 200$.

The positive integer values of $m$ that satisfy this condition are $1, 2, ..., 199$. The number of these values is $199$.

However, we need to find the number of values of $m$ for which the equation has exactly $4$ distinct solutions. From the equations we derived, we see that for each value of $m$, the equation has exactly $4$ distinct solutions. Therefore, for the positive integer values of $m$ from $1$ to $199$, the equation has exactly $4$ distinct solutions. The number of these values of $m$ is $199$.

Therefore, the number of positive integers $m$ for which the equation has $4$ distinct solutions is $199$.
The answer is: $199$

Approach:


We first consider the equation \[\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}.\]
We know that $\frac{m}{100}$ is a positive number, so $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert$ must be a positive number as well.
This means that $\vert x-1 \vert -2$ must be either positive or negative.

Case 1: $\vert x-1 \vert -2 > 0$. Then $\vert x-1 \vert > 2$, which means $x-1 > 2$ or $x-1 < -2$. This gives us $x > 3$ or $x < -1$.

Case 2: $\vert x-1 \vert -2 < 0$. Then $\vert x-1 \vert < 2$, which means $-2 < x-1 < 2$. This gives us $-1 < x < 3$.

Now we have four intervals where the equation is defined: $(-\infty, -1)$, $(-1, 1)$, $(1, 3)$, and $(3, \infty)$.
For each of these intervals, we need to find the value of $\frac{m}{100}$.

For $(-\infty, -1)$, we have $\vert x-1 \vert -2 = -(x-1) -2 = -x +1 -2 = -x -1$.
So the equation becomes $\vert -x -1 \vert = \frac{m}{100}$.
This gives us two equations: $-x -1 = \frac{m}{100}$ or $-x -1 = -\frac{m}{100}$.
Solving these equations, we get $x = -1 - \frac{m}{100}$ or $x = -1 + \frac{m}{100}$.
Since $x < -1$, only the second equation is valid. So we have $x = -1 + \frac{m}{100}$.

For $(-1, 1)$, we have $\vert x-1 \vert -2 = x-1 -2 = x -3$.
So the equation becomes $\vert x -3 \vert = \frac{m}{100}$.
This gives us two equations: $x -3 = \frac{m}{100}$ or $x -3 = -\frac{m}{100}$.
Solving these equations, we get $x = 3 + \frac{m}{100}$ or $x = 3 - \frac{m}{100}$.
Since $-1 < x < 1$, only the second equation is valid. So we have $x = 3 - \frac{m}{100}$.

For $(1, 3)$, we have $\vert x-1 \vert -2 = -(x-1) -2 = -x +1 -2 = -x -1$.
So the equation becomes $\vert -x -1 \vert = \frac{m}{100}$.
This gives us two equations: $-x -1 = \frac{m}{100}$ or $-x -1 = -\frac{m}{100}$.
Solving these equations, we get $x = -1 - \frac{m}{100}$ or $x = -1 + \frac{m}{100}$.
Since $1 < x < 3$, only the second equation is valid. So we have $x = -1 + \frac{m}{100}$.

For $(3, \infty)$, we have $\vert x-1 \vert -2 = x-1 -2 = x -3$.
So the equation becomes $\vert x -3 \vert = \frac{m}{100}$.
This gives us two equations: $x -3 = \frac{m}{100}$ or $x -3 = -\frac{m}{100}$.
Solving these equations, we get $x = 3 + \frac{m}{100}$ or $x = 3 - \frac{m}{100}$.
Since $x > 3$, only the first equation is valid. So we have $x = 3 + \frac{m}{100}$.

Now we need to find the value of $\frac{m}{100}$ for each interval.
For $(-\infty, -1)$, we have $x = -1 + \frac{m}{100}$, which means $\frac{m}{100} = 2$, so $m = 200$.
For $(1, 3)$, we have $x = -1 + \frac{m}{100}$, which means $\frac{m}{100} = 4$, so $m = 400$.
For $(3, \infty)$, we have $x = 3 + \frac{m}{100}$, which means $\frac{m}{100} = 2$, so $m = 200$.

Therefore, the only value of $m$ that makes the equation have 4 distinct solutions is $m = 400$.
So the number of positive integers $m$ that satisfy the condition is 1. The answer is: $1$

To find the number of positive integers $m$ such that the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has 4 distinct solutions, we need to analyze the behavior of the equation.

First, we notice that the right-hand side $\frac{m}{100}$ is always positive, so the absolute value on the left-hand side will create two cases:

Case 1: $\vert x-1 \vert -2 = \frac{m}{100}$
Case 2: $\vert x-1 \vert -2 = -\frac{m}{100}$

For each case, we solve the equation for $x$:

Case 1: $\vert x-1 \vert = 2 + \frac{m}{100}$
This gives us two sub-cases:

Sub-case 1.1: $x-1 = 2 + \frac{m}{100} \Rightarrow x = 3 + \frac{m}{100}$
Sub-case 1.2: $-(x-1) = 2 + \frac{m}{100} \Rightarrow x = -1 + \frac{m}{100}$

Case 2: $\vert x-1 \vert = 2 - \frac{m}{100}$
This also gives us two sub-cases:

Sub-case 2.1: $x-1 = 2 - \frac{m}{100} \Rightarrow x = 3 - \frac{m}{100}$
Sub-case 2.2: $-(x-1) = 2 - \frac{m}{100} \Rightarrow x = -1 - \frac{m}{100}$

So we have a total of 4 possible solutions for $x$:

$x = 3 + \frac{m}{100}$, $x = -1 + \frac{m}{100}$, $x = 3 - \frac{m}{100}$, $x = -1 - \frac{m}{100}$

For these 4 solutions to be distinct, the expressions $\frac{m}{100}$ must be different from 3, 1, -1, and -3. This is because if any of these values were equal to one of these expressions, two of the solutions would coincide.

So we need $\frac{m}{100}$ to be between -3 and 3 but not equal to -1, 1. This means $-3 < \frac{m}{100} < 3$ and $\frac{m}{100} \neq \pm 1$.

Multiplying through by 100, we get $-300 < m < 300$ and $m \neq \pm 100$.

The number of positive integers $m$ that satisfy these conditions is the number of positive integers in the interval (0, 299) excluding 100. This is the same as the number of positive integers in the interval (0, 100) minus 1, because 100 is excluded.

So the number of positive integers $m$ is 100 - 1 = 99.
The answer is: 99

1. We first need to understand the structure of the equation \[\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}\].
2. This equation has 4 distinct solutions if the value of $\frac{m}{100}$ is chosen such that the expression inside the absolute value, $\vert x-1 \vert -2$, crosses the x-axis exactly 3 times.
3. This happens when $\frac{m}{100} = 2$.
4. To find the value of $m$, we multiply both sides of the equation $\frac{m}{100} = 2$ by $100$, yielding $m = 200$.

Therefore, the value of $m$ that makes the equation have 4 distinct solutions is $200$.

So, the answer is $\boxed{1}$.

We first analyze the equation \[\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}.\] This equation has 4 distinct solutions if and only if $\frac{m}{100}$ is between $0$ and $2$. This is because the expression on the left side of the equation is always between $0$ and $2$. So we have $0 < \frac{m}{100} < 2$.

Multiplying all sides of the inequality by $100$, we get $0 < m < 200$. Therefore, $m$ is an integer from $1$ to $199$. We want to count how many such $m$'s make the equation have 4 distinct solutions.

From the analysis above, we know that $m$ must be an integer from $1$ to $199$ such that $\frac{m}{100}$ is between $0$ and $2$. This means $1 \leq m < 200$. Therefore, the number of such $m$ is the number of integers from $1$ to $199$.

This is simply the number of integers in the set $\{1, 2, 3, \ldots, 199\}$. This number can be found by subtracting the smallest integer in the set from the largest integer in the set and then adding $1$. So the number of integers in this set is $199 - 1 + 1 = 199$.
The answer is: $199$

To find the number of positive integers $m$ for which the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has $4$ distinct solutions, we first need to understand the properties of the equation.

The equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has four distinct solutions when $\frac{m}{100}$ is equal to the value of the absolute value function at the points where the function changes its slope. This happens when $\vert x-1 \vert -2$ equals $0$ or $-(\frac{m}{100})$.

Setting $\vert x-1 \vert -2=0$, we find that $\vert x-1 \vert =2$, which gives us two equations: $x-1=2$ and $x-1=-2$. Solving these equations, we find that $x=3$ and $x=-1$.

Setting $\vert x-1 \vert -2=-(\frac{m}{100})$, we find that $\vert x-1 \vert =2-\frac{m}{100}$. This gives us two equations: $x-1=2-\frac{m}{100}$ and $x-1=-(2-\frac{m}{100})$. Solving these equations, we find that $x=3-\frac{m}{100}$ and $x=-1+\frac{m}{100}$.

For the equation to have four distinct solutions, the value of $\frac{m}{100}$ must be such that the distances between the four solutions are all equal. This means that the distance between $3$ and $3-\frac{m}{100}$ must be equal to the distance between $3-\frac{m}{100}$ and $-1$, which in turn must be equal to the distance between $-1$ and $-1+\frac{m}{100}$.

Solving the equation $3-(3-\frac{m}{100})=\left(-1-(3-\frac{m}{100})\right)$, we find that $\frac{m}{100}=1$.

Substituting $\frac{m}{100}=1$ into the equation $3-(3-1)=\left(-1-(3-1)\right)$, we find that it holds true.

Therefore, the value of $\frac{m}{100}$ that gives us four distinct solutions is $1$. This means that $m=100$.

Therefore, there is only one positive integer $m$ for which the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has $4$ distinct solutions, and that is $m=100$.

The answer is: $1$
