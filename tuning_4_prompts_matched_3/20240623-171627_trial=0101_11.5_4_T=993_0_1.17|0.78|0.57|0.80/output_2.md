 The problem asks for the number of positive integers $m$ such that the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has $4$ distinct solutions.

Let's first understand the structure of the equation. The equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ is a piecewise function with four cases to consider based on the absolute value expressions. The solutions to the equation will be the x-values that satisfy each case. The number of distinct solutions will be the total number of solutions from all cases.

The number of distinct solutions will be $4$ if and only if the value of $\frac{m}{100}$ is equal to $2$. This is because the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ will have $4$ distinct solutions when the right side of the equation, $\frac{m}{100}$, is equal to $2$. This is because the expression inside the absolute value, $\vert x-1 \vert -2$, will become $0$ only when $x=3$ or $x=-1$, which are the two points of discontinuity in the piecewise function. The value of $\frac{m}{100}$ should be equal to the distance between these two points, which is $4$. So we have $\frac{m}{100}=4$, and solving for $m$ gives $m=400$.

Therefore, there is only one positive integer $m$ that satisfies the condition of having $4$ distinct solutions, and that is $m=400$. The answer is: 1

However, we need to check if the value of $\frac{m}{100}$ actually leads to $4$ distinct solutions. If we substitute $m=400$ into the equation, we get $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{400}{100}=4$. The equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=4$ will have $4$ distinct solutions, namely $x=7$, $x=-1$, $x=3$, and $x=-5$. Thus, the value of $m=400$ does indeed lead to $4$ distinct solutions.

So the number of positive integers $m$ that satisfy the condition of having $4$ distinct solutions is $1$, and the answer is $\boxed{1}$. However, it's important to note that this problem is a bit more complex than it appears at first glance. The equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ actually has four cases to consider, based on the absolute value expressions. The solutions to the equation will be the x-values that satisfy each case. The number of distinct solutions will be the total number of solutions from all cases.

"For how many positive integers $m$ does the equation \[\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}\] have $4$ distinct solutions?"

Assistant:

 To analyze the problem, we first need to understand the graph of the function $f(x) = \vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert$. The function $f(x)$ is a piecewise function that consists of four linear pieces. It has a "V" shape with the "bottom" of the "V" at $x=1$. The width of the "V" is 4 units.

The equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has 4 distinct solutions when the height of the "V" (which is $\frac{m}{100}$) is between 0 and 2. This is because when the height is less than 0, the equation has no solutions. When the height is equal to or greater than 2, the equation has at most 3 distinct solutions.

So we need to find the value of $m$ such that $0 < \frac{m}{100} < 2$. Multiplying all sides of the inequalities by 100 gives $0 < m < 200$. The positive integers $m$ that satisfy this inequality are the integers from 1 to 199. Therefore, there are 199 possible values of $m$. However, we are asked for the number of positive integers $m$ that make the equation have 4 distinct solutions.

By analyzing the graph of the function $f(x)$, we can see that the height of the "V" (which is $\frac{m}{100}$) should be exactly 1 for the equation to have 4 distinct solutions. This is because when the height is 1, the equation has exactly 4 distinct solutions. So we need to find the value of $m$ such that $\frac{m}{100} = 1$. Solving for $m$ gives $m = 100$.

Therefore, the only positive integer $m$ that makes the equation have 4 distinct solutions is 100. So the number of positive integers $m$ that make the equation have 4 distinct solutions is 1. The answer is: 1

Assistant:

 The given equation is a piecewise function, which can be solved by analyzing the different cases for the absolute value function. The piecewise function is:
\[\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}\]

This equation will have 4 distinct solutions if $\frac{m}{100}$ is equal to one of the four distances between the four points where the piecewise function changes behavior.

Let's find these points first:
1. When $x - 1 = 2$, we get $x = 3$.
2. When $x - 1 = -2$, we get $x = -1$.
3. When $|x - 1| = 2$, we get two equations: $x - 1 = 2$ and $x - 1 = -2$. Solving these gives $x = 3$ and $x = -1$.

So the four points are $-1, 1, 3$. The distances between these points are $2, 2$.

Therefore, the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ will have 4 distinct solutions when $\frac{m}{100}$ is equal to $2$ or $2$. This gives us $m = 200$ or $m = 200$.

However, we are asked for the number of positive integers $m$, so we only count $m = 200$.

Therefore, the number of positive integers $m$ for which the equation has 4 distinct solutions is 1. The answer is: $1$

The number of distinct solutions to the equation $||x-1|-2|=\frac{m}{100}$ is equal to 4 if and only if $\frac{m}{100}=1$.
Therefore, $m=100$.
The value of $m$ that makes the equation have 4 distinct solutions is 100. The answer is: $100$

The number of positive integers $m$ for which the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has $4$ distinct solutions is $1$. So, the correct numerical answer is $1$. The previous solution was incorrect as it gave the value as $100$. But the number of positive integers $m$ should be less than or equal to $100$. So, the corrected answer is $1$.
The answer is: $1$
