The equation given is a product of two terms equal to zero, so either the first term is zero or the second term is zero.
The first term is $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)$, which equals zero if and only if $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$.
The second term is $((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2)$, which equals zero if and only if $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$.
Combining these two conditions, we have four cases:
1. $x + y = 10$ and $x - y = 10$, which implies $x = 10$ and $y = 0$.
2. $x + y = 10$ and $x - y = -10$, which implies $x = 0$ and $y = 10$.
3. $x + y = -10$ and $x - y = 10$, which implies $x = 0$ and $y = -10$.
4. $x + y = -10$ and $x - y = -10$, which implies $x = -10$ and $y = 0$.
So the points satisfying the equation are $(10, 0)$, $(0, 10)$, $(0, -10)$, and $(-10, 0)$. These points form a square with side length $20$. The area of this square is $20^2 = 400$. Therefore, the area of the convex polygon is $400$.

    side_length = 20

    return area

The area of the convex polygon is $400$. The answer is $\boxed{400}$.

"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"

The equation is equal to zero if either of the factors is zero. Therefore, we have two sets of equations to solve:

1. $|x + y| - 10 = 0$ and $|x - y| - 10 = 0$
2. $|x| - 8 = 0$ and $|y| - 8 = 0$

For the first set of equations, we have $|x + y| = 10$ and $|x - y| = 10$. This implies that $x + y = \pm 10$ and $x - y = \pm 10$. Solving these four equations, we get the vertices of the polygon: $(5, 5), (5, -5), (-5, 5),$ and $(-5, -5)$.

For the second set of equations, we have $|x| = 8$ and $|y| = 8$. This implies that $x = \pm 8$ and $y = \pm 8$. Solving these four equations, we get the vertices of the polygon: $(8, 0), (-8, 0), (0, 8),$ and $(0, -8)$.

The polygon is a square with side length 10. The area of the square is side length squared, which is $10^2 = 100$. Therefore, the area of the convex polygon is 100 square units. The answer is: $100$

"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"

The equation given in the problem, $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$, is satisfied if and only if at least one of the factors is zero. This means that either $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$.

For the first factor to be zero, we must have $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. These are the equations of two squares with side length 10, centered at the origin, with sides parallel to the coordinate axes. The intersection of these squares forms a square with side length 10 and area $10^2 = 100$.

For the second factor to be zero, we must have $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$. These are the equations of two squares with side length 8, centered at the origin, with sides parallel to the coordinate axes. The intersection of these squares forms a square with side length 8 and area $8^2 = 64$.

Therefore, the points that satisfy the given equation are those that lie in the intersection of these two squares, which forms a square with side length 8. The area of this square is $64$.

However, we made a mistake in our reasoning. The intersection of the two squares with side length 10 and 8, respectively, is not a square with side length 8. The correct intersection is a square with side length 8 that is entirely contained within the square with side length 10.

So, the points that satisfy the given equation are those that lie in the square with side length 8 and area $64$. Therefore, the area of the convex polygon enclosed by these points is 64.

Here is a Python function to calculate the area of the polygon:

```python

    side_length = 8
    area = side_length ** 2

result = polygon_area()

The area of the convex polygon is $64$. The answer is $\boxed{64}$.

This problem requires a deep understanding of absolute value functions and the properties of the square of absolute value functions. 

The equation $A \cdot B = 0$ implies that either $A = 0$ or $B = 0$. So the points that satisfy the given equation are those that make either of the two factors equal to zero.

The factors are:
1. $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2) = 0$
2. $((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$

For the first factor to be zero, we must have $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. This implies that the points must lie on the lines $x + y = 10$, $x + y = -10$, $x - y = 10$, and $x - y = -10$. These lines form a rectangle.

For the second factor to be zero, we must have $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$. This implies that the points must lie on the lines $x = 8$, $x = -8$, $y = 8$, and $y = -8$. These lines form a square.

The intersection of these two regions is the polygon enclosed by the lines $x = \pm8$ and $y = \pm8$, which is a square with side length 16. The area of this square is $16^2 = 256$.

So the area of the convex polygon is 256.

Here is a Python function that calculates the area of the polygon:
```python


INTERMEDIATE OUT :

def polygon_area():
    """The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"""
    side_length = 16
    area = side_length ** 2
    return area

result = polygon_area()
print(result)
```

CODE RESULTS 256

```output

The area of the convex polygon is $256$. The answer is: $256$

 The expression $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ is true if and only if either of the following conditions is true:

1. $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ and $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ and $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ and $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$.
2. $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ and $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ and $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ and $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$.

For the first condition to be true, we must have $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$. This means that $x = \pm 8$ and $y = \pm 8$. So the vertices of the polygon are $(\pm 8, 8)$ and $(\pm 8, -8)$.

For the second condition to be true, we must have $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$. This means that $x = \pm 8$ and $y = \pm 8$. So the vertices of the polygon are $(\pm 8, 8)$ and $(\pm 8, -8)$.

Therefore, the polygon is a square with side length 16. The area of this square is $16^2 = 256$.

So the area of the convex polygon is 256. The answer is: $256$

This problem requires a deep understanding of absolute value functions and their properties, as well as the properties of multiplication and square roots. 

The equation given is a product of two terms equal to zero. This means that either one of the terms is zero, or both terms are zero. 

The terms $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2$ and $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2$ will be zero when $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. These conditions imply that $x + y = \pm 10$ and $x - y = \pm 10$. Solving these equations, we find that the points that satisfy these conditions are $(0, 10)$, $(0, -10)$, $(10, 0)$, $(-10, 0)$, $(8, 2)$, $(8, -2)$, $(-8, 2)$, and $(-8, -2)$.

Similarly, the terms $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2$ and $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2$ will be zero when $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$. This implies that $x = \pm 8$ and $y = \pm 8$. The points that satisfy these conditions are $(8, 8)$, $(8, -8)$, $(-8, 8)$, and $(-8, -8)$.

The points that satisfy the original equation are the intersection points of these two sets, which are $(0, 10)$, $(0, -10)$, $(10, 0)$, $(-10, 0)$, $(8, 2)$, $(8, -2)$, $(-8, 2)$, and $(-8, -2)$ and $(8, 8)$, $(8, -8)$, $(-8, 8)$, and $(-8, -8)$.

These points form a square with side length 10, so the area of the square is $10^2 = 100$.

So the area of the convex polygon is 100 square units.

In Python, you can simply output the result as a numerical value:

```python

def polygon_area():
    """The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"""
    side_length = 10
    area = side_length ** 2
    return area

The area of the convex polygon is 100 square units. The answer is $\boxed{100}$.

"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"

 The given equation is equivalent to the product of two terms being zero, i.e., $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + (\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + (\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$. 

The first equation implies that $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$, which gives us the lines $x + y = 10$, $x + y = -10$, $x - y = 10$, and $x - y = -10$. These lines form a rectangle with side lengths 20 and 10.

The second equation implies that $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$, which gives us the lines $x = 8$, $x = -8$, $y = 8$, and $y = -8$. These lines form a square with side length 16.

The convex polygon enclosed by the points satisfying the given equation is the intersection of the rectangle and the square, which is also a square with side length 10 (the shorter side of the rectangle and the square). 

The area of this square is side length squared, which is $10^2 = 100$. So the area of the convex polygon is 100. The answer is: $100$
