Solve the following problem with a Python Script (positive numerical answer):
"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"
Write comments to indicate the steps you take. Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Approach:

 The given equation is a product of two terms equal to zero, which implies that either of the terms is zero. This breaks down the problem into two cases:

Case 1: $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$. This implies that $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ or $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. The points that satisfy these conditions form a square with side length 20.

Case 2: $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$. This implies that $\vert x \vert = 8$ or $\vert y \vert = 8$. The points that satisfy these conditions form a square with side length 16.

Now, we need to find the intersection of these two squares. The intersection is a square with side length 8.

The area of a square is given by side length squared. Therefore, the area of the convex polygon is $8^2 = 64$. The answer is: $64$.

Solve the following problem with a Python Script (positive numerical answer):
"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"

The equation is $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + (\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + (\vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$.

This equation equals to zero if any of the factors equals zero. Thus, we have the following four cases to consider:

1. $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$. This gives $\vert x + y \vert = 10$, which means $x + y = 10$ or $x + y = -10$.
2. $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$. This gives $\vert x - y \vert = 10$, which means $x - y = 10$ or $x - y = -10$.
3. $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$. This gives $\vert x \vert = 8$, which means $x = 8$ or $x = -8$.
4. $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$. This gives $\vert y \vert = 8$, which means $y = 8$ or $y = -8$.

By solving these equations, we can find the vertices of the polygon. The polygon is a square with side length 20 (since the vertices are at $(8,8)$, $(8,-8)$, $(-8,8)$, and $(-8,-8)$).

The area of the square is $20 \times 20 = 400$. So the area of the convex polygon is $400$.
The answer is: $400$

Approach:

 The equation is equal to zero if either of the factors is zero. So we have two sets of equations:
1) $|x+y| - 10 = 0 \implies |x+y| = 10$
2) $|x-y| - 10 = 0 \implies |x-y| = 10$
3) $|x| - 8 = 0 \implies |x| = 8$
4) $|y| - 8 = 0 \implies |y| = 8$

Solving these gives us the four vertices of the square: $(8,8), (8,-8), (-8,8),$ and $(-8,-8)$. The distance between any two adjacent vertices is 16, so the side length of the square is 16. The area of the square is $16^2 = 256$.
The answer is: $256$.

The given equation is a product of two expressions equal to zero, which means either the first expression is zero or the second expression is zero. 

The first expression is: $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)$. This expression equals zero only when $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. These two equations represent a square with side length of 10 units centered at the origin.

The second expression is: $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2$. This expression equals zero only when $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$, which represent a square with side length of 16 units centered at the origin.

Therefore, the solution to the given equation is the intersection of the two squares, which is a smaller square with side length of 10 units. The area of this square is $10^2 = 100$.

So the area of the convex polygon is $\boxed{100}$ square units.
The answer is: $100$

Approach:



The equation given is a product of two terms equal to zero, which means that either the first term is zero or the second term is zero. This gives us two systems of equations to solve:

1. $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ and $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ and $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ and $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$
2. $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ and $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ and $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ and $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$

Solving each system of equations, we find that the points that satisfy the conditions are:

1. $x = \pm 8$ and $y = \pm 8$
2. $x = 0$ and $y = 0$

These points form a square with side length $16$. The area of this square is $16^2 = 256$.

Therefore, the area of the convex polygon is 256.

The answer is: $256$

Approach:



The equation is equal to zero when either of the two factors are equal to zero.
The first factor is equal to zero when $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ or $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. These are the equations of two lines.
The second factor is equal to zero when $\vert x \vert = 8$ or $\vert y \vert = 8$, which are the equations of four lines.
The intersection of these lines forms a square with side length 16. The area of this square is $16^2 = 256$.

```python


INTERMEDIATE OUT :

def area_of_polygon():
    side_length = 16
    area = side_length ** 2
    return area

result = area_of_polygon()
print(result)
```

CODE RESULTS 256

INTERMEDIATE OUT :
```output
256
```
The area of the convex polygon is $256$. The answer is: $256$.
