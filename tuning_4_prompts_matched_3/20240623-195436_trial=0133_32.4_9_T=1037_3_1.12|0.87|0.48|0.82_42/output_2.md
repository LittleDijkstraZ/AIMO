 To find the number of positive integers $m$ such that the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has $4$ distinct solutions, we need to understand the properties of the absolute value function and how it affects the number of solutions of the equation.

The function $|x-1|$ is a distance function, and $| |x-1|-2|$ is the distance of the point $x$ from the point $1$ which is $2$ units away from it. The equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ means that the distance of the point $x$ from $1$ is $2 \pm \frac{m}{100}$.

This splits into two cases:

1. If $2 - \frac{m}{100} > 0$, i.e., $\frac{m}{100} < 2$, or $m < 200$, the equation becomes $|x-1| = 2 + \frac{m}{100}$, which gives two solutions for $x$.

2. If $2 - \frac{m}{100} = 0$, i.e., $\frac{m}{100} = 2$, or $m = 200$, the equation becomes $|x-1| = 2$, which gives three solutions for $x$.

3. If $2 - \frac{m}{100} < 0$, i.e., $\frac{m}{100} > 2$, or $m > 200$, the equation becomes $|x-1| = 2 - \frac{m}{100}$, which gives one solution for $x$.

For the equation to have $4$ distinct solutions, we need the first case to occur. This means $m$ must be a positive integer less than $200$. The number of such positive integers is $199$.
The answer is: $199$

We are given the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ and asked to find for how many positive integers $m$ this equation has $4$ distinct solutions.

To begin, let's first consider the right hand side of the equation $\frac{m}{100}$. Since $m$ is a positive integer, $\frac{m}{100}$ is a positive fraction.

Now, let's consider the left hand side of the equation, $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert$. This expression is equal to a nonnegative number and it is equal to $\frac{m}{100}$.

From the properties of the absolute value, we know that $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert$ is equal to a nonnegative number. Therefore, $\frac{m}{100}$ must also be equal to a nonnegative number. This means $m$ must be a positive integer.

The equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has $4$ distinct solutions when $\frac{m}{100}$ is equal to $2$. This is because the graph of $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert$ has $4$ distinct x-intercepts when $y$ is equal to $2$.

Therefore, we need to find the value of $m$ such that $\frac{m}{100}=2$. To do this, we simply multiply both sides of the equation by $100$ to get $m=200$.

Hence, the only positive integer $m$ for which the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has $4$ distinct solutions is $200$.

Therefore, the number of positive integers $m$ for which the equation has $4$ distinct solutions is $1$. The answer is: $1$

Approach:


1. We will try to find the number of positive integers m for which the equation $| |x - 1| - 2 | = \frac{m}{100}$ has exactly four distinct solutions.

2. First, let's consider the range of $\frac{m}{100}$. Since $| |x - 1| - 2 |$ is a modulus function and its value can never be negative, $\frac{m}{100}$ must be less than 2 (the maximum value of $| |x - 1| - 2 |$). Therefore, $0 \leq \frac{m}{100} < 2$, which gives $0 \leq m < 200$.

3. Now, we need to find the number of positive integers m for which the equation has exactly four distinct solutions.

4. The equation $| |x - 1| - 2 | = \frac{m}{100}$ has four distinct solutions when the right side $\frac{m}{100}$ is equal to the value of $| |x - 1| - 2 |$ in the intervals $(0, 2)$ for four times.

5. The value of $| |x - 1| - 2 |$ is 1 at $x = 1, 3$. So, we need to find the values of m for which $\frac{m}{100} = 1$. This gives $m = 100$.

6. Therefore, there is only one value of m for which the equation has four distinct solutions. Hence, the number of positive integers m is 1.
The answer is: $\boxed{1}$

Approach:



The equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has four distinct solutions if and only if $\frac{m}{100} = 2$.

This is because the function $| |x-1|-2|$ has a graph with four distinct "humps" if and only if the absolute value on the right-hand side is equal to 2.

So, we need to solve the equation $\frac{m}{100} = 2$.

Solution:

To find $m$, we can multiply both sides of the equation $\frac{m}{100} = 2$ by $100$ to get $m = 2 \cdot 100 = 200$.

So, the only positive integer $m$ for which the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has four distinct solutions is $200$.
The answer is: $1$

Solve the following problem with a Python Script (positive numerical answer):
"For how many positive integers $m$ does the equation \[\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}\] have $4$ distinct solutions?"
Write comments to indicate the steps you take. Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Assistant:

Approach:

 The number of distinct solutions of the equation $| |x-1|-2|=\frac{m}{100}$ is $4$ if and only if $\frac{m}{100}$ is strictly between $2-1=1$ and $2+1=3$, because the function $| |x-1|-2|$ oscillates between $1$ and $3$ (see graph).

So, $1 < \frac{m}{100} < 3$, which simplifies to $100 < m < 300$. The positive integers $m$ that satisfy this inequality are the integers from $101$ to $299$, inclusive. To find the total number of these integers, we subtract the smallest integer from the largest and add $1$. This gives us $299 - 101 + 1 = 199$.

Therefore, the number of positive integers $m$ for which the equation has $4$ distinct solutions is $199$.

The answer is: 199

To solve the problem, we need to find the number of positive integers $m$ such that the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has exactly 4 distinct solutions.

The equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ can be rewritten as $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$.

The function $y=\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert$ has a graph that consists of two "V" shapes, each with a width of 4 units. The equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has 4 distinct solutions when $\frac{m}{100}$ is equal to the height of one of the "V" shapes, which is 2. Therefore, we have $m=200$.

Therefore, the only positive integer $m$ for which the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has 4 distinct solutions is 200.

The number of such positive integers $m$ is 1. Therefore, the answer is $1$.

However, we have overlooked a point here. The equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ also has 4 distinct solutions when $\frac{m}{100}$ is the height of the other "V" shape, which is 0. In this case, we have $m=0$, but the problem asks for positive integers $m$, so $m=0$ is not a valid solution.

This oversight is due to our misunderstanding of the problem. The problem asks for the number of positive integers $m$ for which the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has exactly 4 distinct solutions. We have correctly found that this happens when $m=200$, but we have overlooked the case when $\frac{m}{100}=0$, which is not a positive integer.

To correct this, we need to revise our approach. The equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has exactly 4 distinct solutions when $\frac{m}{100}$ is equal to the height of either of the "V" shapes. The heights of the "V" shapes are 2 and 0, but 0 is not a positive integer, so the only valid height is 2, which corresponds to $m=200$. Therefore, the number of positive integers $m$ for which the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has exactly 4 distinct solutions is 1.

Therefore, the answer is $1$. The missing value is $1$. The answer is: $1$.
The answer is $\boxed{1}$.
