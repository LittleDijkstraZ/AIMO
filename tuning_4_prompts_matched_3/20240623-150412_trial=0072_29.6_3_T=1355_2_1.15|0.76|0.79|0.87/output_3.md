Question (hint: positive numerical answer):
"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"
Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:


The product of two numbers is zero if and only if at least one of the numbers is zero. Therefore, the equation $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ is satisfied if and only if either $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$.

The equation $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ implies that $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. This is only possible if $x = \pm 10$ and $y = \pm 10$. So, the points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying this equation are $(\pm 10, \pm 10)$.

The equation $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ implies that $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$. This is only possible if $x = \pm 8$ and $y = \pm 8$. So, the points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying this equation are $(\pm 8, \pm 8)$.

The points $(\pm 10, \pm 10)$ and $(\pm 8, \pm 8)$ form a square with side length 20. The area of this square is $20^2 = 400$.
The answer is: $400$

Question (hint: positive numerical answer):
"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"
Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:


The product of two numbers is zero if and only if at least one of the numbers is zero. Therefore, the equation $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ is satisfied if and only if either $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$.

The equation $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ implies that $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. These two equations are satisfied only when $x = \pm 10$ and $y = \pm 10$. So the points are $(\pm 10, \pm 10)$.

The equation $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ implies that $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$. These two equations are satisfied only when $x = \pm 8$ and $y = \pm 8$. So the points are $(\pm 8, \pm 8)$.

Therefore, the convex polygon is a square with side length 16 (since the distance between $(\pm 10, \pm 10)$ and $(\pm 8, \pm 8)$ is $\sqrt{(10 - 8)^2 + (10 - 8)^2} = \sqrt{8} = 4\sqrt{2}$, and the side length of the square is twice the distance, which is $2 \cdot 4\sqrt{2} = 8\sqrt{2} = 16$).

The area of a square is the side length squared, so the area of the square is $16^2 = 256$. The answer is: $256$.

Question (hint: positive numerical answer):
"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"
Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:



For the product of two numbers to be zero, one of the numbers must be zero. Thus, we have two cases to consider:

Case 1: $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ and $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$.
For the first equation to be zero, we must have $\vert x + y \vert = 10$, and for the second equation to be zero, we must have $\vert x - y \vert = 10$.
This means that the points must lie on the lines $x + y = \pm 10$ and $x - y = \pm 10$.

Case 2: $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ and $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$.
For the first equation to be zero, we must have $\vert x \vert = 8$, which means $x = \pm 8$, and for the second equation to be zero, we must have $\vert y \vert = 8$, which means $y = \pm 8$.
This means that the points must lie on the lines $x = \pm 8$ and $y = \pm 8$.

By plotting these lines on a coordinate plane, we can see that the points that satisfy both cases form a square with side length 20. The area of this square is $20^2 = 400$.
The answer is: $400$.

Question (hint: positive numerical answer):
"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"
Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:



The product of two numbers is zero if and only if at least one of the numbers is zero. This means that the given equation is equivalent to the system of equations:

$$((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2) = 0,$$
$$((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0.$$

The first equation is satisfied if and only if $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. These are the equations of two lines in the plane, and the solution set is a square with side length 20 and area $400$.

The second equation is satisfied if and only if $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$. These are also the equations of two lines in the plane, and the solution set is a square with side length 16 and area $256$.

The intersection of the two solution sets is the convex polygon we are interested in. This polygon is the smaller square, and its area is 256.

Therefore, the area of the convex polygon is 256. The answer is: $256$

Question (hint: positive numerical answer):
"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"
Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:


The equation given is $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$. For the product of two numbers to be zero, either one of the numbers must be zero. This gives us two cases to consider.

Case 1: $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$. This can only happen if both $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ and $( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$. This means that $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. The solutions to these equations are all points on the lines $x + y = 10$ and $x - y = 10$, or $x + y = -10$ and $x - y = -10$. These lines form a rectangle with vertices at $(10, 0)$, $(0, 10)$, $(-10, 0)$, and $(0, -10)$.

Case 2: $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$. This can only happen if both $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ and $( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$. This means that $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$. The solutions to these equations are all points on the lines $x = 8$ and $x = -8$, and $y = 8$ and $y = -8$. These lines form a square with vertices at $(8, 8)$, $(8, -8)$, $(-8, 8)$, and $(-8, -8)$.

The intersection of the solutions to these two cases is the convex polygon formed by the intersection of the rectangle and the square. The area of this convex polygon is the area of the rectangle minus the area of the square. The area of the rectangle is $20 \times 20 = 400$, and the area of the square is $16 \times 16 = 256$. Therefore, the area of the convex polygon is $400 - 256 = 144$. The answer is: $144$

Question (hint: positive numerical answer):
"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"
Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:


The equation given is $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$.
For this product to be zero, either the first factor is zero or the second factor is zero.
The first factor is zero when $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$.
These are the equations of two squares with side length 10 centered at the origin.
The second factor is zero when $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$.
These are the equations of two squares with side length 16 centered at the origin.
The points that satisfy either of these conditions are the vertices of a convex polygon.
The convex polygon is the intersection of these two squares.
The area of this polygon is the area of the square with side length 10 minus the area of the square with side length 8.
The area of a square with side length $a$ is $a^2$.
So the area of the polygon is $10^2 - 8^2 = 100 - 64 = 36$. The answer is: 36

Question (hint: positive numerical answer):
"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"
Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:


The expression $AB = 0$ is equivalent to $A = 0$ or $B = 0$. So, the given equation is equivalent to:
$$((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2) = 0 \quad \text{or} \quad ((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0.$$
For the first equation to be zero, we must have $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$.
This gives us the lines $x + y = 10$ and $x + y = -10$, and the lines $x - y = 10$ and $x - y = -10$.
For the second equation to be zero, we must have $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$.
This gives us the lines $x = 8$ and $x = -8$, and the lines $y = 8$ and $y = -8$.
Plotting these lines on a coordinate plane, we see that they form a square with side length 16.
The area of this square is $16^2 = 256$. The answer is: $256$

"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"
Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:


The product of two numbers is zero if and only if at least one of the numbers is zero. Therefore, the equation is satisfied if either $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2) = 0$ or $((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$.

If $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2) = 0$, then $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. This means that $x + y = \pm 10$ and $x - y = \pm 10$. Solving these equations gives us the points $(5,5)$, $(5,-5)$, $(-5,5)$, and $(-5,-5)$.

If $((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$, then $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$. This means that $x = \pm 8$ and $y = \pm 8$. Solving these equations gives us the points $(8,8)$, $(8,-8)$, $(-8,8)$, and $(-8,-8)$.

Plotting these points, we can see that they form a square with side length 10. The area of this square is $10^2 = 100$. Therefore, the area of the convex polygon is 100 square units. The answer is: $100$

"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"
Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:


The expression $AB=0$ is satisfied if and only if $A=0$ or $B=0$. So the given equation is satisfied if and only if at least one of the following two conditions is satisfied:

1. $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$.
2. $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$.

For the first condition to be true, we must have $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. This means that $x + y = \pm 10$ and $x - y = \pm 10$. Solving these equations gives us the vertices of the square: $(8,2)$, $(8,-2)$, $(-8,2)$, and $(-8,-2)$.

For the second condition to be true, we must have $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$. This means that $x = \pm 8$ and $y = \pm 8$. Solving these equations gives us the vertices of the square: $(8,8)$, $(8,-8)$, $(-8,8)$, and $(-8,-8)$.

The intersection of these two squares is the convex polygon whose area we are asked to find. This intersection is a square with side length 8. The area of this square is $8^2 = 64$.
The answer is: $64$

Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:


The expression $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2)$ is equal to zero if and only if either $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$, $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$, $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$, or $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$.
This means that either $\vert x + y \vert = 10$, $\vert x - y \vert = 10$, $\vert x \vert = 8$, or $\vert y \vert = 8$.
The first two equations represent lines $x + y = \pm 10$ and $x - y = \pm 10$, and the last two equations represent lines $x = \pm 8$ and $y = \pm 8$.
These lines form a square with side length 16, so the area of the square is $16^2 = 256$. The answer is: $256$
