Question (hint: positive numerical answer):
"For how many positive integers $m$ does the equation \[\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}\] have $4$ distinct solutions?"
Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:


The equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has $4$ distinct solutions.
We know that the absolute value function $|x|$ is equal to $x$ when $x \geq 0$ and $-x$ when $x < 0$.
So, we can split the equation into two cases:
Case 1: $\vert x-1 \vert -2 = \frac{m}{100}$.
This gives us $\vert x-1 \vert = 2 + \frac{m}{100}$.
Now, we split this into two subcases:
Subcase 1.1: $x-1 = 2 + \frac{m}{100}$.
This gives us $x = 3 + \frac{m}{100}$.
Subcase 1.2: $-(x-1) = 2 + \frac{m}{100}$.
This gives us $x = -1 + \frac{m}{100}$.
Case 2: $\vert x-1 \vert -2 = -\frac{m}{100}$.
This gives us $\vert x-1 \vert = 2 - \frac{m}{100}$.
Now, we split this into two subcases:
Subcase 2.1: $x-1 = 2 - \frac{m}{100}$.
This gives us $x = 3 - \frac{m}{100}$.
Subcase 2.2: $-(x-1) = 2 - \frac{m}{100}$.
This gives us $x = -1 - \frac{m}{100}$.
For each of these subcases, we want to find the value of $m$ such that the four solutions are distinct.
We can see that the four solutions are $3 + \frac{m}{100}$, $-1 + \frac{m}{100}$, $3 - \frac{m}{100}$, and $-1 - \frac{m}{100}$.
For these to be distinct, we require that $\frac{m}{100} > 2$, $\frac{m}{100} > 1$, $\frac{m}{100} < 2$, and $\frac{m}{100} < -1$.
This gives us the system of inequalities:
\[\frac{m}{100} > 2,\]
\[\frac{m}{100} > 1,\]
\[\frac{m}{100} < 2,\]
\[\frac{m}{100} < -1.\]
The first and third inequalities are equivalent, and the second and fourth inequalities are equivalent.
So, we only need to consider the first and second inequalities.
From the first inequality, we get $m > 200$.
From the second inequality, we get $m > 100$.
Therefore, the values of $m$ that satisfy both inequalities are $m > 200$.
Since $m$ is a positive integer, the possible values of $m$ are $m = 201, 202, 203, \dots$.
There are $\boxed{100}$ such values of $m$.
The value of $m$ that makes the four solutions distinct is 201.
The answer is: 100

Question (hint: positive numerical answer):
"For how many positive integers $m$ does the equation \[\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}\] have $4$ distinct solutions?"
Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:



The equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has $4$ distinct solutions if and only if $\frac{m}{100}$ is strictly between $1$ and $2$.
This means $1 < \frac{m}{100} < 2$.
Multiplying all parts of the inequality by $100$ gives $100 < m < 200$.
The positive integers $m$ that satisfy this inequality are the integers from $101$ to $199$, inclusive.
To find the number of these integers, we subtract the smallest integer from the largest and add $1$: $199 - 101 + 1 = 99$.
Therefore, the number of positive integers $m$ for which the equation has $4$ distinct solutions is $99$. The answer is: $99$

Question (hint: positive numerical answer):
"For how many positive integers $m$ does the equation \[\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}\] have $4$ distinct solutions?"
Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:


The equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has 4 distinct solutions when $\frac{m}{100}=2$. This is because the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=a$ has 4 distinct solutions when $a=2$. 

To see why, let's first understand the structure of the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=a$. The equation has 4 distinct solutions when $a=2$. The solutions are $x=3$, $x=-1$, $x=1+2+a$ and $x=1-2-a$. For $a=2$, these solutions are $x=3$, $x=-1$, $x=5$ and $x=-3$. So, the equation has 4 distinct solutions.

Now, we solve the equation $\frac{m}{100}=2$ for $m$. Multiply both sides by 100 to get $m=200$. So, the number of positive integers $m$ for which the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has 4 distinct solutions is 1, since $m=200$ is the only positive integer solution.
The answer is: 1

Question (hint: positive numerical answer):
"For how many positive integers $m$ does the equation \[\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}\] have $4$ distinct solutions?"
Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:



First, we need to understand that the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has 4 distinct solutions.

The equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ can be rewritten as two separate equations: $\vert x-1 \vert -2 = \frac{m}{100}$ and $\vert x-1 \vert -2 = -\frac{m}{100}$.

For the first equation, $\vert x-1 \vert = 2 + \frac{m}{100}$. This equation has two sub-equations: $x-1 = 2 + \frac{m}{100}$ and $x-1 = -(2 + \frac{m}{100})$. Solving these gives $x = 3 + \frac{m}{100}$ and $x = -1 - \frac{m}{100}$ respectively.

For the second equation, $\vert x-1 \vert = 2 - \frac{m}{100}$. This equation also has two sub-equations: $x-1 = 2 - \frac{m}{100}$ and $x-1 = -(2 - \frac{m}{100})$. Solving these gives $x = 3 - \frac{m}{100}$ and $x = -1 + \frac{m}{100}$ respectively.

So, the four solutions are $x = 3 + \frac{m}{100}$, $x = -1 - \frac{m}{100}$, $x = 3 - \frac{m}{100}$, and $x = -1 + \frac{m}{100}$.

For these four solutions to be distinct, we must have $3 + \frac{m}{100} \neq -1 - \frac{m}{100}$, $3 + \frac{m}{100} \neq 3 - \frac{m}{100}$, $-1 - \frac{m}{100} \neq -1 + \frac{m}{100}$, and $3 - \frac{m}{100} \neq -1 + \frac{m}{100}$.

Solving these inequalities, we find that $m > 0$ and $m < 100$. So, $m$ can be any positive integer less than 100.

However, we also need to make sure that the solutions are real. For this, we must have $2 - \frac{m}{100} \geq 0$, which gives $m \leq 200$. And $2 + \frac{m}{100} \geq 0$, which gives $m \geq -200$. But $m$ must be positive, so we only consider $m \leq 200$.

Therefore, the possible values of $m$ are the positive integers between 1 and 100. The number of such integers is 100.

So, the number of positive integers $m$ for which the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has 4 distinct solutions is 100. The answer is: $100$

Question (hint: positive numerical answer):
"For how many positive integers $m$ does the equation \[\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}\] have $4$ distinct solutions?"
Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:


The equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has $4$ distinct solutions,
which means the right-hand side is a number between $0$ and $1$.
For the left-hand side to be between $0$ and $1$, we need $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert$ to be equal to a number between $0$ and $1$.
The expression $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert$ is equal to $0$ when $\vert x-1 \vert = 2$, which gives us two solutions $x=3$ and $x=-1$.
So for $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert$ to be between $0$ and $1$,
we need $\vert x-1 \vert$ to be between $1$ and $3$.
This gives us the inequality $1 < \vert x-1 \vert < 3$.
The solutions to this inequality are $-2 < x < 4$.
Now we need to find the value of $\frac{m}{100}$ that makes this true.
Since $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert$ is between $0$ and $1$,
$\frac{m}{100}$ must also be between $0$ and $1$.
Therefore, $0 < \frac{m}{100} < 1$, which means $0 < m < 100$.
The positive integers $m$ that satisfy this inequality are $1, 2, 3, \dots, 99$.
However, we need to count the number of these integers that make the original equation have $4$ distinct solutions.
For each value of $m$, the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has $4$ distinct solutions.
Therefore, the number of positive integers $m$ that satisfy the condition is $99$.
The answer is: $99$

Question (hint: positive numerical answer):
"For how many positive integers $m$ does the equation \[\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}\] have $4$ distinct solutions?"
Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:


The equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has $4$ distinct solutions.
We know that the absolute value function $|x|$ is always nonnegative, and it equals $x$ if $x \geq 0$ and $-x$ if $x < 0$.
So we can split the equation into two cases:

Case 1: $\vert x-1 \vert -2 = \frac{m}{100}$.
In this case, we can add $2$ to both sides to get $\vert x-1 \vert = 2 + \frac{m}{100}$.
Then we split this into two sub-cases:

Sub-case 1.1: $x-1 = 2 + \frac{m}{100}$.
Solving for $x$, we get $x = 3 + \frac{m}{100}$.

Sub-case 1.2: $x-1 = -(2 + \frac{m}{100})$.
Solving for $x$, we get $x = -1 - \frac{m}{100}$.

Case 2: $\vert x-1 \vert -2 = -\frac{m}{100}$.
In this case, we can add $2$ to both sides to get $\vert x-1 \vert = 2 - \frac{m}{100}$.
Then we split this into two sub-cases:

Sub-case 2.1: $x-1 = 2 - \frac{m}{100}$.
Solving for $x$, we get $x = 3 - \frac{m}{100}$.

Sub-case 2.2: $x-1 = -(2 - \frac{m}{100})$.
Solving for $x$, we get $x = -1 + \frac{m}{100}$.

For each value of $m$, we have $4$ distinct solutions: $3 + \frac{m}{100}$, $-1 - \frac{m}{100}$, $3 - \frac{m}{100}$, and $-1 + \frac{m}{100}$.

For these solutions to be distinct, we must have $3 + \frac{m}{100} \neq -1 - \frac{m}{100}$, $3 + \frac{m}{100} \neq 3 - \frac{m}{100}$, $3 + \frac{m}{100} \neq -1 + \frac{m}{100}$, $-1 - \frac{m}{100} \neq 3 - \frac{m}{100}$, $-1 - \frac{m}{100} \neq -1 + \frac{m}{100}$, and $3 - \frac{m}{100} \neq -1 + \frac{m}{100}$.

Solving these inequalities, we find that $m$ must be greater than $100$ and less than $300$.

The positive integers $m$ that satisfy these conditions are $101, 102, \ldots, 299$.

To find the number of these integers, we subtract the smallest value from the largest value and then add $1$: $299 - 101 + 1 = 198$.

Therefore, there are $198$ positive integers $m$ for which the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has $4$ distinct solutions. The answer is: $198$

Question (hint: positive numerical answer):
"For how many positive integers $m$ does the equation \[\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}\] have $4$ distinct solutions?"
Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:


The equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has $4$ distinct solutions.
This equation represents a piecewise function with four cases based on the absolute value expressions.
For each case, we need to solve the equation and count the number of distinct solutions.
Case 1: $\vert x-1 \vert -2 = \frac{m}{100}$ and $x-1 \ge 0$.
In this case, $\vert x-1 \vert = x-1$ and the equation becomes $x-1-2 = \frac{m}{100}$, or $x = 3 + \frac{m}{100}$.
Substituting this into the original equation, we get $\vert 3 - 1 - 2 \vert = \frac{m}{100}$, or $\vert -2 \vert = \frac{m}{100}$.
This simplifies to $2 = \frac{m}{100}$, so $m = 200$.
Case 2: $\vert x-1 \vert -2 = \frac{m}{100}$ and $x-1 < 0$.
In this case, $\vert x-1 \vert = 1-x$ and the equation becomes $1-x-2 = \frac{m}{100}$, or $x = 1 - \frac{m}{100}$.
Substituting this into the original equation, we get $\vert 1 - (1 - \frac{m}{100}) - 2 \vert = \frac{m}{100}$, or $\vert \frac{m}{100} - 2 \vert = \frac{m}{100}$.
This simplifies to $\frac{m}{100} - 2 = \frac{m}{100}$ or $\frac{m}{100} - 2 = -\frac{m}{100}$.
The first equation gives $2 = 0$, which is not possible.
The second equation gives $2\frac{m}{100} = 2$, so $m = 100$.
Case 3: $\vert x-1 \vert -2 = -\frac{m}{100}$ and $x-1 \ge 0$.
In this case, the equation becomes $x-1-2 = -\frac{m}{100}$, or $x = 1 - \frac{m}{100}$.
Substituting this into the original equation, we get $\vert 1 - (1 - \frac{m}{100}) - 2 \vert = -\frac{m}{100}$, or $\vert \frac{m}{100} - 2 \vert = -\frac{m}{100}$.
This simplifies to $\frac{m}{100} - 2 = -\frac{m}{100}$ or $\frac{m}{100} - 2 = \frac{m}{100}$.
The first equation gives $2 = 0$, which is not possible.
The second equation gives $2\frac{m}{100} = 2$, so $m = 100$.
Case 4: $\vert x-1 \vert -2 = -\frac{m}{100}$ and $x-1 < 0$.
In this case, $\vert x-1 \vert = 1-x$ and the equation becomes $1-x-2 = -\frac{m}{100}$, or $x = 1 + \frac{m}{100}$.
Substituting this into the original equation, we get $\vert 1 - (1 + \frac{m}{100}) - 2 \vert = -\frac{m}{100}$, or $\vert -\frac{m}{100} - 2 \vert = -\frac{m}{100}$.
This simplifies to $-\frac{m}{100} - 2 = -\frac{m}{100}$ or $-\frac{m}{100} - 2 = \frac{m}{100}$.
The first equation gives $2 = 0$, which is not possible.
The second equation gives $2\frac{m}{100} = 2$, so $m = 100$.
From the four cases, we see that $m = 100$ is the only value that gives $4$ distinct solutions.
Therefore, the number of positive integers $m$ is $1$. The answer is: $1$

Question (hint: positive numerical answer):
"For how many positive integers $m$ does the equation \[\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}\] have $4$ distinct solutions?"
Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:



The equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has 4 distinct solutions.
This means that the expression inside the absolute value, $\vert x-1 \vert -2$, must take on two values that are $\frac{m}{100}$ apart.
Let's denote these two values as $a$ and $a+\frac{m}{100}$.
So we have the equation $\vert x-1 \vert -2 = a$ and $\vert x-1 \vert -2 = a+\frac{m}{100}$.

Solving these two equations separately:

For the first equation $\vert x-1 \vert -2 = a$, we have $\vert x-1 \vert = a+2$. This gives us two possibilities: $x-1 = a+2$ or $x-1 = -(a+2)$. Solving these for $x$ gives $x = a+3$ or $x = -a+1$.

For the second equation $\vert x-1 \vert -2 = a+\frac{m}{100}$, we have $\vert x-1 \vert = a+\frac{m}{100}+2$. This gives us two possibilities: $x-1 = a+\frac{m}{100}+2$ or $x-1 = -(a+\frac{m}{100}-2)$. Solving these for $x$ gives $x = a+\frac{m}{100}+3$ or $x = -a-\frac{m}{100}+1$.

The four distinct solutions are $a+3$, $-a+1$, $a+\frac{m}{100}+3$, and $-a-\frac{m}{100}+1$.

The difference between $a+3$ and $-a+1$ is $4a+2$.
The difference between $a+\frac{m}{100}+3$ and $-a-\frac{m}{100}+1$ is $2a+\frac{2m}{100}+2$.

We want these two differences to be equal, so we have the equation $4a+2 = 2a+\frac{2m}{100}+2$. Simplifying gives $2a = \frac{2m}{100}$, or $a = \frac{m}{100}$.

Substituting this into $a+3$ and $-a+1$ gives the solutions $x = \frac{m}{100}+3$ and $x = 1-\frac{m}{100}$.

For these solutions to be distinct, we must have $\frac{m}{100}+3 \neq 1-\frac{m}{100}$. Simplifying gives $m \neq 50$.

So the only value of $m$ that works is $m=50$. However, for $m=50$, the equation becomes $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{50}{100}=0.5$. The equation $\vert x-1 \vert -2 = 0.5$ has only two solutions, not four. Therefore, there must be an error in our reasoning.

Let's go back and check our work.

When we set $\vert x-1 \vert -2 = a$ and $\vert x-1 \vert -2 = a+\frac{m}{100}$, we assumed that $a$ and $a+\frac{m}{100}$ are the two values that $\vert x-1 \vert -2$ takes on. However, this is not necessarily true.

The expression $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert$ can be at most 2 (when $\vert x-1 \vert = 2$), so the right-hand side of the equation, $\frac{m}{100}$, must be less than or equal to 2. This gives us the inequality $m \leq 200$.

Now let's go back and try again.

The equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has 4 distinct solutions. This means that the expression inside the absolute value, $\vert x-1 \vert -2$, must take on two values that are $\frac{m}{100}$ apart.

Let's denote these two values as $-b$ and $b$, where $b > 0$. So we have the equation $\vert x-1 \vert -2 = -b$ and $\vert x-1 \vert -2 = b$.

Solving these two equations separately:

For the first equation $\vert x-1 \vert -2 = -b$, we have $\vert x-1 \vert = 2-b$. This gives us two possibilities: $x-1 = 2-b$ or $x-1 = -(2-b)$. Solving these for $x$ gives $x = b+1$ or $x = -b+3$.

For the second equation $\vert x-1 \vert -2 = b$, we have $\vert x-1 \vert = b+2$. This gives us two possibilities: $x-1 = b+2$ or $x-1 = -(b+2)$. Solving these for $x$ gives $x = b+3$ or $x = -b-1$.

The four distinct solutions are $b+1$, $-b+3$, $b+3$, and $-b-1$.

The difference between $b+1$ and $-b+3$ is $2b+2$.
The difference between $b+3$ and $-b-1$ is $2b+4$.

We want these two differences to be equal, so we have the equation $2b+2 = 2b+4$. This equation has no solution, which means our assumption that the expression inside the absolute value takes on the values $-b$ and $b$ is incorrect.

Let's try a different approach.

The equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has 4 distinct solutions. This means that the expression inside the absolute value, $\vert x-1 \vert -2$, must take on two values that are $\frac{m}{100}$ apart.

Let's denote these two values as $-a$ and $a$, where $a > 0$. So we have the equation $\vert x-1 \vert -2 = -a$ and $\vert x-1 \vert -2 = a$.

Solving these two equations separately:

For the first equation $\vert x-1 \vert -2 = -a$, we have $\vert x-1 \vert = 2-a$. This gives us two possibilities: $x-1 = 2-a$ or $x-1 = -(2-a)$. Solving these for $x$ gives $x = a+1$ or $x = -a+3$.

For the second equation $\vert x-1 \vert -2 = a$, we have $\vert x-1 \vert =

Question (hint: positive numerical answer):
"For how many positive integers $m$ does the equation \[\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}\] have $4$ distinct solutions?"
Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:


The equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has $4$ distinct solutions.
This means that the expression inside the absolute value, $\vert x-1 \vert -2$, must take on the values $\frac{m}{100}$, $0$, $-\frac{m}{100}$ twice.
This happens when the absolute value is equal to $\frac{m}{100}$ or $0$.
So we have two cases to consider:
Case 1: $\vert x-1 \vert -2 = \frac{m}{100}$.
Adding $2$ to both sides gives $\vert x-1 \vert = 2 + \frac{m}{100}$.
This equation has two solutions: $x = 1 + 2 + \frac{m}{100} = 3 + \frac{m}{100}$ and $x = 1 - (2 + \frac{m}{100}) = -1 - \frac{m}{100}$.
Case 2: $\vert x-1 \vert -2 = 0$.
Adding $2$ to both sides gives $\vert x-1 \vert = 2$.
This equation has two solutions: $x = 1 + 2 = 3$ and $x = 1 - 2 = -1$.
So the four distinct solutions are $x = 3 + \frac{m}{100}$, $x = -1 - \frac{m}{100}$, $x = 3$, and $x = -1$.
To have four distinct solutions, we need $-1 < -1 - \frac{m}{100} < 3 + \frac{m}{100} < 3$.
Simplifying this inequality gives $-1 < -1 - \frac{m}{100} < 3$ and $-1 - \frac{m}{100} < 3 + \frac{m}{100} < 3$.
The first inequality simplifies to $0 < \frac{m}{100} < 4$, which is equivalent to $0 < m < 400$.
The second inequality simplifies to $-2 < \frac{m}{50} < 2$, which is equivalent to $-100 < m < 100$.
The intersection of these two intervals is $0 < m < 100$.
Therefore, the positive integers $m$ for which the equation has $4$ distinct solutions are the integers from $1$ to $99$, inclusive.
The number of such integers is $99$. The answer is: $99$

Question (hint: positive numerical answer):
"For how many positive integers $m$ does the equation \[\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}\] have $4$ distinct solutions?"
Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Step-by-step Solution:


The equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has 4 distinct solutions.
This means that the expression inside the absolute value, $\vert x-1 \vert -2$, must be of the form $-a, 0, a$, for some positive number $a$.
For $\vert x-1 \vert -2 = -a$, we have $\vert x-1 \vert = 2-a$. This gives us two solutions: $x = 1-2+a = a+1$ and $x = 1-(-2+a) = 3-a$.
For $\vert x-1 \vert -2 = 0$, we have $\vert x-1 \vert = 2$, which gives us two solutions: $x = 1+2 = 3$ and $x = 1-2 = -1$.
For $\vert x-1 \vert -2 = a$, we have $\vert x-1 \vert = 2+a$. This gives us two solutions: $x = 1-2-a = -a-1$ and $x = 1-(2+a) = -a-1$.
So, the four distinct solutions are $x = a+1, 3-a, 3, -1$.
The distance between any two consecutive solutions is $2a$, which must be less than 2 (since the solutions must be distinct). This implies that $a < 1$.
Therefore, the only possible value for $a$ is 1, and the corresponding value of $m$ is $100 \cdot 1 = 100$.
So, there is only one positive integer $m$ that satisfies the condition, and the answer is $\boxed{1}$.
The answer is: $1$
