Interesting, let's analyze step by step:



1. We are given an equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ with $4$ distinct solutions and we are asked to find the number of positive integers $m$ for which this is true.

2. To start, we can ignore the fraction $\frac{m}{100}$ and just look at the number of solutions to the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert = k$, where $k$ is a positive integer.

3. The equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert = k$ has $4$ solutions when $k = 1$.

4. To see why, consider the following:
   - If $\vert x-1 \vert -2 = 1$, then $\vert x-1 \vert = 3$, which gives us $x-1 = 3$ or $x-1 = -3$, so $x = 4$ or $x = -2$.
   - If $\vert x-1 \vert -2 = -1$, then $\vert x-1 \vert = 1$, which gives us $x-1 = 1$ or $x-1 = -1$, so $x = 2$ or $x = 0$.

5. Therefore, the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert = k$ has $4$ solutions when $k = 1$.

6. To get back to the original problem, we need to find the value of $m$ such that $\frac{m}{100} = 1$. This gives us $m = 100$.

7. Since $m$ must be a positive integer, the only value that satisfies this is $m = 100$.

8. Therefore, the number of positive integers $m$ for which the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has $4$ distinct solutions is $1$.

9. To confirm this, we can check that the equation indeed has $4$ distinct solutions for $m = 100$:

   $$\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{100}{100} \Rightarrow \vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert = 1.$$

   This equation has the same solutions as the one we found earlier: $x = 4$, $x = -2$, $x = 2$, and $x = 0$.

So, the number of positive integers $m$ for which the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has $4$ distinct solutions is $1$.
The answer is: $1$

Interesting, let's analyze step by step:



The equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has 4 distinct solutions. This means that the right side of the equation ( $\frac{m}{100}$) is the distance between the vertical lines. So, we are looking for the number of values of $m$ for which the distance is exactly 2 units.

Let's analyze the equation:

$\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$

We know that $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert$ can only be 0 or greater than 0.

If $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert = 0$, we have $\vert x-1 \vert = 2$, so $x-1 = 2$ or $x-1 = -2$. This gives us $x = 3$ or $x = -1$.

If $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert > 0$, we have $\vert x-1 \vert -2 = \frac{m}{100}$ or $\vert x-1 \vert -2 = -\frac{m}{100}$.

For $\vert x-1 \vert -2 = \frac{m}{100}$, we have $\vert x-1 \vert = 2 + \frac{m}{100}$, so $x-1 = 2 + \frac{m}{100}$ or $x-1 = -2 - \frac{m}{100}$. This gives us $x = 3 + \frac{m}{100}$ or $x = -1 - \frac{m}{100}$.

For $\vert x-1 \vert -2 = -\frac{m}{100}$, we have $\vert x-1 \vert = 2 - \frac{m}{100}$, so $x-1 = 2 - \frac{m}{100}$ or $x-1 = -2 + \frac{m}{100}$. This gives us $x = 3 - \frac{m}{100}$ or $x = -1 + \frac{m}{100}$.

Now, to have 4 distinct solutions, we need to find the values of $m$ for which the vertical lines are at a distance of exactly 2 units. This means that $2 - \frac{m}{100} = 0$, so $m = 200$.

Therefore, the only value of $m$ for which the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has 4 distinct solutions is $m = 200$. Since $200$ is a positive integer, the answer is: $1$.

The value of $m$ that satisfies the equation is $200$.
The value of $m$ that satisfies the equation is a positive integer.

Therefore, the value of $m$ that satisfies the equation and is a positive integer is indeed $200$. The answer is:

\[1.\]
The value of $m$ that satisfies the equation and is a positive integer is indeed $200$. The answer is:

\[1.\]

Interesting, let's analyze step by step:



The equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has 4 distinct solutions. The value of $m$ is what we are looking for. 

First, let's analyze the expression $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert$ . It takes the absolute value of the quantity $\vert x-1 \vert -2$ . The function $\vert x-1 \vert$ is the distance of $x$ from 1, so $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert$ represents the distance of the distance of $x$ from 1 from 2. 

This means that the expression $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert$ equals to $\frac{m}{100}$ will have 4 solutions when $\frac{m}{100}$ falls into the range $(0,2)$.

So we have $0 < \frac{m}{100} < 2$, which gives $0 < m < 200$.

The value of $m$ that satisfies this condition and makes the equation have 4 distinct solutions is 100.

The answer is: $1$.

However, it's not 1 but 100, so the solution is incorrect. Let's retrace our steps.

When we solved $0 < \frac{m}{100} < 2$ we made an error. The correct inequality should be $0 < m/100 < 2$, which gives $0 < m < 200$.

However, the value of $m$ that satisfies this condition and makes the equation have 4 distinct solutions is not 100, but rather 1.

The mistake was in the way we interpreted the problem. The problem is asking for how many positive integers $m$ does the equation have 4 solutions. We interpreted it as the value of m that makes the equation have 4 solutions. The correct interpretation is that m is a positive integer that makes the equation have 4 solutions. 

For the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ to have 4 distinct solutions, $\frac{m}{100}$ must fall into the range $(0,2)$. This means $0 < m < 200$. The positive integer values of $m$ that satisfy this condition are 1, 2, ..., 199. However, we are asked for how many of these values make the equation have 4 solutions. By analyzing the equation further, we can deduce that the equation has 4 solutions when $m=1$. Therefore, there is only one value of $m$, which is 1, that makes the equation have 4 solutions.

The corrected answer is 1.

However, it's important to note that the original interpretation of the problem led to the correct answer, it's just that the wrong value of m was chosen.

Interesting, let's analyze step by step:



The equation is $| |x-1| - 2| = \frac{m}{100}$. The number of distinct solutions is 4.

The inner absolute value can take on a value of $ |x-1| - 2 = y$ or $ |x-1| - 2 = -y$. This gives us two equations: 

1. $|x-1| = y + 2$ 
2. $|x-1| = 2 - y$.

Now, for each of these equations, the outer absolute value can be positive or negative:

For $|x-1| = y + 2$:

  a. $x - 1 = y + 2$ or $x - 1 = -(y + 2)$. These are the equations $x = y + 3$ and $x = -y + 1$.
  
For $|x-1| = 2 - y$:

  b. $x - 1 = 2 - y$ or $x - 1 = -(2 - y)$. These are the equations $x = y - 1$ and $x = y + 1$.

So, we have 4 distinct equations:

1. $x = y + 3$
2. $x = -y + 1$
3. $x = y - 1$
4. $x = y + 1$

For these 4 equations to have 4 distinct solutions, the y-intercepts should be different. This implies that $y = 0$ should give different values for the four equations. 

Substituting $y = 0$ into the four equations, we get:

1. $x = 3$
2. $x = 1$
3. $x = -1$
4. $x = 1$

We can see that the second and fourth equations give the same value of $x = 1$, so we discard it. Now we have 3 distinct values of $x$ for 3 different values of $y$. 

This means that $m = 100y$, where $y$ takes on the values $1, 2, 3$. Checking these values, we find that only $y = 2$ gives an integer value of $m$:

$m = 100 * 2 = 200$.

So, the only positive integer value of $m$ for which the equation has 4 distinct solutions is $200$.

Therefore, the answer is $\boxed{1}$.

Interesting, let's analyze step by step:



The equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has 4 distinct solutions. We know that the expression $\frac{m}{100}$ must be a non-negative number because of the absolute value. This implies $m$ is a non-negative number. The maximum value of $m$ is 100 because $\frac{m}{100}$ cannot exceed 1.

We can see that the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has 4 distinct solutions when $\frac{m}{100} = 1$. Solving for $m$, we get $m = 100$. 

Therefore, the only positive integer $m$ for which the equation has 4 distinct solutions is 100.
The answer is: $1$
