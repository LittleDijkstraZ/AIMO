Interesting, let's analyze step by step:



$(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0 \Rightarrow \vert x + y \vert = 10, \vert x - y \vert = 10$

This system of equations implies that $x + y = \pm10$ and $x - y = \pm10$. We can solve this system to get the four lines as follows:

1. $x + y = 10 \Rightarrow y = 10 - x$
2. $x + y = -10 \Rightarrow y = -10 - x$
3. $x - y = 10 \Rightarrow y = x - 10$
4. $x - y = -10 \Rightarrow y = x + 10$

These lines form a rectangle with vertices at $(0, 0), (0, 20), (20, 0),$ and $(0, -20)$. The side lengths of this rectangle are $20$ and $40$, so the area of this rectangle is $20 \times 40 = 800$.

But, $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0 \Rightarrow \vert x \vert = 8, \vert y \vert = 8$. This means $x = \pm8$ and $y = \pm8$, which means the rectangle is completely inside the square formed by the lines $x = \pm8$ and $y = \pm8$. The side length of this square is $16$, so the area of this square is $16^2 = 256$.

Therefore, the area of the convex polygon enclosed by the given equations is the area of the rectangle minus the area of the square, which is $800 - 256 = 544$. This is a positive integer, so our answer is correct. The area of the convex polygon is $544$.

The answer is: $544$

Interesting, let's analyze step by step:



1. First, let's define some variables:

   Let $x$ and $y$ represent the coordinates of the points in the plane.

2. Now, let's examine the given equation:

   The equation is $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$.

   This equation is equal to zero if either of the two factors is zero.

   The first factor, $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)$, is zero if and only if $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$.

   The second factor, $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$, is zero if and only if $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$.

3. The solutions to these equations are:

   For the first factor, we have $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. This means that the points $(x, y)$ lie on the squares with side length 10 centered at the origin.

   For the second factor, we have $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$. This means that the points $(x, y)$ lie on the squares with side length 16 centered at the origin.

4. The intersection of these two sets of points is a square with side length 8, since the square with side length 10 centered at the origin contains the square with side length 16 centered at the origin.

5. The area of this square is $8^2 = 64$.

So, the area of the convex polygon is 64. Since 64 is a positive integer, we have found the correct answer. The answer is:

$$64$$

Interesting, let's analyze step by step:



The expression $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2)$ equals to zero if and only if both of the following conditions are satisfied:
1. $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ and $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$, which implies $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$.
2. $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ and $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$, which implies $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$.

From the first condition, we have $x + y = \pm 10$ and $x - y = \pm 10$, which gives us four pairs of $(x, y)$: $(5, 5)$, $(5, -5)$, $(-5, 5)$, and $(-5, -5)$. From the second condition, we have $x = \pm 8$ and $y = \pm 8$, which gives us four pairs of $(x, y)$: $(8, 0)$, $(8, 0)$, $(0, 8)$, and $(0, -8)$. Combining these two sets of points, we have a total of 8 points: $(5, 5)$, $(5, -5)$, $(-5, 5)$, $(-5, -5)$, $(8, 0)$, $(8, 0)$, $(0, 8)$, and $(0, -8)$.

These 8 points form a square with side length 10, so the area of the square is $10^2 = 100$. Therefore, the area of the convex polygon is 100.

```python


INTERMEDIATE OUT :

from sympy import symbols, Rational, simplify

def area_of_polygon():
    # The side length of the square is 10
    side_length = 10

    # Calculate the area of the square

    return area

result = area_of_polygon()
print(result)
```

The area of the convex polygon is $100$. The answer is: $100$

Interesting, let's analyze step by step:



The given equation is a product of two terms equaling zero, so one of the terms must be zero. This gives us two systems of equations:

1. $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ and $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ and $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$.
2. $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$

From the first system, we get:
- $\vert x + y \vert = 10$, which implies $x + y = \pm 10$ or $x + y = 0$.
- $\vert x \vert = 8$, which implies $x = \pm 8$.
- $\vert y \vert = 8$, which implies $y = \pm 8$.

From the second system, we get:
- $\vert x - y \vert = 10$, which implies $x - y = \pm 10$ or $x - y = 0$.

Now, we analyze the solutions:

From the first system, we have the following cases:
- For $x + y = \pm 10$ and $x = \pm 8$, we get $y = \pm 2$.
- For $x + y = 0$ and $x = \pm 8$, we get $y = \mp 8$.

From the second system, we have the following cases:
- For $x - y = \pm 10$ and $x = \pm 8$, we get $y = \mp 2$.

The possible solutions are $(\pm 8, \pm 2)$ and $(\pm 8, \mp 8)$.

Plotting these points on a coordinate plane, we see that they form a square with side length $10$. So, the area of this square is $10^2 = 100$. Therefore, the area of the convex polygon is $100$. The answer is: $100$

Interesting, let's analyze step by step:


The only way that this product can be 0 is if one of the terms is 0. Thus, we have three sets of conditions that need to be met:
1. $|x + y| - 10 = 0$, $|x - y| - 10 = 0$, $|x| - 8 = 0$, and $|y| - 8 = 0$.
2. $|x + y| - 10 = 0$ and $|x| - 8 = 0$ and $|y| - 8 = 0$ and $|x - y| - 10 \neq 0$.
3. $|x + y| - 10 = 0$ and $|x| - 8 = 0$ and $|y| - 8 = 0$ and $|x - y| - 10 = 0$.
The first set of conditions lead to $x = y = \pm 8$, the second set of conditions is not possible because it would make the first term 0, which is not possible if the second term is non-zero, and the third set of conditions also is not possible for the same reason.
So the points are at $(\pm 8, \pm 8)$. This forms a square with side length 16. The area of this square is $16^2 = 256$. The value 256 is a positive integer, as required. The answer is: $256$

Interesting, let's analyze step by step:


The product of two terms is zero if and only if at least one of the terms is zero. This translates into four cases:

Case 1: $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ and $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ and $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ and $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$.

Case 2: $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ and $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ and $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ and $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 \neq 0$.

Case 3: $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ and $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 \neq 0$ and $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ and $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$.

Case 4: $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ and $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 \neq 0$ and $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ and $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 \neq 0$.

Case 5: $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 \neq 0$ and $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ and $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ and $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$.

Case 6: $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 \neq 0$ and $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ and $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ and $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 \neq 0$.

Case 7: $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 \neq 0$ and $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 \neq 0$ and $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ and $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$.

Case 8: $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 \neq 0$ and $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 \neq 0$ and $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ and $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 \neq 0$.

Case 1: From $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ and $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ and $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ and $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$, we get $x = \pm 8$ and $y = \pm 8$. This case corresponds to the vertices of the square with side length 16.

Case 2-8: The other cases lead to similar conditions, but they do not yield any additional vertices.

So the points are vertices of a square with side length 16. The area of the square is $16^2 = 256$. The answer is: $\boxed{256}$

Interesting, let's analyze step by step:



Given a condition of the form $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$, the product of two terms is zero if and only if at least one of the terms is zero. This translates to two conditions: 
1. $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$, or
2. $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$.

For the first condition to hold, we must have both $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. This implies that $x$ and $y$ are both $5$ or both $-5$.

For the second condition to hold, we must have both $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$, which implies that $x$ is in the set $\{-8,8\}$ and $y$ is in the set $\{-8,8\}$.

So, the points that satisfy the condition are the four points of intersection of the lines $x = \pm 5$ and $y = \pm 5$ with the square $[-8, 8] \times [-8, 8]$. This forms a square with side length $10$, so the area of the square is $10^2 = 100$.

Therefore, the area of the convex polygon is $100$.

To solve this problem using sympy, we wouldn't need sympy as the solution can be derived directly from the conditions and geometry. The result is $100$.

The area of the convex polygon is 100.
The answer is: $100$
