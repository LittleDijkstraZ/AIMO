- Outline the steps using sympy to solve the problem:
  * Identify the sympy functions required for each step.
  * Implement these functions step-by-step, commenting each line for clarity.
- Calculate the final answer and verify it's a positive integer.

Assistant:

Interesting, let's analyze step by step:



1. The equation is given as:
\[((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0\]

2. This equation is satisfied if either of the following two equations is satisfied:
\[(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0 \quad \text{or} \quad (\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0\]
\[(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0 \quad \text{or} \quad (\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0\]

3. Solving these equations gives us the coordinates of the vertices of the polygon:
\[(x, y) = (8, 8), (-8, 8), (8, -8), (-8, -8)\]

4. Now, we can calculate the area of the polygon using the formula for the area of a square:
\[Area = side^2 = 16^2 = 256\]

5. The area of the polygon is 256 square units. Since the problem asks for a positive integer, the answer is valid.

The answer is: $256$

Below is a math problem you are to solve (positive numerical answer):
"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"

Interesting, let's analyze step by step:



The equation given is a product of two terms equals zero. This means that either the first term equals zero or the second term equals zero. So, we have two cases to consider:

1. $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$
2. $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$

For the first case, we have:

$(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ and $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$

This implies that $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. The solutions to these equations are the lines $x + y = 10$ and $x - y = 10$.

For the second case, we have:

$(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ and $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$

This implies that $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$. The solutions to these equations are the lines $x = 8$ and $y = 8$.

The intersection of these lines forms a square with side length 10 (from the first case) and vertices at $(8,8)$, $(8,-8)$, $(-8,-8)$, and $(-8,8)$.

The area of this square is $10^2 = 100$.

So, the area of the convex polygon is 100. Since 100 is a positive integer, we can conclude that the answer is $\boxed{100}$.
The answer is: $100$

Below is a math problem you are to solve (positive numerical answer):
"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"

Interesting, let's analyze step by step:



The equation is a product of two terms equal to zero. This means that either the first term is zero or the second term is zero. 

The first term is $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)$ and the second term is $((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2)$. 

For the first term to be zero, both $\vert x + y \vert - 10 = 0$ and $\vert x - y \vert - 10 = 0$, which implies $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. This gives us four lines: $x + y = \pm10$ and $x - y = \pm10$.

For the second term to be zero, both $\vert x \vert - 8 = 0$ and $\vert y \vert - 8 = 0$, which implies $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$. This gives us four lines: $x = \pm8$ and $y = \pm8$.

The intersection of these lines form a square with side length 16. The area of this square is $16^2 = 256$.

So the area of the convex polygon is 256.

To confirm that our answer is correct, we can verify that it's a positive integer. The area of the square is indeed a positive integer, 256.

The answer is: $256$

Interesting, let's analyze step by step:



The equation given is $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$.

This equation equals to zero if either of the two factors equals to zero. Therefore, we have two cases:

Case 1: $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$.
This equation can only be true if $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$.
This implies that $x + y = \pm 10$ and $x - y = \pm 10$.
Solving these equations, we get four lines: $x + y = 10$, $x + y = -10$, $x - y = 10$, and $x - y = -10$.

Case 2: $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$.
This equation can only be true if $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$.
This implies that $x = \pm 8$ and $y = \pm 8$.
So we get four lines: $x = 8$, $x = -8$, $y = 8$, and $y = -8$.

The intersection of these lines forms a square with side length 10 (from the lines $x + y = \pm 10$ and $x - y = \pm 10$), and the vertices of the square are at $(8, 8)$, $(8, -8)$, $(-8, 8)$, and $(-8, -8)$.

The area of this square is $10^2 = 100$.

So the area of the convex polygon is 100.

The answer is: $100$

Interesting, let's analyze step by step:



The equation given is:
$$((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$$

This equation is equal to zero if and only if either of the two factors is equal to zero. This gives us two sets of equations to solve:

1. $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ and $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$
2. $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ and $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$

For the first set of equations, we have:

1. $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$
2. $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ implies that either $x + y = 10$ or $x + y = -10$.
3. $\vert x \vert = 8$ implies that either $x = 8$ or $x = -8$.
4. $\vert y \vert = 8$ implies that either $y = 8$ or $y = -8$.

By analyzing all possible combinations, we find that the solutions are the points $(8, 2), (8, -10), (-8, 10), (-8, -2), (2, 8), (-10, -8), (10, 8), (-2, -8)$.

For the second set of equations, the process is similar, and we find the same set of solutions.

So, the points satisfying the equation form a square with side length 10. The area of this square is $10^2 = 100$.

Therefore, the area of the convex polygon is 100. The answer is: $100$

Interesting, let's analyze step by step:



The equation given is $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + (\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + (\vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$. For the product of two numbers to be zero, either one of them must be zero. That means either $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + (\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + (\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$.

If $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + (\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$, then $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. This means that $x + y = \pm 10$ and $x - y = \pm 10$. Solving these equations gives us the vertices of the polygon.

If $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + (\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$, then $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$, which means that $x = \pm 8$ and $y = \pm 8$. This gives us the vertices of the polygon as well.

Now, we can find the vertices of the polygon by solving the system of equations. The vertices are the points where the equations intersect. The polygon is a square with side length 16. To find the area, we simply square the side length: $16^2 = 256$.

So the area of the polygon is 256.

The answer is: $256$

Interesting, let's analyze step by step:



The equation $A \cdot B = 0$ implies that at least one of the factors must be zero. Thus, either:

1. $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$
2. $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$

From 1., we get $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. From 2., we get $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$.

The solutions to $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ are the lines $x + y = 10$ and $x + y = -10$. The solutions to $\vert x - y \vert = 10$ are the lines $x - y = 10$ and $x - y = -10$. The solutions to $\vert x \vert = 8$ are the lines $x = 8$ and $x = -8$. The solutions to $\vert y \vert = 8$ are the lines $y = 8$ and $y = -8$.

The intersection points of these lines are: $(8, 2)$, $(8, -2)$, $(-8, 2)$, $(-8, -2)$, $(2, 8)$, $(-2, 8)$, $(2, -8)$, and $(-2, -8)$. These points form a square with side length 16. The area of this square is $16^2 = 256$.

Therefore, the area of the convex polygon is 256 square units. The answer is: $256$
