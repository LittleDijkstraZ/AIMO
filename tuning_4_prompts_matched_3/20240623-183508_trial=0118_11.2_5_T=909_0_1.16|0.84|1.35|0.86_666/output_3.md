Below is a math problem you are to solve (positive numerical answer!):
"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"
Analyze this problem and think step by step to come to a solution with programs. After solving the problem, output the final numerical answer within \boxed{}.

Assistant:

 The given equation is satisfied only when both $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ and $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$, or both $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ and $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$.
This means that either $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$, or $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$.
The first set of conditions gives us four lines: $x + y = \pm 10$ and $x - y = \pm 10$.
The second set of conditions gives us four lines: $x = \pm 8$ and $y = \pm 8$.
These lines enclose a square with side length 16.
The area of this square is $16^2 = 256$.
The answer is: $256$.

Below is a math problem you are to solve (positive numerical answer!):
"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"
Analyze this problem and think step by step to come to a solution with programs. After solving the problem, output the final numerical answer within \boxed{}.

Assistant:


The given equation is equal to zero if and only if both factors are equal to zero. Therefore, we have the following four equations:
1. $\vert x + y \vert - 10 = 0$
2. $\vert x - y \vert - 10 = 0$
3. $\vert x \vert - 8 = 0$
4. $\vert y \vert - 8 = 0$
From equations 3 and 4, we get $x = \pm 8$ and $y = \pm 8$.
From equations 1 and 2, we get $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. This implies that the points $(x, y)$ must satisfy either $x + y = 10$ or $x + y = -10$ and either $x - y = 10$ or $x - y = -10$.
By solving these four systems of equations, we find that the points $(x, y)$ are the vertices of a square with side length 16.
The area of this square is $16^2 = 256$. Therefore, the area of the convex polygon is 256. The answer is: $256$

Below is a math problem you are to solve (positive numerical answer!):
"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"
Analyze this problem and think step by step to come to a solution with programs. After solving the problem, output the final numerical answer within \boxed{}.

Assistant:

 The equation is satisfied if and only if at least one of the factors is zero. Therefore, we have two cases to consider:

1. $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0 \Rightarrow \vert x + y \vert = 10$.
2. $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0 \Rightarrow \vert x - y \vert = 10$.
3. $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0 \Rightarrow \vert x \vert = 8$.
4. $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0 \Rightarrow \vert y \vert = 8$.

From cases 3 and 4, we get that the point lies in a square with side length 16.

From cases 1 and 2, we get that the point lies on a square grid with a side length of 20 units. The points that satisfy both conditions are the vertices of the square with side length 16.

The area of the square with side length 16 is $16^2 = 256$. So, the area of the convex polygon is 256 square units. The answer is: $256$

Below is a math problem you are to solve (positive numerical answer!):
"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"
Analyze this problem and think step by step to come to a solution with programs. After solving the problem, output the final numerical answer within \boxed{}.

Assistant:

 The expression $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ implies that $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$, which means $x + y = \pm 10$ and $x - y = \pm 10$.
Solving these equations gives us the vertices of the polygon: $(8,2)$, $(8,-2)$, $(-8,2)$, and $(-8,-2)$.
Similarly, $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ implies that $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$, which means $x = \pm 8$ and $y = \pm 8$.
The polygon is a square with side length $16$, so its area is $16^2 = 256$. The answer is: $256$
