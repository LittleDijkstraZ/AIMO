The expression $AB = 0$ is equivalent to $A = 0$ or $B = 0$. Therefore, the given equation is equivalent to one of the following:

1. $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$
2. $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$

In the first case, we have $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. This gives a square with side length 10 units.
In the second case, we have $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$. This gives a square with side length 16 units.

The intersection of these two squares forms a smaller square whose side length is 8 units (the difference between the side lengths of the two squares). The area of this square is therefore $8^2 = 64$ square units.
The answer is $\boxed{64}$.

"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"

Assistant:


First, we understand that the equation $f(x, y) = 0$ if and only if either $g(x, y) = 0$ or $h(x, y) = 0$, where
\[
g(x, y) = (\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2
\]
and
\[
h(x, y) = (\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2.
\]
Setting $g(x, y) = 0$ gives $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$, which lead to the lines $x + y = 10$, $x + y = -10$, $x - y = 10$, and $x - y = -10$. Similarly, setting $h(x, y) = 0$ gives $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$, which lead to the lines $x = 8$, $x = -8$, $y = 8$, and $y = -8$. These lines form a rectangle with vertices at $(8, 8)$, $(8, -8)$, $(-8, -8)$, and $(-8, 8)$.

Hence, the area of the convex polygon is equal to the area of the rectangle, which is the product of the lengths of two adjacent sides. The lengths of the sides are both 16 (the difference between 8 and -8), so the area is $16 \times 16 = 256$. Therefore, the area of the convex polygon is 256.
The answer is: $256$.

 The given equation is equal to 0 if either of the factors is equal to 0. This means that the points satisfying the equation must satisfy either $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$.

For the first factor to be 0, we must have $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. These absolute value equations imply that $x + y = \pm 10$ and $x - y = \pm 10$. Solving these four equations, we get the vertices of the convex polygon: $(0, 10), (0, -10), (10, 0), (-10, 0)$.

For the second factor to be 0, we must have $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$. This implies that $x = \pm 8$ and $y = \pm 8$. Solving these four equations, we get the vertices of the convex polygon: $(8, 8), (8, -8), (-8, 8), (-8, -8)$.

All together, the convex polygon is a square with side length 10. Therefore, the area of the convex polygon is $10 \times 10 = 100$. The answer is: $100$

This problem appears to be a challenge that requires deep mathematical knowledge and not straightforward programming solutions. As a mathematician, I can attempt to solve the problem. The given equation $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + (\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + (\vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ encloses a region in the xy plane which forms a convex polygon. To find the area of the polygon, we need to identify the points that satisfy this equation.

The equation is satisfied if and only if both of the following conditions are met:
1. $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ and $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$, which implies $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$.
2. $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ and $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$, which implies $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$.
From condition 1, we have $x + y = \pm 10$ and $x - y = \pm 10$, which imply that $x = \pm 5$ and $y = \pm 5$.
From condition 2, we have $x = \pm 8$ and $y = \pm 8$.
The intersection of these points gives us the vertices of the polygon:
$(8, 8), (-8, 8), (8, -8),$ and $(-8, -8)$.

The polygon is a square with side length $10$, so its area is $10^2 = 100$. The answer is: $100$

Below is a math problem you are to solve (positive numerical answer!):
"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"
Analyze this problem and think step by step to come to a solution with programs. After solving the problem, output the final numerical answer within \boxed{}.

 To solve this problem, let's first analyze the equation given:
$$ ((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + (\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + (\vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0. $$

The expression equals to zero if either one of the two factors equal to zero. Thus, we have two cases:
$$ (\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + (\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0 \quad \text{or} \quad (\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + (\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0. $$

For the first case, we have:
$$ \vert x + y \vert - 10 = 0 \quad \text{and} \quad \vert x - y \vert - 10 = 0, $$
which implies $x = y = 0$ or $x = -y = 10$.

For the second case, we have:
$$ \vert x \vert - 8 = 0 \quad \text{and} \quad \vert y \vert - 8 = 0, $$
which implies $x = 8$ or $x = -8$, and $y = 8$ or $y = -8$.

Plotting these points in a coordinate plane, we find that they form a square with side length $20$, centered at the origin. Therefore, the area of this square is $20^2 = 400$. The final answer is $400$.

The area of the convex polygon formed by the solution of the equation equals the area of a square of sides $16$. This is because for each absolute term $|\cdot|$, if it is $0$, then the value inside the absolute value must be zero. This translates to a requirement on the coordinates $x$ and $y$ and encloses a square in the coordinate plane. The side of this square is $16$ because $|x|=8$ and $|y|=8$ mean that $x$ is between $-8$ and $8$, and $y$ is between $-8$ and $8$. The area of this square is thus $16^2=256$.

The problem statement presents a condition that the product of two expressions is equal to zero, which means that each of the expressions must be zero. 

This gives us the following four conditions:

1. $\vert x + y \vert - 10 = 0 \Rightarrow \vert x + y \vert = 10$.
2. $\vert x - y \vert - 10 = 0 \Rightarrow \vert x - y \vert = 10$.
3. $\vert x \vert - 8 = 0 \Rightarrow \vert x \vert = 8$.
4. $\vert y \vert - 8 = 0 \Rightarrow \vert y \vert = 8$.

From conditions 3 and 4, we get that $-8 \leq x \leq 8$ and $-8 \leq y \leq 8$. 

From conditions 1 and 2, we have four cases to consider:

Case 1: $x + y = 10$.
Case 2: $x + y = -10$.
Case 3: $x - y = 10$.
Case 4: $x - y = -10$.

The area enclosed by the convex polygon is the area of the square formed by the intersection of all these cases. The side of the square is the diagonal of a rectangle with sides $10$ and $8$, by Pythagorean theorem the length of the diagonal (which is a side of the square) is $\sqrt{10^2+8^2}=\sqrt{164}$. 

The area of the square is thus the square of the side, which is $(\sqrt{164})^2 = 164$. Therefore, the area of the convex polygon is $164$.

Notice that in this case, the problem actually gives you the answer through the conditions directly without needing any calculations, since the polygon is a square with side length $10$, hence the area is $10^2=100$. However, this solution is incorrect, because in condition 2 we are missing a part: this condition includes points where $|x - y| = 10$, i.e. the "vertical" segment in the middle of the square. These points should not be included as they would decrease the area of the convex polygon. 

Hence, by condition 2, we should consider $|x - y| = 10$, which means the square should be "cut" into two equal parts by a line $y = x$, or a line $y = -x$. This divides the square into two congruent right triangles. Each of these triangles has base $10\sqrt{2}$ and height $8\sqrt{2}$, so the area of each triangle is $1/2 * 10\sqrt{2} * 8\sqrt{2} = 80$, and hence, the area of the convex polygon is $2 * 80 = 160$.

Now let's find the final numerical answer as requested. The correct calculation of the area of the polygon gives the value $164$ as the area. However, if we examine the conditions more closely, we realize that the conditions $|x+y|=10$ and $|x-y|=10$ cut the square into two right triangles, not one hexagon. Each of these right triangles has base $10\sqrt{2}$ and height $8\sqrt{2}$, so the area of each triangle is $1/2 * 10\sqrt{2} * 8\sqrt{2} = 80$, and hence, the area of the convex polygon is $2 * 80 = 160$. Thus, the area of the convex polygon formed by the points is 160. The answer is:
$160$

Analyze this problem and think step by step to come to a solution with programs. After solving the problem, output the final numerical answer within \boxed{}.

Assistant:


The equation is given by $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$.
In order for the product to be zero, either one of the factors must be zero.
This gives us four cases to consider:
1. $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0 \implies \vert x + y \vert = 10 \implies x + y = 10 \text{ or } x + y = -10$.
2. $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0 \implies \vert x - y \vert = 10 \implies x - y = 10 \text{ or } x - y = -10$.
3. $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0 \implies \vert x \vert = 8 \implies x = 8 \text{ or } x = -8$.
4. $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0 \implies \vert y \vert = 8 \implies y = 8 \text{ or } y = -8$.
By analyzing these cases, the points that satisfy these equations are the vertices of a square with side length 20, centered at the origin. The area of this square is $(20)^2 = 400$.
Therefore, the area of the convex polygon is $\boxed{400}$.
