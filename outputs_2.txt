 The problem is asking for the number of positive integers $m$ for which the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has exactly four distinct solutions.

Firstly, we note that the right side of the equation, $\frac{m}{100}$, must be nonnegative, so $m$ must be a nonnegative integer. However, the absolute value of a quantity cannot be negative, so the left side of the equation, $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert$, must also be nonnegative. This means that $\vert x-1 \vert -2$ must be either zero or a nonnegative number.

Next, we consider the inner absolute value, $\vert x-1 \vert$. This absolute value is zero when $x=1$, so $\vert x-1 \vert -2$ is equal to $-2$ when $x<1$, and is equal to $x-3$ when $x>1$. Thus, the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ splits into two cases:

1. When $x<1$, the equation becomes $\vert -x+1 -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$, or $\vert -x-1 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$. This simplifies to $\vert x+1 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$.
2. When $x>1$, the equation becomes $\vert x-1 -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$, or $\vert x-3 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$. This simplifies to $\vert x-3 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$.

For each of these cases, we have an equation of the form $\vert y \vert=\frac{m}{100}$, which splits into two separate equations: $y=\frac{m}{100}$ and $y=-\frac{m}{100}$.

For the first case, $x+1=\frac{m}{100}$ or $x+1=-\frac{m}{100}$. Solving these gives $x=\frac{m}{100}-1$ or $x=-\frac{m}{100}-1$.

For the second case, $x-3=\frac{m}{100}$ or $x-3=-\frac{m}{100}$. Solving these gives $x=\frac{m}{100}+3$ or $x=-\frac{m}{100}+3$.

In order for the original equation to have four distinct solutions, we need two of the above equations to have one solution each in the interval $(-\infty,1)$, one in the interval $(1,3)$, and one in the interval $(3,\infty)$.

For the first case, the equation $x=\frac{m}{100}-1$ has a solution in the interval $(-\infty,1)$ when $\frac{m}{100}-1<1$, or $m<100$. The equation $x=-\frac{m}{100}-1$ has no solution in this interval.

For the second case, the equation $x=\frac{m}{100}+3$ has no solution in the interval $(-\infty,1)$. The equation $x=-\frac{m}{100}+3$ has a solution in the interval $(1,3)$ when $1<-\frac{m}{100}+3<3$, or $0<-\frac{m}{100}<2$, or $-200<m<0$. This is not possible since $m$ must be a positive integer.

For the third case, the equation $x=\frac{m}{100}+3$ has no solution in the interval $(3,\infty)$. The equation $x=-\frac{m}{100}+3$ has a solution in this interval when $-\frac{m}{100}+3>3$, or $-\frac{m}{100}>0$, or $m<0$. This is not possible since $m$ must be a positive integer.

Thus, the only possible case is the first case, where the equation $x=\frac{m}{100}-1$ has a solution in the interval $(-\infty,1)$, and the equation $x=\frac{m}{100}+3$ has a solution in the interval $(3,\infty)$. This means we need $1<\frac{m}{100}-1<3$, or $3<\frac{m}{100}<4$, or $300<m<400$. The only positive integer in this range is $301$, so $m=301$ is the only possible value.

Therefore, there is only one positive integer $m$ for which the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has exactly four distinct solutions, and that is $m=301$. The answer is: $1$

The problem asks for how many positive integers $m$ the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has $4$ distinct solutions. 

To solve this problem, we need to understand the properties of the absolute value function and the number of solutions of the equation.

The absolute value function $\vert x \vert$ is defined as:
\[ \vert x \vert = \begin{cases} x & \text{if } x \geq 0 \\ -x & \text{if } x < 0 \end{cases} \]
This means that the graph of the absolute value function is a V-shape with the vertex at the origin.

The equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ involves two absolute value functions, so its graph will be a series of V-shapes. The equation has $4$ distinct solutions when the value of $\frac{m}{100}$ is such that the two inner absolute value functions intersect in exactly $4$ places.

To find the values of $m$ that satisfy this condition, we need to analyze the graph of the equation. The equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ can be rewritten as:

\[ \vert x-1 \vert -2 = \frac{m}{100} \quad \text{or} \quad \vert x-1 \vert -2 = -\frac{m}{100} \]

The first equation $\vert x-1 \vert -2 = \frac{m}{100}$ has $4$ solutions when $2 < \frac{m}{100} < 4$, which gives $200 < m < 400$.

The second equation $\vert x-1 \vert -2 = -\frac{m}{100}$ has no solution when $\frac{m}{100} > 2$, because the left side of the equation is always nonnegative, while the right side is always nonpositive.

Therefore, the values of $m$ that satisfy the condition of having $4$ distinct solutions are the integers in the range $(200, 400)$. The number of such integers is $200$.
The answer is: $200$

 The problem asks for the number of positive integers $m$ such that the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has four distinct solutions.

The equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ can be rewritten as two separate cases:

Case 1: $\vert x-1 \vert -2 = \frac{m}{100}$
Case 2: $-\vert x-1 \vert +2 = \frac{m}{100}$

For each case, we can solve for $x$:

Case 1: $\vert x-1 \vert = 2 + \frac{m}{100}$
This gives us two sub-cases:
Sub-case 1.1: $x - 1 = 2 + \frac{m}{100}$, so $x = 3 + \frac{m}{100}$.
Sub-case 1.2: $-(x - 1) = 2 + \frac{m}{100}$, so $x = -1 + \frac{m}{100}$.

Case 2: $\vert x-1 \vert = 2 - \frac{m}{100}$
This gives us two sub-cases:
Sub-case 2.1: $x - 1 = 2 - \frac{m}{100}$, so $x = 3 - \frac{m}{100}$.
Sub-case 2.2: $-(x - 1) = 2 - \frac{m}{100}$, so $x = -1 - \frac{m}{100}$.

The four distinct solutions are: $x = 3 + \frac{m}{100}$, $x = -1 + \frac{m}{100}$, $x = 3 - \frac{m}{100}$, and $x = -1 - \frac{m}{100}$.

For these four solutions to be distinct, we must have:
\[3 + \frac{m}{100} \neq -1 + \frac{m}{100},\]
\[3 + \frac{m}{100} \neq 3 - \frac{m}{100},\]
\[3 + \frac{m}{100} \neq -1 - \frac{m}{100},\]
\[-1 + \frac{m}{100} \neq 3 - \frac{m}{100},\]
\[-1 + \frac{m}{100} \neq -1 - \frac{m}{100},\]
\[3 - \frac{m}{100} \neq -1 - \frac{m}{100}.\]

Solving these inequalities, we find that $m$ must be an integer between $0$ and $100$, inclusive.

Therefore, there are 101 positive integers $m$ that satisfy the conditions of the problem. The answer is: $101$

Assistant:

 The problem is asking for the number of positive integers $m$ for which the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has $4$ distinct solutions.

The equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ is equivalent to a pair of inequalities. To see this, consider the definition of absolute value:

1. If $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$, then either $\vert x-1 \vert -2 = \frac{m}{100}$ or $\vert x-1 \vert -2 = -\frac{m}{100}$.
2. If $\vert x-1 \vert -2 = \frac{m}{100}$, then $\vert x-1 \vert = 2 + \frac{m}{100}$. This gives two cases:
   a. $x-1 = 2 + \frac{m}{100}$, which simplifies to $x = 3 + \frac{m}{100}$.
   b. $x-1 = -(2 + \frac{m}{100})$, which simplifies to $x = -1 - \frac{m}{100}$.
3. If $\vert x-1 \vert -2 = -\frac{m}{100}$, then $\vert x-1 \vert = 2 - \frac{m}{100}$. This gives two cases:
   a. $x-1 = 2 - \frac{m}{100}$, which simplifies to $x = 3 - \frac{m}{100}$.
   b. $x-1 = -(2 - \frac{m}{100})$, which simplifies to $x = -1 + \frac{m}{100}$.

So, the four distinct solutions are $3 + \frac{m}{100}$, $-1 - \frac{m}{100}$, $3 - \frac{m}{100}$, and $-1 + \frac{m}{100}$.

For these solutions to be distinct, it must be that $3 + \frac{m}{100} \neq -1 - \frac{m}{100}$, $3 + \frac{m}{100} \neq 3 - \frac{m}{100}$, $3 + \frac{m}{100} \neq -1 + \frac{m}{100}$, $-1 - \frac{m}{100} \neq 3 - \frac{m}{100}$, $-1 - \frac{m}{100} \neq -1 + \frac{m}{100}$, and $3 - \frac{m}{100} \neq -1 + \frac{m}{100}$.

Simplifying these inequalities gives:
1. $3 + \frac{m}{100} \neq -1 - \frac{m}{100}$ implies $m \neq -150$.
2. $3 + \frac{m}{100} \neq 3 - \frac{m}{100}$ implies $m \neq 0$.
3. $3 + \frac{m}{100} \neq -1 + \frac{m}{100}$ implies $m \neq 400$.
4. $-1 - \frac{m}{100} \neq 3 - \frac{m}{100}$ is always true.
5. $-1 - \frac{m}{100} \neq -1 + \frac{m}{100}$ implies $m \neq 0$.
6. $3 - \frac{m}{100} \neq -1 + \frac{m}{100}$ is always true.

Since $m$ must be a positive integer, the only values that satisfy all these conditions are $m = 150$ and $m = 400$. Therefore, there are $2$ positive integers $m$ for which the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has $4$ distinct solutions. The answer is: $2$

 The problem asks for the number of positive integers $m$ such that the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has four distinct solutions.

We know that the absolute value function has a V-shape, so the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ will have four distinct solutions if and only if the right side $\frac{m}{100}$ is equal to the height of the V-shape.

The V-shape of the absolute value function has a height of $2$, so we must have $\frac{m}{100}=2$, which implies $m=200$.

Therefore, there is only one such positive integer $m$, which is $200$. The answer is: $\boxed{1}$.

 The equation $| |x - 1| - 2| = \frac{m}{100}$ has four distinct solutions. This means that the absolute value equation $|x - 1| - 2 = \frac{m}{100}$ or $|x - 1| - 2 = -\frac{m}{100}$ has four distinct solutions.

We first consider the equation $|x - 1| - 2 = \frac{m}{100}$. This equation is equivalent to $|x - 1| = 2 + \frac{m}{100}$. This equation has two cases:

1. $x - 1 = 2 + \frac{m}{100}$ or $x - 1 = -(2 + \frac{m}{100})$.
2. $x - 1 = -(2 + \frac{m}{100})$ or $x - 1 = 2 + \frac{m}{100}$.

Solving these equations, we get $x = 3 + \frac{m}{100}$ or $x = -1 + \frac{m}{100}$.

Similarly, for the equation $|x - 1| - 2 = -\frac{m}{100}$, we get $x = 3 - \frac{m}{100}$ or $x = -1 - \frac{m}{100}$.

These four equations have four distinct solutions if and only if the following conditions are satisfied:

1. $3 + \frac{m}{100} \neq 3 - \frac{m}{100}$ and $3 + \frac{m}{100} \neq -1 - \frac{m}{100}$ and $3 + \frac{m}{100} \neq -1 + \frac{m}{100}$ and $3 - \frac{m}{100} \neq -1 + \frac{m}{100}$ and $3 - \frac{m}{100} \neq -1 - \frac{m}{100}$.
2. $-1 + \frac{m}{100} \neq -1 - \frac{m}{100}$.

From condition 1, we get $\frac{m}{100} \neq 0$, which is always true. From condition 2, we get $\frac{2m}{100} \neq 0$, which also holds true.

Therefore, any positive integer value of $m$ will satisfy the conditions. However, we need to find the number of positive integers $m$ such that the equation has four distinct solutions. Since $m$ can be any positive integer, there are infinitely many positive integers $m$ that satisfy the conditions. However, the problem asks for a positive integer $m$ such that the equation has exactly four distinct solutions. The only positive integer value of $m$ that makes the equation have exactly four distinct solutions is $m = 100$.
The value of $m$ that makes the equation have exactly four distinct solutions is 100. The answer is: $1$

Below is a math problem you are to solve (natural number answer):

The equation \[\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}\] has 4 distinct solutions.

We know that the absolute value function $\vert x \vert$ is defined as follows:
\[\vert x \vert = \begin{cases}
x & \text{if } x \geq 0 \\
-x & \text{if } x < 0
\end{cases}\]

Applying this definition to the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$, we have four cases to consider:

Case 1: $\vert x-1 \vert -2 = \frac{m}{100}$ and $\vert x-1 \vert -2 > 0$.
In this case, we have $\vert x-1 \vert = 2 + \frac{m}{100}$.
This gives us two sub-cases:

Sub-case 1.1: $x-1 = 2 + \frac{m}{100}$ and $x-1 > 0$.
Solving this gives $x = 3 + \frac{m}{100}$.

Sub-case 1.2: $x-1 = -2 - \frac{m}{100}$ and $x-1 < 0$.
Solving this gives $x = -1 - \frac{m}{100}$.

Case 2: $\vert x-1 \vert -2 = -\frac{m}{100}$ and $\vert x-1 \vert -2 < 0$.
In this case, we have $\vert x-1 \vert = 2 - \frac{m}{100}$.
This gives us two sub-cases:

Sub-case 2.1: $x-1 = 2 - \frac{m}{100}$ and $x-1 > 0$.
Solving this gives $x = 3 - \frac{m}{100}$.

Sub-case 2.2: $x-1 = -2 + \frac{m}{100}$ and $x-1 < 0$.
Solving this gives $x = -1 + \frac{m}{100}$.

Now we need to find the values of $m$ for which the four solutions obtained above are distinct.
We can see that the four solutions are:
\[x = 3 + \frac{m}{100}, -1 - \frac{m}{100}, 3 - \frac{m}{100}, -1 + \frac{m}{100}.\]

For these solutions to be distinct, we must have:
\[3 + \frac{m}{100} \neq -1 - \frac{m}{100}, 3 + \frac{m}{100} \neq 3 - \frac{m}{100}, 3 + \frac{m}{100} \neq -1 + \frac{m}{100}, -1 - \frac{m}{100} \neq 3 - \frac{m}{100}, -1 - \frac{m}{100} \neq -1 + \frac{m}{100}, 3 - \frac{m}{100} \neq -1 + \frac{m}{100}.\]

Solving these inequalities, we find that $m$ must be in the range $100 < m < 300$.
The number of positive integers $m$ in this range is $200$.

Therefore, there are 200 positive integers $m$ for which the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has 4 distinct solutions. The answer is: $200$

 The problem asks for the number of positive integers $m$ such that the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has exactly 4 distinct solutions.

First, let's consider the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$. The right side of the equation, $\frac{m}{100}$, must be a positive number since $m$ is a positive integer. Therefore, the absolute value expression on the left side must be equal to a positive number as well. This means that $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert > 0$.

The absolute value expression $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert$ can be equal to a positive number in two ways:
1. When $\vert x-1 \vert -2 > 0$, we have $\vert x-1 \vert > 2$. This implies that $x-1 > 2$ or $x-1 < -2$, which gives us $x > 3$ or $x < -1$.
2. When $-\vert x-1 \vert +2 > 0$, we have $\vert x-1 \vert < 2$. This implies that $-2 < x-1 < 2$, which gives us $-1 < x < 3$.

So, the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has 4 distinct solutions when $x$ is in the range $(-1, 3)$.

Now, we need to find the possible values of $m$. The value of $\frac{m}{100}$ must be such that the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has exactly 4 distinct solutions in the range $(-1, 3)$.

For $x$ in the range $(-1, 3)$, the expression $\vert x-1 \vert -2$ takes on the values $-3, -1, 1, 3$ as $x$ varies. Therefore, the value of $\frac{m}{100}$ must be one of these values. This means $m$ can be $300, 100, 100, 300$. However, $m$ must be a positive integer, so we discard the repeated values of $m$.

Therefore, the only possible values of $m$ are $100$ and $300$. So, there are 2 positive integers $m$ such that the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has exactly 4 distinct solutions. The answer is: $2$
