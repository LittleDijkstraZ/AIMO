Interesting, let's analyze step by step:



For how many positive integers $m$ does the equation \[\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}\] have $4$ distinct solutions?

Step 1: Let's first consider the absolute value function $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert$. This function has four distinct solutions when $\frac{m}{100}$ equals $1$, $2$, or $3$. 

Step 2: To find the corresponding values of $m$, we can multiply these values by $100$:
- For $1$, we have $m=100$.
- For $2$, we have $m=200$.
- For $3$, we have $m=300$.

Step 3: So, there are $3$ possible values for $m$.

Step 4: Now let's verify that these values are positive integers:
- $100$ is a positive integer.
- $200$ is a positive integer.
- $300$ is a positive integer.

Therefore, there are $3$ positive integers $m$ for which the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has $4$ distinct solutions. The answer is: $3$.

The equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has four distinct solutions. We need to find how many positive integer values of $m$ make this true.

Step 1: Identify the sympy functions required

The Sympy library does not have built-in functions specifically for solving this problem directly. However, we can use Python's `sympy` library to solve it.

Step 2: Implement the sympy functions step-by-step

Let's use a for loop to iterate over possible values of $m$ from $1$ to $100$ and check how many solutions the equation has for each $m$.

```python


INTERMEDIATE OUT :

from sympy import symbols, Abs, solveset, S

def count_solutions():
    x = symbols('x')
    m_values = range(1, 101)
    count = 0

    for m in m_values:
        equation = Abs(Abs(x - 1) - 2) - m / 100
        solutions = solveset(equation, x, domain=S.Reals)
        if len(solutions) == 4:
            count += 1

    return count

result = count_solutions()
print(result)
```

CODE RESULTS 100

INTERMEDIATE OUT :
```output
100
```

Step 3: Calculate the final answer and verify it's a positive integer

The number of positive integer values of $m$ for which the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has four distinct solutions is $100$. This is a positive integer.

Step 4: Output the result

The value of $m$ that makes the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ have four distinct solutions is $100$. Therefore, the answer is $\boxed{1}$.
The answer is $\boxed{1}$.

Interesting, let's analyze step by step:



The equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has 4 distinct solutions, which means the right side of the equation, $\frac{m}{100}$, should be equal to one of the values of the piecewise function $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert$. The function $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert$ takes on the values of $1, 3, 1, 3$ as $x$ goes from $-\infty$ to $\infty$. So, $\frac{m}{100}$ should be one of these values: $1, 3$. That means $m$ should be one of $100, 300$.

But we also need to make sure the number of solutions for each value of $m$ is 4. For $m=100$, the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{100}{100}=1$ gives us two solutions for each of the two pieces of the piecewise function. Therefore, it gives us a total of 4 solutions. For $m=300$, the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{300}{100}=3$ also gives us two solutions for each of the two pieces of the piecewise function. Therefore, it also gives us a total of 4 solutions.

So, the only values of $m$ for which the equation has 4 distinct solutions are $m=100$ and $m=300$. Since we are asked for the number of such values of $m$, the answer is $2$.

To verify this, we can simply list the values of $m$ for which the equation has 4 distinct solutions: $m=100, 300$. Both values are positive integers. The answer is: $2$. The value of $m$ for which the equation has 4 distinct solutions is a positive integer. Hence, the value of $m$ for which the equation has 4 distinct solutions is a positive integer. The value of $m$ for which the equation has 4 distinct solutions is indeed a positive integer.

The answer is: $2$.
The answer is: $2$

Interesting, let's analyze step by step:



The equation $| |x - 1| - 2 | = \frac{m}{100}$ has four distinct solutions. The expression $|x - 1| - 2$ can take on three different values depending on the value of $x$. Therefore, $\frac{m}{100}$ must be one of these three possible values. 

The three possible values of $|x - 1| - 2$ are:
1. If $x < 1$, then $|x - 1| = 1 - x$, so $|x - 1| - 2 = 1 - x - 2 = -x - 1$.
2. If $1 \leq x \leq 3$, then $|x - 1| = x - 1$, so $|x - 1| - 2 = x - 1 - 2 = x - 3$.
3. If $x > 3$, then $|x - 1| = x - 1$, so $|x - 1| - 2 = x - 1 - 2 = x - 3$.

Thus, the equation $| |x - 1| - 2 | = \frac{m}{100}$ can be rewritten as one of the following three equations:
1. $-(x + 1) = \frac{m}{100}$,
2. $x - 3 = \frac{m}{100}$, or
3. $x - 3 = -\frac{m}{100}$.

We need to find the value of $m$ such that each of these equations has four distinct solutions.

1. The equation $-(x + 1) = \frac{m}{100}$ simplifies to $x = -1 - \frac{m}{100}$. This equation has one solution.
2. The equation $x - 3 = \frac{m}{100}$ simplifies to $x = 3 + \frac{m}{100}$. This equation has four distinct solutions when $0 < \frac{m}{100} < 2$, i.e., when $0 < m < 200$.
3. The equation $x - 3 = -\frac{m}{100}$ simplifies to $x = 3 - \frac{m}{100}$. This equation has one solution.

Therefore, the value of $m$ that satisfies the condition is $m = 200$. The number of positive integers $m$ that satisfy the condition is 1.

So, the number of positive integers $m$ for which the equation $| |x - 1| - 2 | = \frac{m}{100}$ has four distinct solutions is 1.

Therefore, the value of $m$ that satisfies the condition is $m = 200$. The number of positive integers $m$ that satisfy the condition is 1. The only positive integer value of $m$ that makes the equation have four distinct solutions is 200. Therefore, the value of $m$ is 200.

The output is: 1.
The value of $m$ is 200, which is a positive integer.

Therefore, the number of positive integers $m$ for which the equation $| |x - 1| - 2 | = \frac{m}{100}$ has four distinct solutions is 1. The answer is: $1$.

Interesting, let's analyze step by step:



For the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ to have $4$ distinct solutions, the value of $\frac{m}{100}$ must be a number in the interval $(0, 2)$.
So we have $0 < \frac{m}{100} < 2$, which gives $0 < m < 200$.

Since $m$ is a positive integer, the possible values of $m$ are the integers from $1$ to $199$.

Now, let's count the number of such $m$ for which the equation has exactly $4$ distinct solutions.

We know that the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has $4$ distinct solutions when $\frac{m}{100}$ is equal to $1$ or $2 - \epsilon$ (where $\epsilon$ is a very small positive number).

So, we need to find the number of positive integers $m$ such that $\frac{m}{100} = 1$ or $\frac{m}{100} = 2 - \epsilon$.

For $\frac{m}{100} = 1$, we have $m = 100$.
For $\frac{m}{100} = 2 - \epsilon$, we have $m = 200 - \epsilon * 100$. Since $\epsilon$ is very small, we can say $m = 200 - \epsilon * 100 \approx 200$.

So the only possible values of $m$ that make the equation have $4$ distinct solutions are $m = 100$ and $m = 200$. However, $m = 200$ is not a valid value since it is not in the interval $(0, 200)$. So the only valid value is $m = 100$.

Therefore, there is only $1$ positive integer $m$ for which the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has $4$ distinct solutions, and that value is $m = 100$.

So the final answer is $\boxed{1}$.

```python


INTERMEDIATE OUT :

def count_values():
    # Define the range for m
    m_values = list(range(1, 200))

    # Count the number of m values that satisfy the condition
    count = sum(1 for m in m_values if ((m/100) == 1 or (m/100) == 2 - 1e-6))

    return count

result = count_values()
print(result)
```

CODE RESULTS 1

INTERMEDIATE OUT :
```output
1
```
The number of positive integers $m$ for which the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has $4$ distinct solutions is $1$. The only value of $m$ that works is $m = 100$, which is a positive integer. So the result is $\boxed{1}$. The answer is: 1. The answer is: $\boxed{1}$
