Interesting, let's analyze step by step:



1. The equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has 4 distinct solutions, we need to find the value of $m$.
2. The function $| \cdot |$ denotes the absolute value, so the expression $| \vert x-1 \vert -2 |$ is always nonnegative. Therefore, $\frac{m}{100}$ must be a nonnegative number. This implies that $m$ must be a nonnegative integer.
3. The expression $| \vert x-1 \vert -2 |$ is equal to a fixed positive number $\frac{m}{100}$ exactly four times. 
4. By analyzing the properties of the absolute value function, we find that $| \vert x-1 \vert -2 |$ is equal to a fixed positive number exactly four times when $\frac{m}{100}$ is in the interval $(0, 2)$.
5. Therefore, we need to find the value of $m$ such that $\frac{m}{100} = 2$, which gives $m = 200$.

Thus, the only positive integer $m$ for which the equation has 4 distinct solutions is $m = 200$. The answer is: $200$

 The problem involves finding the number of positive integers $m$ for which the equation \[\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}\] has 4 distinct solutions.

The equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ is a piecewise function with 4 cases to consider based on the value of $x$.

1. If $x \ge 3$, then $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert = x - 3$. So the equation becomes $x - 3 = \frac{m}{100}$.
2. If $1 < x < 3$, then $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert = 3 - x$. So the equation becomes $3 - x = \frac{m}{100}$.
3. If $x < 1$, then $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert = 1 - x + 2 = 3 - x$. So the equation becomes $3 - x = \frac{m}{100}$ again.

From these cases, we can see that the equation $x - 3 = \frac{m}{100}$ has one solution for $x$ if $m < 300$, and the equation $3 - x = \frac{m}{100}$ has two solutions for $x$ if $m > 0$.

Therefore, the number of positive integers $m$ for which the equation has 4 distinct solutions is 1 (for $m = 300$).

The answer is: 1

 The equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has 4 distinct solutions if and only if $\frac{m}{100} = 2$. This is because the function $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert$ is a piecewise linear function with 4 distinct linear pieces, and it takes the value of 2 exactly once. Therefore, we have $\frac{m}{100} = 2$, which implies $m = 200$. So the number of positive integers $m$ for which the equation has 4 distinct solutions is 1, which is the number of solutions to the equation $m = 200$. The answer is: $1$

 The given equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has 4 distinct solutions.

First, let's analyze the equation. The expression inside the absolute value, $\vert x-1 \vert -2$, can be either positive or negative. So we have two cases to consider:

1. If $\vert x-1 \vert -2 \geq 0$, then the equation becomes $\vert x-1 \vert -2=\frac{m}{100}$.
2. If $\vert x-1 \vert -2 < 0$, then the equation becomes $-\vert x-1 \vert +2=\frac{m}{100}$.

For the first case, we have $\vert x-1 \vert =2+\frac{m}{100}$. This gives us two sub-cases:
>>>>>>> 044bc423a3d41e84aff1b027215c2ebc174148d7

1a. If $x-1 \geq 0$, then $x-1=2+\frac{m}{100}$, which simplifies to $x=3+\frac{m}{100}$.
1b. If $x-1 < 0$, then $-(x-1)=2+\frac{m}{100}$, which simplifies to $x=-1+\frac{m}{100}$.

For the second case, we have $\vert x-1 \vert =2-\frac{m}{100}$. This gives us two sub-cases:

2a. If $x-1 \geq 0$, then $x-1=2-\frac{m}{100}$, which simplifies to $x=3-\frac{m}{100}$.
2b. If $x-1 < 0$, then $-(x-1)=2-\frac{m}{100}$, which simplifies to $x=-1-\frac{m}{100}$.
>>>>>>> 044bc423a3d41e84aff1b027215c2ebc174148d7

So, the four solutions are $3+\frac{m}{100}$, $-1+\frac{m}{100}$, $3-\frac{m}{100}$, and $-1-\frac{m}{100}$.

For these four solutions to be distinct, the four values of $\frac{m}{100}$ must be distinct. This means that $m$ must be less than 100.

Also, the absolute values in the original equation ensure that the solutions are positive. This means that $\frac{m}{100}$ must be greater than $-1$. Therefore, $m$ must be greater than $-100$.

However, $m$ must be a positive integer, so the only possible values for $m$ are the positive integers between 0 and 100.

For $m$ to be the positive integer that makes the equation have 4 distinct solutions, $m$ must be the only positive integer that makes two of the four solutions equal.

Comparing the four solutions, we see that $3+\frac{m}{100}$ and $-1-\frac{m}{100}$ cannot be equal for any $m$, because their sum is not zero. Similarly, $3-\frac{m}{100}$ and $-1+\frac{m}{100}$ cannot be equal for any $m$, because their sum is not zero.

<<<<<<< HEAD
First, we notice that the number of solutions depends on $m$, and the absolute value function makes it a piecewise function. We can break this into cases based on the value of $x$.

For $x < 1$, we have $\vert x-1 \vert = 1-x$, so the equation becomes $\vert 1-x-2 \vert = \frac{m}{100}$, which simplifies to $\vert -x-1 \vert = \frac{m}{100}$. This further simplifies to $\vert x+1 \vert = \frac{m}{100}$. This has two solutions: $x = -1 - \frac{m}{100}$ and $x = -1 + \frac{m}{100}$.

For $1 \leq x \leq 3$, we have $\vert x-1 \vert = x-1$, so the equation becomes $\vert x-1-2 \vert = \frac{m}{100}$, which simplifies to $\vert x-3 \vert = \frac{m}{100}$. This has two solutions: $x = 3 - \frac{m}{100}$ and $x = 3 + \frac{m}{100}$.

For $x > 3$, we have $\vert x-1 \vert = x-1$, so the equation becomes $\vert x-1-2 \vert = \frac{m}{100}$, which simplifies to $\vert x-3 \vert = \frac{m}{100}$. This has two solutions: $x = 3 - \frac{m}{100}$ and $x = 3 + \frac{m}{100}$.

So in total, we have four distinct solutions when $1 \leq \frac{m}{100} \leq 2$, or equivalently, $100 \leq m \leq 200$. 

So the number of positive integers $m$ that satisfy this condition is $200 - 100 + 1 = 101$. 

The value of $m$ that satisfies this condition is 101. The answer is: $101$

Therefore, $3+\frac{m}{100}$ and $3-\frac{m}{100}$ must be equal, or $-1+\frac{m}{100}$ and $-1-\frac{m}{100}$ must be equal.

Setting $3+\frac{m}{100}$ equal to $3-\frac{m}{100}$, we get $\frac{m}{100}=0$, which has no solution.

Setting $-1+\frac{m}{100}$ equal to $-1-\frac{m}{100}$, we get $\frac{m}{100}=0$, which also has no solution.

However, if we set $3+\frac{m}{100}$ equal to $-1+\frac{m}{100}$, we get $m=200$, which is not between 0 and 100.

Similarly, if we set $3-\frac{m}{100}$ equal to $-1-\frac{m}{100}$, we get $m=200$ again.

So, we must have set $3+\frac{m}{100}$ equal to $-1-\frac{m}{100}$, or $3-\frac{m}{100}$ equal to $-1+\frac{m}{100}$.

Setting $3+\frac{m}{100}$ equal to $-1-\frac{m}{100}$, we get $m=100$.

Setting $3-\frac{m}{100}$ equal to $-1+\frac{m}{100}$, we also get $m=100$.

Therefore, the only value of $m$ that makes the equation have 4 distinct solutions is $m=100$.

So, the number of positive integers $m$ for which the equation has 4 distinct solutions is 1.
The answer is: $1$

Assistant: 

Interesting, let's analyze step by step:


1. First, we can see that the absolute value expression $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert$ is equal to either $\vert x-1 \vert -2$ or $2-\vert x-1 \vert$, depending on whether $\vert x-1 \vert -2$ is positive or negative. 
2. To have four distinct solutions, the expression $\frac{m}{100}$ must be equal to either $\vert x-1 \vert -2$ or $2-\vert x-1 \vert$ at four different $x$ values.
3. This implies that the function $\vert x-1 \vert -2$ or $2-\vert x-1 \vert$ must cross the line $y=\frac{m}{100}$ at exactly four points.
4. The function $\vert x-1 \vert -2$ or $2-\vert x-1 \vert$ is a triangular wave function that oscillates between -2 and 2. The line $y=\frac{m}{100}$ intersects this function at exactly four points if $\frac{m}{100}$ is in the interval $(0, 2)$.
5. Therefore, we need to find the number of positive integers $m$ in the range $(0, 200)$ such that $\frac{m}{100} \in (0, 2)$. This gives $m \in (0, 200)$, and the number of such positive integers $m$ is 200.
6. However, we only need the number of solutions for the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ to have exactly four distinct solutions.
7. From the above analysis, we know that the function $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert$ has four distinct solutions when $\frac{m}{100}$ is in the interval $(0, 2)$.
8. To find the number of positive integers $m$ that satisfy this condition, we can multiply the number of integers in the interval $(0, 200)$ by the fraction of these integers that fall into the interval $(0, 200)$.
9. The number of integers in the interval $(0, 200)$ is 200. The fraction of these integers that fall into the interval $(0, 200)$ is $\frac{200}{100}=2$.
10. Multiplying the number of integers in the interval $(0, 200)$ by the fraction gives $200 \times 2 = 400$.
11. However, this result is not correct because we only need the number of solutions for the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ to have exactly four distinct solutions.
12. To find the correct number of positive integers $m$, we need to consider that the function $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert$ also has four distinct solutions when $\frac{m}{100}$ is in the interval $(-2, 0)$.
13. This gives an additional 200 positive integers $m$ that satisfy the condition.
14. Adding the two sets of integers together, we get a total of 400 positive integers $m$ that satisfy the condition.
15. However, this result is still not correct because we have counted some integers twice.
16. To find the correct number of positive integers $m$, we need to subtract the number of integers that have been counted twice.
17. These are the integers that fall into the interval $(0, 200)$ and also fall into the interval $(-200, 0)$.
18. The number of such integers is equal to the number of integers in the interval $(0, 200)$ that fall into the interval $(-200, 0)$, which is equal to the number of integers in the interval $(0, 200)$ that fall into the interval $(0, 200)$, which is equal to the number of integers in the interval $(0, 200)$, which is 200.
19. Subtracting the number of integers that have been counted twice from the sum of the two sets of integers gives $400 - 200 = 200$.
20. However, this result is still not correct because we have not considered the case where $\frac{m}{100}$ is equal to 2 or -2.
21. When $\frac{m}{100}$ is equal to 2 or -2, the function $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert$ has only three distinct solutions.
22. Therefore, we need to subtract the number of positive integers $m$ that make $\frac{m}{100}$ equal to 2 or -2 from the result obtained above.
23. The number of positive integers $m$ that make $\frac{m}{100}$ equal to 2 or -2 is equal to the number of positive integers $m$ that make $m$ equal to 200 or -200.
24. However, these values of $m$ are not in the range of positive integers $m$ that we are considering.
25. Therefore, we do not need to subtract anything from the result obtained above.
26. The result obtained above, 200, is the number of positive integers $m$ for which the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has exactly four distinct solutions.

Therefore, the number of positive integers $m$ for which the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has exactly four distinct solutions is 200. The answer is: $200$

First, let's denote $f(x) = \vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert$. We need to find how many positive integers $m$ such that the equation $f(x) = m/100$ has $4$ distinct solutions.

We know that $f(x)$ will have 4 distinct solutions if the line $y = m/100$ intersects the graph of $f(x)$ at $4$ points.

Let's plot the graph of $f(x)$. It's a "V" shape with the vertex at $(1, 2)$. The left branch goes down to $(1-2, 0)$, or $(-1, 0)$, and the right branch goes up to $(1+2, 4)$, or $(3, 4)$.

Now, we need to find how many positive integers $m$ such that the line $y = m/100$ intersects the graph of $f(x)$ at $4$ points.

This happens when $0 < m/100 < 2$, or $200 > m > 100$. So the number of such positive integers $m$ is $100$.

So the answer is $100$. However, it's a positive integer, so let's print it:
=======
First, let's understand what the problem is asking. It wants us to find out for how many positive integers $m$ the equation $| |x - 1| - 2| = \frac{m}{100}$ has 4 distinct solutions. 

This equation is an absolute value equation, and it involves another absolute value. The number of solutions to this equation will depend on the value of $m$. 

The inner absolute value term, $|x - 1| - 2$, will be equal to $\frac{m}{100}$ or $-\frac{m}{100}$. This gives us two separate equations to solve:

1. $|x - 1| - 2 = \frac{m}{100}$
2. $|x - 1| - 2 = -\frac{m}{100}$

Each of these equations can have between 0 and 2 solutions, depending on the value of $m$. If there are 2 solutions for each equation, then the original equation will have a total of 4 solutions. 

So the question becomes: for how many positive integers $m$ does each of these equations have 2 solutions?

This is a bit tricky, but we can analyze it graphically. The function $|x - 1| - 2$ is a V-shaped graph with its vertex at $x = 1$. The value of the function decreases from 2 to 0 as $x$ decreases from 1 to 0, and then increases from 0 to 2 as $x$ increases from 0 to 2. 
>>>>>>> 044bc423a3d41e84aff1b027215c2ebc174148d7

The lines $\frac{m}{100}$ and $-\frac{m}{100}$ are horizontal lines that cross the y-axis at $y = \pm \frac{m}{100}$. 

For each value of $m$, the line $\frac{m}{100}$ will intersect the graph of $|x - 1| - 2$ twice if $0 < \frac{m}{100} < 2$, and the line $-\frac{m}{100}$ will intersect the graph twice if $0 < -\frac{m}{100} < 2$. 

This means that the value of $m$ we are looking for must be in the range $0 < m < 200$.

1. First, let's consider the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$. For this equation to have 4 distinct solutions, $\frac{m}{100}$ must be equal to 2. This gives us $m = 200$.

2. Now, let's verify if this value of $m$ gives us 4 distinct solutions. Substituting $m = 200$ into the equation, we get $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{200}{100}$, which simplifies to $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=2$.

3. To solve this equation, we can consider two cases:
   a) $\vert x-1 -2 \vert = 2$, which simplifies to $\vert x-3 \vert = 2$. This gives us two equations: $x-3 = 2$ and $x-3 = -2$, which simplify to $x = 5$ and $x = 1$, respectively.
   b) $\vert x-1 +2 \vert = 2$, which simplifies to $\vert x+1 \vert = 2$. This gives us two equations: $x+1 = 2$ and $x+1 = -2$, which simplify to $x = 1$ and $x = -3$, respectively.

4. However, we can see that $x = 1$ is a repeated solution in both cases, so we only have three distinct solutions: $x = 5$, $x = 1$, and $x = -3$.

5. Therefore, the value of $m$ that we initially thought was correct, $m = 200$, does not give us 4 distinct solutions. So, we need to reconsider our approach.

6. Let's try another approach. The equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ can be rewritten as $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$, which simplifies to $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=0.02m$.

7. Now, let's consider the equation $\vert x-1 -2 \vert=0.02m$. This simplifies to $\vert x-3 \vert=0.02m$. This gives us two equations: $x-3 = 0.02m$ and $x-3 = -0.02m$, which simplify to $x = 3 + 0.02m$ and $x = 3 - 0.02m$, respectively.

8. Similarly, for the equation $\vert x-1 +2 \vert=0.02m$, this simplifies to $\vert x+1 \vert=0.02m$. This gives us two equations: $x+1 = 0.02m$ and $x+1 = -0.02m$, which simplify to $x = 0.02m - 1$ and $x = -0.02m - 1$, respectively.

9. For the equation to have 4 distinct solutions, the four expressions for $x$ must be different. This gives us four equations:
   a) $3 + 0.02m \neq 0.02m - 1$
   b) $3 + 0.02m \neq -0.02m - 1$
   c) $3 - 0.02m \neq 0.02m - 1$
   d) $3 - 0.02m \neq -0.02m - 1$

10. Solving these equations, we find that $m = 100$ is the only value that satisfies all four conditions.

11. Substituting $m = 100$ into the equation, we get $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=2$, which gives us four distinct solutions: $x = 5$, $x = 1$, $x = -1$, and $x = -3$.

Therefore, the only value of $m$ that gives us 4 distinct solutions is $m = 100$. The answer is: $100$

First, let's denote the function on the left side as $f(x)$, so $f(x) = | |x - 1| - 2|$. We want to find the number of values of $m$ such that the equation $f(x) = m/100$ has exactly 4 distinct solutions.

Now, let's look at the graph of $f(x)$. It is a piecewise function with 4 segments:

1. For $x < 1$, $f(x) = |-x - 1 - 2| = |-x - 3| = x + 3 + 2 = x + 5$.
2. For $1 \le x < 3$, $f(x) = |x - 1 - 2| = |x - 3| = 3 - x$.
3. For $3 \le x < 5$, $f(x) = |x - 1 - 2| = |x - 3| = x - 3 + 2 = x - 1$.
4. For $x \ge 5$, $f(x) = |x - 1 - 2| = |x - 3| = x - 3 + 2 = x - 1$.

So the graph of $f(x)$ is a V-shape with the vertex at $(3, 2)$.

Now, we want to find the number of values of $m$ such that the equation $f(x) = m/100$ has exactly 4 distinct solutions. This is equivalent to finding the number of intersections between the graph of $f(x)$ and the line $y = m/100$.

From the graph of $f(x)$, we can see that the line $y = m/100$ intersects the graph at exactly 4 distinct points if and only if $1 \le m/100 < 2$, which gives $100 \le m < 200$.

So the number of positive integer values of $m$ that satisfy the condition is $200 - 100 - 1 = 99$.

So the answer is $99$.

However, this is not the correct answer. The correct answer is $1$.

The mistake in the previous solution is that we have counted the cases where $m = 100$ and $m = 200$ separately, but in fact these cases only give three distinct solutions, not four. So we need to subtract these cases.

The correct solution should be $99 - 1 = 98$, but this is also incorrect.

The correct solution should be $1$.

So the final answer is $1$.
The answer is: $1$

Interesting, let's analyze step by step:

1. We have a piecewise function: $|\vert x-1 \vert -2|=\frac{m}{100}$. The absolute value of a quantity makes it nonnegative. Therefore, we can break the problem into two cases: $\vert x-1 \vert -2=\frac{m}{100}$ and $\vert x-1 \vert -2=-\frac{m}{100}$.

2. For each case, we can further break it down into two sub-cases: $\vert x-1 \vert = 2+\frac{m}{100}$ and $\vert x-1 \vert = 2-\frac{m}{100}$.

3. For each sub-case, we have two more cases based on the absolute value: $x-1 = 2+\frac{m}{100}$ or $x-1 = -(2+\frac{m}{100})$, and $x-1 = 2-\frac{m}{100}$ or $x-1 = -(2-\frac{m}{100})$.

4. Solving these equations gives us four distinct solutions for each case. To find the number of positive integers $m$ such that the equation has exactly four distinct solutions, we need to find the number of positive integers $m$ for which the right side of the equation is between 0 and 2. This is because the left side of the equation, $|\vert x-1 \vert -2|$, can take values only in the interval [0, 2].

5. Therefore, we need to find the number of positive integers $m$ such that $0 < \frac{m}{100} < 2$, which is equivalent to $0 < m < 200$.

6. The number of positive integers in the interval (0, 200) is 199. But we need to subtract 1 because $m$ cannot be 0. So the number of positive integers $m$ is 198.

Therefore, the equation $|\vert x-1 \vert -2|=\frac{m}{100}$ has four distinct solutions for 198 positive integers $m$. So the answer is $\boxed{198}$.

We know that the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has 4 distinct solutions. Now we want to find how many different positive integer values of $m$ make this true.

To do this, we need to know how the left side of the equation, $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert$, behaves as $m$ varies over the positive integers. We can start by considering the right side of the equation, $\frac{m}{100}$, which is a positive number. This means that the left side must also take on positive values, so $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert$ must be greater than 0.

This means that $\vert x-1 \vert -2 > 0$, or $\vert x-1 \vert > 2$. The absolute value of a quantity is greater than 2 if the quantity is greater than 2 or less than -2. So we have two cases to consider:

1. $x-1 > 2$, which gives $x > 3$.
2. $x-1 < -2$, which gives $x < -1$.

Now let's consider each case:

Case 1: $x > 3$. In this case, we have $\vert x-1 \vert = x-1$, so the equation becomes $x-1-2 = \frac{m}{100}$, or $x-3 = \frac{m}{100}$. Solving for $x$, we have $x = \frac{m}{100} + 3$. For this solution to be valid, we need $x > 3$, so we have $\frac{m}{100} + 3 > 3$, or $\frac{m}{100} > 0$. This is always true, so any positive value of $m$ will give a valid solution in this case.

Case 2: $x < -1$. In this case, we have $\vert x-1 \vert = 1-x$, so the equation becomes $1-x-2 = \frac{m}{100}$, or $-x-1 = \frac{m}{100}$. Multiplying by -1, we have $x+1 = -\frac{m}{100}$. Solving for $x$, we have $x = -\frac{m}{100} - 1$. For this solution to be valid, we need $x < -1$, so we have $-\frac{m}{100} - 1 < -1$, or $-\frac{m}{100} < 0$. This is always true, so any positive value of $m$ will give a valid solution in this case.

Combining the two cases, we see that any positive value of $m$ will give a valid solution to the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ with 4 distinct solutions. Therefore, there are infinitely many positive integer values of $m$ that make the equation true.
However, we were asked to find the number of positive integer values of $m$. This means we need to find a finite number. Let's reconsider our approach.

We know that $\frac{m}{100}$ must be less than 2, because $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert$ is less than 2. This gives us $m < 200$. The smallest positive integer value of $m$ is 1, and the largest is 199. So there are 199 positive integer values of $m$.

So the number of positive integer values of $m$ that make the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ with 4 distinct solutions is 199.
The answer is: $199$.

The equation has four distinct solutions, so the expression inside the absolute value must have two values that make the equation true, and the other two values must make the equation false.

The absolute value expression $\vert x-1 \vert -2$ can be either positive or negative. Let's consider these two cases separately:

1) $\vert x-1 \vert -2 = \frac{m}{100}$: In this case, $\vert x-1 \vert = \frac{m}{100} + 2$. This means that $x-1$ is either $\frac{m}{100} + 2$ or $-\frac{m}{100} - 2$. We have two equations to solve:

   a) $x - 1 = \frac{m}{100} + 2$, which gives $x = \frac{m}{100} + 3$.
   
   b) $x - 1 = -\frac{m}{100} - 2$, which gives $x = -\frac{m}{100} - 1$.

2) $\vert x-1 \vert -2 = -\frac{m}{100}$: In this case, $\vert x-1 \vert = 2 - \frac{m}{100}$. This means that $x-1$ is either $2 - \frac{m}{100}$ or $-2 + \frac{m}{100}$. We have two more equations to solve:

   c) $x - 1 = 2 - \frac{m}{100}$, which gives $x = 3 - \frac{m}{100}$.
   
   d) $x - 1 = -2 + \frac{m}{100}$, which gives $x = \frac{m}{100} - 1$.

Now we have 4 possible solutions for $x$: $\frac{m}{100} + 3$, $-\frac{m}{100} - 1$, $3 - \frac{m}{100}$, and $\frac{m}{100} - 1$. For these 4 solutions to be distinct, none of them can be equal. This gives us some restrictions on the possible values of $m$.

For example, $\frac{m}{100} + 3 \neq -\frac{m}{100} - 1$, which simplifies to $m \neq -50$. Similarly, we can find other restrictions:

- $\frac{m}{100} + 3 \neq 3 - \frac{m}{100}$, which simplifies to $m \neq 0$.
- $\frac{m}{100} + 3 \neq \frac{m}{100} - 1$, which simplifies to $m \neq 150$.
- $-\frac{m}{100} - 1 \neq 3 - \frac{m}{100}$, which simplifies to $m \neq -100$.
- $-\frac{m}{100} - 1 \neq \frac{m}{100} - 1$, which simplifies to $m \neq 0$.
- $3 - \frac{m}{100} \neq \frac{m}{100} - 1$, which simplifies to $m \neq 100$.

So, the only restrictions are $m \neq 0, 150$. This means that $m$ can be any positive integer except $0$ and $150$. The largest possible value of $m$ that still allows 4 distinct solutions is $149$. Therefore, the number of possible values of $m$ is 148. The answer is: $148$

The given equation is $|\vert x-1 \vert -2|=\frac{m}{100}$.

We want to find the number of values of $m$ for which the equation has 4 distinct solutions.

First, let's simplify the right hand side of the equation. The value $\frac{m}{100}$ is a positive number for positive values of $m$.

Next, we notice that the left hand side of the equation is a double absolute value function. This function has a piecewise definition, which can be simplified as follows:

- If $\vert x-1 \vert -2 \geq 0$, then $|\vert x-1 \vert -2|=\vert x-1 \vert -2$.
- If $\vert x-1 \vert -2 < 0$, then $|\vert x-1 \vert -2|=2-\vert x-1 \vert$.

Now, let's analyze the two cases separately:

Case 1: $\vert x-1 \vert -2 = \frac{m}{100}$. This gives us $\vert x-1 \vert = 2+\frac{m}{100}$. The solutions are $x = 1+2+\frac{m}{100}$ and $x = 1-2-\frac{m}{100}$, which simplifies to $x = 3+\frac{m}{100}$ and $x = -1-\frac{m}{100}$.

Case 2: $2-\vert x-1 \vert = \frac{m}{100}$. This gives us $\vert x-1 \vert = 2-\frac{m}{100}$. The solutions are $x = 1+2-\frac{m}{100}$ and $x = 1-2+\frac{m}{100}$, which simplifies to $x = 3-\frac{m}{100}$ and $x = -1+\frac{m}{100}$.

So, the four solutions are $x = 3+\frac{m}{100}$, $x = -1-\frac{m}{100}$, $x = 3-\frac{m}{100}$, and $x = -1+\frac{m}{100}$.

These four solutions are distinct if and only if $-1+\frac{m}{100} > -1-\frac{m}{100}$, which simplifies to $\frac{m}{100} > \frac{m}{50}$, or $m < 0$.

Since $m$ is a positive integer, there are no values of $m$ that satisfy $m < 0$.

Therefore, the only way for the four solutions to be distinct is if $3+\frac{m}{100} \neq -1-\frac{m}{100}$, $3+\frac{m}{100} \neq 3-\frac{m}{100}$, and $3+\frac{m}{100} \neq -1+\frac{m}{100}$.

This gives us the system of inequalities:

1. $3+\frac{m}{100} \neq -1-\frac{m}{100}$, which simplifies to $m \neq -200$.
2. $3+\frac{m}{100} \neq 3-\frac{m}{100}$, which simplifies to $m \neq 0$.
3. $3+\frac{m}{100} \neq -1+\frac{m}{100}$, which simplifies to $m \neq 400$.

Since $m$ is a positive integer, the only values of $m$ that satisfy these inequalities are $m = 1$, $m = 2$, and $m = 3$.

Therefore, there are 3 positive integer values of $m$ for which the equation has 4 distinct solutions. The answer is: $3$.

The equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has 4 distinct solutions. We want to find out for how many positive integers $m$ this is true.

We can start by analyzing the right side of the equation. Since $\frac{m}{100}$ is always positive, the absolute value of the left side must also be positive. This means that $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert > 0$.

Next, let's consider the innermost absolute value $\vert x-1 \vert$. For this absolute value to be less than or equal to $2+\frac{m}{100}$, we have the inequality $- (2 + \frac{m}{100}) \leq x - 1 \leq 2 + \frac{m}{100}$.
Solving these inequalities gives us the range of $x$: $1 - 2 - \frac{m}{100} \leq x \leq 1 + 2 + \frac{m}{100}$, or $-1 - \frac{m}{100} \leq x \leq 3 + \frac{m}{100}$.

Now, we need to find the number of integer solutions in this interval. The length of the interval is $3 + \frac{m}{100} - (-1 - \frac{m}{100}) = 4 + \frac{2m}{100} = 4 + \frac{m}{50}$.

The number of integer solutions is the floor of the length of the interval, which is $\lfloor 4 + \frac{m}{50} \rfloor$.

We want this to be equal to 4. So we have the equation $\lfloor 4 + \frac{m}{50} \rfloor = 4$.

Solving this equation, we find that $4 \leq 4 + \frac{m}{50} < 5$, which simplifies to $0 \leq \frac{m}{50} < 1$.

Multiplying all sides of the inequality by 50, we get $0 \leq m < 50$.

So the positive integers $m$ for which the equation has 4 distinct solutions are the integers from 0 to 49, inclusive. However, since we are asked for the number of positive integers $m$, we only consider the positive values of $m$.

Therefore, the number of positive integers $m$ for which the equation has 4 distinct solutions is the number of positive integers from 1 to 49, inclusive. This is simply 49.

So the answer is $\boxed{49}$.

Interesting, let's analyze step by step:



1. The equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ has four distinct solutions. This implies that $\frac{m}{100}$ is a positive number between 1 and 2. Hence, we have $1 \leq \frac{m}{100} < 2$, which simplifies to $100 \leq m < 200$.

2. Therefore, the positive integers $m$ that satisfy the equation are all the integers from 100 to 199.

3. To find the number of such integers, we simply subtract the smallest possible value of $m$ from the largest possible value of $m$ and add 1. This gives us $199 - 100 + 1 = 100$.

1. The number of distinct solutions of the equation $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert=\frac{m}{100}$ equals $4$ if and only if $\frac{m}{100} = 2$. This is because the expression $\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert$ equals $2$ has exactly $4$ distinct solutions.

2. To find the value of $m$, we can simply multiply both sides of the equation $\frac{m}{100} = 2$ by $100$ to get $m = 200$.

3. Therefore, the number of positive integers $m$ that satisfy the condition is $1$, and the value of $m$ is $200$.
