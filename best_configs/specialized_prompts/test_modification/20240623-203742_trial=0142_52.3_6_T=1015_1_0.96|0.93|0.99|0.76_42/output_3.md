Interesting, let's analyze step by step:



Since $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$, either $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$.

If $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$, then $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. This means $x + y = \pm 10$ and $x - y = \pm 10$, so $x = y = \pm 5$.

If $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$, then $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$, so $x = y = \pm 8$.

Thus, the points $(\pm 5, \pm 5)$ and $(\pm 8, \pm 8)$ are the vertices of the polygon. The polygon is a square with side length 10, so its area is $10^2 = 100$.

The area of the convex polygon is $\boxed{100}$.

Interesting, let's analyze step by step:



The equation $AB = 0$ implies that either $A = 0$ or $B = 0$. So we have two sets of conditions:

1) $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ and $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ and $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$.
2) $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$.

From 1) we get:
- $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$.
This implies $-8 \leq x, y \leq 8$.

From 2) we get:
- $\vert x - y \vert = 10$.
This implies that for any point $(x, y)$ satisfying the conditions from 1), we must have either $x - y = 10$ or $x - y = -10$ or $y - x = 10$ or $y - x = -10$.
These are the equations of four lines in the plane: $x - y = 10$, $x - y = -10$, $y - x = 10$, $y - x = -10$.
The intersection points of these lines with the square $-8 \leq x, y \leq 8$ form a rectangle with side lengths $16$ and $20$.

The area of this rectangle is $16 \times 20 = 320$.

Therefore, the area of the convex polygon is $320$. The answer is: $320$

Interesting, let's analyze step by step:



Firstly, we can see that the product of two terms equals zero if at least one of them equals zero. Therefore, we have four separate cases to consider:

Case 1: $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$
Case 2: $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$
Case 3: $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$
Case 4: $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$

In each of these cases, the absolute value expressions must equal 10 or 8. This gives us the following systems of equations:

Case 1: $x + y = \pm 10$
Case 2: $x - y = \pm 10$
Case 3: $x = \pm 8$
Case 4: $y = \pm 8$

Solving these systems, we obtain the vertices of the polygon:

Case 1: $(8,2),(8,-2),(2,8),(-2,8)$
Case 2: $(8,2),(-8,2),(8,-2),(-8,-2)$
Case 3: $(8,2),(8,-2)$
Case 4: $(2,8),(-2,8)$

The vertices that appear in all cases are the intersection points: $(8,2)$ and $(8,-2)$. These are the vertices of a rectangle with side lengths $8$ and $4$.

Finally, we compute the area of the rectangle: $A = length \times width = 8 \times 4 = 32$.

Now we need to verify that the area is a positive integer: It is.

The area of the convex polygon is $\boxed{32}$. The answer is: $32$

Interesting, let's analyze step by step:



The condition $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ and $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ are both true only when $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$.

From $\vert x \vert = 8$, we have $x = 8$ or $x = -8$. Similarly, from $\vert y \vert = 8$, we have $y = 8$ or $y = -8$. Now we have four cases to consider:

1. $x = 8$ and $y = 8$. From $\vert x + y \vert = 10$, we get $16 = 10$, which is not true.
2. $x = 8$ and $y = -8$. From $\vert x + y \vert = 10$, we get $0 = 10$, which is not true.
3. $x = -8$ and $y = 8$. From $\vert x + y \vert = 10$, we get $0 = 10$, which is not true.
4. $x = -8$ and $y = -8$. From $\vert x + y \vert = 10$, we get $-16 = 10$, which is not true.

So none of the cases satisfy the conditions. This means there are no solutions for the given equations and the area of the convex polygon is 0.

However, it seems there is a mistake in the problem statement or the given equations. The equations are set up to imply a square with side length 16, which would have an area of 256, not 0. Let's reconsider the problem.

The condition $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ implies that $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. This is true when $x = 0$ and $y = \pm10$ or $x = \pm10$ and $y = 0$. Similarly, the condition $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ implies that $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$, which is true when $x = \pm8$ and $y = \pm8$.

The possible solutions are then: $(8, 0)$, $(-8, 0)$, $(0, 8)$, and $(0, -8)$. This forms a square with side length 16, and the area is $16^2 = 256$.

The mistake was in the interpretation of the problem statement, not the mathematics used to solve it. The area of the convex polygon is 256.

Therefore, the area of the convex polygon is 256. The answer is: $256$

Interesting, let's analyze step by step:



The equation involves absolute value functions, and it's a product of two functions equals to zero. Therefore, we have two scenarios:

1. Either $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$.

2. If either of the above two equations equals to zero, then the whole equation equals to zero.

Now let's use the property of absolute value: $|a| = 0$ if and only if $a = 0$.

For the first equation, we have:

$(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$,

which means $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$.

This implies $-10 \leq x + y \leq 10$ and $-10 \leq x - y \leq 10$.

For the second equation, we have:

$(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$,

which means $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$.

This implies $-8 \leq x \leq 8$ and $-8 \leq y \leq 8$.

By combining the two sets of inequalities, we find that the points $(x, y)$ that satisfy the original equation are those that lie in the rectangle with vertices at $(-8, -8)$, $(-8, 8)$, $(8, 8)$, and $(8, -8)$.

The area of this rectangle is $16 \times 16 = 256$.

Therefore, the area of the convex polygon is 256 square units. The answer is: $256$

Interesting, let's analyze step by step:



The equation is 
$$((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$$
This equation is equal to zero if either of the two terms is zero. This gives us four sets of equations:

1. $\vert x + y \vert - 10 = 0$, $\vert x - y \vert - 10 = 0$, $\vert x \vert - 8 = 0$, $\vert y \vert - 8 = 0$

2. $\vert x + y \vert - 10 = 0$, $\vert x - y \vert - 10 = 0$, $\vert x \vert - 8 = 0$, $-\vert y \vert + 8 = 0$

3. $\vert x + y \vert - 10 = 0$, $\vert x - y \vert - 10 = 0$, $-\vert x \vert + 8 = 0$, $\vert y \vert - 8 = 0$

4. $\vert x + y \vert - 10 = 0$, $\vert x - y \vert - 10 = 0$, $-\vert x \vert + 8 = 0$, $-\vert y \vert + 8 = 0$

Each of these sets of equations give us a set of points, and together they form a square with side length 16. The area of this square is $16^2 = 256$.

So the area of the convex polygon is 256 square units.
The answer is: $256$.

Interesting, let's analyze step by step:



The given equation is $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + (\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + (\vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$. The only way the product of two numbers can be zero is if both numbers are zero. Hence, each term in the equation must be zero.

1. $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0 \implies \vert x + y \vert = 10$.
2. $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0 \implies \vert x - y \vert = 10$.
3. $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0 \implies \vert x \vert = 8$.
4. $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0 \implies \vert y \vert = 8$.

From 3 and 4, we get $-8 \leq x, y \leq 8$. From 1 and 2, we get two cases:

Case 1: $x + y = 10$ and $x - y = 10 \implies x = 10, y = 0$.
Case 2: $x + y = -10$ and $x - y = -10 \implies x = -10, y = 0$.

So, the points that satisfy the equation are $(10, 0)$, $(-10, 0)$, $(8, 2)$, $(8, -2)$, $(-8, 2)$, and $(-8, -2)$. These points form a hexagon.

Now, let's calculate its area. The hexagon can be divided into six equilateral triangles. The side length of each triangle is 10 (from the points $(10, 0)$ and $(-10, 0)$). The area of an equilateral triangle with side length $a$ is $\frac{a^2\sqrt{3}}{4}$. Hence, the area of the hexagon is $6 \times \frac{10^2\sqrt{3}}{4} = 150\sqrt{3}$.

However, this is not a positive integer, which contradicts the problem statement.

Upon re-checking the steps, I realized that there was a mistake in the last step. The hexagon is actually divided into six congruent right triangles, not equilateral triangles. The area of a right triangle with legs of length $a$ and $b$ is $\frac{1}{2}ab$. Hence, the area of the hexagon is $6 \times \frac{1}{2} \times 8 \times 10 = 240$.

Therefore, the area of the convex polygon is 240, which is a positive integer.

The answer is: $240$

Interesting, let's analyze step by step:



1. We are asked to solve an equation with absolute values, which can be tricky with sympy. But we can handle it using Piecewise.
2. We can use the property of absolute values that $|x| = x$ if $x \geq 0$ and $|x| = -x$ if $x < 0$. This will allow us to split the equation into two cases based on the signs of $x$ and $y$.
3. For each case, we can solve the equation and find the possible values of $x$ and $y$.
4. Then we can plot these points on a graph and connect them to form a polygon.
5. Finally, we can calculate the area of this polygon.

Now let's implement this step by step using sympy:

```python


INTERMEDIATE OUT :

from sympy import symbols, Piecewise, simplify, Abs, solveset, S
from sympy.plotting import plot
from sympy.geometry import Polygon

def solve_and_plot():
    x, y = symbols('x y')

    equation = ((Abs(x + y) - 10)**2 + (Abs(x - y) - 10)**2) * ((Abs(x) - 8)**2 + (Abs(y) - 8)**2)

    # Split the equation into two cases based on the signs of x and y
    case1 = equation.subs({Abs(x): x, Abs(y): y})
    case2 = equation.subs({Abs(x): -x, Abs(y): -y})

    # Solve the equation for each case
    solutions1 = solveset(case1, (x, y), domain=S.Reals)
    solutions2 = solveset(case2, (x, y), domain=S.Reals)

    # Form a polygon from the solutions
    polygon = Polygon(*solutions)

    # Calculate the area of the polygon
    area = polygon.area

    return area

result = solve_and_plot()

The above code does not work because we have not properly handled the absolute value function with sympy. Instead, let's solve the problem analytically:

The equation $f(x, y) = 0$ is equivalent to $f(x, y)f(-x, -y) = 0$. Therefore, the solutions to the equation are the union of the solutions to $f(x, y) = 0$ and $f(-x, -y) = 0$. The solutions to $f(x, y) = 0$ are given by the intersections of the equations:

1. $|x + y| = 10$, $|x - y| = 10$, $|x| = 8$, $|y| = 8$.

From the equations $|x| = 8$ and $|y| = 8$, we have $x = \pm 8$ and $y = \pm 8$. The solutions to the first pair of equations are given by:

2. $x + y = \pm 10$, $x - y = \pm 10$.

Adding the two equations in (2) gives $2x = \pm 20$, so $x = \pm 10$. Subtracting the two equations in (2) gives $2y = \pm 20$, so $y = \pm 10$. Therefore, the solutions to the first pair of equations are given by the points $(\pm 8, \pm 8)$, $(\pm 10, \pm 10)$.

Similarly, the solutions to the second pair of equations are given by the points $( \pm 8, \pm 8)$, $( \pm 10, \pm 10)$.

Therefore, the solutions to the original equation are the union of the solutions to the first and second pairs of equations, and are given by the points $(\pm 8, \pm 8)$, $(\pm 10, \pm 10)$. These points form a square with side length 16, so the area of the square is $16^2 = 256$.

So, the area of the convex polygon is 256.

The answer is: $256$
