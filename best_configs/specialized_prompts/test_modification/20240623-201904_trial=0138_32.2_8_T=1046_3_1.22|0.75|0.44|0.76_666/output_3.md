Solve the following problem with a Python Script (positive numerical answer):
"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"
Write comments to indicate the steps you take. Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Approach:


The equation $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ is true if either of the two terms in the product is zero. This gives us two sets of equations to solve:
1. $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ and $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$
2. $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ and $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$
For each set of equations, we find the solutions and plot them on a graph. The points that satisfy either of these sets of equations will form a rectangle, and the area of this rectangle will be the area of the convex polygon.

Solution:

1. For the first set of equations, we have:
   $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ implies $\vert x + y \vert = 10$, which gives us $x + y = 10$ or $x + y = -10$.
   $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ implies $\vert x \vert = 8$, which gives us $x = 8$ or $x = -8$.
   Plotting these lines on a graph, we find that the rectangle formed has vertices at $(8, 2), (8, -18), (-8, 2),$ and $(-8, -18)$.

2. For the second set of equations, we have:
   $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ implies $\vert x - y \vert = 10$, which gives us $x - y = 10$ or $x - y = -10$.
   $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ implies $\vert y \vert = 8$, which gives us $y = 8$ or $y = -8$.
   Plotting these lines on a graph, we find that the rectangle formed has vertices at $(2, 8), (-18, 8), (2, -8),$ and $(-18, -8)$.

The combined rectangle has dimensions 18 units by 16 units, so its area is $18 \times 16 = 288$.

The area of the convex polygon formed by the intersection of the two rectangles is thus 288 square units. The answer is: $288$

Solve the following problem with a Python Script (positive numerical answer):
"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"

Assistant:

Approach:

 The given equation is a product of two expressions, so one of them must be zero for the product to be zero. This gives us two separate cases to consider:

Case 1: $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$
Case 2: $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$

For Case 1, both $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2$ and $( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2$ must be zero. This implies that $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. Solving these absolute value equations gives us four lines: $x + y = 10$, $x + y = -10$, $x - y = 10$, and $x - y = -10$. These lines form a square with side length 10 and vertices at $(5,5)$, $(5,-5)$, $(-5,-5)$, and $(-5,5)$.

For Case 2, both $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2$ and $( \vert y \vert - 8)^2$ must be zero. This implies that $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$. Solving these absolute value equations gives us four lines: $x = 8$, $x = -8$, $y = 8$, and $y = -8$. These lines form a square with side length 16 and vertices at $(8,8)$, $(8,-8)$, $(-8,-8)$, and $(-8,8)$.

The area of the convex polygon formed by the intersection of the two squares is simply the area of the smaller square with side length 10. The area of a square is given by the square of the side length, so the area of this square is $10^2 = 100$. Therefore, the area of the convex polygon is 100 square units. The answer is: $100$

Solve the following problem with a Python Script (positive numerical answer):
"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"
Write comments to indicate the steps you take. Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Assistant:

Approach:


The equation $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ is satisfied if either of the factors is zero.

Setting each factor to zero, we have:

1. $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0 \implies \vert x + y \vert = 10 \implies x + y = \pm 10$.
2. $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0 \implies \vert x - y \vert = 10 \implies x - y = \pm 10$.
3. $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0 \implies \vert x \vert = 8 \implies x = \pm 8$.
4. $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0 \implies \vert y \vert = 8 \implies y = \pm 8$.

From 1 and 2, we get the lines $x + y = \pm 10$ and $x - y = \pm 10$.
From 3 and 4, we get the lines $x = \pm 8$ and $y = \pm 8$.

These lines form a rectangle with side lengths 16 and 20. The area of this rectangle is $16 \times 20 = 320$. So, the area of the convex polygon is 320. The answer is: $320$

The equation $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ implies that $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. This is only possible when $x = y = \pm 10$ or $x = -y = \pm 10$. These points form a square with side length 20.
Similarly, the equation $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ implies that $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$. This is only possible when $x = y = \pm 8$ or $x = -y = \pm 8$. These points form a square with side length 16.
The intersection of these two squares is the convex polygon we are interested in. The area of this convex polygon is the area of the smaller square, which is $(16)^2 = 256$.

The answer is: $256$.

Approach:



The equation given is a product of two terms equal to zero. Therefore, either the first term is zero or the second term is zero. 

Let's consider each term separately:

1. For the first term, we have:
\[(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0.\]
This equation implies that both $\vert x + y \vert - 10 = 0$ and $\vert x - y \vert - 10 = 0$, which means $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$.
Solving these absolute value equations gives four lines: $x + y = 10$, $x + y = -10$, $x - y = 10$, and $x - y = -10$.
These lines form a square with side length 10. The area of this square is $10^2 = 100$.

2. For the second term, we have:
\[(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0.\]
This equation implies that both $\vert x \vert - 8 = 0$ and $\vert y \vert - 8 = 0$, which means $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$.
Solving these absolute value equations gives four lines: $x = 8$, $x = -8$, $y = 8$, and $y = -8$.
These lines form a square with side length 16. The area of this square is $16^2 = 256$.

However, the points that satisfy both terms simultaneously are the points that lie on the intersection of the two squares, which is the smaller square with side length 10.

So, the area of the convex polygon formed by the points satisfying the given equation is the area of the smaller square, which is $10^2 = 100$.

The answer is: $100$

Solve the following problem with a Python Script (positive numerical answer):
"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"
Write comments to indicate the steps you take. Please put your final solution into \boxed{}.

Assistant:

Approach:

 The equation is equal to zero if either of the factors is zero. This means that either $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$. Solving these equations will give us the vertices of the polygon. Once we have the vertices, we can calculate the area of the polygon.

Step 1: Solve the equations $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$, $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$, $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$, and $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$.

From $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$, we have $\vert x + y \vert = 10$, which gives us two equations: $x + y = 10$ and $x + y = -10$.

From $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$, we have $\vert x - y \vert = 10$, which gives us two equations: $x - y = 10$ and $x - y = -10$.

From $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$, we have $\vert x \vert = 8$, which gives us two equations: $x = 8$ and $x = -8$.

From $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$, we have $\vert y \vert = 8$, which gives us two equations: $y = 8$ and $y = -8$.

Step 2: Solve the system of equations formed by the combinations of these equations to find the vertices of the polygon.

By solving the system of equations, we find the vertices of the polygon: $(8,8)$, $(8,-8)$, $(-8,8)$, and $(-8,-8)$.

Step 3: Calculate the area of the polygon.

The polygon is a square with side length 16 (the distance between any two adjacent vertices). The area of a square is the square of its side length, so the area of the polygon is $16^2 = 256$.

Therefore, the area of the convex polygon is 256. The answer is: $256$

Approach:

 The equation $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + (\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + (\vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ is satisfied only when at least one of the factors is zero. This implies that either $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + (\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + (\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$. The first factor equals zero when $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. This forms a square with side length 10. The second factor equals zero when $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$, which forms a square with side length 8.

The area of the square formed by the points satisfying $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$ is $10^2 = 100$. The area of the square formed by the points satisfying $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$ is $8^2 = 64$. The area of the convex polygon formed by the union of these two squares is the sum of their areas, which is $100 + 64 = 164$. The answer is: $164$

The equation given in the problem is a product of two terms equal to zero. This means that either the first term is zero or the second term is zero.

Let's consider each term separately:

1. $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ which implies $\vert x + y \vert = 10$, so $x + y = \pm 10$.
2. $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ which implies $\vert x - y \vert = 10$, so $x - y = \pm 10$.
3. $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ which implies $\vert x \vert = 8$, so $x = \pm 8$.
4. $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ which implies $\vert y \vert = 8$, so $y = \pm 8$.

Now, we need to find the intersection points of these lines to plot the points on a graph.

The intersection points are:

$(8, 2)$, $(8, -2)$, $(-8, 2)$, $(-8, -2)$, $(2, 8)$, $(-2, 8)$, $(2, -8)$, $(-2, -8)$.

These points form a square with side length 16. The area of a square is given by side length squared, so the area of the square is $16^2 = 256$. The answer is: $256$

Solve the following problem with a Python Script (positive numerical answer):
"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"

Approach:



The given equation is a product of two expressions, set equal to zero. Therefore, either $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$. 

If the first expression equals zero, then $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. This implies that $x + y = \pm 10$ and $x - y = \pm 10$. Solving these equations gives us the coordinates of the vertices of the polygon: $(0, 10), (0, -10), (10, 0), (-10, 0)$.

If the second expression equals zero, then $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$, which implies that $x = \pm 8$ and $y = \pm 8$. This gives us four more vertices: $(8, 8), (8, -8), (-8, 8), (-8, -8)$.

So, the vertices of the polygon are: $(0, 10), (0, -10), (10, 0), (-10, 0), (8, 8), (8, -8), (-8, 8), (-8, -8)$.

The polygon is a square with side length 10 units. The area of a square is given by the square of the length of its side, so the area of this square is $10^2 = 100$ square units.
The answer is: $100$

Solve the following problem with a Python Script (positive numerical answer):
"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"

Approach:

 The equation $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ is satisfied if either of the two factors is zero. This means that either $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$.

For the first factor to be zero, we must have $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. This gives us four lines: $x + y = 10$, $x + y = -10$, $x - y = 10$, and $x - y = -10$. These lines form a rectangle with side lengths of 20 units in the x and y directions.

For the second factor to be zero, we must have $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$. This gives us four lines: $x = 8$, $x = -8$, $y = 8$, and $y = -8$. These lines form a square with side length of 16 units.

The area of the rectangle is $20 \times 20 = 400$ square units, and the area of the square is $16 \times 16 = 256$ square units. The area of the convex polygon enclosed by the points satisfying the equation is the difference between the area of the rectangle and the area of the square, which is $400 - 256 = 144$ square units.

The equation given in the problem is a product of two terms equal to zero, so either of the terms must be zero. Therefore, we have two cases to consider:

1. $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$
2. $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$

For the first case, we have:

$(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ and $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$

This implies that $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. The only way this can be true is if $x = y = 5$ or $x = -y = -5$. This forms two lines $x = y$ and $x = -y$ on the coordinate plane.

For the second case, we have:

$(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ and $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$

This implies that $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$. The only way this can be true is if $x = 8$ or $x = -8$ and $y = 8$ or $y = -8$. This forms a square with side length 16 on the coordinate plane.

The intersection of these two cases is the square formed by the points $(5, 5), (5, -5), (-5, -5), (-5, 5)$.

The area of this square is side length squared, which is $16^2 = 256$. Therefore, the area of the convex polygon formed by the points satisfying the given equation is 256 square units. The answer is: $256$
