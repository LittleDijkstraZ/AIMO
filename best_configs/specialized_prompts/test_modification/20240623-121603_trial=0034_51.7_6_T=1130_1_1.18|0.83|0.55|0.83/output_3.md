Interesting, let's analyze step by step:


The equation given is: $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$
The product of two numbers is zero if and only if at least one of the numbers is zero. Hence the equation is satisfied if either:
1. $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ or
2. $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$

For the first case, we have:
$(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ and $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$
This implies $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$.
This represents a square with side length 10 units, centered at the origin (0,0) with vertices at $(\pm 5, 0), (0, \pm 5)$.

For the second case, we have:
$(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ and $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$
This implies $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$.
This represents a square with side length 16 units, centered at the origin (0,0) with vertices at $(\pm 8, 0), (0, \pm 8)$.

The intersection of these two squares is a smaller square with side length 10 units, centered at the origin (0,0) with vertices at $(\pm 5, 0), (0, \pm 5)$.

The area of this square is $10^2 = 100$.

So, the area of the convex polygon is 100 square units.
The answer is: $100$

Interesting, let's analyze step by step:



The expression is equal to zero if and only if both $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2$ and $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2$ are equal to zero, or both $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2$ and $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2$ are equal to zero.

This gives us four cases to consider:

1. $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. From this, we get $x + y = \pm 10$ and $x - y = \pm 10$. Solving these equations gives us four points: $(8,2)$, $(8,-2)$, $(-8,2)$, and $(-8,-2)$.

2. $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$. From this, we get $x = \pm 8$ and $y = \pm 8$. Solving these equations gives us four more points: $(8,8)$, $(8,-8)$, $(-8,8)$, and $(-8,-8)$.

The points form a square with side length $16$. The area of this square is $16^2 = 256$. Therefore, the area of the convex polygon is $256$. The answer is: $256$

Interesting, let's analyze step by step:



The equation has the form $AB = 0$. Therefore, either $A = 0$ or $B = 0$.

This breaks down into four cases:

1. $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ and $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ and $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$.
2. $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ and $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ and $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$.
3. $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ and $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ and $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$.
4. $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$, $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ and $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$.

Each case gives a line segment on the coordinate plane. For example, in case 1, we have $x = \pm 8$ and $y = \pm 8$, which are the vertices of a square. The same logic applies to the other cases, resulting in a square with side length 16.

The area of this square is $16^2 = 256$. Hence, the area of the convex polygon is 256 square units. The answer is: $\boxed{256}$.

The equation is $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$. 

The product of two numbers is zero if and only if one of them is zero. Therefore, either $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2) = 0$ or $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$.

If $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2) = 0$, then $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$, which implies that $x = \pm 10$ and $y = \pm 10$. So, we get the four points: $(10, 10), (10, -10), (-10, 10),$ and $(-10, -10)$.

If $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$, then $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$, which implies that $x = \pm 8$ and $y = \pm 8$. So, we get the four points: $(8, 8), (8, -8), (-8, 8),$ and $(-8, -8)$.

The points form a square with side length $20$. Therefore, the area of the square is $20^2 = 400$.

The answer is: $400$

Interesting, let's analyze step by step:



If a product of two terms is zero, then at least one of the terms must be zero. So the given equation is satisfied if either $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$.

From $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ we get $\vert x + y \vert = 10$. This gives us two lines $x + y = 10$ and $x + y = -10$.

From $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ we get $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. This gives us two lines $x - y = 10$ and $x - y = -10$.

From $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ we get $\vert x \vert = 8$. This gives us two lines $x = 8$ and $x = -8$.

From $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ we get $\vert y \vert = 8$. This gives us two lines $y = 8$ and $y = -8$.

The intersection points of these lines are the vertices of the polygon: $(8,8)$, $(8,-8)$, $(-8,8)$, and $(-8,-8)$.

Now, let's find the side lengths:
The distance between $(8,8)$ and $(8,-8)$ is $16$ (by Pythagorean theorem).
The distance between $(8,8)$ and $(-8,8)$ is $16$ (by Pythagorean theorem).
The distance between $(8,-8)$ and $(-8,-8)$ is $16$ (by Pythagorean theorem).
The distance between $(-8,8)$ and $(-8,-8)$ is $16$ (by Pythagorean theorem).

So, the polygon is a square with side length $16$. The area of the square is $16^2 = 256$.

Therefore, the area of the convex polygon is $256$. Since the problem statement asks for a positive numerical answer, we have found the correct answer.

The answer is: $256$

Interesting, let's analyze step by step:


The product of two numbers is zero if and only if at least one of the numbers is zero. So, the equation

$$((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$$

is true if and only if either
$$((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2) = 0$$
or
$$((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0.$$

The first equation is true if and only if both $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. This means $x = \pm 10$ and $y = \pm 10$. The second equation is true if and only if both $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$, which means $x = \pm 8$ and $y = \pm 8$.

So the points that satisfy the equation are the vertices of a square with side length $20$ (from $10$ to $-10$ or from $8$ to $-8$), which means the area of the square is $20^2 = 400$. The square is a convex polygon.

So the area of the convex polygon is $400$. This is a positive integer, as requested.
The answer is: $400$.

Interesting, let's analyze step by step:



1. The given equation is of the form $AB = 0$, which means either $A = 0$ or $B = 0$. Therefore, the points satisfying the given equation will be those satisfying either $A = 0$ or $B = 0$.

2. Now, let's define $A = (|x + y| - 10)^2$ and $B = (|x - y| - 10)^2$. So the points satisfying $A = 0$ or $B = 0$ are those where $|x + y| = 10$ or $|x - y| = 10$. These are the equations of two sets of parallel lines, forming a square with side length 20.

3. Next, let's define $C = (|x| - 8)^2$ and $D = (|y| - 8)^2$. So the points satisfying $C = 0$ or $D = 0$ are those where $|x| = 8$ or $|y| = 8$. These are the equations of two sets of parallel lines, forming a square with side length 16.

4. Combining both conditions, the points satisfying the given equation are those that lie either on the 20x20 square or the 16x16 square. The intersection of these two squares is a 8x8 square.

5. The area of a square with side length $s$ is $s^2$. So the area of the convex polygon is $8^2 = 64$.

The area of the convex polygon is 64.
The answer is: $64$

Interesting, let's analyze step by step:



The equation $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + (\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + (\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ is a product of two equations. For the product to be zero, either one of the equations should be zero. Hence we need to solve four equations:

1. $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$,
2. $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$,
3. $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$,
4. $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$.

Let's solve these four equations:

1. $\vert x + y \vert - 10 = 0 \Rightarrow \vert x + y \vert = 10 \Rightarrow x + y = \pm 10$.
2. $\vert x - y \vert - 10 = 0 \Rightarrow \vert x - y \vert = 10 \Rightarrow x - y = \pm 10$.
3. $\vert x \vert - 8 = 0 \Rightarrow \vert x \vert = 8 \Rightarrow x = \pm 8$.
4. $\vert y \vert - 8 = 0 \Rightarrow \vert y \vert = 8 \Rightarrow y = \pm 8$.

So the solutions are:

- $x = 8, y = 8$
- $x = 8, y = -8$
- $x = -8, y = 8$
- $x = -8, y = -8$
- $x = 10, y = 0$
- $x = 0, y = 10$
- $x = -10, y = 0$
- $x = 0, y = -10$

This gives us the vertices of a square with side length $16$. The area of this square is $16^2 = 256$. So the area of the polygon is $256$. Since the area is a positive integer, we have found the correct answer. Therefore, the area of the convex polygon is $256$.
The answer is: $256$
