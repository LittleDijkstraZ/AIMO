<<<<<<< HEAD
"How many square units are in the area of the triangle whose vertices are the $x$ and $y$ intercepts of the curve $y = (x-3)^2 (x+2)$?"
=======
"Find the number of 10-tuples $(x_1, x_2, \dots, x_{10})$ of real numbers such that
\[(1 - x_1)^2 + (x_1 - x_2)^2 + (x_2 - x_3)^2 + \dots + (x_9 - x_{10})^2 + x_{10}^2 = \frac{1}{11}.\]"

Put your final answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:** 
Let's think step by step:
<<<<<<< HEAD
First, we need to find where this curve intersects the $x$ and $y$ axes.  If $y=0$, then $(x-3)^2(x+2)=0$, which has solutions of $x=3$ and $x=-2$.  If $x=0$, then $y=(-3)^2(2)=18$.  So, the curve has two $x$-intercepts and one $y$-intercept.  The length of the base along the $x$-axis is $3-(-2)=5$.  The height from this base is equal to the $y$-intercept, 18.  The area of the triangle is $\frac{1}{2}\cdot 5\cdot 18=\boxed{45}$. The answer is $\boxed{45}$
=======
By the Cauchy-Schwarz inequality,
\begin{align*}
&[(1^2 + 1^2 + 1^2 + \dots + 1^2 + 1^2)][(1 - x_1)^2 + (x_1 - x_2)^2 + (x_2 - x_3)^2 + \dots + (x_9 - x_{10})^2 + x_{10}^2] \\
&\ge [(1 - x_1) + (x_1 - x_2) + (x_2 - x_3) + \dots + (x_9 - x_{10}) + x_{10}]^2 = 1.
\end{align*}From the given condition, we have equality, so by the equality condition for Cauchy-Schwarz,
\[\frac{1 - x_1}{1} = \frac{x_1 - x_2}{1} = \frac{x_2 - x_3}{1} = \dots = \frac{x_9 - x_{10}}{1} = \frac{x_{10}}{1}.\]Let
\[d = 1 - x_1 = x_1 - x_2 = x_2 - x_3 = \dots = x_9 - x_{10} = x_{10}.\]Then
\[(1 - x_1) + (x_1 - x_2) + \dots + (x_9 - x_{10}) + x_{10} = 11d,\]so $11d = 1.$  Then $d = \frac{1}{11},$ so
\[(x_1, x_2, x_3, \dots, x_{10}) = \left( \frac{10}{11}, \frac{9}{11}, \frac{8}{11}, \dots, \frac{1}{11} \right).\]In particular, there is only $\boxed{1}$ solution. The answer is $\boxed{1}$

The area of the convex polygon is 256 square units. The answer is $\boxed{256}$.
=======

To solve this problem, we first need to understand the given equation and the conditions it imposes on $x$ and $y$. The equation is of the form $A \cdot B = 0$, which means that either $A = 0$ or $B = 0$. We will analyze these two cases separately.

Case 1: $A = (\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$
This case implies that $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. This means that the point $(x, y)$ is at a distance of 10 from the line $x + y = 0$ and at a distance of 10 from the line $x - y = 0$. These lines are perpendicular bisectors of the lines $x = -y$ and $x = y$, respectively. The point $(x, y)$ must lie on one of these lines, so $x = -y$ or $x = y$.

Case 2: $B = (\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$
This case implies that $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$, which means that the point $(x, y)$ is at a distance of 8 from the origin. This means that $(x, y)$ must lie on a circle centered at the origin with radius 8.

Combining these two cases, we find that the point $(x, y)$ must lie on the line $x = -y$ and at a distance of 8 from the origin. This line intersects the circle centered at the origin with radius 8 at the points $(-8, 8)$, $(8, -8)$, $(0, 8)$, and $(0, -8)$. Therefore, the polygon formed by the points $(x, y)$ is a square with side length 16. The area of this square is $16^2 = 256$.

So the area of the convex polygon is 256.
The answer is: $256$

label("$x$", (x/2, -0.1), S);

[/asy]"
Put your final answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:** 
Let's think step by step:
Let $w$ be the width of each of the identical rectangles. Since $PQ=3w$, $RS=2x$ and $PQ=RS$ (because $PQRS$ is a rectangle), then $2x = 3w$, or $$w=\frac{2}{3}x.$$ Therefore, the area of each of the five identical rectangles is $$x\left(\frac{2}{3}x\right)=\frac{2}{3}x^2.$$ Since the area of $PQRS$ is 4000 and it is made up of five of these identical smaller rectangles, then $$5\left(\frac{2}{3}x^2\right)=4000$$ or $$\frac{10}{3}x^2 = 4000$$ or $x^2 = 1200$ or $x \approx 34.6$ which, when rounded off to the nearest integer, is $\boxed{35}.$ The answer is $\boxed{35}$

Analyze the problem and think step by step to come to a solution with programs. After solving the problem, output the final numerical answer within $\boxed{}$.

**Solution:**


The equation $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ is satisfied if and only if either $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$.

This means that either $\vert x + y \vert = 10$, $\vert x - y \vert = 10$, $\vert x \vert = 8$, or $\vert y \vert = 8$.

The lines $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$ form a cross, and the lines $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$ form a square.

The intersection of these lines and shapes form a convex polygon, which is a square with side length 16. The area of this square is $16^2 = 256$.

Therefore, the area of the convex polygon is 256. The answer is: $256$

\[(1 - x_1) + (x_1 - x_2) + \dots + (x_9 - x_{10}) + x_{10} = 11d,\]so $11d = 1.$  Then $d = \frac{1}{11},$ so
\[(x_1, x_2, x_3, \dots, x_{10}) = \left( \frac{10}{11}, \frac{9}{11}, \frac{8}{11}, \dots, \frac{1}{11} \right).\]In particular, there is only $\boxed{1}$ solution. The answer is $\boxed{1}$

The given equation is a product of two terms, which makes it equal to zero if and only if one of the terms is zero. This gives us four separate cases to consider:

1. $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ and $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$.
2. $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ and $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$.
3. $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ and $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$.
4. $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ and $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$.

For each case, we can solve the equations involving absolute values by considering the different possibilities for the signs of the expressions inside the absolute values. For example, for case 1, we have:

1a. $x + y = 10$ and $x = 8$.
1b. $x + y = 10$ and $y = 8$.
1c. $x + y = -10$ and $x = 8$.
1d. $x + y = -10$ and $y = 8$.

Solving these equations gives us the vertices of the polygon. Then we can calculate the area of the polygon using standard methods.

The area of the polygon is 128 square units. The answer is: $128$

This problem is too complex to be solved directly using Python. However, we can observe that the equation given in the problem is equivalent to the intersection of four equations:
1. $|x + y| - 10 = 0$,
2. $|x - y| - 10 = 0$,
3. $|x| - 8 = 0$,
4. $|y| - 8 = 0$.

Solving these equations, we find that the points that satisfy the equation are the vertices of a square with side length 16. The area of this square is $16^2 = 256$.
