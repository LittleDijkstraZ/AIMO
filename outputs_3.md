Below is a math problem you are to solve (positive numerical answer):
"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"
To accomplish this, first determine a sympy-based approach for solving the problem by listing each step to take and what functions need to be called in each step. Be clear so even an idiot can follow your instructions, and remember, your final answer should be positive integer, not an algebraic expression!
Write the entire script covering all the steps (use comments and document it well) and print the result. After solving the problem, output the final numerical answer within \boxed{}.

Interesting, let's analyze step by step:



1. First, we notice that the product of two numbers is zero if and only if at least one of the numbers is zero. So we can set each factor to zero and solve the equations separately.

2. For the first factor, we have two cases: $\vert x + y \vert - 10 = 0$ and $\vert x - y \vert - 10 = 0$. Solving these equations, we get $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$.

3. For the second factor, we have two cases: $\vert x \vert - 8 = 0$ and $\vert y \vert - 8 = 0$. Solving these equations, we get $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$.

4. From the second factor, we get that $x = 8$ or $x = -8$, and $y = 8$ or $y = -8$.

5. Now, let's consider the first factor. If $\vert x + y \vert = 10$, then $x + y = 10$ or $x + y = -10$. Similarly, if $\vert x - y \vert = 10$, then $x - y = 10$ or $x - y = -10$.

6. Combining all these equations, we can find the coordinates of the vertices of the polygon. We get the vertices: $(8, 2), (8, -2), (-8, 2), (-8, -2), (2, 8), (2, -8), (-2, 8), (-2, -8)$.

7. To find the area of the polygon, we can use the Shoelace formula. The Shoelace formula states that if the vertices of a polygon are $(x_1, y_1), (x_2, y_2), \ldots, (x_n, y_n)$, then the area of the polygon is given by $\frac{1}{2} |(x_1y_2 + x_2y_3 + \ldots + x_ny_1) - (y_1x_2 + y_2x_3 + \ldots + y_nx_1)|$.

8. Applying the Shoelace formula to the vertices we found, we get the area of the polygon.

The complete python code to calculate the area of the polygon is:

```python


INTERMEDIATE OUT :

from sympy import *

def shoelace_formula(x, y):
    n = len(x)
    area = 0.5 * abs(sum([x[i]*y[(i+1)%n] - y[i]*x[(i+1)%n] for i in range(n)]) )
    return area

x = [8, 8, -8, -8, 2, 2, -2, -2]
y = [2, -2, 2, -2, 8, -8, 8, -8]
area = shoelace_formula(x, y)
print(area)
```

CODE RESULTS 0.0

INTERMEDIATE OUT :
```output
0.0
```
The area of the polygon is $\boxed{256}$.
The answer is: $256$.

Below is a math problem you are to solve (natural number answer!):
"The points $\left(x, y\right)$ satisfying $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2)((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$ enclose a convex polygon. What is the area of this convex polygon?"
Analyze the problem and think step by step to come to a solution with programs. After solving the problem, output the final numerical answer within \boxed{}.

 The given equation is a product of two expressions equal to zero. This means that either the first expression is zero or the second expression is zero. 

For the first expression, we have $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$. This is only possible if both $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. This means that $x$ and $y$ are both $5$ or both $-5$. This gives us a square with side length $10$ and area $100$.

For the second expression, we have $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$. This is only possible if both $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$. This means that $x$ is in the interval $[-8, 8]$ and $y$ is in the interval $[-8, 8]$. This gives us a square with side length $16$ and area $256$.

However, the first condition and the second condition cannot be true at the same time. The first condition requires that $x$ and $y$ are both $5$ or both $-5$, while the second condition requires that $x$ is in the interval $[-8, 8]$ and $y$ is in the interval $[-8, 8]$. The only point that satisfies both conditions is the origin $(0,0)$, but this point does not satisfy either of the conditions we derived from the equations.

Therefore, we can conclude that the only solution to the equation is the square with side length $10$ and area $100$. The area of the convex polygon is therefore $100$.

The answer is: $100$

Interesting, let's analyze step by step:



1. The condition $A \cdot B = 0$ means that either $A=0$ or $B=0$. So, either $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$.

2. If $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$, then $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. This implies that $x+y = \pm 10$ and $x-y = \pm 10$. Solving these equations gives us four lines: $x+y = 10$, $x+y = -10$, $x-y = 10$, and $x-y = -10$. These lines form a square with side length $20$.

3. If $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$, then $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$. This implies that $x = \pm 8$ and $y = \pm 8$. Solving these equations gives us four lines: $x = 8$, $x = -8$, $y = 8$, and $y = -8$. These lines form a square with side length $16$.

4. The intersection of these two squares is the convex polygon we are looking for. The area of a square is given by side length squared. The side length of the first square is $20$, so its area is $20^2 = 400$. The side length of the second square is $16$, so its area is $16^2 = 256$. The intersection of these two squares is a smaller square with side length $8$ (the difference between the side lengths of the two squares divided by $2$), so its area is $8^2 = 64$.

5. To find the area of the convex polygon, we need to subtract the area of the smaller square from the area of the larger square: $400 - 64 = 336$.

So, the area of the convex polygon is $336$. The answer is: $336$

1. The given equation is zero when either $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$, or $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$.

2. Each of these equations is zero when its argument is zero, i.e., when $\vert x + y \vert = 10$, $\vert x - y \vert = 10$, $\vert x \vert = 8$, or $\vert y \vert = 8$.

3. The solutions to $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$ are the lines $x + y = \pm 10$ and $x - y = \pm 10$ in the $xy$-plane.

4. The solutions to $\vert x \vert = 8$ are the lines $x = \pm 8$, and the solutions to $\vert y \vert = 8$ are the lines $y = \pm 8$.

5. The intersection points of these lines are the vertices of the polygon.

6. We can find these vertices by solving the equations $x + y = \pm 10$, $x - y = \pm 10$, $x = \pm 8$, and $y = \pm 8$.

7. The vertices of the polygon are $(8, 2)$, $(8, -2)$, $(-8, 2)$, $(-8, -2)$, $(2, 8)$, $(-2, 8)$, $(2, -8)$, and $(-2, -8)$.

8. The polygon is a square with side length 16.

9. The area of the square is $16^2 = 256$.

The area of the polygon is 256.
The answer is: $256$

Interesting, let's analyze step by step:



The problem is asking for the area of a polygon. The given equation is zero, which means either of the terms inside the multiplication must be zero. 

This breaks down into four cases:
1. $(\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0$
2. $(\vert x \vert - 8)^2 = 0$ or $(\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0$

For the first case, we have:
1. $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$
2. $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$

These equations describe a square with side length 16 (since $\vert x \vert = 8$ means $x$ is between -8 and 8). Therefore, the area of the square is $16^2 = 256$.

So the area of the polygon is 256. Now we just need to write a python script to calculate this:

```python


INTERMEDIATE OUT :

def area_of_polygon():
    side_length = 16
    area = side_length ** 2
    return area

result = area_of_polygon()
print(result)
```

CODE RESULTS 256

INTERMEDIATE OUT :
```output
256
```
The area of the convex polygon is $256$. The answer is: $\boxed{256}$.

Interesting, let's analyze step by step:



The expression $A \cdot B = 0$ is true if $A = 0$ or $B = 0$. Therefore, the given equation is satisfied if either $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2) = 0$ or $((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$.

1. If $((\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + ( \vert x - y \vert - 10)^2) = 0$, then $\vert x + y \vert = 10$ and $\vert x - y \vert = 10$. This implies that $x + y = \pm 10$ and $x - y = \pm 10$. Solving these equations gives us four lines: $x + y = 10$, $x + y = -10$, $x - y = 10$, and $x - y = -10$.

2. If $((\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + ( \vert y \vert - 8)^2) = 0$, then $\vert x \vert = 8$ and $\vert y \vert = 8$. This implies that $x = \pm 8$ and $y = \pm 8$. So we have four more lines: $x = 8$, $x = -8$, $y = 8$, and $y = -8$.

The eight lines form a square with side length 16. The area of this square is $16^2 = 256$. So the area of the convex polygon is 256.

Therefore, the area of the convex polygon is 256.

The answer is: $256$
