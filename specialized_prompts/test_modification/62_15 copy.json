        "\nBelow is a math problem you are to solve (positive numerical answer):\n\"Each of the three-digits numbers $111$ to $999$ is coloured blue or yellow in such a way that the sum of any two (not necessarily different) yellow numbers is equal to a blue number. What is the maximum possible number of yellow numbers there can be?\"\nTo accomplish this, first determine a sympy-based approach for solving the problem by listing each step to take and what functions need to be called in each step. Be clear so even an idiot can follow your instructions, and remember, your final answer should be positive integer, not an algebraic expression!\nWrite the entire script covering all the steps (use comments and document it well) and print the result. After solving the problem, output the final numerical answer within \\boxed{}.\n\nAssistant: \n\nInteresting, let's analyze step by step:\n\n1. The maximum possible number of yellow numbers is when each blue number can be written as the sum of two yellow numbers in exactly one way.\n2. The smallest blue number is $111+111=222$, and the largest is $999$.\n3. The numbers from $111$ to $499$ are blue because they can be written as the sum of two copies of the same number.\n4. The numbers from $500$ to $749$ are yellow because they can be written as the sum of two different numbers from $250$ to $499$.\n5. The numbers from $750$ to $999$ are blue because they can be written as the sum of $250$ and one of the numbers from $500$ to $749$.\n6. Therefore, the maximum number of yellow numbers is the number of numbers from $250$ to $499$, which is $250$.\n\nSo, the maximum possible number of yellow numbers there can be is $250$. The answer is: $250$\n\n---\n\nUser:\n\nBelow is a math problem you are to solve (positive numerical answer):\n\"{}\"\nTo accomplish this, first determine a sympy-based approach for solving the problem by listing each step to take and what functions need to be called in each step.
